The two British women accused of trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of Peru will receive a dramatically shorter sentence than they could have after pleading guilty yesterday.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly admitted trying to board a flight from Lima to Spain on August 6 knowing they had 24lb of the class-A drug in their suitcases.

The maximum sentence they can receive is six years and eight months - but if they had pleaded not guilty and been convicted, they could have faced as much as 15 years in a Peruvian prison.

The women will be eligible for parole within three years, allowing them to return home, while it has also been suggested that they could be transferred to Britain to serve part of their sentences.

Accused: Melissa Reid, right, and Michaella McCollum were yesterday escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison ahead of their court appearance

Police escort: The pair were handcuffed as they were taken from Virgen de Fatima Prison on the outskirts of the capital, to a court in the city centre wearing their own clothes

Behind bars: After the pair arrived at the court, they were detained in a holding cell, surrounded by guards, as they awaited their appearance in front of a judge

The women, both aged 20, continue to claim that a gun-toting Colombian mafia forced them to act as drug mules.

But, after police rubbished their ‘illogical’ story, they decided to plead guilty in the hope of securing shorter sentences, which will be decided next week.

It also means they will not have to stand trial on drugs trafficking charges.

Miss Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, has previously said, 'I don't want to be in jail until I'm 35,' adding: 'Pleading guilty is going to get me back to my family sooner rather than later.'

Miss McCollum Connolly, from Dungannon, Northern Ireland, and Miss Reid both admitted drugs trafficking at a hearing closed to the Press.

It took place at a men’s jail in Lima called Sarita Colonia. They were driven the short distance from the notorious prison Virgen de Fatima, where they are being held, to enter their pleas separately.

The two women arrived at the court handcuffed and in their own clothes, Miss Reid carrying a plastic bag and Miss McCollum a bottle of water as they were surrounded by guards.

They were led into a holding cell in the court room, awaiting their second appearance in front of a judge since they were arrested.

Both Miss Reid and Miss McCollum stood up and spoke separately for half an hour after being asked their names.

Miss Reid told the court: 'I feel very bad for the pain I have caused my family. I assume complete responsibility.'

The pair also explained to the judge exactly how they carried out the smuggling plot, which they claim was planned under coercion.

After the hearing they were taken back to the prison that has been their home since August 22.

A
 spokesman for the fourth criminal court of Callao, in charge of the 
judicial investigation into the two women, confirmed: 'Both women have 
pleaded guilty to drugs trafficking.

'It
 means they automatically benefit from a sixth of the minimum jail 
sentence of eight years and will be sentenced to six years and eight 
months in prison.

'Sentencing will take place on October 1 at a new hearing.'

The lawyer for Miss McCollum and Miss Reid refused to comment to reporters on the content of of the hearing.

It has been reported the pair could serve their sentence in this country if Britain agrees to a transfer.

Melissa’s
 parents, energy company manager Billy, 54, and National Grid 
administrator Debra, 53, insisted last week they still believed their 
daughter was forced into carrying cocaine through Lima’s Jorge Chavez 
airport.

Mrs Reid said: ‘She was definitely carrying the drugs in her luggage. That’s for sure.

‘But we still believe she was coerced into it. Obviously now we realise she needs to plead guilty just to get her home.’

Miss Reid, speaking from the prison 
earlier this month, said: ‘Pleading guilty is going to get me back to my
 family sooner rather than later.’

But
 a legal source close to the case  said a transfer could take many 
years, by which time they could be free, adding: ‘It is a very long 
process and Britain does not often agree to it.’

Miss
 Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for 
her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We 
could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.'

Miss Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly will need to show they behaved well in jail, pass 'legal, social, medical and psychological tests' and can fund their own tickets back.

They are currently being held in a classification unit of a women's prison which, charities have warned, has dire conditions.

However, Miss Reid has compared it to a ‘Brownie camp’, and claimed to have spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions.

First court appearance: Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid were told they would be imprisoned as they awaited trial when they were in front of a judge in August

Media frenzy: An enormous group of cameras and reporters were there to meet the pair as they arrived for their first court appearance earlier this summer

The women claimed they were kidnapped 
in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters
 who threatened them and their families.

In August the pair wore each other's 
clothes as they appeared in court for the first time in Lima. A judge 
told them they would be imprisoned as they awaited trial.

The pair looked glum and drawn as they 
were led away in handcuffs through the back of the court to a holding 
cell. At one point, Miss Connolly wiped a tear away from her eye.

They were sent to prison because 
they admitted they knew there was cocaine in their suitcases and could 
flee Peru if they were bailed.

The women insisted they 
had no idea they were carrying drugs after police stopped them as they 
tried to board an Air Europa flight to Madrid and discovered more than 
five kilos of cocaine disguised as food products in each of their 
suitcases.

There have been continued concerns over the state of their mental health, with their lawyer claiming last month that they were being held in a 'windowless cage'.

During both court appearances, the pair have looked terrified.

Peru’s penal authority says 1,648 
foreigners are currently in its prisons on drug trafficking charges, 31 
of them British citizens.

Miss
McCollum Connolly has dyed her black locks brown and had a striking bun
for a court appearance last month.

The women are reported to be among the wealthier 
inmates who can buy treats such as sweets, crisps and chocolate from a  
food kiosk.

Fellow prisoners said the Britons were being treated ‘very well’ by inmates and staff because they were foreigners.

Paola
Andrade, 56, in jail for attempted murder, added: ‘The girls look so 
young and innocent. I feel really bad for them because they seem so 
young.

‘I can only imagine how horrible it must be to be incarcerated so far away from home and your family.’
