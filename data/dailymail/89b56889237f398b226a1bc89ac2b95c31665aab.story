David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury backed the plan claiming HMRC needed the threat of criminal prosecution to stop  tax evasion 

People who fail to declare money held in offshore accounts could face prison under controversial plans to add to the taxman’s growing armoury of powers.

HM Revenue & Customs has already faced anger over its request to be able to raid bank accounts for unpaid taxes without obtaining a court order first.

Yesterday it launched a fresh power grab, setting out plans for a new criminal offence of failing to declare income from money held in offshore accounts.

Anyone found to have withheld details of their funds could face ‘unlimited’ financial penalties, or up to six months in prison in the most serious cases.

HMRC’s demand for greater muscle comes amid a broader crackdown on tax evasion, as Chancellor George Osborne looks to balance the country’s books.

Some £1.5billion has already been recovered from offshore tax evaders over the past two years, HMRC said. But the proposals would further beef up HMRC’s power by absolving it of the obligation to prove that someone has deliberately tried to avoid paying their share.

Instead, the onus would be on taxpayers to ensure that they are declaring funds stashed in foreign accounts.

Ignorance of the law or of one’s own financial affairs would no longer be deemed an acceptable excuse.

HMRC said that under its proposals, offshore evasion would become a ‘strict liability’ offence meaning a court no longer has to consider the state of mind of a defendant before convicting.

This category of offence is usually reserved for crimes that pose a direct risk to the public, such as speeding or selling contaminated food.

‘It’s hard to see how non-declaration of tax fits into this category,’ said Gary Ashford, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, who described the plan as hugely controversial.

He added: ‘The Government must recognise that while some taxpayers actively seek to hide their income by failing to declare their accounts to HMRC, there will be individuals who make mistakes in their financial affairs without intending to act wrongly. Not everyone who under-declares their tax is acting with criminal intent.’

HMRC insisted that criminal prosecution would hit only those who are evading ‘significant’ amounts of tax, although it has yet to determine the threshold.

But critics warned that frail and vulnerable people could find themselves at risk of prosecution through no fault of their own.

Stephen Camm, tax partner at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said HMRC’s past record of major blunders meant it was not suited to wielding such extensive powers.

HMRC said its proposals would be directed only at ‘highly sophisticated’ schemes operated by ‘stone cold tax cheats’.

And David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury, said HMRC needed the threat of criminal prosecution to stop the ‘blight’ of tax evasion.

Some richer taxpayers in Britain have turned to offshore bank accounts in an attempt to shelter their income from the taxman. They have stashed money outside their country of residence because they mistakenly thought it could not be touched by UK authorities.

Not all offshore accounts are used for tax avoidance, however, and the practice is not in itself illegal. Many people set up offshore accounts to look after income from an overseas property.

The problems arise when this cash, property or other asset is not declared to HMRC where it is liable for tax.
