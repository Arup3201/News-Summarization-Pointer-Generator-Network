Climbing, falling and tugging on his weary mum, this little orangutan is up to all kinds of trouble.Â 

The youngster was photographed by Indian photographer Manoj Kumar Tuteja, 27, after he spotted it messing around with his mum while on a trip to Singapore Zoo.

'It's the unusual behaviour of the baby orangutan which is most attractive in these photos,' said Manoj, now of Singapore.

'He was just playing about in the open, holding onto his mother and using her as a climbing frame while he messed around.

'I think you can see the love between the mother and her baby, which is amazing to witness.'

Spending an hour photographing the little orangutan, Manoj watched from just 50 metres away as the ape's mother let him get up to mischief around her.

Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for the first two years of their lives, and will often spend a lot of time clinging to them.

At the age of four, they begin to socialise with other orangutans but still keep in close contact with their mother.

Manoj said: 'I feel like I was lucky to be in the right place at the right time, to watch this little baby playing.

'I've still got a long way to go in terms of learning about photography, but my love of nature and wildlife is what has ultimately led me to taking pictures, as it gives me the option to be closer to them.

'I don't want our children to tell their children that once upon a time there used to be tigers and orangutans in the world.

'We need to protect and save the wild.'
