On trial: PR guru Max Clifford  arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he faces charges of indecent assault

Celebrity publicist Max Clifford said today 'all I want is the truth to come out' as he arrived at court for the start of his sexual abuse trial.

The PR guru is accused of molesting a string of teenage girls over two decades, with one alleged victim aged 14 at the time.

Clifford, 70, is said to have preyed on a total of seven victims, beginning with a teenage girl in 1966.

A further six women claim they were targeted between 1975 and 1984.

Clifford - whose famous clients include Simon Cowell, Kerry Katona and the late Jade Goody - denies 11 counts of indecent assault.

Four charges relate to one victim who was allegedly groped between July 1, 1977 and August 31, 1978.

The jury will be selected today before prosecution is due to open its case at Southwark Crown Court, with the trial expected to last up to six weeks.

Arriving at the court in a black taxi, accompanied by his lawyer, Clifford patiently posed for the mass of photographers and TV crews.

Asked how he was feeling Clifford replied: 'I'm okay. It's (the trial) got to be done.

'It's been 15 months under a very dark cloud for myself and my family and loved ones.

'All I want is for the truth to come out.'

Wearing grey trousers, navy blazer, white shirt and blue patterned tie, bespectacled Clifford said his family would be attending the court to support him.

Clifford, who vehemently denies the charges, is the second suspect to be tried under Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree probe, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal in October 2012.

The twice-married father-of-one has told how he blames Jimmy Savile for his predicament.

He set up his own PR firm, Max Clifford Associates, in 1970, representing the likes of Frank Sinatra, Muhammad Ali and Marlon Brando.Â

More recent clients have included TV chef Jean Christophe-Novelli and Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy.

Clifford is banned from contacting his alleged victims or having any unsupervised contact with anyone aged under 18 as part of his bail conditions. He also must sleep each night at his home address.

Clifford, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, denies seven charges of indecently assaulting a woman and four charges of indecently assaulting a girl aged under 16.
