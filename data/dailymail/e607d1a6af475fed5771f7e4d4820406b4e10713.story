Fox 8 Cleveland reports that the boy's mother, who has not been identified, sat in the street cradling the child until medics arrived.

Police say Alexander had been involved in a verbal and physical fight with the boy's mother before storming out of the house at 2522(B) Division Street into a shared garden.

As he left he turned back and fired one shot into the property, hitting his son who had woken up and was standing on the upstairs landing.

According to witnesses, Alexander threw the gun in a trash can, then drove through a metal fence before arriving at the boy's grandmother's house.

She told reporters that Alexander was trying to kill himself when he arrived, said he did not mean to hurt the boy, and was 'devastated' over the death.

She added that Alexander was eventually turned over to the authorities by relatives.
