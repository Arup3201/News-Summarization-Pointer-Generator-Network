Precious: Allison Noyce with husband Richard and their daughter Sophie, now 16 months old

After going through the menopause aged 20, Allison Noyce was told she could never have children naturally.

So when she went to the doctor with stomach pains 15 years later, she was astonished to learn that she was pregnant – and the baby was due within days.

The 36-year-old was afraid she had cancer when she felt pain and found a lump in her stomach.

Instead, medics told her she was eight months pregnant, and just 12 days later she gave birth to daughter Sophie, who weighed 6lb 4oz.

Mrs Noyce said: ‘Sophie is truly a miracle. We simply couldn’t believe it when doctors said I was not only pregnant – but so close to delivery.’

The fitness instructor became alarmed when she felt unusually tired after one 40-mile bike ride.

She said: ‘Around the same time I noticed pains in my tummy, and over the past few weeks, I had thought I could feel a lump. Terrified, I booked an appointment with my GP.’ Her doctor believed the lump was ‘probably a large cyst’ and quickly sent Mrs Noyce to hospital for tests.

She was sure pregnancy was not a possibility because at the age of 30, after marrying her husband Richard, she had gone back to the doctor’s to double check that she would never conceive naturally. 

She recalled: ‘Richard and I were worried it was something serious. So we were overcome with emotion when the woman doing an ultrasound said I was eight months pregnant. Relief that it wasn’t cancer and sheer joy that we were having a baby.

‘We were also in shock – when a midwife arrived to discuss birthing arrangements I thought I was dreaming.

‘In hindsight I’d had other signs, but put morning sickness down to a virus and tiredness down to being busy.’

Mrs Noyce was told she would never have children naturally after going through menopause in her twenties.

Most women experience the menopause – a natural change in the body’s sex hormones – between 45 and 55.

In rare cases, some women experience menopause before they reach 40, often for no known cause. This premature ovarian failure affects about one in 100 women before 40, and five in 100 by 45.

Mrs Noyce said: ‘I only had scanty periods in my teens and they stopped completely when I was 20. But it was still terrible to be told so young that I’d never have a family.

The average age at which women go through the menopause in Britain is 51.

Menopause occurs when a woman’s ovaries run out of eggs, meaning she can no longer have children.

One in 20 women goes through an early menopause, before the age of 45, because her ovaries stop working properly, a British study found last year.

The process can be gradual, with a woman producing eggs and having periods intermittently. During this perimenopause stage, which can last years, a woman may still conceive, although experts usually describe the chance as negligible.

There may be no medical reason for early menopause, or it may be caused by hysterectomy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

The Daisy Network is a support group for women going through early menopause.

‘We’d already given up all thoughts of having a baby, we’d never used contraception and in fact since I’ve been with Richard I’ve never had a period. But it was still terribly sad when tests confirmed I’d definitely gone through the menopause and that I’d never be a mum or make Richard a dad. He gave me a hug and said perhaps being parents wasn’t for us.’

Instead, Richard, 41, wrote a ‘bucket list’ of things they could look forward to as a childless couple.

Over a decade the pair, from Southampton, travelled the world and pursued hobbies such as long-distance bike riding and hill walking.

But they were delighted to learn the doctors had been wrong, and couldn’t wait to tell their stunned friends and family the news.

Mrs Noyce said: ‘Richard and I rushed round in a haze of excitement buying baby clothes. One friend donated a pushchair, another gave me a book about pregnancy – I skipped to the last month.

‘It was strange telling people our baby was due in the next four weeks.’

After 12 days, in July 2013, she woke with contractions – and five-and-a-half hours later Sophie was born.

Mrs Noyce said: ‘She was perfect, beautiful. After my 12-day pregnancy I could hardly take it in – I was a mum.’

'Perfect': Sophie, above on her birthday, is now 16 months old and the Noyces still can’t believe she’s here

Mystery: Mrs Noyce said that doctors have no idea why she conceived so many years after the menopause

Sophie is now 16 months old and the Noyces still can’t believe she’s here.

Mrs Noyce explained: ‘Doctors have no idea why so many years after going through the menopause I suddenly conceived. Since her birth I still haven’t had a period, so while we’d love another baby, it might be she is our only child.

‘We are just enjoying our precious daughter – she is the miracle baby we never thought we’d have. We look at her and feel incredibly lucky.’
