Record numbers of parents are ending up with criminal records for letting their children skip lessons, new figures show.

Truancy convictions have topped 10,000 for the first time amid a growing crackdown on youngsters missing class.

The Ministry of Justice figures come as the Coalition has increasingly turned the spotlight on truancy and the problem families who continue to condone it.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2012, 12,909 parents in England and Wales were taken to court for failing to ensure their children go to school.

Of these, 10,185 were found guilty and sentenced - a 3.5 per cent rise on 2011’s figures of 9,836.

Two-thirds - 6,871 were fined; 516 undertook community service and 20 were jailed.

The number of convictions has risen more than fivefold from 2001 when only 2,243 were prosecuted and 1,845 found guilty and sentenced.

Between 2001 and 2012, 71,552 parents have been convicted and 173 jailed. The MoJ will release figures for 2013 next May.

Among the parents recently sanctioned is mother-of-six Kelly Murphy, 35, from Cardiff, who was jailed after her two teenage daughters attended fewer than a third of their school days.

She was sent to prison for 16 weeks in June after pleading guilty to two offences of failing to secure the attendance of the girls aged 16 and 14.

Cardiff magistrates’ court heard that the girls had made just 59 and 56 attendances respectively out of 182.

Leah Griffiths, defending, told the court that Ms Murphy had withdrawn pocket money, mobile phones, laptops and even refused to buy Christmas presents in a bid to make them go to lessons.

Magistrates gained new powers to deal with the parents of truanting children in 2000, when the maximum fine they could impose was more than doubled from £1,000 to £2,500.

Since September 2012, head teachers have been able to impose a £60 spot fine on parents, rising to £120 if it goes unpaid. This compares to just £50 under the previous government.

The time limit for paying has also slashed cut from 28 to 21 days for a £60 fine and 42 to 28 days for a £120 charge.

Excuses: The results also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences (file picture)

Meanwhile legislation came into force in England this September which scrapped a system that allowed head teachers to grant ‘authorised absences’ to pupils to go on holiday during term time. Now they can only approve days off under ‘exceptional circumstances’.

A recent survey found that a quarter of head teachers have fined parents for flouting the new rules.

The survey of more than 800 primary school head teachers and deputies in England - conducted by The Key consultancy service - also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences.

Latest figures show that ‘unauthorised absences’ between September 2012 and March this year increased from 0.9 per cent to one per cent.

This meant that around 63,000 youngsters were missing lessons without permission on a typical day.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘It’s clear from the figures there’s been a crackdown.

‘It would be good to have evidence of how successful this approach is. I suspect that many of the families are dysfunctional and a criminal conviction isn’t necessarily going to be that effective in giving the young person the start in life that we would want.

‘Clearly, to get as much out of life as you can, you need the best possible education. It’s important you should be in schools. But I wonder if it would be more effective making sure that within schools there’s provision that enhances the lives of those who are deciding to truant.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent.

‘That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay.’
