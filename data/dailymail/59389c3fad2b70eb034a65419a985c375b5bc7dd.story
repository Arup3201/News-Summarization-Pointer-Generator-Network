The heartbroken family of a 19-year-old dancer who died of a sudden blood clot to the brain are mourning the one year anniversary of the girl's death.

Morgan Judd performed with her dance troupe at a basketball game on Saturday December 3, 2011, and called her younger brother Patrick around midnight to wish him a happy birthday. The next morning her roommate couldn't wake her up and she died two days later.

Yesterday, the Cincinatti, Ohio, teen's 
twin brother, Michael, posted a photograph of himself and Morgan in her 
memory on Facebook and the image prompted an outpouring of support from 
family and friends.

The twins' aunt Diana Doyle Schmitt wrote: 'What a great pic of the two of you. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with you today. You were an amazing brother to Morgan I love you Michael. Aunt Diane.'

Cassandra Nassif added: 'Thinking about you and your whole family,' while JJ Rohde said: 'I miss u guys.'

In her final days, the teenager, a business major at The Wake Forest University, lived her passions.

She was a celebrated dancer at 
Ursuline Academy, in Blue Ash, where she graduated in May 2011 and 
continued to perform and compete right up until the night before her 
tragic blood clot.

'Her last waking moment was a happy moment,' Leigh Judd, Morgan's mother told Cincinnati.com.

Mrs Judd added that her 'young and healthy' daughter was able to save eight people's lives through the donation of her organs.

According to friends and teachers, Morgan was a gifted dancer, a clever student and a good friend to many.

She was especially welcoming to new 
classmates at The Studio for Dance in Blue Ash, where she practiced 
ballet and tap among a variety of other dances since the seventh grade.

She toured Ohio competing and performing with her different dance troupes.

'She was a magnificent dancer and ... brought such joy to every performance,' The Studio owner Shari Poff, told the news website.

'If a new kid came to the studio, she was the first to befriend that girl and make her feel comfortable.'

Devastated, he father, Jerry Judd, spoke tenderly of his little girl.

'She was a best friend to many,' Mr Judd said. 'If you had a bad day, she always had a smile that would lift you up.'
