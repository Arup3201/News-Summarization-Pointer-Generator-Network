Couple: Former soldier Kyle Stobbart, 27, from Pelton, County Durham, (pictured with his wife Abby) who was found hanged just months after leaving the Army

A war veteran was found hanged just months after leaving the Army, prompting the soldier's family to claim he did not receive support from the armed forces as he struggled to adjust to civilian life.

Kyle Stobbart, 27, spent ten years in the military, rising to become a sergeant with the Scots Guards, and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But after struggling to adjust outside the military, the father went missing and was later found hanged from a tree.

After disappearing from the family home in Pelton, Durham, his wife Abby found an emotional goodbye note detailing how hard he found the readjustment.

Mr Stobbart, who was a father to three-year-old Kaidence, also wrote about feeling scared and how he had broken down in tears as he wrote his last words.

When Mrs Stobbart, 33, raised the alarm that her husband had gone missing on February 22, his car was discovered in Waldridge Fell the following day - also her birthday.

Mrs Stobbart initially thought that her husband had left the house to buy her a birthday present in Durham but later noticed that his bank card was in the house.

She said: 'I knew straight away that if Kyle wasn't asleep and he wasn't texting me something was wrong, because he didn't go half an hour without texting me.

After ringing her husband's father, the local hospital and police, Mrs Stobbart moved the covers from her bed and found the note.

She said: 'I knew then that he had gone and he wasn't coming back.'

Mrs Stobbart, who married Kyle in April last year, said he may have bottled up some of his experiences from his time serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, having finished his service in November.

She said: 'I don't know what he had seen out there, but I know he loved the army and the camaraderie with the lads.

'He didn't talk about his work at home. It was work to him and he didn't want to bring it back with him.'

Joker: Mrs Stobbart described her husband as a 'joker' with a 'big personality'

Mr Stobbart had taken a job as a maintenance technician at Nissan on his return, having joined the Army at 17 after leaving school.

He worked night shifts at the manufacturer's Sunderland plant and admitted being frustrated, but his wife said he showed no signs of being emotionally distressed.

She said: 'We just don't know where this has come from. He said his body clock was changing but he wasn't different with me. Nothing changed towards me and the kids.

'He did go to Durham that morning but I don't know if something has just snapped in his head.

She described her husband as a 'joker' with a 'big personality' who loved to wind people up. She added: 'He never took anything seriously and he could cheer up any situation.'

The soldier's aunt Margaret Meek believes the army should have offered more help to Mr Stobbart as he started his new life outside the forces.

She said: 'They put him on a couple of courses and that was it. We spent a lot of time together over the last three years and I'm proud that he let me in.

'He was there for everybody else but when he needed someone he didn't ask anybody for help.'

Mr Stobbart leaves behind his grandmother Jean, sister Nicola, brother Michael and parents Brian and Vilma.

He was also a stepfather to Brandon, 13, and Samantha, nine. Mrs Stobbart said: 'He was a brilliant dad. I couldn't fault him in any way. I don't think we could have been any happier if we tried and we knew each other inside out.

'He meant everything to me. He was my life and my best friend. Part of me had died with him.

'People say 'you will get over it', but I won't - for me he was it. I couldn't replace him even if I wanted to.

'There is no-one that could live up to Kyle. He was the one. I'm angry in a way, but I know how much he loved me and Kaidence so in his head this must have been the only way that he could see.'

An inquest into Mr Stobbart's death has been opened and adjourned.
