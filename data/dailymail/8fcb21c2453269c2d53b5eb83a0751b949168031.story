The Australian flag has been burned at an Indigenous rally in Brisbane's CBD on the last day of the G20 Summit.

Rows of police, some belonging to the riot squad, assembled near the Roma St Forum as the second protest against Indigenous deaths in custody broke out. 

Skulls and words were drawn on the flags before they were incinerated at Emma Miller Place.

Effigies of Indigenous leaders Noel Pearson, Marcia Langton and Warren Mundine were also burned. 

Photos of their faces were attached to the stakes, with the labels 'Queen Marcia Langton', 'King Noel Pearson' and 'King Warren Mundine'. 

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman is angered by the display, saying that although he respects the right to protest, he will not condone flag burning, according to Nine News. 

The protesters chanted their motto, 'resist, revise, decolonise' in front of a crowd of around 300 people.

The group of about 50 are enraged by comments from Prime Minister Tony Abbott about Australia's history.

'He refers to this country as desolate (prior to the arrival of the first fleet),' activist Wayne Wharton said.

'He welcomes the world leaders and tells them there was nothing.

'So we have to resort to symbolism to show our disgust in your colonial leadership.'

Australia was ruled by force and founded in bloodshed, Mr Wharton said.

He made references to the large police presence keeping watch over the rally, criticising their carrying of firearms.

'It's no different to how you showed up in 1770,' Mr Wharton said.

Protesters formed a circle around a pile of shredded paper as the speeches continued, before six flags were paraded before the crowd. 

No police officer intervened.

The group then burned effigies of prominent Aboriginal leaders Warren Mundine, Noel Pearson and Marcia Langton to chants of 'sell outs!'

Brisbane is in the grips of a heatwave on the final day of the G20 summit, with the temperature tipped to get to 40C in the city.

On Friday, around 500 people stormed through the CBD, crying 'they say murder, we say justice'.
