She may only be 2ft 7in tall, but Hindu nun Anjali Barma is a towering presence at her temple in India.

Every day, the 65-year-old dwarf greets dozens of worshippers who flock to her temple in the Indian
holy city of Haridwar so she can bless their prayers.

'People from all walks of life bow to me,' said Anjali, also known as Ganga Maa.

'I used to hate being so small but now
I love it. It has brought me many fortunes and people think I'm an 
extra special holy person.'

Extra special holy person: The 65-year-old blesses dozens of worshippers each day covering requests from health and happiness to more bizarre ones such as good fortune with gambling bets

'It has brought me many fortunes': Anjali, also known as Ganga Maa, said she used to hate being so small, but now she loves it

Apart from the usual requests, such as for wealth, health or happiness, her devotees also
ask her to bless more bizarre hopes ranging from visa 
approvals and gambling bets.

She said: 'I try to advise everyone to 
stay away from vices but when a devotee comes from afar one has to 
respect his wishes so I do as I'm asked.'

Anjali, was born to a wealthy family in 1947.

Her
father was an employee with the Indian railways and she was sent to 
school for a few years. But the bullying and taunting on the school 
playground became too much, and she soon lost interest in study.

At the age of 10, she was out playing when she was kidnapped by a circus owner attracted by her unusual height.

Distressing childhood: At the age of 10, Anjali was out playing when she was kidnapped by a circus owner attracted by her unusual height

Trapped: Anjali was held captive by the circus owner for several months before escaping and being reunited with her parents

He held her captive for several months
and tried to persuade her to perform on his stage and become a huge 
attraction for the show, but she refused.

'The circus owner offered me everything to perform - clothes, expensive food and toys but I refused,' she added.

'He kept me locked up for months, until eventually I managed to escape.'

Anjali ran until she came across a police station and reported herself to the authorities.

Back
at home, her parents tried to find her a husband and when she was 17 
she was engaged to be married but things abruptly came to an end.

She said: 'He liked to flirt with me, always flirting, I didn't like it so I reported him to the police and had him arrested.'

Left homeless: Anjali was forced to find refuge on the banks of a river when her siblings abandoned her after their parents died

Anjali is even smaller than the world's smallest bodybuilder, the late Romeo Devi, who stood at 2ft 9ins, but is just 7ins taller than the world's smallest woman, is a remarkable 2ft 0.7ins

Anjali was engaged at 17, but things ended abruptly when she got her fiance arrested because she didn't like him

Sadly, Anjali's parents died when she was only in her 20s. Her siblings ignored her parents' wishes to take care of her and abandoned her, leaving her to find refuge near the banks of the famous Ganga River, in Haridwar.

She said: 'My family deserted me; I was left with no one. My only hope was god.

'I quickly decided not to marry and remain celibate and dedicate my life to God and the service of humankind.

'It has worked well for me. I have lived a very colourful life. Yes, I have no children of my own, but all my devotees are my children.'

Dressed from head to toe in her bright orange robes, sometimes as many as 40 locals a day meet with her at her favourite ghat and ask her to bless their prayers.

Anjali is even smaller than the 'World's smallest bodybuilder', the late Romeo Devi, who stood at 2ft 9ins, but is just 7ins taller than the world's smallest woman, Jyoti who stands at a remarkable 2ft 0.7ins.

Anjali added: 'I used to be sad about my height but now people much taller than me bow before me.

'I believe life is guided by your deeds, not by your height. There are hundreds of saints and holy men in this city but my height has brought me something extra. I'm small but today, in my life, it doesn't matter.'
