U.S. Bank officials are offering a $10,000 reward after a woman robbed six banks in Southern California in the space of two weeks.

The suspect, dubbed the ‘Plain Jane Bandit’, began her crime spree last Monday after two robberies, one unsuccessful, in the city of Moreno Valley.

The FBI has confirmed that the suspect struck three other U.S. Bank branches in Buena Park, Whittier and Santa Fe Springs, according to KTLA news.

Then, on July 23, FBI officials said that the same woman had struck a Chase Bank Branch and a U.S. Bank branch in Moreno Valley.

The most recent heist was last Tuesday (July 24) at a U.S. Bank branch in a grocery store in the city of Wildomar.

She
is also believed to have robbed another U.S. Bank in the city of Buena 
Park on Tuesday before hitting the branch in Wildomar.

NBC reported that during the 
robberies, the woman has made demands, in writing and verbally, and said
someone, possibly an accomplice was waiting for her outside. Nobody was
seen, however.

Witness 
reports have described the ‘plain Jane bandit’ as a Hispanic female, 35 
to 40 years old and about 5 feet 5 inches tall. She is believed to be 
about 160 to 180 pounds.

Investigators chose her nickname based on the statement of a witness who described her as ‘plain Jane’.
