Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement after allegedly sneaking in drugs and a mobile phone to prison  

One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement after smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell, it has been claimed. 

The 31-year-old, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, had been running a criminal network from HM Prison Manchester, sources said. 

Prison staff have come under fire for the reported security breach with critics slamming the alleged oversight as 'really embarrassing'.

Cregan is serving a life sentence after shooting dead PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as well as father and son David and Mark Short in Manchester in 2012. 

The gangster admitted the attempted murder of three others in a high profile court case the following year. 

He was told he would never see release after admitting to the killings which prompted public outcry and an outpouring of sympathy for the police.

It is the second time he has been caught smuggling drugs into the prison, known as Strangeways, since being put behind bars. 

But having managed to get hold of a phone to direct illegal activity on the streets, critics are demanding his case be used to set an example. 

'If the authorities cannot stop dangerous criminals like this continuing their activities from the inside then the Government will have to step in,' Tory MP Philip Davies told the Sun's Jake Ryan. 

'Dale Cregan is not the only prisoner with a phone because security is so lax and we might have to block mobile signals in prisons if it can't be stopped by the authorities.' 

A prison source added the blunder had been 'really embarrassing' for staff who were now under fire from bosses. 

'It's really embarrassing for the prison that one of the country's most dangerous prisoners has got a hold of a phone and drugs again.'

Cregan went on the run in 2012 after murdering David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, in a bar fight. 

The killer, who has one eye after losing the other in a separate brawl, lured officers Bone and Hughes into a house in September 2012. 

In October last year staff at the Category A prison faced questions after the murderer tested positive for cannabis in a random drug test. 

At the time a spokesman for the prison said: “The availability of illicit drugs in our prisons impacts greatly on prison life and can lead to violence and intimidation of both prisoners and their family.'

Earlier this year one of the key witnesses in his case revealed she had fled the country after receiving threats from the gangster's cronies online. 

The woman, who has not been named, refused to say where she was in the world but that she had been contacted by friends of Cregan threatening her life. 

She claimed she had been left destitute and without work after testifying for the Crown Prosecution Service. 

Greater Manchester Police declined to comment on her claims at the time on the grounds the force does not speak to individual cases involving witness protection.

The key witness who helped put Cregan behind bars for the killings that shocked the nation came under intense threats from gangland thugs before the trial.

On the night Mark Short was shot dead, the woman saw one of Cregan's co-accused, Damian Gorman, outside her house with two other people.

Giving evidence to the trial via video link, she said she also found clothes dumped in a garden next to her home the next day.

She said she faced threats after Short was killed, including one of the 'one-eyed Scotchman' - a reference to Cregan - paying her a visit. 

The trial heard Gorman had told her: 'You better make sure that you keep your f****** mouth shut or you're dead... You see these people, what they are capable of. You're f****** next. You and your f****** kids.' 

'He said, "Be careful because you don't want the one-eyed Scotchman coming to [your] door"... If I said anything to the police,' she said.

She said he pulled his finger under his chin and across his throat and told her: 'You don't want to die and you don't want your kids to die.'

'He was always threatening me. The message he gave me was clear,' she added.
