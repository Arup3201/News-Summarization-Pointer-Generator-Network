Harry Redknapp’s travelling circus is still going strong. The away days from hell are being offered to Queens Park Rangers fans by a rabble of overpaid, under-performing clowns who are simply not prepared to do their jobs properly for the club, the supporters or their manager.

Redknapp deserves better from these shirkers, who dress up and pretend to be footballers when they travel away from Loftus Road this season.

Eleven games on the road in the Premier League this season, and 11 defeats. This useless bunch of wannabes even lost at League Two Burton Albion in the Capital One Cup.

Joey Barton throws his arms up in the air after QPR's latest miserable outing away from Loftus Road

Queens Park Rangers have let Harry Redknapp down this season; he deserves better

Why am I picking on the players and not the manager? Just take a look at the ridiculous goals they conceded at Stoke on Saturday.

For the first Karl Henry inexplicably lets the ball run across his body just outside his own box, Stephen Ireland robs him and instantly feeds Jon Walters who scores. Nobody is near Walters because Rangers players have taken up space making themselves available for the ball because they were in possession. Until Henry’s blunder.

For the second, Eduardo Vargas, an international footballer who played at the World Cup, was lazy and sloppy in possession, under hit a simple pass in the opposition half, and gave the ball away cheaply. Now Walters is definitely not Usain Bolt – quite the opposite. But with no fewer than four QPR players chasing him he still managed to find time and space to score his second. 

Those four will be named and shamed: Leroy Fer was guilty of trotting back; Nedum Onouha looked like he was towing a caravan with flat tyres through a sea of treacle; Vargas chased like a headless chicken to atone for his error; and Henry was in the vicinity but didn’t exactly bust a gut.

The third was a joke. Stoke launched a free-kick from close to the halfway line into the box. Joey Barton was outwitted by Victor Moses. Barton wasn’t concentrating, Moses got goal-side of him, and in his desperate attempts to recover the situation after he had dozed off, Barton launched himself at the ball, but only succeeded in heading it across his own penalty area straight into the path of Walters, hungry for a hat-trick. 

While Barton looked stupid, Yun Suk-young looked feeble: as Walters closed in on the ball, he was side by side with the QPR substitute. The South Korean makes a limp, pathetic attempt to beat Walters to the ball, leaning into the Stoke striker who probably didn’t even realise he was there. The Rangers man is brushed aside like he doesn’t exist.

Tony Fernandes tweeted that QPR have good players, who fight. He failed to mention on social media that quite a lot of them fail to do their jobs properly and fail to give their all for the cause.

So before these QPR wasters even got into their luxury expensive cars and headed to training this week, I hope they implore themselves to do the following:

Can any of this shower look Redknapp in the eye?

A manager who took a team from the bottom three to the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a short space of time, a manager who has won more in English football than all of these players put together.

These are players who were not professional enough in their work on Saturday, and I suspect they and some others could be accused of shirking responsibilities in all their away games this season.

The QPR players are letting their extremely generous chairman down. They’re letting the fans down and they’re in danger of taking Queens Park Rangers down.

It seems the only thing this embarrassment of players will succeed in doing is tarnishing Harry Redknapp’s proud managerial record.
