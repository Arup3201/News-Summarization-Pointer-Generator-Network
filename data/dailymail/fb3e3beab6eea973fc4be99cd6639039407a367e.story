A 26-year-old teacher from Oregon has been jailed in Japan after receiving a bottle of prescribed Adderall pills in the mail for her attention deficit disorder.

Carrie Russell has been held at a detention center near Nagoya since February 20 over the pills, the Oregonian reported. Amphetamines - which include Adderall - are illegal in Japan. 

Russell's mother, who is a doctor in Portland, originally sent her daughter's prescription to South Korea which the 26-year-old then forwarded on to Nagoya where she was moving for an English teaching job, according to the newspaper.

Authorities found Russell's pills tucked inside a Tylenol bottle, the Oregonian reported. 

Dr Jill Russell told the newspaper she put the pills in the Tylenol bottle so as not to draw the attention of thieves wanting to sell them.

She also said that she acted out of concern for her daughter's social standing if anybody saw the pills.

She said in an affidavit obtained by the newspaper: 'My repackaging was not an attempt to break or circumvent the law. It was intended to preserve Carrie's privacy and dignity around a sensitive issue regarding medication to treat a disorder which falls under the area of mental health.' 

Miss Russell's family said that she has been in a detention facility near Nagoya, Japan since last month 

The 26-year-old was arrested at a Tokyo restaurant where she was dining with friends on February 20 and jailed, the Oregonian reported. Authorities are holding Russell on suspicion of trying to sneak in amphetamine drugs, according to the newspaper. 

The newspaper noted that a few notices, including a document from the Consulate General of Japan in Seattle, appear online and say not to carry Adderall into the Asian nation.

Amphetamines were banned by Japan in the 1950s. 

The Oregonian also pointed out that there is a mental health stigma in the country.

Russell's family learned about what happened on February 21 - one day after her arrest - according to the newspaper.  

The family's attorney in Portland, Loren Podwill - who is Carrie Russell's stepfather - told the NY Daily News that her family was working with the State Department to find a 'quick and successful resolution'.
