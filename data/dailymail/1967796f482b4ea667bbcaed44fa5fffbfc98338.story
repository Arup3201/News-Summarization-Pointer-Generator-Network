When welcoming a guest to your TV show it is important to get their name right, so have pity on Fox News host Megyn Kelly who managed to slip up while introducing Mike Huckabee.

Kelly managed to pronounce his name correctly the first time around, but when it came to reading out the title of his show - named after himself - she blurted out 'F***abee' instead.

As she made the gaffe, former Republican presidential candidate Mr Huckabee appeared to crack a smile before Mrs Kelly corrected herself.

When introducing former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Fox News host Megyn Kelly accidentally called him 'F***abee' while pronouncing the name of his self-titled show

Mrs Kelly later addressed the mistake after it drew a wave of mockery on Twitter, saying: 'Something else that happened on the program is also getting a lot of attention on Twitter and including this tweet from some nice man named Sean who said ‘Megyn you’re a delight to watch and gave a stoic performance after your slip up with Governor Huckabee’s name.’ 

'I thought I was stoic too – I have a heart of a 12 year old boy.' 

It is not the first on-air gaffe from Megyn Kelly, who ended up in hot water earlier this year when she made a stand over naming the Fort Hood shooter.

Mrs Kelly refused to name Ivan Lopez on her show on the day of the killings, trying to avoid giving him notoriety, but instead described his name as sounding 'Hispanic or Latino'.

Mr Huckabee didn't miss a beat, despite Mrs Kelly's mistake - and even appeared to crack a smile. Mrs Kelly later admitted to the error, saying it had attracted a lot of attention on Twitter

That controversy followed on from a race row that she sparked late in 2013 when she described both Santa and Jesus as 'verifiably white'.

Mrs Kelly was hitting back at an article saying Santa should be replaced by a penguin because the 'Santa-as-fat-old-white-man' image was not relevant in modern multi-cultured America. 

Mr Huckabee presents his show - called Huckabee - on Fox on Saturdays at 8pm.
