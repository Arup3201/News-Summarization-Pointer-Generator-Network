Address: Johan Lever, pictured today, was accused of a £77,000 Olympic Games scam but was allowed to leave on bail despite only leaving behind an address 'on a mountain side' in Crete

A man accused of a £77,000 Olympics ticket scam this summer was allowed to leave the UK despite giving his address as ‘a mountain side’ in Crete.

Johan Lever, 57, was released on bail after he was charged with money laundering offences relating to the illegal sale of 2012 Games seats.

The Crown Prosecution Service has today expressed its concern that despite giving just a PO Box address in Crete he was still allowed to leave Britain.

Mr Lever was only back at Westminster Magistrates Court today because he chose to come back to 'clear his name'.

‘He lives in a barren mountain side in Crete which is simply referred to by a Greek postal address’, prosecutor Edmund Hall said.

‘There isn’t a street name or anything.’

Lever, along with co-accused Lubor Pekarovic, is accused of selling tickets across England and Wales before laundering the proceeds through a series of bank accounts.

Prosecutors say a ’significant amount of tickets’ were involved in the scam.

Mr Hall said police were initially sceptical about releasing Lever on bail, but were reassured by further information.

‘Mr Lever was at large until very recently, having left the country sometime in August’, he said.

‘He voluntarily flew to this country last week and surrendered himself to police last Thursday.

‘It is a cliche but he says he has come here to clear his name.

‘The fact he gave a PO Box address was of considerable concern to the officers in the case.

‘But we have seen particular documentation, images and photos.’

He added: ‘Given his conduct so far, we would not be particularly concerned.’

Miranda Ching, defending, said Lever has been living in a hotel since returning to the UK and has surrendered his passport.

‘The address he lives at is about a kilometre outside the nearest town’, she said.

‘Police have previously written to the address and he responds to the correspondence by phoning the police.’

Lever worked as a tour operator in the Netherlands until around five years ago and has continued working sporadically since, she added.

He moved his family to Crete when he went into semi-retirement.

District Judge Michael Snow sent the case to Snaresbrook Crown Court on November 20, when Lever will appear in the dock alongside Pekarovic.

They both face charges of conspiring to sell Olympic tickets illegally and the transfer the profits.

No pleas have been entered.
