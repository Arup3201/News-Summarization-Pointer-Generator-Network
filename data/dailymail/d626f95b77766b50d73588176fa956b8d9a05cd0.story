Disciplined: Former substitute teacher Tiffany Leiseth, 27, lost her Pennsylvania teacher's license and will spend a year on probation after pleading guilty to plying two teenage boys with beer

A former substitute teacher from Pennsylvania accused of having sexual encounters with two 18-year-old students while her husband was away has pleaded guilty to giving them alcohol but not having sex with them.

Under Monday's plea bargain, 27-year-old Tiffany Leiseth, of Moon Township, lost her Pennsylvania teacher's license and will spend a year on probation.

Leiseth's attorney, Michael DeRiso, said Tuesday the outcome was appropriate because the boys were old enough to consent to sex. 

Police and Allegheny County prosecutors had argued the boys couldn't legally consent because of their student-teacher relationship with Leiseth.

The teens both testified at a preliminary hearing that the substitute English teacher at New Brighton High School sent them nude cellphone pictures and text messages before and after their separate trysts last year.

Leiseth was initially charged with two counts of sexual contact with a student for allegedly having sex with two male students on back-to-back days last May, just hours after final classes but days before graduation.

While both students were consenting adults at the time, Leiseth was charged because they had not yet officially graduated and maintained a student-teacher relationship with her. 

Investigators said Leiseith invited the two students over to home separately, on May 27 and 28, while her husband was away on business. She then offered both minors beer before engaging in intercourse.

School district officials started investigating Leiseth on May 30, after another teacher overheard some students talking about lewd photos another male student had received.

Plea deal: As part of an agreement with the prosecution, Leiseth was cleared of a sexual assault charge for sleeping with two 18-year-olds last May while her husband was away on business  

Fired: Leiseth started as a substitute teacher for the town middle school in 2012-2013, and moved on to New Brighton High School the following school year. She has since been terminated

Tryst: Investigators said Leiseth invited the male students over to her family home on different days, offered them beer and then engaged in intercourse

As part of the plea deal announced Tuesday, prosecutors dropped a felony count of institutional sexual assault. In exchange, Leiseth agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges.

Leiseth's attorney, Michael DeRiso, said his client did not try to seduce the students, bur rather one of the boys was courting her. 

Tiffany Leisith began working for the district at a middle school substitute teacher in the 2012-2013 year before being hired as a permanent substitute English teacher for the high school in 2013-2014. She was fired by the district in June.
