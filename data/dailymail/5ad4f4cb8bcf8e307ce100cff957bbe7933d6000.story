Twitter: Friends of Ralph Ferrett, 34, from Plymouth launched a Twitter campaign to find him a girlfriend

A man who complained he was struggling to find a girlfriend has been inundated with the offer of dates from around the world after his friends launched a campaign to find him a lady on Twitter.

Ralph Ferrett's friends decided to take action after tiring of hearing him moan about how 'hopeless' he is with women.

They decided to advertise Ralph on Twitter - inviting single women to submit themselves for consideration using the hashtag #GetRalphADate.

Within days they had received dozens of responses from ladies keen to try their hand at wooing the 34-year-old Royal Mail union official.

Most of the replies came from faraway places like Istanbul and Dubai - but Ralph says he'd rather find a girlfriend closer to his home in Plymouth, Devon.

He said: 'When it comes to affairs of the heart I'm a bit hopeless. But this is the 21st century, Twitter is part of the zeitgeist, so who knows? Fingers crossed.'

His friend Donna Galloway said: 'We have had quite a lot of interest but most of it has been from outside Devon.

'He is a really intelligent guy, you can have a good conversation with him about politics and he is good with technology.

Ralph says he is only really nervous when it comes to girls and has a hard timing speaking to the opposite sex

Friends used the hashtag #GetRalphADate to set the campaign trending

'He has got a really good sense of 
humour, he is a really good cook and he is into his fitness. He is just a
 good bloke. He just needs a bit of confidence.'

Ralph describes himself on his Twitter page as a ‘Argyle fan, food fanatic, avid reader, tech nerd, triathlete and film lover'.

MailOnline caught up with Ralph today to find out how the campaign had unfolded since its launch on Sunday night.

‘The reason the campaign is running because in these respects I’m a terribly
shy chap,' he said today.

'I get ever so anxious when it comes to talking to girls I’m
interested in. That’s why my friends decided to come to help with the Twitter campaign.

‘To be honest, I’m a bit overwhelmed by everything that’s happened, and I’m
feeling ever so shy at the moment if truth be told. It’s been odd.'

Ralph's friend Donna was one of the masterminds behind the campaign - and she says she vowed to find her friend three dates over the next six months - and she's 'not against pimping him via Twitter'

Ralph says he is only really nervous when it comes to girls.

'I’m a full time trade union official so I have to do a lot of public
speaking and helping people with problems – I’m good at all those sort of things,' he said.

'But when it comes to talking about myself I clam up and get really nervous.

‘I’ve not met anybody in person since the campaign took off on Sunday
night, but I have chatted to a few people.

‘It’s been overwhelming, but I made a conscious decision to let my friends do it.
Maybe at the very least it’ll help me get over my crippling fear of talking to
girls.

And ultimately, Ralph is keen to meet the a girl and settle down.

‘Without wanting to sound like a soppy character from a Mills & Boon, I
wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t want to meet Miss Right,' he said.

‘My friends are enjoying this - they think it’s good for me in the
long term.

‘They’re enjoying the fact that it’s been picked up by everyone.

'I wasn’t
aware of it until Monday morning when I got to work and got a few text messages
asking if it was me. But it’s all been very good. People at work are taking it in
good spirits, I’ve chatted to the local papers – I’ve even featured in Time
magazine in America. But I see Pope Francis has
taken my Man of the Year award...’

‘It’s one of those things – nerves have meant that I haven’t really done
anything like Internet dating or Tinder before.

'When I asked my friends for
help I was looking sensibly for some advice, and this is what came out of it.
But maybe this is the way of the future - 
one day we’ll all be using social media to find love.’

Plea for help: Ralph's friend Donna sent out a request for 'three dates over the next six months', adding that he was 'in good shape, intelligent and funny'
