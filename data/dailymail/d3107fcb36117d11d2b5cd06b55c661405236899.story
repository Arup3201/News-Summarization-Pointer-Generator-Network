The company behind the popular Thermomix kitchen appliance have responded to fierce criticism of their alleged 'shonky' antics with a lemonade recipe.

Thermomix caused controversy last month when they surprised customers with the release of the first new model in seven years.

Many so-called 'Thermo fans', who had only recently purchased the older TM31 model, were furious. Some said the company had told them there was not going to be a new Thermomix.

After consumer group CHOICE awarded them a Shonky Award yesterday, Thermomix Australia released a Facebook statement featuring the lemonade recipe.

'As the old saying goes: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,' Thermomix said in the post, which featured a picture of a jug of lemon juice. 

The statement went on to note the device had scored well in CHOICE kitchen tests in the past, before providing a link to the citrus recipe. 

'We are working hard to win back the support of all of our customers and hope we will again be voted a Top Scorer in the Choice Test in the future. 

'Please enjoy this recipe for Thermomix lemonade,' the statement said, before promising more lemonade recipes would be available shortly.

While many customers came to the defence of Thermomix's product, Facebook user Tanya Wilks said: 'Tackling the issue by posting a recipe about turning lemons into lemonade is insulting to say the very least.'

The Thermomix is extraordinarily popular and has received positive reviews from CHOICE. But the company's behaviour has been the target of scathing criticism

'How disgusting Thermomix Australia,' Julie Calleja wrote. 'Making fun of customers who are disappointed in your product by offering a... lemon recipe.'

Christi Britt, who labelled the move 'condescending', said: 'I am offended that Thermomix Australia thinks that a lemonade recipe might somehow make customers overlook the deceit.'

CHOICE has stepped up its demands for consumers to be compensated in the washup from yesterday's awards. 

The consumer organisation is calling on Thermomix to provide customers who purchased the TM31 in the three months before the new TM5 model was released with either: a full refund, a $250 discount or an upgrade to the new machine for $50.   

Customers were vocal in their anger after the latest device was released last month. A Change.org petition garnered more than 2500 signatures.

'I have only had my thermomix for just over a month when the new one was launched,' signatory Kim Burgess wrote. 

'This has left a bitter taste to what was to be an exciting purchase.'

Andrew Dickson wrote: 'My wife just bought one after wanting one for 2 years. Even asked the consultant if there was a new one coming out and was told no.'

Consumers and CHOICE have threatened to bring the apparent deception to the attention of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). 

An ACCC spokesman said it does not comment on whether it is conducting particular investigations.
