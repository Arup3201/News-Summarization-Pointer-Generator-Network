Israeli spy: Movie tycoon Arnon Milchan, who owns New Regency Films, has given details about his clandestine deals to acquire weapons for Israel in the 70s in a TV interview

A big-shot Hollywood producer who for decades was working as an Israeli spy and arms dealer has defended his actions and said it was 'exciting' being his country's 'James Bond.'

Arnon Milchan, 68, who's famous for smash hit movies including 'Fight Club' and 'Pretty Woman,' spoke openly for the first time about his espionage work in an Israeli TV special that aired Monday night.

The program reveals Milchan, at the special request of his friend Shimon Peres, who is now the country's president' set up and operated some 30 companies in 17 countries that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s. He brokered deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the show.

'I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,' Milchan said of his work for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations.

'Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting.'

The film tycoon spoke to Israeli investigative journalist Ilana Dayan for the season premiere of her current affairs show, Uvda.

Milchan was born in 1944 in what was then Palestine but was a successful young businessman in the United States when Peres, then in the defense department, recruited him to help following the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

'I knew': Robert De Niro sits next to his friend, Arnon Milchan, in the interview for the show. He says he asked Milchan in the 70s if he was a spy and Milchan admitted it

Israeli spy officials used bank 
accounts set up by Milchan to buy up helicopters and missiles and other 
defense equipment from around the world, Dayan said.

Milchan, the multi-billionaire 
chairman of New Regency Productions, explains in the program how he also convinced a 
German engineer to let him photograph plans for a nuclear facility and 
helped the South African government deal with the international backlash
 to its apartheid system in exchange for uranium supplied to Israel.

When the FBI discovered one of his 
companies was used to ship nuclear triggers to Israel without proper 
licenses in 1985, an executive who was involved was indicted.

But charges against Milchan were dropped by the Reagan administration.

'I didn't know Israel ordered the triggers,' Milchan told the program. 'I didn't even know what triggers were.'

He
 explains how famed Hollywood director Sidney Pollack, whose films 
included 'Tootsie' and 'Out of Africa,' was 'my partner in export in 
aerospace, planes, all kinds of things, with license.'

'He
 had to decide what he was willing and what he was not,' Milchan said. 
'On many things he said "No." Many things he said "Yes."'

Estimated
 earlier this year to be worth $4.2 billion, Milchan insisted he never 
profited from his spy work but risked his life multiple times even as 
rumors swirled around Hollywood.

'In
 Hollywood, they don't like working with an arms dealer, 
ideologically... with someone who lives off selling machine guns and 
killing,' he said. 'Instead of someone talking to me about a script, I 
had to spend half an hour explaining that I'm not an arms dealer. If 
people knew how many times I risked my life, back and forth, again and 
again, for my country.'

In 
the show, Robert De Niro was also interviewed sitting beside Milchan and
 recalled suspecting something about the producer's 'ventures' decades 
ago, but 'I wasn't sure.'

'Accepted it': De Niro says Milchan told him he was an Israeli and that 'of course' he would spy for his country. The actor says he did not judge him for it

When
 he confronted him, he said: '(Milchan) told me that he was an Israeli 
and that of course he would do these things for his country.'

Milchan said he wanted to speak out about what he'd done to gain recognition in Israel.

Russell Crowe, Ben 
Affleck and other major Hollywood players also featured in the 
controversial report that aired on Israel's Channel 2.

Pollack,
 who died in 2008, acquired arms and other military equipment for Israel
 in the 1970s, reveals Milchan in the TV report.

ollack
 knew of the details of the deals, said Milchan, who added that he 'didn't want to scare him because he's American.'

Milchan also said he used at least 
one big-name actor's star quality to lure U.S. scientist Arthur Biehl – an
 expert on nuclear weapons and a co-developer of the hydrogen bomb – to a
 meeting.

Milchan 
invited Biehl to the actor's home under the pretense the actor was 
seeking scientific advice for a project he was working on.

Milchan
 expected Biehl to cooperate because, 'Anyone who lives in California is
 a star-f*****… They hear "star"…they come running,' he said.

De Niro was asked if he knew what was going on at the time, and he said he did.

'I
 did ask him once, we spoke about something, he told me that he was an 
Israeli and that he of course would do these things for his country.

'I remember at some point, I had 
asked Arnon about that, being friends I was curious, but not in an 
accusatory way, I just wanted to know.

'He gave me that answer and I accepted it,' said De Niro.

This wasn't the first time Milchan's role in Israeli arms dealings and intelligence surfaced.

Two years ago, a book titled 
Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon 
Milchan, was published by authors Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman.

The book alleged that Milchan was an 
operative for Israel's Bureau of Scientific Relations, which gathered 
information for Israel's alleged nuclear program.

The bureau was closed after Jonathan Pollard was arrested for spying on behalf of Israel in 1986.

Milchan is still making movies, and his company, New Regency films, is working on four films slated for release in 2013-14.

One of those is Noah, a Darren Aronofsky-directed take on the Biblical flood story starring Russell Crowe, Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.
