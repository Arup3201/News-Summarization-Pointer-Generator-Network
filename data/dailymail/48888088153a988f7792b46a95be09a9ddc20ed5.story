As an ambassador for one of the world’s most popular and well known lingerie brands Doutzen Kroes is well aware of the power of her physique.

And now the Victoria’s Secret Angel has admitted that she likes to make the most of her enviable assets both on and off the catwalk.

Describing her own style as ‘casual chic’ the 29-year-old says that she loves wearing jeans, emphasising that making sure her bottom looks good is of the utmost importance.

It is hard to believe that the mother-of-one really has to make any effort to make her body look any better

‘I love jeans. The fit is very important, that it’s a little bit stretchy, comfortable, and how the butt looks especially. I’m a typical girl that way’

Speaking in a video interview for the launch of Victoria Secret’s new T-shirt bra, the mother-of one (who recently announced she is expecting her second child), says the key to her look is jazzing up a simple outfit.

‘I would describe my style as casual chic. Which means I wear lots of jeans and t shirts, and I like to dress it up with some accessories like a nice bag or shoes or a belt.

Wearing white cropped jeans and a simple round necked soft grey T-shirt, Doutzen has her ombre blonde hair loose and wears minimal make-up in the video, smiling as she goofs around and discusses her style.

Midway through she strips down to reveal not only her toned body and defined stomach, but also showing off the Victoria’s Secret bra which aims to combine comfort with a sexy natural shape, eliminating 'double boob', bra strap induced back pain, and 'greige' (i.e. once white) bras.

Having gained her coveted Victoria's Secret Angel wings in 2008 and walked in their epic annual show as well as modelling for the brand ever since, it is not surprising that the Dutch beauty cites underwear as an important component of her wardrobe.

‘Lingerie plays a huge role in how I feel. If you put on something sexy then it is almost like you have your own little secret and you feel confident and that is something that’s really important.’

However, the down to earth beauty, who lives in New York with husband Sunnery James and three year old son Phyllon Joy Gorré, says that despite her extensive experience of the fashion world she still diverts to her friends when it comes to style.

It is not hard to see why ladies man Adam Levine is besotted with his beautiful fiance as Behati models the T shirt bra

‘My friends have better fashion sense than I have so I sometimes ask them.’

One of those friends is fellow model Behati Prinsloo who models the Victoria's Secret T Shirt Bra in images for the campaign. The 24- year-old looks predictably stunning in a simple grey cotton strappy top and jeans over her underwear.

The fiancé of singer Adam Levine is one of the newest Angels and has been hard at work earning her wings, last week stripping down to show off the lingerie brand's 2014 Swim Collection at The London Hotel in West Hollywood with Alessandra Ambrosio.
