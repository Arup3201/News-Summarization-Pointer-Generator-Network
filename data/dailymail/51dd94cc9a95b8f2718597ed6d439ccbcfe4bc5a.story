An Australian entrepreuner and a tech 'genius' have constructed a car from Lego - and it can actually be driven on the road.

The bright yellow hot rod, snappily titled the 'Super Awesome Micro Project', was built using 500,000 pieces of Lego. Even the air-powered engine is made from standard Lego pieces and utilises four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons.

It can reach a top speed of 12-18mph, although the creators - Melbourne entrepreneur and marketeer Steve Sammartino and Raul Oaida, a 20-year-old self-taught 'technology genius' from Romania - do admit they were 'scared of a Lego explosion so we drove it slowly'.

Well put-together: The 'Super Awesome Micro Project' - a Lego car - was built using 500,000 pieces of Lego

Propulsion: The car has four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons and can hit 18mph

Mr Sammartino says the car is a world-first and is 'proof-of-concept of environmentally-friendly equipment'.

He added: 'What really matters in the world now isn’t so much the new technology. It’s people having access to the technology. It’s about people using their imagination to put things together in ways that people haven’t thought of before. That’s where the real power is.'

It cost £11,200 to build and was crowd-funded by forty Australian patrons. One of them is blogger Trevor Young, who said: 'I think ultimately you get involved with something like this because it’s such an awesome idea and good things might flow from it.'

The two men were worried that there would be a 'Lego explosion' if they pushed it too hard

Uncomfortable: Even the steering wheel and pedals are created from Lego bricks

The wheels, which are one of the few parts not made from Lego, feature likenesses of the pair of creators

Group project: The car was crowd-funded by 40 different technology enthusiasts from Australia

More than 500,000 Lego pieces were used.

The car engine is made from standard Lego pieces and runs on air

The engine has four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons.

Top speed is around 12-18mph.

It was built in Romania and shipped to a secret location in suburban Melbourne.

It’s a Hot Rod design, 'mainly because hot rods are cool'.

The wheels and some load-bearing elements are non-Lego.

The pair met when Mr Sammartino reluctantly accepted a random Skype request from the Romanian and from there, their working partnership flourished.

'He wanted me to connect him with this astronaut I know because he’s interested in rockets,' Mr Sammartino said.

'I’m teaching him about business and he’s teaching me a bit about physics. It’s a really nice mash-up.'

It's not the pair's first foray into bizarre Lego-related projects.

In late 2011, the pair sent a small space shuttle made out of Lego into space, where it reached an altitude of about 35,000 metres above the earth.

It landed in the snow near a little village in Germany, the country in which it was launched. Raul retrieved the shuttle using a GPS device.

Their initial attempt failed and the space shuttle blew up into thousands of Lego pieces as it couldn’t withstand the pressure of going into space.

So for the second successful attempt, Raul simply super glued all the pieces together so the shuttle wouldn’t fly apart as it was buffeted by 124mph winds.
