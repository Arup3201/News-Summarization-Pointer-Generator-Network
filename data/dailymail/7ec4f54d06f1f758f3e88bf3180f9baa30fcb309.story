A landmark bridge opened just over a year ago has been closed after metal thieves stole most of it.

The striking Puddlers Bridge was supposed to bring hope of new investment and better times to a struggling town.

But just a year after it was opened by fashion designer Julien MacDonald - and cheered by excited schoolchildren - the bridge was plundered for steel.

The landmark Puddlers Bridge which opened just over a year ago in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, has now had to be closed after metal thieves stole most of it

The striking white footbridge over a busy road was described by the designer as 'a small piece of Las Vegas in Merthyr Tydfil'

Metal thieves stripped more than 900 metres of stainless steel wire was from the striking suspension bridge at Merthyr Tydfil in the South Wales valleys.

And the theft has forced the local council to close the £830,000 bridge for the next three weeks to replace the pinched metal.

Locals said the latest metal theft was 'a kick in the teeth' to the community after fashion guru MacDonald opened it in a blaze of publicity.

The striking white footbridge over a busy road was described by the designer as 'a small piece of Las Vegas in Merthyr Tydfil'.

MacDonald said: 'It is great to celebrate something very positive. It is an incredible piece of modern architecture.'

But shopper Glenda Jones, 56, said: 'It was so exciting to have Julien come back to his home town and open the brand new bridge.

Investigation: South Wales Police the metal theft happened between 5pm on April 2 and 10am on April 5

'It was a real ray of light in the town - but once again some idiots have to ruin it.'

The bridge was part of a series of £50million route funded by the National Lottery of new walking and cycling links created across the South Wales Valleys to promote tourism.

David Jones, a spokesman for Merthyr council, said: 'It was only just over a year ago that Julien Macdonald opened this bridge with more than 100 schoolchildren in attendance.

Struggling: Merthyr Tydfil in the South Wales Valleys is often seen as one the most deprived towns in the UK

'I am extremely disappointed and angered at this theft which has resulted in the temporary closure of the bridge.

'We work hard with our partners to bring funding into the area to improve and regenerate the county borough and mindless individuals not only undo all the hard work, but leave us with a problem of which we have to find additional money to rectify.'

South Wales Police the metal theft happened between 5pm on April 4 and 10am on April 5.

Inspector Clare Hallett said: 'These mindless and reckless thieves have put the safety of the public in danger.

'The wire was vital for the safety of people using the bridge, so it is lucky no incidents have occurred as a result of what they did.'
