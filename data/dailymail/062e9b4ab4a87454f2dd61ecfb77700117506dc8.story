BBC bosses have spent £48,000 on a couch and fake television set at the corporation's new headquarters.

The expensive replica - a copy of the BBC Breakfast set - forms part of the public tour at Media City in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Bosses said it has been designed to give visitors a 'hands on experience'.

BBC bosses have spent £48,000 on a couch and fake television set at the corporation's new Manchester headquarters

A spokesman told the Sun: 'It is based on the BBC Breakfast set. The sofa and rest of the £48,000 mock studio allow visitors a hands on experience.'

But the decision to splash out on the design has attracted criticism.

Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The BBC must focus on ensuring value for licence fee-payers' money.

'Hard-pressed families expect their cash to be spent on quality programming and will rightly be frustrated at so much of their money being spent on a sofa.'

The BBC told the paper that public tours in the north had attracted nearly 50,000 visitors in just over two years.

They added that the revenue from the visits had exceeded the cost of the set, which was designed to 'give visitors a chance to try out their presenting skills'.

'Public tours to BBC North have attracted nearly 50,000 visitors in just over two years with revenues exceeding the cost of the replica set which gives visitors a chance to try out their presenting skills and it is one of the most popular elements of the tour.'

The couch is featured on BBC website, in a section promoting the tour. 

It says: 'Our well-informed and friendly tour guides will entertain and surprise you as you walk in the footsteps of your favourite stars.

'We'll make sure that you see the most interesting areas available when you visit us, as well as giving you a fascinating insight into how TV and radio work.

'You can also have a go at making your own news and weather bulletin in our interactive studio.'
