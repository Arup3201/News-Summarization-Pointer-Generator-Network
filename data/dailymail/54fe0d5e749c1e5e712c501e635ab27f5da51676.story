Childhood sweethearts Michelle and Pete Lakin have not had the smoothest of rides.

With Pete suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 23, having a heart attack in 2006 and finally suffering a cancer relapse three years later, their relationship has been tested to its limit. 

And with exercise and dieting the last things on their mind, the two found they were piling on the pounds too. When Pete was given the all clear from cancer in 2009 and released from hospital, the pounds just kept creeping on.

But now the couple have decided to battle against the weight - and each other - and have now lost over 7st each - using their Wii fit machine.

Thanks to making some simple changes to their diet and regular routines on the Wii Fit and dance games, the couple have lost over 7 stone each - but Michelle has lost 3lbs more

Michelle and Pete started piling on the pounds after Pete was released from hospital having suffered from cancer

Michelle has got the edge thanks to 
putting in the extra hours on the Wii after their three children had 
gone to bed, and has lost three pounds more than Pete.

Full-time mother Michelle, 37, said: 'I saw a photo of myself on a night out and I looked like a giant beast.

'I said to Pete 'Why didn't you tell me I was fat?' and he claimed he thought I knew.

'We're very competitive with everything we do - and the weight loss was no different. There have been times when I've thought about cheating and slipping a sugar or two into his coffee.

'I started using the Wii to tone up and it's clearly paid off.

Pete, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgekins Lymphoma when he was 23, suffering a heart attack in 2006 and a relapse of the cancer in 2009, says he began to eat loads when he came out of hospital

Michelle used the Wii Fit to get the upper hand in weight loss battle with her husband, doing extra work outs after the children had gone to bed

Michelle was shocked when she saw unflattering pictures of herself on Facebook and was motivated to start losing weight

Michelle says she started using the Wii as it was fun and she didn't want to end up with saggy excess skin

'Now we've reached our target weights it feels great. I can do so much more and I feel much healthier.'

Pete, 38, was first diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, when he was 23.

It led to weakening of his organs and he suffered a heart attack in 2006, followed by a relapse of the cancer in 2009.

Pete, an engineer, said: 'I was eating loads when I came out of hospital. I had to have a stem cell transplant which left my immune system very low and weak. Eating built my strength back up.

'We couldn't go out much so we'd just stay in and eat.

The super-trim couple now plan to  celebrate by taking a family holiday together

'But when Michelle saw that picture of herself on Facebook, we realised how bad our eating had become and decided to do something about it.

'I was in bad condition so I went along to classes with her. I do all the cooking and the healthy eating plan really appealed to me.'

The couple started Slimming World classes in June 2010 and after a break returned in February 2012.

Michelle has dropped from a size 24 to a svelte size 12, and Pete has gone from a waist size of 44 inches to 34 inches.

Michelle said: 'I was tired of being the fat, funny friend. Everyone around you is always so slim and I had to prove them wrong.

'Pete and I go through everything together and this is no different.

As well as using Wii the competitive couple joined Slimming World and won the title of 'couple of the year' for their joint 14 stone weight loss

'At first he just came to support me, but he got involved and we'd keep checks on how much the other had lost.

'It made it fun - and we had something to prove.

'I started using the Wii because I didn't want to end up with excess skin, so I've been doing yoga and playing the dance games with the girls to tone up.

'It's great fun and good for you - and it's paid off because I've lost three pounds more than Pete.'

Pete and Michelle have three daughters - Lauren, 10, Katie, nine and Mollie, four. They are taking them abroad for the first time later this year.

Michelle said: 'I was tired of being the fat, funny friend. Everyone around you is always so slim and I had to prove them wrong'

Pete said: 'We're taking the girls to Disneyworld in Florida.

'Before there were so many things we had to worry about - would the seat belt fit? Would we get on the rides? - but now we can go and enjoy ourselves.'

Michelle said: 'I wouldn't even go to the park with the girls before. The walk there was bad enough.

'But now I'm always outside playing games with them. I've even got a pair of roller skates.

'You're not the best parent when you're overweight. We've given them their childhood back.'

The couple were nominated for this year's Couple of the Year award, but narrowly missed out on the top prize.

Michelle said: 'Everyone's stories are so inspiring - I hope we can be like that one day.

'An old friend saw me and couldn't believe how much weight I'd lost. Now she's started a slimming class too.

'Our friends got used to us being the fat couple so now we've lost weight it makes them realise that it is possible.

'If after everything we've been through we can lose weight - then anyone can.'

Maureen Yardley leads the couple's Slimming World group in the Leicestershire village of Blaby.

She said: 'I'm extremely proud of the efforts they made to lose weight and they should rightly be proud of themselves.

'The family has been through such a lot in the past few years.'
