The crowd of 12,000 who had come for the memorial service to Joe Paterno, the legendary football coach of Penn State who died on Sunday of lung cancer, gave Nike founder and chairman Phil Knight a standing ovation for defending the coach's memory.

Mr Knight said at the public memorial service: ‘If there is a villain in this tragedy, it lies in that investigation, and not in Joe Paterno’s response.’ Paterno’s widow Sue and former defensive coordinator Tom Bradley were among those who stood after the defence eulogy.

Mr Knight’s comment seemed to refer to Paterno’s failure to alert anyone beyond his superiors at the school when he was told of a sex abuse allegation against former assistant Jerry Sandusky, a major reason he was fired by university trustees on November 9, less than three months before his death at age 85.

The service - at the end of three days 
of mourning on the university campus - took place in the Penn State 
basketball arena and saw tribute after tribute paid to the man called 
'JoePa'.

His remarkable achievements during 
his 46-year career as a coach saw him rack up more wins - 409 - than any
other major-college football coach. He also led his team to two 
national championships and preached 'success with honour' while 
insisting his athletes focus on academics.

His son Jay told the crowd how he leaned over his dying father, gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear.

'Dad, you won,' he said. 'You did all you could do. You've done enough. We all love you. We won. You can go home now.'

The service was primarily a glowing 
tribute to Paterno, who died at age 85, and his accomplishments but also an opportunity to 
defend his legacy against criticism that he failed to do more when told 
about an alleged sexual assault on a child involving one of his former 
assistants.

The service took place in Penn State's Bryce Jordan Center. Although primarily a glowing tribute to Paterno it was also an opportunity to defend his legacy against criticism that he failed to do more when told about an alleged sexual assault on a child involving one of his former assistants

Though the campus and surrounding 
community have been torn with anger over the Sandusky scandal and 
Paterno's summary dismissal by the board of trustees two months before 
his death, Jay Paterno said his father didn't hold a grudge.

He said: 'Despite all that had happened to 
him, he never wavered in his belief, in his dream, of Penn State.

'Despite all that had happened to 
him, he never wavered in his belief, in his dream, of Penn State. He 
told me he wanted to use his remaining time on earth to see Penn State 
continue to thrive. He never spoke ill and never wanted anyone to feel 
badly for him.'

'He 
told me he wanted to use his remaining time on earth to see Penn State 
continue to thrive. He never spoke ill and never wanted anyone to feel 
badly for him.'

Players from each decade of Paterno's
career spoke in loving terms about their mentor, saying he worked them 
hard, but always had their best interests at heart and encouraged them 
to complete their educations and become productive members of their 
communities.

Among the speakers were Michael 
Robinson, who played for Paterno from 2002 to 2005 and flew in from 
Hawaii, where he was practising for his first Pro Bowl; star quarterback
Todd Blackledge from the 1980s; and Jimmy Cefalo, a star in the 1970s.

Like Robinson, Blackledge and Cefalo went on to play in the NFL.

Former NFL player Charles V Pittman, speaking for players from the 1960s, called Paterno a lifelong influence and inspiration.

He said Paterno challenged his 
young players, once bringing Pittman to tears in his sophomore year. He 
said he realised later that the coach was moulding him into the man he 
would become.

'What I now know is that Joe wasn't 
trying to build perfection. That doesn't exist and he knew it. He was, 
bit by bit, building a habit of excellence,' said Pittman.

Paterno was fired on November 9 after he was
criticised for not going to police in 2002 when he was told that 
Sandusky had been seen sexually assaulting a boy in the showers.

Sandusky was arrested in November and is awaiting trial on charges that 
he molested 10 boys over a 15-year span.

As the scandal erupted, 
Pennsylvania's state police commissioner said Paterno may have met his 
legal duty but not his moral one. Penn State president Graham Spanier 
was also fired in the fall-out.

Nike CEO Knight, appearing about midway through the memorial, became the first speaker explicitly to address the scandal

Mourners wipe away their tears as they listen to the tributes being paid to the university's former coach

He said the coach 'gave full 
disclosure to his superiors, information that went up the chains to the 
head of the campus police and the president of the school. The matter 
was in the hands of a world-class university, and by a president with an
outstanding national reputation'.

Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for the 
board, replied after the service, saying: 'All the reasons for the 
board's difficult and anguished decision - made unanimously, including 
former football players and everyone who still loves Coach Paterno and 
his memory - reached a decision which was heartfelt. All 32.

'The facts speak for themselves' and include the grand jury testimony, he said.

Chris Marrone, another former player 
who eulogised Paterno, said Knight was his 'new hero' for expressing the 'pent-up frustration' of Paterno's supporters.

'I think the response that he got is indicative of how folks feel,' Marrone said.

Only one member of the university 
administration - the dean of the college of liberal arts - spoke at the memorial which was arranged 
primarily by the Paterno family. No one 
from the board of trustees made a speech.

People said it felt good to remember and celebrate the good times.

Tennessee Titans coach Mike Munchak, who played for Paterno, said he attended the service 'because I'm a part of his legacy'.

'It was not only about football," Munchak said. 'It was about life and how he affected all of us as men.'

Phil Knight, former CEO and co-founder of  Nike, becomes emotional as he speaks during the service. He got a standing ovation when he said: 'If there is a villain in this tragedy, 
it lies in that investigation and not in Joe Paterno's response'. Right, a young mourner is overcome with grief
