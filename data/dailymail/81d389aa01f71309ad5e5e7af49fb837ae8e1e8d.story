An eight-year-old has been hailed as a hero by his mom and more than a dozen other families who live in the same Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, apartment complex after he discovered flames engulfing a neighbor’s home and raised the alarm.

Thanks to Johnathan Bent everyone escaped unharmed from Wednesday morning’s blaze including his two young sisters, one of whom had to be dramatically dropped to safety from a second floor balcony.

Their dramatic rescue was captured on a camera mounted to a fireman's helmet.

Johnathan Bent has been hailed a hero after raising the alarm over a fire at an apartment complex in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee

One of Bent's young sister had to be dramatically dropped to safety from a second floor balcony

The third-grader was sleeping at an elderly neighbor's home to keep an eye on her, when her screams woke him up about 2 a.m.

The woman had dropped her cigarette near her oxygen tube, sparking a fire.

‘Then all this fire flamed up and hit the door,’ the boy told WRCB.

Initially he tried to put the blaze out with a couple of glasses of water, but when that didn’t work he ran through the building, banging on neighbors' doors, including his mom's, to wake everyone up.

One neighbor pulled the elderly women to safety, while another used an extinguisher to try and douse the fast-moving flames.

'My hero': Proud mom Lynn Bent described her son as a kindhearted soul who cares about people

One of the children trapped had to be lowered from a balcony on the second floor to firefighters on the ground.

'This little boy did a terrific job for his age in notifying people, and thanks be to him that he got all the people up or we would have had more rescue to do than what we had, and we could have had fatalities,' Fire Chief Jay Moore told WKRN.

Proud mom Lynn Bent described her son as a kindhearted soul who cares about people. ‘I've never had a hero, but I do now,’ she said.

Medics took the elderly woman to an area hospital to be checked out for smoke inhalation. No charges have been filed.

In all, seven families were displaced, and the American Red Cross has put them up in a hotel for now.
