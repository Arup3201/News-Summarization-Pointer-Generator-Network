Kitchen surfaces piled high with pots and pans, plastic bags filled with old newspapers and even a collection of human hair are just some of the thousands of items which fill these hoarders' homes.

The secret life of the hoarders, who can not bear to throw the objects away, was unveiled when a number of hoarding support group members invited a photographer into their homes in a bid to shock them out of the condition.

For many of the group, who meet regularly to seek help and advice, their addiction to hoarding had become so extreme that they had no choice but to leave their squalid homes behind, unable to live among the floor-to-ceiling stacks of newspapers, dirty clothes and shopping bags.

Clutter: Photographer Paula Salischiker was invited into the homes of hoarders living in London and Essex in an attempt to help cure them of their condition

Hair-raising: Among the more unusual, and stomach-churning, items discovered by Ms Salischicker was a collection of human hair

Squalor: The collection of hair had spread to the bathroom, along with bags filled with paper and rubbish

Rubbish: A pile of rubbish and old food wrappers coat the kitchen work tops in one hoarders' home

Respectable: Ms Salischiker said that some of the homes she photographed belonged to people with 'respectable jobs' who were 'deeply ashamed of their condition'

Photographer Paula Salischicker was asked by the group members to take pictures of their homes as part of an exercise to show the true extent of their 'collections'.

London-based Ms Salischicker said that many of the hoarders, who live in London and Essex, had initially found it hard to let her inside, ashamed at the piles of rubbish they had amassed over the years.

'Some
of the people I photographed were deeply ashamed of their condition and
the state of their homes, and even had respectable jobs and good social
lives,' said the London-based photographer.

'For them, the thought of letting me 
into their home was unbearable, but with some of them, I managed to help
them bring down their barriers letting them help me to help them.

'When something broke, say the cooker, or the washing machine, they were that ashamed of letting someone in that whatever was broken would stay that way.'

The shocking series of images, taken by the Argentinian-born photographer, reveal some very unusual collections including, human hair, rotting food and twigs.

Ray of light: The homes pictured belong to members of a support group, which is the first of its kind and gives free help and advice to members trying to battle their addiction to collecting

A space to sit: One man sits in his chair, amidst a sea of old newspapers, discarded supermarket bags and numerous pairs of trainers

Ms Salischiker said: 'The things some of the hoarders collected was unbelievable and I could never think of a use for a lot of their belongings - obviously to them, everything had it’s place.

'While some of the hoarders were ashamed of their homes, others were in denial and their clutter became invisible to them.

'It was only when I showed them my photographs, that it opened their eyes to what was staring right at them, but initially they couldn’t see the wood through the trees.

Haul: A mountain of video cassettes, books, and even an old fan fill this room, almost from floor to ceiling

Can't cook won't cook: Any food preparation would be impossible on this stove top, covered in piles of pots and pans

Mystery object: This strange item is unrecognisable, and yet one hoarder could not bring themselves to throw it away

'One of even refused to believe that that the pictures I was showing them was their house!'

Earlier this year, hoarding was defined as a separate disorder from OCD in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, meaning that until recently, the treatments offered have not been entirely appropriate.

The group, which meets in London, is the first of its kind and gives free help and advice to members from around the country, who are trying to battle their addiction to hoarding.

Piled high: Barely any space remains in this squalid kitchen, while another hoarder's bed was hidden with plastic bags, containing, among other items, newspapers, a Father Christmas hat and a box of Celebrations chocolates

Forced out: Sometimes, the hoarders' collections had got so bad, they could no longer live in their home and had to move

'Sometimes, the hoarders' collections had got so bad, that they could no longer live in their home and had to live elsewhere,' said Ms Salischiker.

'I’m grateful that they let me into their homes and the experience really opened my eyes to hoarding as a medical condition.

'I just hope that my photographs helped them see the extent of their hoarding and will help them conquer, or remedy their condition.'

Stciking point: This hoarder's activities have not been confined to the inside of their home, with a collection of twigs kept on top of some garden chairs
