Hundreds of sheep have been released around Carson City in Nevada to eat vegetation in a bid to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires this summer. 

The sheep have become a familiar sight in the capital since 2006 - two years after the Waterfall Fire spread across land around Carson City destroying 17 homes and damaging 14 others. 

The 2004 fire also damaged or destroyed three commercial buildings, 51 vehicles and 32 out buildings.

It is believed it cost around $8million to get the blaze under control and $10 million in personal-property damage.

About 750 sheep will graze along the city's urban interface from south Carson City north to Western Nevada College.

The Carson City Fire Department hauls water for the four-legged firefighters. 

City officials say the arrangement benefits the animals and residents alike.

The sheep get to eat and they reduce the abundance of invasive weeds that dry out in the summer and provide more fuel for fires.

Carson City Fire Chief Stacey Giomi told the Nevada Appeal: 'It's one of the greenest tools.'

Speaking about the blaze of 2004 he said: 'I was the acting chief. It was devastating. It was devastating to our community; it was devastating to our employees.' 

A couple of herders, a Great Pyrenees guard dog and three or four border collies will accompany about 750 sheep, plus lambs.
