Convicted: Simon Hale tricked underage girls into stripping for his webcam by pretending to be Justin Bieber

A paedophile who tricked under aged girls into performing sexual acts on their webcams befriended the teens online by posing as Justin Bieber and One Direction's Niall Horan.

Simon Hale then persuaded the girls from Britain, Australia and Denmark into posing naked or topless for him as well as blackmailing teen Bieber and 1D fans into performing sexual acts on Skype.

The 37-year-old was jailed for a minimum of ten years and the judge branded him so dangerous he may never be freed.

Both Justin Bieber and Niall Horan 
have been informed of the case and were both ‘horrified and appalled’ at
the way their identities had been used by Hale.

He
tricked the underage girls into believing they would be able to talk to
Justin Bieber and 1D’s Horan through a chat-room style website – 
although the recipient of their messages was in fact Hale, Plymouth 
Crown Court heard.

He then 
used sophisticated software to take over the young girls’ computers 
after which he recorded and blackmailed some of them into committing 
on-camera sex acts for his own perverted sexual gratification.

When police tracked him down they found 35 Skype accounts and more than 180 homemade videos, mostly of young girls.

Nearly 90 of these show the girls them performing various sex acts.

Police identified ten out of 33 girls with whom Hale has struck up online relationships.

The
court heart how Hale blackmailed one 13-year-old Bieber fan to strip 
naked and commit simulated sex acts with her six-year-old cousin.

Another girl was made to commit sexual 
acts with her four-year-old brother and other girls were made to touch 
themselves intimately.

All girls were underage and between 13 and 15.

Hale admitted ten counts of causing or
inciting children to comment indecent acts and 12 charges of making, 
possessing or distributing images of those children.

Prosecutor
David Gittins told the court that Hale had a previous conviction for 
grooming a girl on the internet, meeting her and having intercourse with
her twice.

He was jailed for five years in 2005.

Judge
Paul Darlow said: ‘By pretending to be someone you knew girls would 
idolise, you inveigled your way into their confidence in several cases 
spawned an infatuation with you.’

He said Hale's actions were 'sinister and premeditated' and warned he will remain a risk to the public in the future.

Hale
was sentenced to an indeterminate jail term for public protection with a
minimum of ten years behind bars but warned he may stay in prison.

Detective
Inspector Simon Snell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, who leads the 
cyber-crime team, said: ‘The abuse of Hale's victims was horrific.

'He is
a very dangerous and sadistic man, with him it's about control and 
sexual gratification.’
