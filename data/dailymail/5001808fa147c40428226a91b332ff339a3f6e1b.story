Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein, there to cover the match, reported from the main square: 'I saw one elderly man, clearly dazed, ushered into a red ambulance with a heavy bloodied gash over his left eye at 3pm local time.

'But his entry into the vehicle was delayed by his friends arguing with heavily-armed Gendarme, while a woman tried to act as peacemaker so the man could get medical attention quickly.

'It was a chaotic scene. A lot of drinking has taken place. It has to be said the vast majority of Everton fans have been well-behaved and there are families there too. But there is also a belligerent minority who are not making things easy, though the police will also have to look at themselves and ask if they have been too heavy-handed.

'Despite a warning from Everton's official Twitter feed, hundreds of their supporters remained in the square this afternoon.'

The mood seemed relaxed and jovial as the 7,000-strong Everton faithful looked forward to the game before an act of aggression seemed to spark riot police into action.

Everton say the trouble started when a plainclothes officers went to arrest a supporter who was misbehaving.

Everton fans thought it was local Lille follower giving the man hassle and retaliated.

He ran from police and it sparked the confrontation which led to CS gas and pepper spray being used.

The supporter, who was taken off to hospital in an ambulance, had a  bloodied gash above his left eye that came from a a CS Gas canister that was fired by police.

Back in the square, a loud bang rattled through the area as the police let off the first of three tear gas bombs.

With shields covering their bodies, the police move aggressively through a group of Everton fans, knocking one to the ground as the second tear gas bomb was released.

Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Several fans seemed extremely shaken by the events and the majority  felt they had been victims of another unprovoked attack.

One fan shouted, 'they've got rubber bullets', which the police reportedly used to stem any further aggression from either set of fans, although there were no Lille fans in sight.

The away support certainly seemed to be the victims as the mood in the square had been a pleasant one for the majority of the afternoon.

This second alleged attack comes 24 hours after a group around 50 locals stormed a bar full of Everton supporters on Wednesday night.
