A mobile phone company has developed a new handset for old people - dubbed the Grandroid - that has a ringtone as loud as a pneumatic jackhammer.

The smartphone also features an easy-to-read screen as well as a special button on the rear to call for help. 

The Amplicomms Power Tel M9000 uses the Android operating system and has a simple system of menus on screen so as not to confuse elderly users.

The 'Grandroid' smartphone features larger than normal menus and a special SOS button on the rear 

The company describes the unit as a 'Senior Smart Phone' although it is more commonly known as the Grandroid due to its operating system and easy-to-use menus and extra-loud ringtone. 

The phone is also designed to be compatible with hearing aids and has a louder than normal handset volume. 

Pensioners will also be able to download their favourite musical tracks as MP3s onto the device adn carry their music with them. 

Also the 'Grandroid' has Bluetooth allowing it to connect to a range of devices such as computers, in-car audio system and even induction loops. 

The £140 handset features a clever Caller ID system which will read out the phone number for the pensioner. 

The phone also comes with a two-year warranty offering considerable peace of mind. 

Ran Reyrav of Amplicomms told The Sun: 'This phone ensures older generations are not excluded.' 

The grandroid phone also features an extra-loud ringtone and works well with different types of hearing aid
