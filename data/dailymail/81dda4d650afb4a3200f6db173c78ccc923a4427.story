A Chinese university student has been condemned to death after he was found guilty of fatally poisoning his roommate with drinking water.

Lin Senhao, 27, claimed that the death of Huang Yang, also 27, was an accident after an innocent April Fool's Day prank which had ended in tragedy.

However, a judge sitting at Shanghai Number Two Intermediate People's Court ruled that the act was malicious and Lin had intentionally murdered his roommate out of spite.

Mr Huang drank water from a spiked dispenser at a prestigious Shanghai university on April 1 last year but did not die until April 16 of liver, kidney and lung failure according to the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate.

A post-mortem revealed that he had been poisoned with the toxic chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which Lin had taken from the Shanghai hospital laboratory where he was an intern.

At trial in November, the defendant confessed to poisoning the water, but stated he never intended to kill Mr Huang.

The Global Times reported that prosecutors rejected Lin's argument by claiming he was familiar with the chemical he put in the water as he had used it in experiments on laboratory animals and therefore knew what he was doing.

'The defendant Lin Senhao committed intentional homicide by poisoning due to trivialities. The method was ruthless, the harm to society was great, the crime extremely serious,' the court said in a statement.

Prosecutors added that Lin killed Mr Huang in an intentional homicide because of a grudge he held against over "trivial daily matters." It was also claimed that Mr Huang often described Lin as "stingy," and once criticising their other roommate's bad behaviour to Lin's, which angered the April Fool murderer.

Lin's lawyers argued against any intention, claiming "trivial daily matters" were not enough for Lin to commit the murder and he would have used a different chemical if there was intention to kill due to NDMA's strong odour.

Lin stated he was prompted to do prank after Mr Huang announced his own plans to trick someone on April Fool's Day, but he only wanted to cause Mr Huang some discomfort.

But Lin's understanding of NDMA is extensive and he has  published several articles with descriptions of experiments with the chemical in national academic journals, including measuring lethal volumes in mice.

Creating a killer dose, Lin put at least 30 grams - 10 times the fatal does for an adult man of Mr Huang's size - of the chemical in the water dispensers on March 31 at about 5.50pm. Prosecutors said Lin had taken the chemical from an experiment at the hospital on the same day.

NDMA is primarily used for research and according to the US Environmental Protection Agency exposure in humans may cause liver damage and affect the blood.

After drinking the toxic water on April Fool's Day, Mr Huang was hospitalised the next say and transferred to intensive care the following day with liver failure, plunging blood platelets and fever.

After doing an ultrasonic examination on Mr Huang on the morning of April 2, Lin told him there was nothing wrong with his liver and he even visited Mr Huang in hospital and prosecutors used this to blame Lin for doing nothing to save Mr Huang's life.

With his condition remaining undiagnosed for eight days after drinking the chemical, Lin's other roommate, Ge Jungi, not a resident in the dorm at the time, remembered Lin had written articles about the chemical.

When police found the chemical in the water dispenser and arrested Lin, he confessed. Police also found Lin had searched murder cases involving fatal doses on his laptop from April 1 to April 4.

The court said Lin could appeal the sentence and China's top court must review death sentences before execution can take place.

The crime has been compared to a 1994 case that saw a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing allegedly poisoned with thallium, a toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons, by classmate Sun Wei while the two were studying chemistry.

The victim, Zhu Ling, survived the poisoning but lives severe brain damage as a result. CNN reported that at almost 40 years old, Zhu remains mostly bed-ridden, practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old child, despite previously being a keen swimmer and skilled musician.

Despite being suspected of the poisoning, Sun, who has family connections with Chinese officials, was never tried and now lives abroad.
