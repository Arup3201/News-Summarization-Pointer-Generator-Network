A former woodwork teacher repeatedly molested children aged between three and 16 while reading passages from the bible and posing as a churchgoer.

79-year-old Stephen Gough admitted to nine acts of child sex abuse charges on Wednesday at Waitakere District Court in New Zealand.

He received three-and-a-half years behind bars for his disturbing crimes.

The judge said that Mr Gough carefully orchestrated his acts and used the children as 'sexual toys'.

The court heard that Gough, who needed the help of a walking stick to get up on the dock, repeatedly committed the heinous crimes against three girls and one boy over an 11-year period.

Gough gained the trust of community members by being heavily involved in his local community and in the church. 

It was revealed that Gough would read passages from the bible to the innocent children while sexually abusing them, between 1976 and 1987.

The court also heard that Gough watched children showering by carving out a peep hole under a house.

His crimes only came to light after his victims came forward last year.

Police believe more victims may come to light after Gough has been sentenced and are encouraging people to come forward. 

Police say new charges against Gough will be considered if further victims identify themselves.

Speaking at the sentencing, Judge Glubb said Mr Gough's actions were 'a total disgrace'.

'This is a very sad day. It represents an appalling track record of invasive offending against very vulnerable young children,' he said.

As Gough was led away from the dock, one of his victims screamed out in disgust. 

'Burn in hell you piece of s***,' the victim said.

According to reports,  Mr Gough believed he had been cured of his sexual addiction, having completed three rehabilitation programs for his urges.

The court took this into consideration when sentencing Mr Gough.

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, one of Gough's victims described how the vile man had ruined her life.

She told the newspaper that her mother knew exactly what was happening to her and never did anything about it. 

She also revealed that she has tried to end her own life on numerous occasions since she was abused as a young girl and has developed an alcohol addiction and eating disorder from her trauma. 

'Two months ago I tried to take my life... it was pretty bad,' she said.

They thought I was going to die this time. It's pretty hard. 

'He has totally and completely ruined my life, I'm a complete mess. I drink to forget... I've been to rehab four times, I got sectioned last year because of my drinking. I'm so f***ing angry.' the victim said. 

She encouraged any other victims to come forward now that Mr Gough's name has been made public. 

She also thanked the police for helping bring Mr Gough to justice.
