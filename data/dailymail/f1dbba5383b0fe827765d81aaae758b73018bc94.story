Controversial: Mississippi's governor Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, pictured with his wife Deborah, has caused a debate over children's education and women returning to work

A Mississippi governor has ignited a heated debate by claiming that standards in education have declined in line with women returning to the workplace.

Speaking during a televised panel discussion, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant quickly realised his controversial remarks would cause a backlash from those who oppose his views, but he stood by his claims.

He pointed out however that he was not trying to blame working women for children's declining education.

In response to a question asking why American children's test results had become 'so mediocre', he told the panel, hosted by the Washington Post: 'Both parents started working, and the mom is in the work place. That's not a bad thing. I'm going to get in trouble. I can just see - I can see the emails tomorrow. But now, both parents are working. They're pursuing careers. It's a great American story now - that women are in the work place.'

He went on to say that he didn't believe it was the mother's place to teach children to read, but said that before women started working, there was a 'loving, nurturing opportunity' and both parents had a more time to devote to the family.

Equal opportunities for women began notably in the 1950s and 60s. The struggle for women to be accepted as equal in the workplace is epitomised in the successful TV series Mad Men, set during this period.

Prior to this the traditional role for women was to act as the matriarch, to be the mother and home-maker, cook and cleaner and to keep the house in order.

In more rural parts of the country, such as Mississippi, women have always toiled in much the same way as men, according to Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole.

Calling Bryant, 'the goofiest governor in America,' Cole said throughout the state's 200-year history, most mothers have had to work to earn money for their families.

Janis Lane,  right, president of the Central Mississippi Tea Party, said she was proof children could be the focus of the home and still work. Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole, left, described Bryant as 'goofy' saying most women in Mississippi had always worked in some way

He said in a statement: 'Whether that work took place in the fields, in the logwoods, as domestic workers, as teachers, as nurses, as factory workers, in food service, in retail or in many other fields of arduous work, the mothers of Mississippi have been bringing home the bacon since Mississippi began.'

He added:  'The 1950s `Father Knows Best,' picket fence, middle-class family myth has never been an option for most Mississippians.'

Bryant's remarks were also criticised by Democratic state Senator Deborah Dawkins, of Pass Christian.

The frequent critique of Bryant, who said she worked as a physician's assistant while raising three children, described Bryant as being out 'out of touch' with the challenges facing parents to afford child care, particularly in the poorest states.

1950s wife: Equal opportunities for women began notably in the 1950s and 60s; they were traditionally mothers and home makers

Housewife: Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole said: 'The 1950s `Father Knows Best,' picket fence, middle-class family myth has never been an option for most Mississippians.'

Speaking to Associated Press, she said he 'surrounds himself with Tea Party people who want to home-school their children'.

The president of Central Mississippi's Tea Party, Janis Lane, said she believes Bryant meant nothing derogatory.

Lane, who worked while raising two sons, said having both parents working takes some of the focus away from home life, but said she was proof that it was possible to build your life around your children and still work.
