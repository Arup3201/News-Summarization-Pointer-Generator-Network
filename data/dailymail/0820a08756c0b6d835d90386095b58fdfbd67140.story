A 67-year-old man has a rare brain defect which causes him to hear people speak before he sees their lips move.

The end result is that all of his conversations resemble a badly dubbed film where the sound and actions are out of sync.

The man, known only as PH, is the first confirmed case of the disorder where his brain processes sight significantly slower than sound.

Living in a badly dubbed world: A 67-year-old man hears people speak before he sees their lips move making all of his conversations appear out of sync (stock image)

PH first started suffering the unusual symptoms after undergoing surgery.

'I said to my daughter "hey, you've got 
two TVs that need sorting!'", he told New Scientist. 

But PH then realised that he was 
hearing his own voice before feeling his jaw move.

Doctors conducted scans of his brain which showed two lesions in areas that potentially play a role in hearing, 
timing and movement.

Light and sound travel at different speeds, so visual and auditory inputs arrive at the eyes and ears at different times.

The signals are then processed at different rates in the brain but still appear as though they are happening simultaneously.

Possible cause: The 67-year-old, only known as PH, only started suffering the symptoms after undergoing surgery. Scans show he has two lesions in the areas of the brain which play a role in hearing, timing and movement (stock image)

PH's brain is believed to processes visual input much slower than it processes sound - causing the large time discrepancy.

Elliot Freeman and colleagues at City University London performed several temporal order judgement tests using video clips to confirm the condition.

They found that they had to play the sound 200 milliseconds later for PH to view it as in sync with the visual action

Mr Freeman is now looking for a way to slow down PH's hearing so it matches what he is seeing.
