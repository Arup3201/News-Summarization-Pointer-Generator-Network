The married New York mother who was murdered while on a solo trip to Turkey was reportedly seen with a second mystery man twice before her death - including the day she was supposed to fly home, it was revealed today.

It follows reports that Sarai Sierra, 33, had sex the day before she vanished with a man she had struck up a friendship with on the internet months ahead of her trip.

Police are also investigating whether the mother-of-two was involved with any criminal activity while in Turkey after she was seen with 'a criminal element'.

Now a witness has told Istanbul police that he saw Sierra speaking to a different man outside the city's Sultanahmet Mosque on January 11, just days after she arrived in the country.

He handed her a card and as she left the mosque, she took a walk with him and four or five other men, the witness claimed, Turkish newspaper Milliyet reported.

Sierra flew to Amsterdam on January 15 and to Munich the next day, returning to Istanbul on January 19. The witness said he then saw Sierra talking with the same man on January 21 at Topkapi Palace - the day she was due to fly home, but she never boarded the flight.

Turkish police and the FBI are reportedly looking into whether Sierra was involved with drug traffickers, human traffickers or jewellery transportation while on her solo trip.

They have previously said the first people Sierra - who had been unemployed and declared bankruptcy in 2005 - met with on her trip were 'a criminal element'.

Sierra's body was found with a single blow to the head and stashed by the city's ancient walls on Saturday, two weeks after she was meant to fly home to her husband and two sons in Staten Island.

Final journey: It is loaded onto a plane bound for New York at the Ataturk Airport on Thursday morning

Preparation: Her casket is carried through Beyoglu in Istanbul on Wednesday

But as intrigue continues to swirl around the circumstances of her death, a man named 'Taylan' said on Wednesday that he had sex with the married mother a day before she disappeared.

Claims: Turkey's Vatan newspaper reported that Taylan had sex with the married mother of two

The man, who met Sierra online months ago when he commented on one of her Instagram photos, has not been fully named, but police said his first name is Tarkan and his last name begins with a K.

They had previously referred to him as 'Taylan' as it appears in his Instagram name.

He had initially insisted they were just friends, but Turkey's Vatan newspaper reported he told police they had consensual sex a day before she went missing. He had hoped to see her before she left but she never responded to his message.

Tarkan, who is in his early 30s and lives in Istanbul, was quizzed by Turkish police several times and has given DNA samples, 
along with 21 other people. He has denied any part in her murder.

All of those questioned have now been released, and police have also taken statements from 200 other people.

The investigation continues as 
Sierra's casket heads back to the United States on a Turkish Airlines 
flight today. Her husband, Steven, and brother, David Jimenez, also 
returned yesterday after flying to Turkey to assist with the search.

Sierra's body was 
found stashed by Istanbul's ancient city walls on Saturday, more than a 
week after she failed to catch her flight home. Police said she died 
from a blunt force trauma.

She was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was
wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a 
bracelet on, but her iPhone and iPad were missing.

Theory: Police say she may have been murdered somewhere else and her body was then dumped

Her
family, including her devastated husband Steven Sierra, have said she 
went to the country because of the photo opportunities. They say she 
used her iPad and iPhone to shoot the images.

To pay for her funeral, her family began selling some of her images online on Tuesday and soon had enough to cover her expenses.

The photos remain on sale online and any other profits will go to her two young sons, who are nine and 11, her family wrote on the website.

Photographs
on sale include images taken during her time in Istanbul and pictures 
of New York City. They are being sold as canvases, framed prints, 
greeting cards and iPhone cases for $39.95 each.

'Sarai's
passion for photography and love for capturing the beauty we see in 
culture, architecture and scenery was her reason for traveling to 
Istanbul,' her brother, David Jimenez, wrote on the site.

He added this afternoon: 'Thank you 
for all the support in purchasing Sarai's pictures. Quick update, all 
expenses for Sarai's funeral have been paid for!

'From
here on out any picture of hers that you purchase will NOT be going 
towards her funeral. All funds will be going to her children. Thank you 
for your support. David.'

Sierra's devastated husband of 14 years, 40-year-old Steven Sierra, revealed earlier this week how he is consumed 
with sadness at his wife's death.

'I'm heartbroken,' Mr Sierra told the New York Daily News, weeping. 'This is something you never want to imagine, and it's something I'd never want anyone to experience.

'You
have so many plans, so many dreams with the person you deeply love. You
look forward to many years together and there are so many things you 
haven’t fulfilled with that person, and now those won’t be fulfilled.'

His two sons, who are aged nine and 11, still do not know their mother 
is dead. Mr Sierra told the Daily News he is waiting until he returns 
home to tell the boys face-to-face.

Her mother, Betsy Jimenez, told the Today show: 'It was such a shock when we heard. She was supposed to come back and she didn't.

'Her little boys do not know, their father will talk to them once he gets back. We will all be present for this.

'It was the first time she was going overseas after getting into 
photography college. She wanted to go there and take pictures of bridges and
the history of the city.'

Sierra had left for Istanbul on January 7 to explore her photography hobby, her family said.

She
was in regular contact with friends and relatives, and had told them 
she would visit Galata Bridge, which spans Istanbul's Golden Horn 
waterway, to take photos.

CBS News reported that shortly after 
Sierra's body was discovered, a woman came forward and told police she 
had seen a white car parked near the city walls as she was driving there
the night of January 29, Anadolu reported.

The eyewitness said a man was trying to remove 'something' from the car, at which point she caught a glimpse of a woman's hand.

Last week, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the 
missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home.

Her
family last heard from her on Jan. 21, when she was supposed to start 
her journey home, but she never checked into her flight.
