A woman has been found attempting to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Zhou worked as a builder and needs to undergo surgery but doctors will not operate on him until the couple pay the 100,000 Yuan (£10,000) fee.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to see my daughter and save my husband.'

According to That's Magazines, she was also in possession of another poster that stated: 'Boss fled after industrial accident and we don't have the money for treatment. I'm willing to sell my child to save her father.'

Many locals who witnessed her in distress were sympathetic to her plight.

Although some gave her money, no-one offered to purchase her daughter in the four hours she sat in the street with the sign, the magazine reported.

Only last year were a young Chinese couple were prosecuted after allegedly having sold their baby daughter to raise money for an iPhone and other luxury goods.

The couple were accused of placing anonymous advertisements in newspapers suggesting they would be willing to part with their baby - unborn at that stage - in exchange for 50,000 Yuan (£5,000).

Police in Shanghai charged the couple with human trafficking after accepting money for the baby, who was born at home and still only weeks, or months old, when sold.

Despite claiming to have been acting in the baby's best interests, prosecutors said after having received the money, which was deposited in their bank account, the couple went out on a spending spree, using part of the proceeds to buy an iPhone.
