Mark Robson is set to join Tim Sherwood's new-look backroom team at Aston Villa after Scott Marshall left the club.

Former Norwich coach Robson is expected to become Sherwood's first-team coach at Villa Park.

Marshall left on Tuesday, following Paul Lambert out of the club after the Scot's sacking last week.

Tim Sherwood is expected to add former Norwich coach Mark Robson to his backroom staff at Villa Park 

Sherwood was announced manager at Villa Park on Saturday and took his first training session on Tuesday

Tim Sherwood took charge of an Aston Villa training session for the first time on Tuesday 

Sherwood's side are in the bottom three in the Premier League and face Stoke City on Saturday 

Sherwood was appointed on Saturday and chairman Randy Lerner watched his first training session on Tuesday.

Nothing has been confirmed with Robson yet but Sherwood is acting fast to replace Marshall, who took caretaker charge after Lambert's dismissal last week.

Robson left Norwich in November and had previously been joint head coach at Barnet with Edgar Davids.

America-based Lerner is not staying for Sherwood's first Barclays Premier League game at home to Stoke on Saturday but met the new manager at the club's Bodymoor Heath training ground after jetting in.

Lerner's chief executive Tom Fox is in charge of the day-to-day running of Villa and the owner is in constant contact despite being away from the club.

Sherwood will be desperate to get Christian Benteke back on form with Villa struggling for goals this term 

He took a hands-on approach at Bodymoor Heath with Aston Villa's future in the Premier League in doubt 

The former Spurs boss, pictured speaking to Alan Hutton, has signed a deal to manage the club until 2018 

Sherwood confirmed at his unveiling on Monday he had spoken to the chairman by phone but had not met him before penning his deal until 2018.

Sherwood watched Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup win over Leicester and gave a half-time team talk when the score was 0-0.

He takes charge with Villa third from bottom in the Barclays Premier League after Lambert was dismissed last Wednesday.

Marshall took caretaker charge, assisted by goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall and under-21 boss Gordon Cowans, and picked the team for Sunday's fifth-round win but has now departed.

Fox told the club's official site: 'I'd like to thank Scott for his efforts during his time at the football club and especially under difficult circumstances at the weekend when he took the team for Sunday's FA Cup victory over Leicester City.

'We wish him all the best in the future.'
