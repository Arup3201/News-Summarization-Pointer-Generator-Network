This is the last image of soldier Lee Rigby in his Help For Heroes top - taken just two days before his brutal murder.

Drummer Lee was a regular at the Kebab Ye takeaway in Frances Street, Woolwich, south-east London, and would visit to order food at least three times a week.

The kebab shop is less than 100 metres from the main entrance to the Woolwich barracks where the 25-year-old Fusilier was based after serving in Helmand four years ago.

Timecodes on the footage show him entering the premises at 9.23pm on Monday and leaving 12 minutes later.

The shop's owner told ITV that he knew the soldier as 'Lee' and that he was a regular customer

Yesterday, one member of staff at the
shop was red eyed and still visibly upset after the death of the young 
soldier two days ago.

Colleague Ali Ulu, 32, spoke warmly of the late Lee Rigby. He said: 'Lee was in here at least three times a week.

'He was a really regular customer and he came in at lunchtime two days before he was murdered.

'He ordered pizza and chips to take 
away. He would always stop and chat. He would talk about his young son 
and once showed us his picture. He was a really nice man and we are all 
still in a state of shock.'

Lee's image was captured on the shop's CCTV security camera and Mr Ulu added: 'He
was so well known in here that we would let him use our staff toilet 
upstairs while we prepared his food. We still cannot believe he was 
killed in such a horrible way.'

Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier

The shop's owner, Oner Arslanboga, told ITV that he knew the soldier as 'Lee' and that he was a regular customer.

He added that Lee was a 'very polite chap'.

Drummer Lee Rigby, of 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was hit by a car and then 'hacked to death' on Wednesday by two men who got out of the vehicle and attacked him with knives and meat cleavers while shouting 'Allah Akbar!' - an Islamic phrase for 'God is great'.

Lee had been off-duty at the time, and was possibly wearing the same Help For Heroes hooded top he had on in the kebab shop.

His death has sparked a public outpouring of grief, with hundreds of tributes to the father-of-one left near the scene of the crime by Woolwich Barracks.

Both the suspected killers, Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5.

They were shot by armed officers at the scene after allegedly waiting around for up to 20 minutes for police to arrive so they could attack them.

A man who was identified on internet forums as Adebolajo was filmed clutching knives and with his hands covered in blood ranting about Islam to passers-by with cameras after the incident.

The pair have been arrested and are under armed guard as they recover in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Another man and a woman, both 29, were arrested yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, after police raided a number of addresses around London, Essex and Lincolnshire.

Suspect: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death
