Judging by Britain’s dismal Eurovision performance in recent years, we’ve been holding out for a hero.

But fans hope all that could be about to change – after it was announced that Bonnie Tyler will be representing the UK in the song contest in May.

Tyler, who is best known for 1980s hits such as Total Eclipse of the Heart, It’s a Heartache and Holding Out for a Hero, has described being chosen to perform for the country as ‘an honour’.

However, the 61-year-old will be hoping to fare better than the last veteran singer who represented the UK.

Last year Engelbert Humperdinck was Britain’s entrant into the contest, held in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Despite being one of the better-known names to represent the country in recent years, the 76-year-old finished in 25th place with only 12 points.

Whether or not Tyler will achieve a better score in this year’s contest, held in Malmo, Sweden, remains to be seen.

It is widely believed  that many countries vote for each other for ‘political’ reasons rather than for the quality of their songs.

The Welsh-born singer will be performing a track called Believe in Me, written for her by Desmond Child.

Honoured: The 61-year-old singer described being chosen as 'an honour'

He has previously penned hits for chart toppers including Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams and Aerosmith.

Tyler, whose husky voice has led to her being described as ‘the female Rod Stewart’, said: ‘It is an honour to represent my country and is also a wonderful way to ensure that my song Believe in Me reaches the widest possible audience.

‘It is a very strong, catchy and melodic song that appeals to a wide range of people. Desmond Child partially wrote this song at the dinner table at his house in Nashville whilst we were all eating together.’

Tyler, who was born Gaynor Hopkins, credits her remarkably youthful looks to Botox injections, which she has had twice a year for 15 years.

Last year she also showed off her slimmer figure after losing more than a stone and half in three months.

And despite her last big hit in the UK being almost 30 years ago, Tyler has enjoyed continued success on the continent and hopes this will help her in the competition.

She said: ‘I do believe that God blessed me in life with a wonderful family, a successful career and a loving marriage, and remain thankful for that blessing.’

Describing almost four decades of marriage to property developer Robert Sullivan, she added: ‘It’s simple, we still love each other.’
