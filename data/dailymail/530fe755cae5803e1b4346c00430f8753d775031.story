After selling her luxury beachside home in Sydney's eastern beaches for $3,010,000 in March, one homeowner has decided to sell-off all the trimmings that made her home unique.

Having sold the property so she could downsize to an inner Sydney unit, jeweller Irene Byrne has enticed auction hunters - with items going under the hammer ranging from quirky furniture pieces to a grand piano.

Ms Byrne has removed all her personal items, photographs and clothing - wanting everything she left behind sold at the auction this Sunday.

Bargains galore: After selling her home for more than $3 million in March, Sydney-based jeweller Irene Byrne is selling all the trimmings that made her home unique

Lounging about: All the remaining furnishings from the Maroubra home will be up for auction on Sunday, including sofas and homewares

The auction, to be conducted by Lawsons Auctioneers, will commence on Sunday 1 June at Ms Byrne's former home in Maroubra.

Lawsons Auctioneers business manager Shauna Farren-Price is promising lots of variety for auction punters, 'from affordable pieces to some ranging in the thousands.'

'Irene is a jeweller by trade, therefore there's a good 40 or so lots of really beautiful custom pieces,' Ms Farren-Price said.

Among the 400 lots going under the hammer are Australian and international contemporary art, candelabras, Persian rugs, glassware, crockery, leather sofas and even an ebonised grand piano.

Better view than being at the beach: Why bother going to the beach to sunbathe when the views are so spectacular from this home.

For those looking to feel the wind through their hair as they drive away from the beachside auction, a red 1965 Mercedes Benz 220SE W111 convertible with tan leather interior will be available - but those interested should be prepared to pay, with the vehicle estimated to be worth up to $80,000.

'There's lots of quirky 1980s furniture - which may or may not come back in fashion soon, hopefully by Saturday they will,' Ms Farren-Price said.

There is also 900mL of Chanel No. 5, in it's original packaging, which Ms Farren-Price believes will go for a good price, to those interested.

Of the items available, Ms Farren-Price admits her favourite is the grand piano.

'Buying second-hand is becoming really trendy,' Ms Farren-Price admits.

'I love the fact that all this stuff we see everyday gives people pleasure.'

Lawsons Auctioneers is promising plenty of variety in the pieces for sale and note it will be 'fair game for everyone.'
