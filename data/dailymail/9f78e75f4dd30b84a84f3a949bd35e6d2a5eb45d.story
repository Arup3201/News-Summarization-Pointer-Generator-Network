A bride and groom have been forced to cancel their wedding after a fire ripped through the 11th century church where they planned to marry - just two days before the ceremony.

Alicia Hardy, 46, said it had been a 'no-brainer' to pick St Peter's Church in her home village of Ropley, near Winchester, as the place to marry her 45-year-old fiancé Darren Bunce.

But now the solicitor fears she might have to get married 'in a field' after the historic church, which has stood at the centre of the village for 800 years, was destroyed by a 'catastrophic' fire.

The historic church of St Peter's in Ropley, near Winchester in Hampshire, was partially destroyed by fire today. The fire broke out just after residents reported a power surge in their homes

Alicia Hardy, 46, who has lived in the village for 16 years, planned to 
marry Darren Bunce, 45, in the church on Saturday but now say they might
 have to get married in a field

The 14th century bell tower and the tiled roof were destroyed after flames ripped through the imposing Norman structure, just moments after nearby 
residents reported power surges in their homes.

Miss Hardy said: 'We’re all just so shocked. It’s a real tragedy for the village. The church is ancient and is in the centre of the village.

'We chose the church the day we got 
engaged, on Christmas Day. It was a no-brainer. I don’t think we ever 
thought of anywhere else.

'I’ve
 lived here for 16 years and my fiance was born and raised in the area 
and we have done family weddings, christenings and funerals at the 
church.'

But now the bride-to-be has begun sending messages and making phone calls, to spread the word about the change of plan to the couple's 132 guests. 

She was due to collect her 
brother, who was flying in from Colorado, today while another brother was 
expected in from Australia.

The historic church, parts of which date back to the 11th century, has stood at the centre of the village for more than 800 years

Flames were seen coming out of the church's roof and during the worst 
part of the fire, black smoke could be seen half a mile away on the A31 
Alresford bypass.

She said: 'We’re meant to be having the 
wedding rehearsal today. I haven’t spoken to the vicar as he’s
 pretty preoccupied.

'We will get married somewhere on Saturday. That’s all I know. If
 the worst comes to the worst we would just do everything but the 
marriage, or get married somewhere in a field, and formalise the 
marriage later.

'We haven’t got an alternative. We’ve just said it won’t be St Peter’s in Ropley. At least it’s not tomorrow or Saturday and nobody died. That’s one way to look at things.'

Around 80 firefighters and 12 fire 
engines were called to the medieval church in a bid to save it from 
the blaze.

thought of anywhere else'

Miss Hardy said: 'I got a call at about 9.30am from somebody in the village, saying her husband had seen the church on fire.

'Then
 I got a stream of texts and phone calls. I haven’t seen it myself. I 
was just about to go up there. I’ve just seen pictures taken by someone 
else.'

Whatever they do, the couple say they will still go on a brief honeymoon to West Wittering, in West Sussex, for a few days.

The
 couple’s four children - Amy Webb, 20, Louise Hardy, 12, Ben Hardy, 15 and Kieran Webb, 23 - will be their 
bridesmaids and ushers.

But the fire has caused long-term devastation in the village.

Reverend
 Royston Such, who has been the vicar of St Peter’s for 24 years, said it was 'catastrophic' to see the flames destroy the historic 
landmark.

Although most of the exterior was renovated in 1896, and now consists of flint walls, the church's nave and transepts date back as far as the 11th century.

Around 80 firefighters spent the day tackling the fire, after a 100metre square area of the roof caught fire

He said: 'It’s 
absolutely devastating. The building has so many memories attached to 
it, we have a book called ‘A Years Mind’ which we use to commemorate 
people who have died in the village.

'It’s not just my church, it’s everybody’s church. It hasn’t sunk in, and it doesn’t feel real. It’s utterly catastrophic.

'Although we have 
tragically lost our church building, the real value of a church is its 
congregation and community and these, thank God, are all safe.'

Villager Terry Neilson saw the fire unfold. He said: 'I came up to get a paper this morning and saw smoke, so wandered down out of curiosity and saw this.

Revered Royston Such, who watched on as the fire ravaged the historic church, said the fire was 'utterly catastrophic' but was thankful that the congregation was safe

The 14th century bell tower and the roof of the Grade II-listed property have been destroyed in the fire

'The church has been at the heart of the village for 800 years. Hopefully the stone will be saved.'

The church is yards from Ropley Primary School, from where pupils were collected early after the fire broke out.

Maria
 Burr, an administrator at the school, said: 'The children and 
the school are in no danger at all but we have very close links with the
 church - Reverend Sutch comes in to school regularly.

'It is pretty dramatic unfortunately, it seems the bell tower and roof are completely destroyed. It is just such a shame.'

A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It’s a substantial fire and a 10 metre by 10 metre part of the roof was well alight when our teams arrived.

'Crews from stations around the county including Basingstoke, Alresford, Eastleigh and Portchester are tackling the blaze.

'It is the roof and bell tower, which are both 100 per cent alight in the fire.'

Steve
 Foye, area manager for the fire service, said: 'This 
was a significant fire that has seriously affected a prominent building 
within the village.

'Crews have worked hard in arduous conditions to 
bring the fire under control.

'We
 are still working with partner agencies to bring this incident to a 
close. We would like to thank the local community for their support 
during this time.'

Investigations as to what caused the fire are underway.
