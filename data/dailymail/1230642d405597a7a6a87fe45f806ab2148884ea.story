Chelsea youngster Ruben Loftus-Cheek would be playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League if his side weren't under pressure in a title race situation, according to manager Jose Mourinho.

Loftus-Cheek was on the bench for Chelsea's 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday and is now a full-time member of Mourinho's first-team squad having made substitute appearances against Sporting Lisbon and Manchester City this season.

And Mourinho believes the 19-year-old midfielder is ready to play in the first team at Chelsea, although he is yet to start a game even in the absence of Nemanja Matic or John Obi Mikel.

'I had Ruben Loftus-Cheek on the bench and I have to say that, in my opinion, next year, this kid will be a big surprise in the Premier League,' Mourinho said after the win over West Ham.

'This season, if I was not playing for the title and if we were not playing with the pressure we have when you are playing for the title, this kid would already be on the pitch.

'But it's step-by-step and today  was again a day for (Kurt) Zouma to help John (Terry) and (Gary) Cahill in a game when (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia are very difficult opponents.'

Loftus-Cheek could even see more game-time before the end of the season, with Mourinho likely to rest players for a potential Champions League bid if Chelsea wrap up the title early enough. 

The youngster has already been earmarked as a future England international by Mourinho and previously attracted the interest of Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona.
