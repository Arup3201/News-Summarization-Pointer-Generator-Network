The rising generation, which is known as Generation Z, wants more healthy and fresh ingredients than the older portion of the population ever did.

According to a new report by market research group NPD, the youngest generation of consumers - which includes everyone up to the age of 23 - is more inclined to eat fresh greens and home-cooked meals than their predecessors, Generations Y and X.

This signals an overall trend toward healthier eating, says the report.

Generation salad: According to a new report by NPD market research group, Generation Z (everyone up to age 23) is more inclined to eat fresh ingredients and home-cooked meals than their predecessors

Fresh food
 consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next 
five years, due to the eating habits of Generation Z, with salad 
consumption in particular on the rise.

Also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and 'better-for-you' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars, as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking.

Indeed, Generation Z exhibits a tendency to use stove tops instead of microwaves for preparing meals.

This is in contrast to Gen X consumers (considered as everyone between the ages of 38 and 48), who are more focused on convenience and therefore more likely to prepare microwaveable foods.

In fact, the rising generation tends to spend more time in general in the kitchen, meaning home-made breakfasts like omelets and French toast are set to overtake packaged cereals and oatmeal.

Involved: Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, says Gen Z 'wants to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project'

Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, pointed out on his blog that it may seem counter-intuitive that the younger generation - which is typically time-pressed - is spending more time in the kitchen.

But he explains the logic behind it, writing: 'There seems to be a need to have their say or approval on the final product.

'It's almost as if they want to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project.'

Changing habits: Fresh food consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next five years, and the consumption of convenient microwaveable meals will decrease

He added that younger consumers are increasingly using additives - i.e. putting fruits or syrups on their foods - for the same reason, to feel more involved in the overall process.

Judging by growing food trends, having what is typically considered a side dish as a main meal is another eating habit that will continue to become more popular.

And with Hispanics making up a large percentage of Millennials as well as Gen Z, the NPD group expects the consumption of Latino foods to grow by seven per cent in the next five years.
