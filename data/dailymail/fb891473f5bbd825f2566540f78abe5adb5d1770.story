This CCTV footage shows the terrifying moment three masked men, armed with a machete and a hammer, robbed a branch of Subway.

After threatening a female employee, the trio made off with around £300 from the sandwich shop shortly before closing time.

One of the men, wearing a Scream-style mask, stayed on the door of the shop, in Clayton, Manchester, while the other two men, who were armed, ran inside.

Terrifying: A Subway worker was threatened with a machete as the store was raided by three masked men

While the hammer-wielding thief jumped over the counter, the man with the machete ran into the staff area.

The pair then surrounded a 25-year-old worker and demanded she give them cash or they would hurt her. One of the men lifted the machete above his head in a threatening manner.

The gang stole from the cash register before running out of the shop.

There were no customers inside at the time of the incident and the woman was not injured.

The man carrying the wooden-handled machete was medium build and around 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in. He was wearing a black balaclava, had dark eyes and spoke with a local accent.

He was wearing a navy tracksuit with blue Nike tracksuit bottoms and trainers and wore black woollen gloves.

The man carrying the hammer was scrawny, around 5ft 6in and believed to be 18 to 22-years-old. He was wearing a black balaclava and was possibly white with brown eyes.

He wore a navy blue tracksuit top, navy blue tracksuit bottoms and black woollen gloves.

The man by the door is described as wearing a Scream-style mask, dark clothing with the hood pulled up and was around 6ft and skinny.

The incident happened on Tuesday, November 5.

Det Con Dave Berry said: 'Unless anyone has been in a similar situation themselves, I don't think we can appreciate just how scared this woman must have been to have a machete threatened at her in this way by a man in a mask - and all just for a few notes from a till.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police at Central Park on 0161 856 4288 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
