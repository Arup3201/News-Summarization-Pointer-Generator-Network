The villagers who spent 1,088 days on a round-the-clock vigil to evict travellers from an illegal camp today marked their victory by dismantling their protest tent.

At least 40 residents in the Warwickshire village of Meriden have kept constant watch over the encampment, just yards from their front doors, since April 2010.

On Sunday the final group of travellers moved their caravans off eight-acres of greenbelt land, following a three-year legal battle.

Victory: The nearly 40 Meriden residents gather at the tent, where they have held a 24-hour vigil for the past three years, following their victory against the illegal travellers camp

Today the residents celebrated by dismounting their own camp, pausing to hold a minute of silence in memory of four villagers who passed away during the three-year protest.

Campaigners Mary Griffiths, 56, Barry Pointon, 74, Jim Charlesworth, 89, and Roy Kedward, 64, were never given the opportunity to see the victorious day, and were honoured by their fellow protesters.

Mrs Griffiths’ widower David, 62, whose wife died of bone cancer in 2011, said: ‘She supported every one of these campaigners and would love to have seen this.

‘Like everyone else she adored Meriden, and did everything she could to save it.’

Dave McGrath, 53, chairman of RAID, 
Residents Against Inappropriate Development which raised £87,000 locally
to fund a legal fighting fund, said: ‘What this community have achieved
is incredible.

Applause: The protest has been ongoing since the group of travellers first moved to the greenbelt land in the village in April 2010

All gone: The last protest signs and remnants of 'RAID's vigil tent is dismantled and taken away

He added: ‘All of us here have our own lives to lead, but we still gave it everything to protect this beautiful part of British countryside.

‘It’s been a long tough fight, and we have seen so many setbacks, but this is what happens when you refuse to give up on something you believe in.

‘These guys were an affront to the travelling community. They said on one occasion they were going to kill me, and they threatened to burn peoples’ houses down.

‘I’m not talking about kids either, these were fully grown men behaving this way.’

The landowner, Noah Burton, who bought
the protected land for £100,000 from a farmer, planned to build park 
homes on the site that he could sell off.

He
has been acting as a spokesman for the travellers throughout the 
dispute and said yesterday there were no winners in this battle.

Barren land: An aerial shot of the village and the nearby field, which was turned into an illegal camp site, taken Monday shows the damage done by the travellers

In recovery: The travellers who lived on the site have been given one month to restore the land to its former green glory

Disarray: The travellers, the last of whom left on Sunday, have all but destroyed the greenbelt land in the Warwickshire village where they camped illegally for three years

Destruction: The plots used for the travellers caravans can still be seen on the field as well as mounds of ashes where they set fire to debris and a caravan before they left the site

Damage: The field, which has been occupied by travellers since April 2010, was left torn up by vehicles

Mr Burton said: ‘We have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there.

'This was never about green belt land, it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps, they told me that many times.'

He added: 'I can't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already.’

West Midlands MEP Nikki Sinclaire, who
has supported the community throughout their struggle, said: ‘When I 
first heard about this three years ago I saw a village in dismay, the 
people were terrified about what was going to happen to this beautiful 
part of the country.

‘I am thrilled these people have won, it just shows what you can do doesn’t it.’

In a final act of defiance, the travellers torched a caravan and left it burning at the entrance of the site before it was put out by firefighters on Sunday afternoon.

Mavis Lapworth, 74, a retired bed and breakfast owner, who has lived in the village 17 years, said: ‘We are all delighted it’s over. This community is closer now than it ever has been before, and long may that continue.

‘The gypsies were rude, abusive and showed us no respect at all.

‘I have nothing against travellers, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy protected land.

Jo Hipwood, 71, a retired caterer, 
said: ‘I feel quite emotional really. To see all our hard work pay off, 
and all these lovely people get what they deserve.

‘This is one of the most beautiful parts of England, and I’m delighted we have it back.’

The travellers now have one month to restore the site, or will face prosecution.

Doug
Bacon, 46, a semi-retired press controller, who is vice chairman of 
RAID, said: ‘The fight isn’t completely over because we need to ensure 
they restore this site.

‘But we will without a doubt make sure they do that.

‘They’ve cut down loads of trees here and damaged the field a ridiculous amount, so they have a lot of planting to do.

‘At least they are gone now though, so we have a lot to celebrate.’

The travellers are thought to have moved on to a site in Kettering, North Hampshire .
