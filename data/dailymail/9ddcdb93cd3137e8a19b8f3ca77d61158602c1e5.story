A pledge to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax is to be revived by the Conservatives in their general election manifesto.

Official forecasts suggest the number of families paying death duties will double over the next five years unless the current threshold of £325,000 is raised.

Leaked Government documents suggest that the majority of estates currently liable would be lifted out of tax under plans drawn up for the Tories.

The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Lib Dems

The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Liberal Democrats.

The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election, prompting the Labour government to allow married couples effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000.

The Chancellor's plan to raise it further was killed off by the coalition with the Lib Dems, who insisted that raising the personal income tax allowance should take priority.

David Cameron believes families who do not feel 'in any way mega-rich' are being dragged into the tax bracket, according to Government sources.

One option is to create a new tax free band worth £175,000 per person on a family home, that could be transferred between married couples, making it worth a maximum of £350,000. 

The leaked documents show that by adding the existing maximum combined allowance for couples of £650,000 to the new maximum relief of £350,000, properties up to £1million would escape inheritance tax.

The paper, written by officials for the Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke, notes the scheme will be 'very popular with the public'.

'It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances,' the paper states.

'This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house, particularly in London and the South East, paying inheritance tax.'

It estimates that by 2019-20, around 20,000 fewer estates a year would be liable for any inheritance tax.

Critics of the duty say that money bequeathed at death has already been taxed, so should not face further charges.

They also point out that the super-rich often employ accountants to devise trusts and exemptions to reduce their liability.

The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Tory plan was 'very cynical'.

'If taxes can be cut – and it's very difficult within the present budget constraint – we've got to start at the bottom with people on low pay, not at the top,' he said.

A revival of the inheritance tax pledge would be another pitch to the 'grey vote' that could prove crucial in May's election.

The policy was credited with a surge in support for the Conservatives in 2007, which helped scare Gordon Brown into abandoning plans for a snap election. 

Experts pointed out that the Treasury has suggested the inheritance tax threshold will remain frozen until 2017-18 to help pay for the introduction of a new cap on the cost of social care.

By the following year, it is forecast to be worth almost £6billion a year to the Exchequer.

Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Building up a legacy for children and grandchildren is one of the reasons hard-working parents go into work every day, and it's immoral for the taxman to take that away especially after the deceased has paid taxes all their lives.'
