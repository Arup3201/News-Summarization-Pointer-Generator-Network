Pakistan has threatened to ban Google from the country over an ongoing row about 'blasphemous' content on YouTube.

The new Minister for IT and Telecommunications Anusha Rahman said unless YouTube, which is owned by Google, complies in removing clips that are deemed anti-Islamic it will block access to the search engine.

The video sharing website has been banned in Pakistan for nine months after bosses at the internet giant refused to remove a trailer for low-budget film The Innocence of Muslims.

IT Minister Anusha Rahman said it wants Google to set restrictions on YouTube before Pakistan unblocks YouTube which was banned after worldwide protests against anti-Islamic film that was uploaded on website

The controversial American-made film sparked worldwide protests last year amid fury at the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.

The
film, created by an Egyptian-born Christian who is now a U.S. citizen, 
depicts the prophet, a central figure to Islam, as a religious fraud, 
womaniser and paedophile.

Ms
Rahman said one of the new Government's top priorities is to restore 
YouTube but said it will not do so unless blasphemous and pornographic 
content is banned.

She told Pakistan's The News: 'It’s our job to ensure re-opening of YouTube as soon as possible with thorough screening of objectionable material.

'We
will pump in extra money if needed and do whatever is in our capacity 
to bring YouTube back to Pakistan without compromising our ethical 
values.'

Mrs Rahman threatened to ban Google from Pakistan if it does not comply with their filter request

Ms Rahman warned 
that if Google refused to comply, as the internet giant did to similar 
requests from the previous government, then they would ban the search 
engine as 'a last resort'.

She
said: 'It all depends on our negotiation clout. If they persisted with 
their stance we can block Google in Pakistan as a last resort as there 
are many alternative search engines available on the web', according to 
The News.

She said her ministry is due to start work on a web filter to block blasphemous and pornographic material.

Ms Rahman added that they would not unblock the website without the measures to avoid the 'embarrassment' of having to ban it again if more protests ensued.

The film sparked protests across the Muslim world in September. Pictured, a protester throws a tear gas canister during clashes near the U.S. embassy, near Tahrir Square in Cairo on September 13

Thousands of Muslims also marched in London. About 50 people were killed in the worldwide protests

In September, more than 50 people were killed in protests against The Innocence of Muslims that spread across 20 countries.

Google, declined requests to remove 
the video from the website last year, but restricted access to it in 
certain countries, including Egypt, Libya and Indonesia, because it said
the video broke laws in those countries.

At the height of the protests in September, YouTube was blocked in several countries, including Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Saudi
Arabia's King Abdullah issued an order blocking all websites with 
access to the anti-Islam film in the conservative kingdom.
