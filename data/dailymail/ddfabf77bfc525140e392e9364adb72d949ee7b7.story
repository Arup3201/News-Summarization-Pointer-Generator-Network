A dog shot and left to die in a crate in the Colorado Desert in California was saved after emergency surgery in which vets removed part of her lung.

Lab-pitbull cross Shadow was found abandoned with another dog that had died and frozen solid overnight.

The animals were surrounded by gun cartridges.

Two-year-old Shadow was rescued by Zach Skow - director of Marley's Mutts Dog Rescue – who rehabilitated her and rehomed her with Robbie Miller, who had just been released from 12 years in prison.

The 34-year-old former gang-member's life was transformed when he adopted two-year-old Shadow - who helped him adapt to life in the real world.

After a few weeks of blissful bonding between Mr Miller and Shadow, however, she began to cough up blood.

Mr Miller sent Shadow to the hospital for x-rays and blood work which revealed that she had been shot and had a bullet lodged in her chest.

Mr Miller was absolutely devastated that Shadow was sick and was prepared to do whatever it took to make her well again.

Mr Miller said: ‘When I got out of prison, my social skills were terrible - I knew that people would judge me for the bad things I'd done in my past, but that a dog wouldn't care.

‘She is the love of my life and it would be unbearable to be without her.’

Expenses paid: Shadow's surgery cost $15,000 but the cost was covered by donations that came in from around the world

The dog rescue team located a hospital that was primed to deal with the incredibly expensive kind of emergency surgery Shadow would inevitably need.

Just out of prison - Mr Miller didn't have the funds for such an expensive operation - but a fund-raising page was set up and generous pledges from across the globe started pouring in.

At an animal hospital in west Los Angeles, a surgeon removed a 40-caliber bullet from Shadow's body, along with a portion of her lung.

Against all odds, including a severe bleed during surgery, Shadow survived and Mr Miller spent all his time by her bed-side.

The imaging, 24/7 care, specialist consultation, medications and surgery cost nearly $15,000, - raised through the incredible generosity of strangers captivated by the pair’s heart-wrenching story.

Mr Miller said: ‘In prison, if you show your feelings, people will prey on you.

‘But Shadow has taught me that love conquers all, and she has broken my walls down so that I can feel a kind of love I never knew before.

‘She is the love of my life, and I know that with her by my side, I can be a good person and do good things in this world.’
