A scrap metal dealer bought memorial plaques stolen from cemeteries and cut them up in to small pieces of valuable metals to sell on.

Joseph Collier, 72, from Dulwich, was found guilty on Wednesday of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries  after a six-day trial at Croydon Crown Court.

Some of the plaques were still screwed to the stakes used to plant them at cemeteries across south London including Croydon, Teddington, Putney Vale and Beckenham.

In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours piecing them back together

And footage shown to the jury during Collier's trial showed some of the plaques were still caked with fresh mud and grass.

Police raided Collier's DSM Scrap Metal Yard in Croydon in May 2012 as part of a London-wide crackdown on metal theft. 

During the raid, they found boxes and bags containing hundreds of metal memorial plaques, as well as a stolen bronze dragon and a statue of Jesus.  

Many of the plaques had been cut up into small pieces in an attempt to disguise them. 

In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours  piecing them back together.

Collier was arrested and charged with offences the following day and was bailed pending his court appearance.

But in March 2013, suspicious that Collier was continuing to receive stolen goods, police contacted UK Power Networks, who assisted them with an undercover operation where an officer sold brand-new copper wiring to him, making it obvious to Collier that the goods were stolen as he was accepting it.

Sergeant George Shannon, of Croydon police station said: 'I can only describe Collier's attitude throughout this whole process as brazen.

'He tried to deny any knowledge of receiving stolen items, but some of the memorial plaques even had the mud and wall plugs attached where they'd been prized from the graves.

'There was little doubt that he knew they were stolen and he had absolutely no regard for the law.

Collier used this machine at his scrap yard in Croydon to cut the plaques into the box below

'His actions, in accepting stolen metal, have fuelled other criminal activity by thieves stealing metal to make a quick profit by selling it to unscrupulous scrap dealers like Collier.

'Metal theft has a huge impact on society - be it through delays on train networks where cabling has been stolen, or the emotional effects associated with the theft of memorial plaques.

'The majority of registered scrap metal dealers are operating correctly, but we will continue to target those who don't and will bring the full force of the law against them.

'Now that he's been found guilty of these offences, we will certainly be considering further action against Collier under the Proceeds of Crime Act to look at confiscating any assets he has gained through his criminal activity.'

Collier was found guilty  of three counts of possession of criminal property, one count of disguising criminal property and one count of attempting to receive stolen goods at Croydon Crown Court.

He will be sentenced on November 3.
