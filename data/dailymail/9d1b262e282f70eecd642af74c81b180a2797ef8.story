The school holidays are coming to an end, and what better way to dust off the mental cobwebs by pitting your brain against some seriously tough (and incredibly fun) tests.

Enter Mensa Academy - out on the Wii and 3DS. This clever game offers up hundreds of different ways to kick start your thinking just before getting back to school.

Vibrant: Games are fun, varied and easy to use, so it's great for all ages

Numeracy, literacy, memory - they're all tested by questions endorsed by the Mensa team.

And developers Square Enix have done their best to make the challenges look as inviting as possible.

They’re packed full of colourful characters, and there’s a general ‘scrapbook’ feel about the presentation which stops it feeling like an exam.

But, is it any good? Well, as my school days have been over for a while, I enlisted the help of two bright young gamers to put it through its paces.

Over to you, Verity and Sophie Hunn. (aged 14 and 11). This is what they had to say:

This is a good fun, easy-to-use game. The instructions are clear and easy to understand, which for my younger sister was essential.

Touch of genius: Some of the tasks are pretty tough, so you'll need to stay alert!

The games are all really fun and we liked that you could be a solo player,  where you play individually, and party mode where you can have up to four players.

We would improve it by adding more instructions to the test section, but the rest of the instructions throughout the test section are perfect.

Overall, a very fun game with an educational twist.

I couldn't have put it better myself...
