Derek Burt had seen the ad just weeks before his wife Angela had a heart attack

When Derek Burt’s alarm went off one chilly morning this February, it wasn’t just to rouse him for work.

The impeccably timed alarm also saved his partner Angela’s life.

She was having a heart attack and were it not for a TV advert he’d seen a few weeks previously, she wouldn’t be alive today.

Mr Burt had seen ad starring Vinnie Jones, telling members of the 
public how best to resuscitate a cardiac arrest victim.

Produced by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), it recommends people hum Stayin’ Alive and pump the patient’s chest to the 
beat – around 100 to 120 times a minute. 

The clip shows Jones, reprising his 
Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels gangster persona, demonstrating the 
technique on a ‘geezer’ who has collapsed in an empty warehouse, while 
the Bee Gees’ 1970s hit plays in the background.

The online training film since clocked up 2.4 million views and the charity has been flooded with 
amazing stories of survival.

Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical 
Director at the British Heart Foundation said: ‘The great thing about 
Hands-only CPR is you don’t need any special skills or to remember how 
to do the kiss of life.

'It’s simple, you can’t do any harm and you may 
well save a life.  We know of at least 28 people who are alive today 
simply because the person standing next to them when they collapsed did 
what Vinnie told them to do in our advert.'

The
new guidelines were unveiled at the beginning of the year after experts
found that giving mouth-to-mouth is often ineffective if performed by 
an untrained member of the public. It also gets in the way of the 
crucial chest compressions need to keep the victim’s heart beating.

And according to the charity, the 
sheer thought of having to blow into someone’s mouth puts many of us off
from even attempting resuscitation.

Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 
as it is officially known, is given to patients who have suffered a 
cardiac arrest – when their heart stops pumping blood around the body.

The new guidelines state that people 
should ignore the breaths and give constant chest compressions 5-6cm 
deep (2 inches), just between the nipples, at the rate of 100 to 120 a 
minute.

The breaths of air, or rescue breaths, are meant to fill the patients’ lungs with oxygen – so you effectively breathe for them.

The BHF says that patients should have
enough oxygen into their body to survive until help arrives so it is 
more essential that helpers concentrate on the compressions to pump 
blood round the body. 

Official figures show that survival 
rates for cardiac arrests are very low. Some 30,000 people suffer from 
one outside hospital every year and only 10 per cent will recover and be
discharged from hospital.

Mrs Burt, 43, had no history of heart problems before the episode in February.

And Mr Burt, 49, a joiner, had no idea anything was wrong until he woke and heard her making a strange coughing sound. 

He told MailOnline: ‘I thought something didn’t sound right so I put the light on. I could see 
her eyes were open, her mouth was open but she wasn’t breathing. I got 
her off the bed and onto the floor and the first thing I thought of was 
the Vinnie Jones ad.’

Mr Burt had seen the advert starring 
Vinnie Jones on the TV a few weeks earlier. ‘I remember it being a good 
ad and I only watched it and paid attention because it had him in it. 
Had it been a doctor in a white coat I wouldn’t have paid so much 
attention. I certainly never dreamt I’d have to use it a few months 
later.'

He added: 'What was miraculous – but also 
terrifying – was the timing. If she hadn’t coughed at the time my alarm 
went off I might never have spotted she was in trouble.

'Normally we 
don’t speak in the morning because I get up so early and she’s still 
sleeping. If I hadn’t spotted her, then the kids would have found her 
when it was too late. The timing was sheer luck.'

Mr Jones explains how members of the public should call 999 before checking if the collapsed person in breathing. Then chest compressions should be performed to the beat of Stayin Alive

He got Angela on to the floor and 
started chest compressions. ‘I kept doing CPR for five minutes and 
phoned for an ambulance. They told me to carry on while they were on 
their way. Slowly I could see the colour returning to Angela’s cheeks, 
so I knew it must be doing something right.'

Angela arrested again after paramedics
arrived and was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with an 
irregular heartbeat and received an implantable pacemaker and 
defibrillator.

When she was discharged from hospital 
two weeks later, on Valentine’s day, Mr Burt proposed.  He said: ‘After 
everything that had happened, it seemed like the right thing to do.’ The couple, who live in Edinburgh, married last month.

He added:  ‘Angela still can’t believe
it. She went to bed feeling fine and woke up in hospital. She obviously
doesn’t remember anything about what happened that day.'

Mrs Burt, who works as a carer, said 
the couple had thought about playing the Bee Gees song at their wedding, 
but had decided against it.

She said: ‘I just feel so incredibly lucky that Derek saw the ad.’

The BHF says if survival rates from cardiac arrest are to improve then more bystanders need to help by doing CPR.

The charity is now bringing back the 
popular Vinnie Jones advert and releasing a new training film, starring 
Mini Vinnie (see below), to help promote hands-only CPR among the next generation of
life-savers.

Vinnie Jones added: ‘Dozens of Brits 
are alive today because of hands-only CPR – and that’s only the people 
we know about. But still not enough of us survive a cardiac arrest and 
it’s seriously important that everyone knows hard and fast chest 
compressions to the beat of the Stayin’ Alive by the Bee Gees can be the
difference between life and death.

'Whatever you do, tell your family and mates about Hands-only CPR. It could turn out to be a life-saving decision.'
