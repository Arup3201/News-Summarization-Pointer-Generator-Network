Police have seized a painting of Russia's president Vladamir Putin wearing women's underwear from a gallery, saying the satirical display had broken the law.

The painting entitled 'Travesty' by Konstantin Altunin, shows President Putin wearing a tight-fitting slip and brushing the hair of 
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who is wearing knickers and a bra.

Police swooped on the Muzei Vlasti (Museum of Authorities) in St. Petersburg on the night of August 26 confiscating several art installations, including 'Travesty' which are to be checked for extremist propaganda.

Banned: The picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin brushing the hair of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev which was seized from a St. Petersburg gallery

A picture of the leader of the 
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, with his torso covered in 
tattoos, and two others poking fun at lawmakers who have backed 
legislation banning so-called gay propaganda, were also confiscated, 
gallery staff said.

The
 police service said it had taken paintings from the 
gallery - based in two rooms of a flat - late on Monday after receiving 
reports they were illegal.

It gave no further detail but Russia does have a law against insulting authorities - an offence that carries a maximum one-year prison term.

St Petersburg deputy Vitaly Mironov, 
whose face was combined with the gay rights movement's rainbow flag in 
one of the paintings, told Reuters the images were inappropriate and 'of
 a distinctly pornographic character'.

Gallery owner Alexander Donskoy said the
 officers had also shut down his establishment and gave him no 
explanation for the removal of paintings from the exhibition, titled 
'Leaders'.

'This is an 
(illegal) seizure,' he said. 'We have been given no formal 
documents banning us from operating and no receipt confirming our petty 
cash was seized.' 

St Petersburg, which next week hosts 
world leaders at a G20 summit, was one of the first Russian cities to 
introduce a law banning the spread of 'gay propaganda' and making it a crime 'to spread information about non-traditional sexual
 behavior' to those under 18.

In June President Vladimir Putin 
signed legislation, giving the national government the authority to 
detain gay or 'pro-gay' foreigners for up to 14 days, and then to expel 
them from the country.

Four 
Dutch tourists were the first to be arrested under the statute in 
mid-July, although they were later released without being criminally 
charged.

The move has sparked a storm of protest 
with many campaigners calling for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics 
which are due to take place in the resort town of Sochi.
