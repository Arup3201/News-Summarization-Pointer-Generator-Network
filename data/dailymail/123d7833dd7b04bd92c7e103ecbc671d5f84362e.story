The mother of a 13-year-old boy told how he scrubbed himself in the shower for weeks after he had sex at a swingers' party.

And she criticised the justice system after three of four defendants were cleared at Swansea Crown Court of inciting him to engage in sexual activity.

She said the verdicts had shocked the family. The mother, who can't be named for legal reasons, said: 'I can't really put into words how I feel.

Iwan Walker, 24, Saron, Llandysul, pictured here outside Swansea Crown Court on April 2, 2013, was the only one of the four to be jailed. He received four years after the jury accepted he knew the boy was only 13

'I've always had faith in the justice system, but not now. I don't feel the jury made the right decision.

'I'm fuming. I don't think anyone realises how it has affected my son or even how it is still affecting him. He's not taken it very well.

'He was scrubbing himself in the shower for weeks and weeks afterwards. All hours of the day he would be scrubbing himself with boiling hot water.

'I cannot believe that anyone thought he looked over 16. He did not look over 16 when this happened two and a half years ago."

Iwan Walker, 24, of Saron, Llandysul, was the only one of the four defendants to be found guilty. The jury accepted that he knew the boy's real age.

Walker was found guilty of inciting the boy to have sex with Emmanie Louise Angela Hughes, 31, of Wind Street, Llandysul and was jailed for four years.

The boy's mother said she blamed Walker for what happened.

The mother said she wanted people to know that despite Hughes, Brian James Ecclestone, 32, of Wind Street, Llandysul, and Peter Sweetman, also 32, of Cawdor Terrace, Newcastle Emlyn, west Wales being cleared, they had all admitted that Hughes and the youngster had sex and the two other men had been present.

And she added: 'To be fair to the judge, he made the point that people shouldn't think this sort of thing can just happen to girls.

'I was a bit naive about it as well, but this can happen to boys as well.
