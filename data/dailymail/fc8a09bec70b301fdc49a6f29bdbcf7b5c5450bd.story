The Premier League may give up yet more of their traditional Saturday 3pm kick-offs to satisfy bidders in the next TV rights tender.

They will want to keep both Sky and BT happy with the next three-year agreement from the 2016-17 season, with the packages on offer expected to be launched around the new year.

BT Sport, who have taken the Champions League from Sky, will want at least three packages out of the current seven, and Sky cannot afford to lose any Premier League football.

So one option being looked at by the league and mooted in ongoing talks with broadcast partners is increasing the number of live matches to be sold. That went up from 138 to 154 in the last auction but is still less than half the 380 games in a PL season.

An extra Sunday night slot — like Spain’s La Liga — could be shoehorned into the TV schedule to give BT the opportunity to screen more games, while Sky would at least retain their current share.

BT chief executive Gavin Patterson has made no secret of their support for this option, saying: ‘It is a very interesting point. If there were more games available we would be very interested.’

There is continued upset among football agents about the FA allowing David Beckham’s former personal manager Terry Byrne to oversee the 1966 agency which represents England players’ commercial interests while also setting up management company Ten10. 

The middle men are threatening to turn up at FA sponsors’ events organised by 1966 to ensure players are not approached to join Ten10, who have signed Jack Wilshere as their first client.

Sir Alex Ferguson is taking no chances with facing difficult questions while promoting the paperback edition of his autobiography. The first interview was with club channel MUTV, and United supporter James Nesbitt, one of Fergie’s pals, is conducting the Q&A at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane on Sunday week. Tickets cost £40 — about double the price of the Kevin Pietersen shows.

The word within boxing is that Sky Sports overlord Barney Francis has been personally ringing fighters George Groves and David Haye, encouraging them to be part of the Sky pay-per-view bill at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on November 22. 

The main attraction that night is the rematch between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew, a non-major title fight. It is unusual for Sky to demand extra money from subscribers for such a bout — hence the alleged involvement of Francis in beefing up the undercard. Sky made no comment.

Giggs pays by card

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore donated nearly £30,000 to the Nordoff Robbins charity at the HMV Football Extravaganza tribute to Ryan Giggs.

The sum was the result of a complex formula involving Giggs’s goals, appearances and medals — minus £50 for each of the United legend’s 36 bookings. Giggs paid the £1,800 himself to round the donation up to £30,000.

Meanwhile, Manchester United’s senior press officer Karen Shotbolt paid £1,000 for a kiss from Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones.

It will be intriguing how long City highflyer Martin Slumbers remains on Twitter after being appointed chief executive of the secretive R&A. Certainly he is unlikely to be retweeting contentious comments about this week’s World Match Play at London Golf Club, as he did last year with one that read: ‘Let’s start a campaign to get the Matchplay back at Wentworth, it’s just not the same elsewhere and not interesting.’

Martin Slumbers was announced as the new chief executive of the R&A from October 2015

British Champions Day is taking place at Ascot on Saturday and the insular world of horseracing has already started the recriminations over staging such a flagship meeting at a time when the ground is always going to be risky for the Flat’s best horses. Rod Street, chief executive of Great British Racing, is one of those with a lot of explaining to do.
