Furious Muslims are flooding the internet with their own version of the Ice Bucket Challenge in protest against the Islamic State - by burning the terror group's flag.

Dozens of pictures and videos are trending on Twitter and YouTube showing campaigners from America to Lebanon setting fire to the black jihadist standard.

The groundswell of disgust comes after the sickening beheadings of two U.S. journalists which were even denounced by hate cleric Abu Qatada.

The movement, which uses the hashtags #BurnISISFlagChallenge and #BurnISIS, started in Lebanon with a group of students disgusted by the beheading of one of their soldiers last month.

Yesterday, even Qatada, who was extradited from Britain to Jordan on terror charges in July last year, condemned the barbaric tactics employed by the Islamic State.

Qatada was once described by a Spanish judge as the right-hand man in Europe of al-Qaeda terror network founder Osama bin Laden.

Speaking to reporters from the dock at an Amman courthouse about the beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, he said: 'Journalists should not be killed because they are messengers of the truth.'

He also branded IS 'a killing and demolition machine' and likened its fighters to 'dogs of hellfire'.

Sherlock  actor Benedict Cumberbatch has waded into Middle East politics, comparing the Muslim militants of Islamic State to the Nazis.

The actor, who protested publicly against the Iraq War, said he would willingly go and fight against the terror group, calling their murderous creed ‘astonishing and terrifying, and needs to be opposed’.

He insisted the rise of IS was a direct result of the Iraq War, and was proof that ‘you can’t kill an idea with bombs, in fact you often strengthen ideas with bombs’.

He told the Daily Beast website: ‘If there was conscription and I was asked, I would go, because it’s fundamental to every person’s ideology on the planet, no matter what race or creed you are. It’s their way or death.’

Cumberbatch went on: “That’s as clear-cut a divide in morality and principles as we’ve faced with fascism in the Second World War…it’s a form of ethical and moral genocide.’

The Harrow-educated actor believes the ‘smart way’ of opposing IS is to ‘understand it totally first’.

Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes have wiped out 
Islamic State insurgents menacing Iraq's Haditha Dam with five air 
strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately 
defeat the jihadist movement.

The aerial assault drove Islamic State fighters away from the dam, according to a police intelligence officer in the vast western province of Anbar, a hotbed of Islamist insurgency.

The U.S. military said in a statement that the strikes destroyed four IS Humvees, four IS armed vehicles, two of which were carrying anti-aircraft artillery, an IS fighting position, one IS command post and an IS defensive fighting position.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the strikes on the Sunni Muslim insurgents had been carried out at the request of the Shi'ite Muslim-led central government in Baghdad.

'If that dam would fall into [Islamic State's] hands or if that dam would be destroyed, the damage that would cause would be very significant and it would put a significant, additional and big risk into the mix in Iraq,' Hagel told reporters during a trip to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.

Obama said on the weekend he would explain to Americans this week his plan to 'start going on some offense' against Islamic State.

'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in an NBC TV interview.

'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control. And ultimately we're going to defeat 'em.'
