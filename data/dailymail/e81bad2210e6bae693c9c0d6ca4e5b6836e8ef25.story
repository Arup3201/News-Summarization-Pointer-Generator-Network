As relationships go, theirs is surely one of the most enduring.

Now Mr and Mrs Potato Head have had their nuptials captured on film by an inventive wedding photographer in a bid to explain his work to his young son.

Chris Thornton, 34, was left at a loss when his three-year old son Cole asked what he did for a living.

Mr and Mrs Potato Head have 'renewed their vows' and had their nuptials captured on film by an inventive wedding photographer in a bid to explain his work to his young son

Chris Thornton, 34, was left at a loss when his three-year old son Cole asked what he did for a living - and so decided to enlist the help of the characters from his son's favourite film, Toy Story

As he was a big fan of Toy Story, Mr Thornton decided to put together some shots of the characters in the traditional wedding photograph poses

The result will delight fans of the famous Disney Pixar films as it shows the characters in wedding dress and top hats

Mr Thornton's mother made the outfits and her house played venue for the cartoon festivities

As he was a big fan of Toy Story, Mr Thornton decided to put together some shots of the characters in the traditional wedding photograph poses.

The result will delight fans of the famous Disney Pixar films as it shows all of the characters in wedding dresses and top hats.

Mr Thornton's mother made the outfits and her house played venue for the cartoon festivities.

The couple even have their very own chip-per wedding photographer to capture their special day - although he could have dressed up for the occasion

Mr Thornton, from Leeds, said: 'Cole's first big love was Toy Story. It was one of the first things that he would sit and watch for longer than 15 minutes'

The happy Bride and Groom pictured with their family. Each of the wedding outfits was specially crafted by Mr Thornton's mother

The couple look delighted to be at their 'reception', complete with romantic candle lighting - perhaps preparing for their first dance

Mr Thornton said: 'Cole would always ask when I'm heading out of the house if I'm going to take pictures at a wedding. Although he didn't really understand what this was or wasn't at all interested in any of the photos'

So he decided to show his son some of his favourite Disney Pixar characters in some of his client's favourite settings - such as a woodland backdrop

The photographer captures the tender touch between the two spuds, as their guests rain confetti down on them

Every last detail of the shoot was sorted - from a tiny wedding breakfast spread with miniature wine bottles

She even played prop assistant by pouring a watering can to provide a back drop of rain for some sparkling backdrops.

It's not the first time his son's toys have played a role in his photography.

One of his most popular shots in the five years he's been photographing weddings features Buzz Lightyear holding the brides shoes.

Mr Thornton, from Leeds, said: 'Cole's first big love was Toy Story.

Miniature wedding favours were set on each tiny table setting so that Mr Thornton could give his a son a real taste of what photographing a wedding was like

The bride's elegant wedding shoes were also pictured with soft natural light falling on to them from a window - as is the current fashion in wedding photography

And he made certain that all of the characters were invited and seated appropriately - ensuring that Buzz and Woody were sat at the top table

It was one of the first things that he would sit and watch for longer than 15 minutes. And of course I love it too.

'Cole would always ask when I'm heading out of the house if I'm going to take pictures at a wedding.

'Although he didn't really understand what this was or wasn't at all interested in any of the photos.

'I thought I'd try and shoot a wedding that he'd be really interested in and use my job to make him smile.

'Since then he's actually got his own little camera and did take some shots at a recent wedding I was invited to.'
