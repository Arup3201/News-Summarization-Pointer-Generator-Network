A man charged with kidnapping, robbing and sexually assaulting a woman has claimed it couldn't have been rape... because he is so handsome.

Darrious Mathis had managed to persuade a member of a jury in Marietta, Georgia, that his alleged victim must have consented to sex with him on account of his good looks.

His claim resulted in an 11-1 hung jury after nearly four days of deliberation back in September, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial.

Really, really good looking: Darrious Mathis even managed to persuade a member of a jury that his victim could only have consented to sex with him on account of his good looks

Mistrial: Incredibly, his claim resulted in an 11-1 hung jury after nearly four days of deliberation, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial

But prosecutors successfully applied for a retrial which began this week, and yesterday the woman shared her story with another jury for a second time, Kirotv.com reported.

The alleged offence is said to have taken 
place in the early hours of October 25 2011 when Mathis approached the 
unnamed 24-year-old woman as she was leaving a CVS pharmacy and pulled 
out a gun.

He then forced her to drive to various ATM cash machines and withdraw money before sexually assaulting her, the court heard.

'He had told me to get in the car and I 
actually begged him to take my car,' she told the court. 'I had pushed 
my wallet that was in my hand and my keys toward him and I was like 
‘Please take my car. You can take my cards and everything.'

Accused: The offence is alleged to have taken place two years ago when Mathis approached the unnamed 24-year-old woman as she was leaving a CVS pharmacy and pulled out a gun

He then forced her to drive from the Austell CVS, into Atlanta, where he sexually assaulted her, the court heard.

'In my mind I figured that was the best way, instead of panicking and trying to get hurt,' the woman said.

His lawyer, however, claims she consented to the sex, mostly because of his good looks and the fact that she gave him her phone number.

The woman said she gave him the phone number because she was terrified.

His defence counsel offered an alternative explanation, however, claiming she was attracted to his bubbly personality and handsome features coupled with the fact she wanted to buy drugs from him.

'He walked up to her with a bottle of Vicodin and said, "Wanna buy some pills?" She said, "Sure, get in. We’ll go to the ATM,"' said attorney Carter Clayton.

Mathis is facing kidnapping, carjacking, assault and weapons charges.
