A woman drowned on a Northern California beach after she was swept out to sea by a huge wave, the third such tragedy in the region this winter.

The 32-year-old, identified as Susan Kay Archer, was walking on a beach near Shelter Cove in Humboldt County on Sunday with her boyfriend and dog when the so-called 'sneaker' wave pulled her into the water.

Her boyfriend was able to climb on top of a rock and, though he sustained injuries from being lashed by the rough conditions, he survived.

Archer's body was brought to shore after a 45-minute search by boat and helicopter.

This death is the third incident involving 'sneaker waves' in Northern California this winter. In this picture a couple walk along beach as a helicopter searches for a man lost in the high surf on New Year's Day at the Point Reyes National Seashore

Sneaker waves are disproportionately 
large breakers that can appear without warning - five people have 
now drowned in similar 
incidents in the area since November.

Cheryl Antony, an officer with the Shelter Cove Volunteer Fire Department, told theÂ Eureka Times-Standard Sunday: 'The ocean today was extremely hazardous.

'The waves were about 10 to 15 feet. It was very, very hazardous for them to be out there.'

The Coast Guard said that winter is 'an especially dangerous 
time' on beaches and that sneaker waves can 'catch 
beach goers by surprise.'

'People walking along the beach should not turn their back to the ocean,' was their advice.

On New Year's Day, Charles Quaid, 59, and his wife were walking on the beach near Point Reyes, also in Northern California, when a wave overtook their dog.

The couple went into the water to rescue the pet and Quaid was swept away. His wife and dog made it safely to shore.

Then, on November 24, Olivia Kuljian, 18, watched as her parents and 16-year-old brother were swept to their deaths at Big Lagoon, also in Humboldt County, CA.

Mary Elena Scott, 57, and Howard Gregory
Kuljian, 54, both drowned and their 16-year-old son disappeared while trying to save their dog after it was pulled into the ocean by 8- to 10-foot waves.

Their son, Gregory 
James Kuljian, remains missing after going into the water and he is 
presumed dead. The family's dog climbed out of the sea on its own.
