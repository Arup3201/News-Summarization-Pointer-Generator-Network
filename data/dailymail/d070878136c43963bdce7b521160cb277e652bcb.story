A billboard in west Los Angeles for the hit movie American Sniper has been defaced with the word 'murder' sprayed in red paint, as the bitter dispute over whether the film is about a hero or killer intensified.

The LAPD have said that the prominent graffiti, which was discovered on Sunday, has since been covered up and no crime report has been filed.

A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman also said that unfortunately finding those responsible will ultimately prove fruitless.

Controversial: This is the billboard in West Los Angeles that was vandalized with the word Murder! 

'Taggers like to throw up their own stuff,' LAPD Sgt. A. Bone told PEOPLE. 'If it's just the word 'murder' there's practically no way to track it down.' 

The polarizing film has sparked furious reactions online and drawn the ire of The Interview comedian Seth Rogen and documentary film maker Michael Moore.

Moore took to social media on Sunday to liken snipers to cowards and claimed that his uncle was killed by one in World War Two - before he clarified his controversial tweet on Monday after a furious backlash.

On Tuesday, Rogen also qualified comments also made on Sunday that the Clint Eastwood directed film reminded him of the fake Nazi propaganda vignette featured during the third act of Inglorious Basterds.

Fake: American Sniper star Bradley Cooper has been nominated for Best Actor at this years Oscars

American Sniper: The biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, starring Bradley Cooper, has become a box office hit since its wide release last week. Kyle was credited with the most confirmed kills in American military history but tragically died a few years after leaving the military 

Backtracking from Sunday's tweet that the Bradley Coooper movie made him think of the parody vignette at the climax of Inglorious Basterds, Rogen said 'there is a big difference between comparing and reminding.'

That's not what I meant: Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stirred up controversy on Twitter this weekend by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has since backtracked to say the comments were not meant in relation to the late Chris Kyle, or the recently-released movie based on his memoir,  American Sniper

To illustrate this point, Rogen used the old false analogy of apples and oranges to explain and said that in fact, he 'actually liked' the Iraq war feature.

'Apples remind me of oranges. Can't compare them though.'

That cleared up, Rogen, 32, then threw in a small dig at the media ahead of their reporting of his sudden about-turn.

Accusing the press of blowing his opinions 'out of proportion', The Interview star, wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy.

Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride.

One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle.

American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills.

The film based off Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help.

Rogen isn't the first to criticize the film this weekend, during which American Sniper topped the box office and raked in a record $105.3million.

Clarification: The following day he clarified that his comments did not mention American Sniper or Chris Kyle 

History: Moore wrote that while many aspects of the film were well done, he was not happy with director Clint Eastwood's depiction of the Iraq War 

True story: The movie is based on Kyle's autobiography, written before he was shot dead in February 2013

Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II.

Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Opinion: Seth Rogen compared American Sniper to a fake Nazi propaganda film in a tweet on Sunday

Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War.

The Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy Facebook post today clarifying his statements, saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie American Sniper, based on Kyle's bestselling memoir.

After an onslaught of criticism, Moore tweeted again today to claim he was not talking about either Kyle or the film, pointing out the fact that he didn't mention either directly in his tweets.

'Hmm. I never tweeted 1word bout AmericaSniper/ChrisKyle. I said my uncle killed by sniper in WWII; only cowards would do that 2 him, others,' he said.

He went on to write about his mixed-feelings towards the film in a protracted Facebook post, saying that while some aspects of the movie were praise-worthy, director Clint Eastwood didn't cover the history surrounding the Iraq War to Moore's liking.

'Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb!

'Oh... and too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis "savages" throughout the film.

This is what I really meant: Seth Rogen went online to clarify the difference between 'kinda reminded me' and a direct comparison. He used apples and oranges as an example

'But there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas - and then used it to kill the man who called himself the 'America Sniper'.

American Sniper has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture.

Seth Rogen's film The Neighbors was eligible for this year's Academy Awards, but was not nominated in any category.

Rogen's other film The Interview, nearly banned for fear that screenings of the North Korean-set comedy would be targeted by terrorists, was not eligible for the Oscars since it was released online a day before it premiered in theaters.
