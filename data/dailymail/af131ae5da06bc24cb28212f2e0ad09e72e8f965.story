High tides are forecast to batter the country this weekend as a storm sweeping in from the Atlantic brings 80mph gale force winds and coastal flooding.

Devon, Somerset, the Bristol Channel, the south Wales coast and the English Channel are all expected to be affected, with flood warnings issued across much of the country as it braces itself for a wet and windy weekend coupled with 50ft high tides.

The Environment Agency has warned of potential flooding across dozens of coastal areas, with the towns of Clevedon, Chepstow and Sheepway directly in the firing line.

And many more seaside towns and villages were on sandbag alert with huge waves starting to roll in this morning and likely to continue until Monday.

Drivers trying to make their way through the coastal town of Sandside, Cumbria, were caught off guard  as astronomical tides rose to their highest level of the season.

The seaside road connects the towns of Milnthorpe and Arnside but commuters were unable to tell where the open water began and the flooded road ended. 

Simon Davies, 58, a specialist care dentist from Sandside, Cumbria, said: 'We have lived here for five years and three to four times a year we get flood water covering the whole road.

'It doesn't cause much damage for us as we anticipate it coming and we move our car.

'When we bought the house we knew there was a flood risk but the view we get out of the living room window makes the few floods we get a year worth while.

'The water floods the road for an hour and then it goes away. We are expecting more flooding this weekend.'

A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: 'Our main area of concern is the north of the North West, specifically the coastline at Gretna to Silloth.

'It is not unusual for the Gretna to Silloth coastline to have flood warnings in place, coastal areas often suffer because of high tides.

'The water quite often sprays over the top of walls but it's quite a common occurrence.To have a warning for the North of Cumbria, which we do today, is a bit more serious.'

High tides of 50ft are expected to hit the Sandside, Cumbria coastline this weekend, with overtipping likely in many areas

North Somerset Council spokesman Nick Yates said: 'We will be experiencing some very high tides towards the end of the week.

'These could be some of the highest tides seen in the Bristol Channel for the last 20 years. We will continue to monitor the situation with the Environment Agency and the Met Office and we already have plans in place.

'We have also written to businesses along Weston seafront warning of potential problems and that we are planning to close the flood gates.'

Environment Agency spokesman Paul Gainey said: 'We are monitoring the situation and working closely with the Met Office. We are ready if people need to be issued warnings of potential coastal flooding.'

Flooding could yet hit more than 50 areas throughout Wales and west and south England, while residents in at least 10 areas - many located throughout the Bristol Channel - are being told flooding is expected. 

The low pressure system is set to bring with it gale force winds of up to 80mph around coastal areas on Sunday and Monday - coupled with rain across the majority of the country.

Bosses at Clevedon Pier, Somerset, are also keeping a close eye on the situation and say if necessary, the landmark will close.

Piermistress Linda Strong said 'This weekend's tides are some of the highest of the year. We will be keeping a close eye on what the weather is doing.

'It may be we have to lift the planks at the beginning of the pier if the weather is bad. The scaffolding, which is designed to sustain up to 100mph winds, is checked daily but additional checks will also take place.

'We are expecting winds of around 50mph on Sunday and Monday and if necessary will close the pier on safety grounds.'

A Met Office spokesman said they were expecting surge tides of 40 - 50ft.
