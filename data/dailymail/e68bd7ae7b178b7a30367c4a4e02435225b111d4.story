A seven-year-old girl was left with critical injuries after being caught in the crossfire between waring groups while riding her bicycle along the sidewalk in Detroit.

Shortly before 5.30pm on Sunday India Williams was shot when gunfire erupted between two vehicles involved in a high-speed chase in Charest, in the northeast of the city.

Witnesses said the fighting was sparked by a game of dice a couple of blocks away from where the shooting occurred.

According to USA Today, family members said India was shot shortly after the racing cars knocked over a garbage can a few houses from her home.

India's uncle, Eric Tucker of Westland, said the day before the shooting he had spoken with India's father, Rodney Williams, about getting the children out of the area.

Mr Tucker said he arrived at the crime scene after hearing reports that 'a bunch of guys were shooting at each other'.

He said they came up the street 'flying, swerving'.

Mr Tucker added: 'The devil works in mysterious ways.' Police said yesterday that India remained in a critical condition.

Detroit Police Sgt Eren Stephens said a description of the suspects or their vehicles was not yet available.
