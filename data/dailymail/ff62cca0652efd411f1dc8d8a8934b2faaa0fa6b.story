After six years on the red planet, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has collected its fair share of dust.

In fact, the red planet has thrown up so much that the solar panels on the rover were not working as well as they should.

However, Nasa has revealed the rover has has a spring clean - courtesy of the martian wind.

Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission.

Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years.Â 

During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals.

Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water.

Nasa today revealed these amazing pictures showing the rover's cleanup.

'It now has cleaner solar arrays than in any Martian winter since its first on the Red Planet, in 2005,' Nasa said.

'Cleaning effects of wind events in March boosted the amount of electricity available for the rover's work.'

TRhe two images show the rover in its 'dirty' state in January 2014 (above), where the panels have a thick layer of dust.

The 'clean' picture below, taken in March, reveals a sparking set of panels with their full capability restored.

The mission is using the rover's added energy to inspect 'Murray Ridge,' on the western rim of Endeavour Crater, to learn about wet environments on ancient Mars, Nasa said.

During Opportunity's first decade on Mars and the 2004-2010 career of its twin, Spirit, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project yielded a range of findings proving wet environmental conditions on ancient Mars -- some very acidic, others milder and more conducive to supporting life.

After: In its sixth Martian winter, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity now has cleaner solar arrays than in any Martian winter since its first on the Red Planet, in 2005.
