If you’ve ever carried your laptop around a room, trying to pick up a Wi-Fi signal, then this device may help.

Youtuber, Charles Lohr, has created a Wi-Fi radar system that he claims allows anyone to see invisible Wi-Fi signals around the home. 

The Maryland-based hacker built the device using a chip, LED light, software and a CNC milling machine.

If you’ve ever carried your laptop around a room, trying to pick up a Wi-Fi signal, then this device may help.Youtuber, Charles Lohr, has created a Wi-Fi radar system that he claims allows anyone to see invisible Wi-Fi signals. This is a screenshot of his 3D software program. Blue shows where the signal is strongest

The system works with a battery-powered ESP8266 chip which pings a device and measures the signal - in a similar way to the process used by a Wi-Fi radar.

By attaching a light to the hardware, the system changes colour depending on the quality of signal in a given location.

'There is an application on my computer that looks at the receiver power of those pings and sends a colour to the ESP8266,’ Mr Lohr says in his video.

'So as Adam moves around in the three dimensional space, you can see the relative strength changing.'

The images reveal just how much variation there is in Wi-Fi strength in just one area, with most of the images appearing in a variety of colours.

Wi-Fi signals use very low intensity radio waves. While similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of Wi-Fi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven.

The type of radiation emitted by radio waves (Wi-Fi), visible light, microwaves and mobile phones has been shown to raise the temperature of tissue at very high levels of exposure - but that's much higher than what people are subjected to on a regular basis.

This is called a thermal interaction, but researchers are divided as to whether the radiation we receive daily can cause damage.

The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been monitoring the safety of Wi-Fi. It says people using Wi-Fi, or those in the proximity, are exposed to the radio signals it emits - and some of the transmitted energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies.

However, the signals are very low power. Sitting in a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call. 

Mr Lohr then attempted to capture these colours using long-exposure on his camera. Blue in the images shows where the signal is at its strongest.

‘I thought, there must be a better way to do this,’ he said.

Using just a Wi-Fi module and a CNC mill, Mr Lohr then captured the variability of the signal to create a 3D visualisation on his computer.

‘The mill follows a basic zig zag pattern, while I'm running the same software that determines the signal strength,’ he said.

‘As the mill goes back and forth, I record the position of the mill and the Wi-Fi signal at the same time.’

The data is then uploaded onto his computer, showing a 3D model of blackspots and areas with good signal strength.

'This absolutely surprised me,’ he said. ‘I did not expect to see this much detail...it just blew my mind.'

A number of things can affect Wi-Fi signal, including competing Wi-Fi systems, household electronics and Bluetooth devices.

Last year, Jason Cole at Imperial College London attempted to tackle the problem of improving Wi-Fi signals by mathematically working out the optimum position for a router.

He studied how walls and reflections affected signal strength and concluded that, as common sense might suggest, the centre of the house, is the best place for a router.
