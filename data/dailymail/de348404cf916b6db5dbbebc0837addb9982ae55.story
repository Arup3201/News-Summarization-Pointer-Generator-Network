This is the glamorous woman accused of playing a 'honey-trap' to lure a high-rolling poker player to his death.

Leonie Granger, 24, appeared in court charged with the murder of father-of-three Mehmet Hassan.

She is suspecting of enticing the professional gambler back to his flat after he won £3,000 at an exclusive West End casino.

Mr Hassan was allegedly tied up, beaten and left to die at his home in Islington, North London.

Earlier he told friends that he was celebrating his win at the Mayfair celebrity haunt Nobu with a mystery woman he met in the street.

Granger was arrested by Scotland Yard murder squad detectives last Friday at her home in Gillingham, Kent.

Yesterday, she appeared in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court, in North London, accused of murder.

The young woman, dressed in a grey prison-issue sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm her name, age and address during the five minute hearing.

Granger is a professional healthcare assistant and works at a care home in Dagenham, Essex, which specialises in looking after elderly people with dementia.

Two other men, Nicholas Chandler, 28, of Bow, East London, and Kyrron Jackson, 27, of Lewisham, South East London, also appeared in court charged with murder.

Jackson, who appeared in the dock wearing a white forensic suit and black jogging bottoms, gave his name in court as Jahi Baggs.

Magistrate Claire Freedman remanded all three in custody and ordered them to appear at the Old Bailey tomorrow.

Investigators continue to appeal for help tracking the last movements of Mr Hassan, 56, on the evening of Sunday March 23.

Friends said he won more than £3,000 playing poker at Palm Beach casino in Mayfair before heading out for dinner at the Michelin starred restaurant.

Police were called to his home almost 24-hours later after his daughter could not reach him and became suspicious.

Friends have paid tribute to the flamboyant poker player who they described as a 'born gambler'.

Mr Mehmet's best friend Andrew 'Giddy' Perendes, 65, said: 'Mem was born with a pack of cards in his hands. He was a gambler since he was 11 years old.

'We've known each other since we were eight. We have never worked, we have always gambled.

'Mem was one of the best all-round card players I have ever known. He was a very generous man and a big winner.' 

Mr Perendes, who wrote his life story in his memoirs Life Is A Gamble, added: 'Mem was very well liked. He had no enemies. I'm really devastated.

'He could have been anything he wanted to be but he chose to live on his wits. No one deserves to go that way, to get battered to death in your own flat.' 

Det Chief Insp Andy Partridge said officers are trying to establish Mr Hassan's exact last movements from 7.30pm on Sunday.
