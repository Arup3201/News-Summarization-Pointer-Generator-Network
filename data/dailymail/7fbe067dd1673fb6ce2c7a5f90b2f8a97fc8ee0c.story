An overflow crowd spilled into the parking lot of a New York church at the funeral Mass for a Long Island high school football player who died during a game last week.

A funeral procession, led by police on motorcycles and accompanied by a pipe band, brought the casket of 16-year-old Tom Cutinella to the St John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Wading River on Tuesday.

Cutinella, a junior on the Shoreham-Wading River varsity football team, died after collapsing during a game last Wednesday.

Hundreds watched in silence as the funeral procession made its way to the church with the teen's football jersey No. 54 in flowers on top of one car.

School was canceled for the day, CBS reported, as hundreds of school friends turned out to say goodbye to their classmate. 

His coffin was carried into the chapel by mourners as his devastated parents and three younger siblings followed behind.  

Tom had been raced to Huntington Hospital on Long Island last week, where he underwent emergency surgery for a brain injury. But despite medics' best efforts, he later died. 

Authorities have not revealed a cause of death. 

He was the third teenage footballer to die in five days following the deaths of cornerback Demario Harris Jr. and linebacker Isaiah Langston. 

Friends and teachers have called Cutinella an inspiration to his fellow classmates.

Many members of opposing teams attended a wake for Cutinella on Sunday and Monday.

His father Frank Cutinella revealed last week his son's heartbreaking final words to him as he ran toward the school bus.

He explained how the teenager had forgotten his No. 54 football jersey, so he had had to hurry out of their Long Island home to give it to him. 

'I threw the jersey at him and he caught it and said, "I love you Dad". He always said "I love you" to his family before going to school each morning,' the father of four told Newsday.

 A pipe band played a solemn funeral march as hundreds lined the street to watch the procession

Hundreds of fellow students attended the funeral after school was canceled for the day of mourning 

'But his mom was still in the house. Then he gets halfway to the bus, turns around and says, "Tell Mom I love her." That was the last message he gave us.' 

He added that his son, who was running for junior class president alongside his football teammate Jason Curran, was an honors student who 'loved to give'.

'He always said, "Dad, you know I'm a giver",' he said. 'And he's still giving. I'm at the hospital right now and they are harvesting every possible organ of his that they can.'

Mr Cutinella collided helmet-to-helmet with a Glenn player while blocking during the third quarter of the game. Shoreham's head coach Matt Millheiser described the smash as 'a big hit.'

The player, the eldest of four siblings, then stood up and tried to walk off the field after the incident, but collapsed several feet from the sideline.

He was attended to by emergency medical technicians and rushed to hospital by ambulance, while both teams agreed to suspend the game.
