The murder of soldier Lee Rigby has 
provoked a backlash of anger across the UK, including the attacking of 
mosques, racial abuse and comments made on social media.

Eleven people have been arrested around Britain for making 'racist or anti-religious' comments on Twitter following the brutal killing in Woolwich 
on Wednesday.

The incident has also prompted a huge increase in anti-Muslim incidents, 
according to the organisation Faith Matters, which works to reduce 
extremism.

Before the attack about four to eight 
cases a day were reported to its helpline. But the group said about 150 
incidents had been reported in the last few days, including attacks on 
mosques.

Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith 
Matters, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'What's really concerning is the 
spread of these incidents. They're coming in from right across the 
country.

'Secondly, some of them are quite 
aggressive very focused, very aggressive attacks. And thirdly, there 
also seems to be significant online activity...suggesting co-ordination 
of incidents and attacks against institutions or places where Muslims 
congregate.'

It comes as 22-year-old man appeared 
before magistrates in Lincoln today charged with posting a 'grossly 
offensive' anti-Muslim message on Facebook following the 
Woolwich murder.

Benjamin Flatters, of Swineshead, 
Lincs, faces a charge under the 1988 Malicious Communications Act 
following a message he posted on Facebook on 22 May which is alleged to 
be offensive to Muslims.

No details of the message were given at the 
hearing but another man was warned about his conduct on social media.

Flatters, who spoke only to confirm 
his name, age and address, was refused bail by Lincoln Magistrates 
following a 20 minute hearing.

The court was told he faces further 
matters including four charges of inciting under-age girls to engage in 
sexual activity by sending sexual messages by Facebook as well as two 
drugs charges.

Flatters was remanded in custody until Wednesday when he will appear before Skegness Magistrates via video link.

His court appearance came within 24 
hours of Lincolnshire Police warning users of social networking sites 
such as Facebook that they face arrest if posts were likely to incite 
racial hatred or violence.

A force spokesman said 'We have 
received a number of reports from local members of the public about 
tweets and Facebook comments that could potentially incite racial hatred
 and violence.

'These are currently being 
investigated. If such communications are reported to us and they do 
breach the law, those messages may be monitored; captured and robust 
police action will be considered.

'We would urge people to consider the very real impact of their online comments in relation to this matter.'

Flatters court appearance comes after 
two men were arrested and released on bail for making alleged offensive 
comments on Twitter about the murder of Lee Rigby.

Complaints were made to Avon and 
Somerset Police about remarks that appeared on the social networking 
website, which were allegedly of a racist or anti-religious nature.

A 23-year-old and a 22-year-old, both 
from Bristol, were held under the Public Order Act on suspicion of 
inciting racial or religious hatred.

Shocking: The Twitter comments come after the attack in London. Police say they do even more harm to the community

Detective Inspector Ed Yaxley of Avon 
and Somerset Police said: 'These comments were directed against a 
section of our community. Comments such as these are completely 
unacceptable and only cause more harm to our community in Bristol.

'People should stop and think about 
what they say on social media before making statements as the 
consequences could be serious.'

Two men will also appear at Thames 
Magistrates Court today charged with religiously aggravated threatening 
behaviour over an incident in an east London fast food restaurant on 
Thursday.

Labourer Toni Latcal, 32, and 
plasterer Eugen-Aurelian Eugen-Beredei, 34, both from London, were 
arrested following the incident at 9.15pm on Thursday.

Latcal was charged with religiously 
aggravated threatening behaviour and causing criminal damage, while 
Eugen-Beredei was charged with religiously aggravated threatening 
behaviour.

Surrey Police said a 19-year-old man 
has been charged in connection with comments placed on a social media 
website following the murder of the soldier.

Mohammed Mazar, of Balmoral Drive, 
Woking, has been charged with improper use of public electronic 
communications network under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.

A police spokesman said Mazar has been freed on police bail to appear at South West Surrey Magistrates' Court on June 11.

Superintendent Matt Goodridge said: 
'Surrey Police will not tolerate language used in a public place, 
including on social media websites, which causes harassment, alarm or 
distress.'

Another unemployed 28-year-old has been charged by police after allegedly posting an offensive message on Facebook.

Sussex Police said Adam Rogers, of Kingsman Street, Woolwich, was arrested in Hastings, East Sussex, yesterday.

He will appear at Brighton 
Magistrates' Court later today accused of sending an 'offensive, 
indecent or menacing message' online.

A police spokesman said: 'The entry was allegedly in connection to an incident in Woolwich on Wednesday.'

Meanwhile, a 23-year-old woman has 
been charged with allegedly sending a 'grossly offensive' message on 
Facebook, Hampshire Constabulary said.

Michaela Turner, of Lumsden Road, 
Southsea, was arrested at her home yesterday evening after a post was 
uploaded at 10.42pm on Wednesday. The post has since been removed.

Turner was charged overnight with an 
offence contrary to Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. She has 
been bailed to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court on June 7.

A police spokesman said: 'Following 
the terrorist incident in Woolwich this week, Hampshire Constabulary is 
working closely with local partnership groups to safeguard all members 
of the community.

'This includes monitoring social 
networking sites, and we will seek to arrest and prosecute anyone 
inciting hatred or violence online.'

Police have also arrested three people ahead of an EDL protest for allegedly making racist tweets.

Northumbria Police said two people 
from Gateshead and a third from Stockton, Teesside, were held earlier. 
The EDL has planned their demonstration for months, but the horrific 
murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich on Wednesday has heightened 
tensions in the local community.

A counter demonstration by opponents of the EDL has been planned.

Northumbria Police said it will 
'allow people the right to peaceful protest, protect the safety of 
everyone in the city and prevent serious disorder and damage'.

Newcastle area commander chief 
superintendent Gary Calvert said: 'We appreciate that the events in 
London on Thursday may have heightened community concerns about this 
weekend's planned protests in Newcastle.

'We are constantly monitoring the situation and will continue to adapt accordingly.'
