Sending signals: Jeb Bush will release emails and an e-book to give voters an insight into his beliefs in the clearest sign yet that he plans to run for president

Jeb Bush is releasing 250,000 emails and an e-book in the clearest signal yet that he plans to run for president. 

The news comes after Bush, 61, revealed he will announce his plans to run or not 'in short order'.

But first he wants to 'let people make up their mind' by making vast swathes of his work files public at the beginning of 2015.

The former Florida governor, George W Bush's younger brother, insists the release will offer a candid insight into his beliefs and ideals because he 'was digital before digital was cool'.

He cryptically described the documents as containing 'some funny ones...some sad ones...some serious ones'.

'One of the things I am going to do as I go through this process is release all of my e-mails and write an e-book, which has been kind of fun to go back and to think about this, and remind myself that if you run with big ideas and then you're true to those ideas, and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction, you can move the needle,' Bush told WPLG's Glenna Milberg. 

'And that's what we need right now in America.' 

His words came in a wide-reaching interview that addressed his criticism of President Obama's immigration plans.

Earlier this month, the younger Bush said he will make up his mind on whether to follow his father and brother into the White House based on whether he can 'lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex', and whether 'the sacrifice for my family is tolerable'.

He said: 'I'm thinking about running for president. And I'll make up my mind in short order - not that far out in the future.'

'I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one,' Bush continued. 

'I kind of know how a Republican can win, whether it's me or somebody else, and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to be practical...'.

Bush, who is the son of one former president and brother of another, also blasted Obama's immigration order for going 'way beyond' what other presidents have done.

He reiterated his support for a pathway to legal status for those immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. 

But he said Obama may have exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally lifting the threat of deportation from millions of such immigrants last month.

'The idea that, well, Reagan did it, my dad did it - they did it on a much smaller scale and they did it with consent of Congress. There are a lot of differences,' Bush said on December 1 at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council, an invitation-only event in Washington featuring some of the nation's most powerful CEOs.

Speaking publicly about the order for the first time, Bush said Obama's move 'makes it harder' for Congress to adopt lasting immigration reform. 'It's a shame,' he added.

The former Florida governor is seen as the early favorite of business-minded Republicans eager to reclaim the White House in 2016.

While he would be a force in the Republican presidential primary, Bush would face criticism from the party's conservative wing unhappy with his positions on immigration and education reform. 

Those who attended the event, however, include many political donors and Republican business leaders who support a more forgiving immigration policy.

Bush was seen chatting with News Corp. head Rupert Murdoch, who has urged lawmakers to adopt a pathway to legal status for immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Two of the last three Republican presidents - Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush - also extended amnesty to family members of immigrants who were not covered by the last major overhaul of immigration law in 1986.

Obama's executive order has drawn a withering response from Republicans, but also has laid bare divisions within the GOP over how to deal with immigration. 

The issue is seen as critical for the GOP ahead of the 2016 presidential contest as party officials work to attract more Hispanic voters. 

The comments come as Bush works this week to keep his public profile high.

Earlier in the day, he attended a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Republican Senate hopeful Bill Cassidy, less than a week before Cassidy faces incumbent Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisana in a runoff election that could increase the GOP's new majority. 

Bush, whose wife is Mexican, told the CEO Council that he supports a nation in which people ultimately find no need to identify their cultural origin.

'That is the America we should aspire to - not the one where we're dividing ourselves up to find where we are different,' he said. 

'But the fact that you're from a different place or you've got a different origin is totally irrelevant.'
