Charla Nash, the woman who underwent a face transplant after she was mauled by her friend's chimpanzee, has revealed in a newly-released video that she feels like she is locked in a cage.

She appeared in the footage in a last-ditch appeal to legislators to sue the state for $150 million, saying the attack that robbed her of her hands, her sight and much of her face has left her life forever changed.

'It’s
 a different world to not be able to see again or to use your hands and 
just do things for yourself. That you have to depend on other people for
 help now, it’s very hard,' Nash said.

'I feel like I’m locked up. I feel like I’m in a cage.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Prison: Charla Nash has appeared in a seven-minute video that will be shown to Connecticut lawmakers as she attempts to sue the state for a chimpanzee attack that left her needing a face transplant

Difficult: Nash lost both of her hands in the attack, as well as her eyes and much of her face

The
 nearly seven-minute video will be sent to members of the General 
Assembly’s Judiciary Committee. She says the state had the authority and
 obligation to seize the dangerous animal.

The
 state generally is immune to lawsuits, unless allowed by the claims 
commissioner.

The legislative panel is scheduled to meet Friday to hear 
testimony on a bill that would override the June decision by State 
Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr., who dismissed Nash’s request for 
permission to sue the state government. Nash also may appear in person 
at Friday’s hearing.

'I’m hoping that the legislation will allow me to have my day in court, that I will be able to have a judge listen to the evidence that is brought before him about the vicious attack on me and that it shall not happen to any other person again,' Nash says on the video.  

Difficult: In her video, Nash demonstrates how basic tasks - like getting around - are hard because she is now blind from the attack

Final plea: Nash is pleading with lawmakers to give her the chance to bring her case before a judge

In her room at a Massachusetts 
convalescent center, where she is awaiting a second attempt at a hand 
transplant, Nash describes the difficulties she has endured over the 
past five years.

The 60-year-old single mother was blinded, lost both hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack in Stamford.

Nash went to the home of the chimp’s owner, Sandra Herold, on Feb. 16, 2009, to help her friend and employer lure the 200-pound animal, known as Travis, back inside.

But the chimpanzee went berserk and ripped off Nash’s nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer.

Nash reached a $4 million settlement in 2012 with the estate of Herold, who died in 2010. Nash’s attorneys say that will only cover a small portion of her medical costs.

Injuries: She was left with a thumb on one hand and lost the other hand between her wrist and elbow

Denied: Connecticut Claims Commissioner Paul Vance denied Nash the permission to sue the state of Connecticut

It is unusual for state lawmakers to 
overturn denials issued by the state claims commissioner, but Nash hopes
 her appeal will resonate.

'It’s
 a shame that this attack had to happen, unfortunately,' she said. 'But 
now I’m trying to work the best I can to have my sanity. I want to be as
 normal as I can be.'

In
 an appeal of Vance’s decision, Nash’s lawyers in July claimed the state
 law that was in place at the time of Nash’s attack prohibited the 
ownership of primates weighing more than 50 pounds without a permit.

The
 state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection had the 
'unequivocal authority to seize an animal whose existence threatened 
public health and safety,' Nash’s attorneys wrote. Because the chimp was
 owned illegally by Herold the lawyers contend the state was obligated 
to seize it.

Intense: A team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, residents and other clinical staff are pictured at work during the 20 hour procedure at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston

After the transplant: She underwent a face transplant in 2011, pictured, and was given glass eyes

Months 
before the attack, a state biologist warned state officials in a memo 
that the chimpanzee could seriously hurt someone if it felt threatened, 
saying 'it is an accident waiting to happen.'

Vance
 concluded that no law at the time of the attack prevented Herold from 
owning the chimpanzee. He added: 'If there was a failure by the DEP (now
 referred to as DEEP) to seize the animal … the duty owed was to the 
general public and does not create a statutory obligation to ensure the 
safety of a private individual.'

State Attorney General George Jepsen has said state law on the issue was ambiguous and difficult to enforce.

In
 the video distributed to state legislators, Nash is seen attempting to 
navigate down a hallway of the nursing home, feeling her way along the 
wall.

'I really miss 
seeing a whole lot,' she said. 'I think there’d be so much more I could 
be doing handicapped if I could see what I was doing. I think I could 
figure out how I could use a foot or a toe to do something. Not being 
able to see makes it a lot harder.'
