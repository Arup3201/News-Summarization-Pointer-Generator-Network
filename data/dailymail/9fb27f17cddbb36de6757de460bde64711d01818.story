Oprah Winfrey has published her hotly-anticipated 'Favorite Things' gift guide for the holiday season.

But fans had better have a generous present-buying budget set aside, as many of the items picked out by the billionaire media mogul are on the pricey side.

Indeed, illustrating her taste for the finer things in life, is a 'decadent' black truffle risotto gift box for $500 and steak knife set - handcrafted by 'Italian artisans' - priced at $475.

And while popcorn is usually a cheap treat, Ms Winfrey appears to have selected some of the most expensive kernels on the market.

Her 'dream' popcorn kit rings in at $94 (sabatinostore.com) due to the fact it comes with black and white truffle oils and infused salt.

Overall, kitchen items feature heavily on the list, reflecting Ms Winfrey's penchant for cooking.

On
the condiment front she recommends a 'luscious', 'rare, raw organic' 
honey ($29, eulogiaproducts.com), 'old school' preserves ($75 for a 
crate of six, bonniesjams.com) and a sauce set 'kissed with truffle' 
($55 urbani.com).

For sweet-toothed friends and family 
there is a luxury tube of cookie dough ($12, sprinkles.com) Peruvian 
dark chocolate truffles ($75, compartes.com) and tower of 'sumptuous' 
toffee combinations ($54, toffeetogo.com).

To wash it all down, Ms Winfrey recommends a bottle of Napa Valley red wine, priced at a rather reasonable $13 from Target.

When it comes to fashion, Ms Winfrey says comfort is key.

She
says she is 'crazy about' barn jackets, and recommends a $128 cover-up 
from C.Wonder, and 'love', love loves' the new tall boots from Ugg at 
$300.

The $225 cashmere and Himalayan wool sweaters from turkish-t.com are another of her favorite wardrobe items.

For those looking to treat a special lady, Ms 
Winfrey suggests a $2,700 women's watch from Swiss brand, Rado.

Defending her choice she says: 'I like a watch that's easy to wear and easy to read.

'This
one, on my wrist year-round, is only 5mm thick and clearly marked with 
rose gold lines and mini diamonds, and the simple white band works with 
everything.'

A pair of crystal and silver dropper earrings, $220 by Susan Hanover, are another suggestion.
