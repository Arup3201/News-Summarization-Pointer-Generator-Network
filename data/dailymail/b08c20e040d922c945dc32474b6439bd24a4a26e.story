Time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below 2C this century, the United Nations warns.

Greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3C and up to 5C by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept.

Governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below 2C, scientists and UN officials said.

To do so, an international team of scientists said, annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes (Gt) today to about 44GT by 2020.

However, emissions are still rising – they have risen 20 per cent since 2000 – and the report by the United Nations Environment Programme forecasts they will be at about 58Gt by the end of the decade.

This would leave an ‘emissions gap’ estimated to be 13Gt and even if government’s delivered the most ambitious of their pledges the gap would still be 8Gt.

The gap is 2Gt worse than last year's forecast.

Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said: ‘The sobering fact remains that a transition to a low carbon, inclusive Green Economy is happening far too slowly and the opportunity for meeting the 44Gt target is narrowing annually.

‘While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties.

‘There are also a wide range of complementary voluntary measures that can that can bridge the gap between ambition and reality now rather than later.’

But he remains confident that temperatures can be kept down if there is the political will and that the technical capability exists.

He added: ‘There are many inspiring actions taking place at the national level on energy efficiency in buildings, investing in forests to avoid emissions linked with deforestation and new vehicle emissions standards alongside a remarkable growth in investment in new renewable energies worldwide, which in 2011 totaled close to US$260 billion.’

Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: ‘This report is a reminder that time is running out, but that the technical means and the policy tools to allow the world to stay below a maximum 2 degrees Celsius are still available to governments and societies.

‘Governments meeting in Doha for COP18 now need to urgently implement existing decisions which will allow for a swifter transition towards a low-carbon and resilient world.

‘Governments need to urgently identify how ambition can be raised.’

Friends of the Earth described the publication of the report as a ‘stark warning’ that action needs to be taken urgently.

Estimated emissions through energy efficiency:

Asad Rehman, from the campaign group, said: ‘This report is a stark warning that cannot be ignored - nations must take urgent and comprehensive action to slash emissions to avert a climate disaster.

‘The clock is ticking but there’s still time to act - countries meeting in Doha next week must agree a clear course of action to tackle climate change before it is too late.

‘Current EU plans are hopelessly inadequate – its proposals to cut emissions by 20 per cent of 1990 levels have already been met.

‘Developed nations like Britain must show leadership by getting themselves off the fossil fuel hook and securing the new jobs and economic benefits that building a low carbon economy will bring.’

The report, compiled by 55 scientists from 22 countries, highlighted the need for action but identified several areas where emissions can be cut, such as by walking and cycling instead of using cars, saving forests, and energy efficient appliances.

It warned: ‘Current global emissions are already considerably higher than the emissions level consistent with the 2oC target in 2020 and are still growing.

‘To stay within the 2°C limit global emissions will have to peak before 2020.

‘Scenarios that meet the 2oC limit have global emissions in 2050 roughly 40 per cent below 1990 emission levels and roughly 60 per cent below 2010 emission levels.

‘The gap can also be closed by swift and comprehensive action to scale up a wide range of tried-and-true policy actions.

‘These are actions that have worked around the world and in many different sectors, and which are not only beneficial to climate protection, but also satisfy a great variety of other local and national priorities.’
