Don’t be surprised if you encounter larger crowds when you’re strolling through a town square or museum on your next staycation.

It appears many holidaymakers are choosing to remain closer to home this year, with the average Briton splurging on two or three UK breaks instead of an overseas getaway, according to a new study.

Sixty per cent of us are planning at least one domestic trip that will last an average of four days.

Staycation: 60% of Britons are planning at least one UK break this year, according to a new study

The survey commissioned by luxury holiday rental firm Rural Retreats analysed the habits of more than 2,000 adults and found that Britons consider a shorter staycation a better fit with their busy lifestyles.

With couples facing the challenge of getting time off work together and children committed to summer activities, the traditional two-week foreign getaway is no longer practical for many families, the study found. 

Holidaymakers are spending 15 per cent less on overseas trips compared to 2013, and the survey suggested there is a growing demand for more interesting destinations closer to home.

And it appears more families are choosing to spend their nights in unusual places.

Rural Retreats reported increased demand for overnight stays in converted lighthouses, coast houses and windmills.

Charles Millward, chief executive of Rural Retreats, said: ‘In this country we have stunning landscapes, fantastic heritage and great holiday locations to enjoy all year around and more people are being reminded of that.

‘Having decided to take a break, Brits are looking to enjoy something different, rather than simply staying in a hotel or B&B.

‘Staying in a unique location like a lighthouse can provide fun and a very different experience, adding to the enjoyment.’
