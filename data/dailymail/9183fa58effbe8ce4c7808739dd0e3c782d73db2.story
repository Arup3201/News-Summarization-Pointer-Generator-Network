For most people, the question is whether to have curry with naan bread or papadum. 

But for one man, it was served up with a three-inch centipede. 

Jason Damms, 41, from West Malling, Kent, purchased a chicken tikka masala ahead of a quiet Saturday night in with his girlfriend, Kim Wakefield. 

Jason Damms, 41, said he was 'disgusted' to find the centipede in his chicken tikka masala meal 

But as the couple sat down to enjoy their Tesco microwaved meal, Mr Damms spotted the centipede in the curry sauce. 

Mr Damms, a warehouse manager at a firm, said: 'I sat down to eat the curry and this thing crawled out of the middle.

'It has really put me off my food and I haven't shopped at Tesco since. It's disgusting.' 

Mr Damms said the centipede must have been in the curry when he purchased it, as he only pierced the film when he sat down to eat it. 

Mr Damms received an apology letter from Tesco and said he must have been 'disappointed' to find the centipede in his curry 

Staff at Tesco, who thought it might have been a caterpillar, said they would freeze it and send it off for testing.

He later received a letter from Tesco, with a £15 gift card as a gesture of goodwill.

The letter said: 'I am sorry to hear that you found a caterpillar in the tikka masala and I can appreciate how disappointing this would have been. I'd like to reassure you how rare it is.

'Despite our precautions you still found a caterpillar in your chicken tikka masala and pilau rice.' 

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our products.

'Our suppliers have conducted a full investigation and we have provided Mr Damms with a gesture of goodwill.'
