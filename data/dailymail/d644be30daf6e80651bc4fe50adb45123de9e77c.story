The extravagant waterfront mansion owned by Sarah Murdoch and her media executive husband Lachlan has been sold after being put on market for the third time in five years.

Although Christie's International Real Estate managing director Ken Jacobs could not provide an exact figure, he confirmed the Bronte property in Sydney's beachside eastern suburbs was sold for about $10million on Friday.

The five-bedroom, four-bathroom home was listed four weeks ago.

Lachlan Murdoch and model wife Sarah sold their beachside Bronte property, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, on Friday for about $10million. The five-bedroom, four-bathroom home was listed four weeks ago and was expected to go under the hammer on Saturday

The prestigious pad was initially put up for auction in 2009 for $13.5 million and again in 2011. It is located on an exclusive strip called The Cutting

The Sydney glamour couple initially put their prestigious pad, on a strip called The Cutting, up for auction in 2009 for $13.5million and again in 2011.

But this is just a slice of their property portfolio.

The pair are currently renting the history Coolong residence in Vaucluse while their $23million Georgian estate in Bellevue Hill undergoes an $11.6million revamp, as reported by Property Observer.

The Murdochs moved out of the property five years ago and it is believed the house was once rented to Australian actress Toni Collette.

The contemporary property set for auction has sweeping ocean views from almost every room and has multiple terraces across three floors on the 411sqm sloping block.

The renovated Bronte residence also boasts a rumpus room with wet bar and a large temperature-controlled wine cellar, full security and a double lock up garage.

Sarah, a 42-year-old former fashion model, married the son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1999 - who's also 42.

They spent the first half of their married life living in New York before moving back to Sydney in 2005.

They have three children together, sons Kalan, nine, Aidan, seven, and daughter Aerin, three.
