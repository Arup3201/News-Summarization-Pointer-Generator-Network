Zombies. They're the 'thing' these days, aren't they?

Movies, TV, video games. The walking dead are everywhere.

It's no surprise, then, that many modern-day zombie offerings lack that killer suspense...after all, we've all seen it all and played it all before, right?

Wrong. Because that's where ZombiU comes in - a revolutionary first-person horror game built from the ground up to take full advantage of the Wii U's GamePad.

London is plagued with zombies and survivors are few and far between. Your job is to stay alive for as long as possible.

Dead good: the zombies are smart and will attack in packs if you're too noisy

And thanks to the GamePad controls, staying alive has never felt, well, more alive. It acts as a number of things.

First and foremost it's your satchel. With a click of a button the game zooms out from first person and you use GamePad's screen to equip / use items.

This works brilliantly as it forces you to take your eyes away from the main TV screen - giving you a sense of vulnerability never before experienced in games of this nature.

Of course, zombies can still attack you while you check your supplies.

The controller also acts as a lock pick and an infrared scanner. With the scanner, you can use the GamePad to scope out a room - any objects of interest appearing highlighted.

What's scary is that if there is a ghost in the room (yes, there are ghosts, too) your scanner reading goes all fuzzy.

One boss battle was so scary, in fact, that I had to stop playing - much to one of the developer's amusement.

Another cool touch is that when you die, your character turns into a zombie and you take control of another survivor.

If you run into your old character - you can kill it and get back all your ammo. This feature is set to play a big part in the game's online multiplayer component.

Graphically, it's not a huge step up from current gen. There's a silkiness to the visuals that both Xbox and PS3 don't have, but textures and lighting seem very similar indeed.

Barren land: You'll have to survive London, like you've never seen it before

Zombies look fantastic and charge at you unpredictably.

They all look different, too. Which makes a change from the 'I just killed that guy...again! Why won't you die!' feeling so often associated with so many games of the genre.

They're also very clever (for the undead, anyway). They will scramble over desks and burst through doors to get at you. Plus, their behaviour will be directly influenced by how you approach combat.

Go in all-guns-blazing and it will attract more zombies to your location. With that in mind, there are some points where you'll just want to use melee weapons - an axe - for example, to take them down with minimum of noise.

With games like this, there's always going to be a controversial twist.

ZombiU's 'shock factor' is that one of the levels reportedly sees you killing the undead inside Buckingham Palace.

So, is it looking like the title worth buying a Wii U for?

A dead cert.
