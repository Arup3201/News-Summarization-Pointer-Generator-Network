Staff and pupils at a private school are in mourning after two schoolgirls died after their car was involved in a crash with a bus.

Anna Haefeli, 18, and 17-year-old Anastasia Besedovskaya were killed when the Peugeot 206 they were in was involved in a collision with the vehicle in Tickencote, Rutland.

The pair attended the nearby independent Oakham School, where annual fees are £30,000. It is thought they were international boarders at the school, which dates back to 1584 and counts England one-day cricket captain Stuart Broad among its ex-pupils.

Several school events were cancelled as a mark of respect, and flags were flown at half-mast.

An investigation is now underway into the cause of the crash, which took place on a country lane at around 1.25pm on Friday.

Heartbroken friends of Anna and Anastasia, who were the only occupants of the car and were pronounced dead at the scene, paid tribute to them online.

Pip Lashbrook posted a collage of photos of herself and Anna on Instagram.

She wrote: 'Anna, you are truly one of the funniest, kindest, loving and craziest people I have met.

'I have the best memories with you and I will never ever forget them.

'I will always love you with all my heart and I will never ever forgot you. Thank you for just being you babe. Love you loads my angel.

The car was travelling along Empingham Lane towards Empingham and the bus was travelling in the opposite direction towards Tickencote when the collision occurred

'Yesterday we lost two fantastic girls far to early and they will both be missed massively.

'RIP Anna and Anastasia. God has gained two beautiful angels.'

Another Instagram user, Alina Kicheava, posted a picture of the two girls, with the message: 'Dear Anna and Anastasia, Oakham will never be the same without you two. I don't know how to describe my feeling.

'I will always remember you two as the happiest and nicest girls in this school which could have made others smile at any time.'

And Hattie Merriman posted on the photo-sharing site: 'My beautifuls. You will be missed eternally. 

'You were both the sweetest most caring people.'

A spokesman for Oakham School said it was an 'incredibly sad time', adding: 'Understandably, the school community is extremely upset by the tragic loss of two such wonderful young adults.'

The driver of the bus and eight passengers suffered superficial injuries in the incident.

Detective Constable Pete Davies, of the East Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'The car was travelling along Empingham Lane towards Empingham and the bus was travelling in the opposite direction towards Tickencote when the collision occurred.

'We would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or saw either vehicle beforehand to contact us.'

The road was closed for several hours while the emergency services dealt with the aftermath of the crash.
