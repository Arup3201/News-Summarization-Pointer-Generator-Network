Titus Bramble, 30, was held by officers in the early hours after the cab driver became concerned by the player's behaviour towards his fellow passenger

A Premier League footballer was suspended from his club today after he was arrested over an alleged sex attack on a woman in the back of a taxi.

Titus Bramble, 30, was held by officers in the early hours after the cab driver became concerned by the player’s behaviour towards his fellow passenger.

Instead of driving Bramble home, he took the pair straight to a nearby police station and alerted officers.

They then arrested the defender, who earns £40,000 a week playing for Sunderland, on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a Class A drug.

Today Bramble was suspended by his club which said in a statement: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Titus Bramble has been suspended 
from duties, pending the outcome of a club investigation.

'The player will not attend team training or be available for selection for matches during this period.'

Bramble was last night released on police bail over the alleged attack in Yarm, North Yorkshire, and left the police station in a black Mercedes.

A source said: ‘He was in a nightclub on the high street until about 2.30am. He then left the club and got into a taxi with a girl.

‘The taxi driver was heading towards Bramble’s home 15 miles away in Wynyard when he became concerned about what was happening in the back of his taxi.

‘He instead drove Bramble and the girl five miles to a nearby police station where he alerted officers to what was going on.

‘They came out and then arrested him on suspicion of sexual assault.

Bramble is said to have travelled to Yarm on Tuesday evening for what is known locally as 'grab a granny night' before entering the Cross Keys nightclub (pictured)

‘They also allegedly discovered a white powder and arrested him on suspicion of possessing a Class A drug. Tests are continuing to determine what the substance is.’

Bramble was later transferred from Stockton to Middlesbrough police station where he was held in the cells overnight and questioned yesterday.

His alleged victim was taken to a specialist unit where she was interviewed in a video suite by trained officers.

Bramble, a former England Under-21 international, had been playing for his club side just 24 hours earlier in a 2-1 defeat to Norwich.

He is said to have travelled to Yarm on Tuesday evening for what is known locally as ‘grab a granny night’ before entering the Cross Keys nightclub.

Bramble left the club in the early hours.

Last night, a spokesman for Sunderland FC said: ‘The club is looking into this matter but due to ongoing police investigations is unable to comment further at this stage.’ A Cleveland Police spokesman said: ‘A 30-year-old man from Wynyard has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class A drug.

‘He is currently being questioned by police and inquiries are ongoing.’

Bramble’s career started at his hometown club, Ipswich, before he was signed by Newcastle United under Sir Bobby Robson for £6million in 2002.

After a largely unsuccessful period that saw him mocked by fans for a series of defensive errors, he later joined Wigan Athletic, where his career recovered, before securing a transfer back to the North East with Sunderland last year.
