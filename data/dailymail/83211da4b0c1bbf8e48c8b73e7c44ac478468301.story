'Worrying': Iain Gilmour complained that the noise of 110 children talking loudly in the dinner hall was a health risk

A head teacher ordered pupils to  whisper at lunchtime – because their talking was so loud it ‘broke health and safety laws’.

Iain Gilmour complained that the children’s cacophonous chatting could give staff migraines.

But parents say the move was overly strict and prevented pupils at Isambard Brunel Junior School from relaxing between lessons.

The mother of an eight-year-old pupil said: ‘It seems a strange thing for the headmaster to come up with.

‘Part of education is learning social skills. Children need to learn how to relax with their peers. 

‘I was in disbelief when I heard about this . . . [the lunch break is] their time to relax and converse with friends and not have to worry about doing as they are told in class.’

Another parent added: ‘The head teacher [told me] he asked the children to whisper. When I asked why he said he gets a headache.

‘It’s not fair on the kids. They should be able to talk to their friends. If they don’t talk they aren’t able to socialise properly.’

Mr Gilmour said pupils had complained about behaviour in the dining hall in a survey, which had influenced the school’s actions.

However, he added that children at the Portsmouth school were no longer required to whisper.

‘In our lunch hall we had 110 children shouting. It was breaking the health and safety laws in terms of decibels,’ he claimed.

‘We said to them “please talk quietly, and if you can’t talk quietly then don’t talk at all”.

‘I did say whisper to begin with. Now it’s a quiet chat – everybody can hear everybody talk. Our teachers and dinner staff were having problems making themselves heard. But it’s a lovely atmosphere now.’

'The idea of children being seen and 
not heard is definitely not what we are doing. We are just trying to 
make dinner time nice.'

Mr 
Gilmour said pupils had previously complained about the behaviour in the
school hall in a children’s survey and this had influenced the school’s
actions.

U-turn: But Mr Gilmour says he has now relaxed the ruling at the school in North End, Portsmouth, Hants, and children are no longer required to whisper but have to 'talk quietly'
