Travel review website TripAdvisor has been fined £392,000 by an Italian regulator after complaints from hotel owners about fake reviews on its pages.

The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) ruled that people reading TripAdvisor Italy were unable to distinguish between genuine and fake reviews posted on the site.

It said both were presented by TripAdvisor as ‘authentic and genuine in nature’.

Travel review website TripAdvisor has been fined £392,000 by an Italian regulator after complaints from hotel owners about fake reviews on its pages

The fine follows a seven-month investigation by the regulator into whether the website takes appropriate measures to avoid publishing false opinions while presenting them as genuine.

Founded in February 2000, TripAdvisor now claims to be the world's largest travel website, hosting millions of reviews from its community of users.

It operates in 45 countries and is used by around 300 million people a month.

The association says unscrupulous hotel owners sometimes leave false bad reviews of neighbouring competitors, which could skew holidaymakers’ decisions.

In its response, TripAdvisor said it took aggressive action to fight fraud and had adequate systems in place to prevent it.

Measures deployed by the website to fight bogus reviews include a team to detect fraudsters as well as automated tools and algorithms.

The company said: ‘Our systems and procedures are extremely efficient in protecting consumers from a small minority of people who try to con our system.

‘We firmly believe that Tripadvisor is a force for good, both for consumers and the hospitality industry.’

It complained that the Italian watchdog's ‘zero tolerance’ rules meant it would be liable to the same punishment even if just one review out of millions was deemed questionable.

‘From our initial review we believe that the ICA's recommendations are unwarranted and out of touch with commercial realities, not just of a user-generated content business, but of any company in any sector,’ it said.

‘The bottom line is, if people didn't find the reviews helpful, they wouldn't keep coming back to our site.’

However, the Federalberghi Italian hoteliers association, which was involved in the initial complaint against the website, alongside the country’s national consumer’s union, welcomed the decision.

‘We are happy with the decision by the antitrust authority, which goes in the right direction to offer greater protection for consumers and businesses,’ the group’s director-general Alessandro Nicara said.

TripAdvisor was investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2011 and 2012 following claims from UK hoteliers that many of its reviews are fake.

In 2012 the UK advertising regulator the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that TripAdvisor could not advertise all of its reviews as being genuine and the website subsequently scrapped its ‘reviews you can trust’ slogan and stopped claiming that its reviews are from ‘real’ travellers.

Despite the elaborate systems it says are in place to detect fraudulent reviews, many have slipped through the net in recent years.

Last year, a senior executive at one of the world’s biggest hotel groups admitted breaching rules last year by posting dozens of glowing reviews about the firm’s properties – and negative ones of its rivals.

The reviews were only removed after Telegraph Travel contacted TripAdvisor.

The website's fraud detection systems also failed to prevent a non-existent business becoming one of the most highly-rated restaurants in the popular seaside town of Brixham in 2013.

And in March TripAdvisor’s came under fire over “alarmingly prolific” reviewers on daodao, its Chinese website.

One member was found to have posted 2,633 reviews since 2010, while another had posted 1,361 reviews since October 2013, including 51 in Paris in a single month, during which time they also reviewed 50 other hotels in several other countries.

Last month a couple were charged £100 by a hotel after they left a negative review of the establishment on TripAdvisor. The ‘fine’ was eventually refunded after a social media outcry.
