Train passengers will not get the chance to travel directly from Manchester or Leeds to mainland Europe on the new high-speed rail network, it was revealed last night.

A £700million connection had been proposed between London Euston station - from where High Speed 2 will depart - and the High Speed 1 Channel Tunnel Eurostar terminal at London St Pancras.

But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said it does not offer ‘good value’ and would require ‘too many compromises in terms of impacts on freight, passengers and the community in Camden’.

Mr McLoughlin announced yesterday that he was removing the HS2-HS1 link from the HS2 Bill currently going through Parliament - and would look at other ways of linking HS2 with the continent.

Those hoping to use the HS2 line to get directly from the North to cities including Paris and Brussels will now have to make a short walk between the two stations in Central London.

Passengers will have to disembark at Euston, where the HS2 ends, and walk 700 yards to St Pancras to catch a connecting train. The average person would take seven minutes to walk that distance.

HS2 boss Sir David Higgins recommended in a report launched yesterday in Manchester that the proposed link was ‘sub-optimal’.

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It was the right technical solution to achieve that linkage, but it was a compromise on everything it did.

‘We should look at what the other options [are] as simple as being able to get between the two stations either by Tube or by walking, as you do in Paris, or a very expensive high speed connection from further outside London to the North.’

It comes as Mr McLoughlin gave a green light to ‘ambitious’ plans by his high-speed tsar to fast-track the £50billion HS2 to the North.

And he also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the Euston Arch - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s ‘modernisation’ of the station.

The minster backed Sir David’s plans to ‘accelerate’ the route beyond Birmingham by up to six years by creating a new hub station 43 miles to the North at Crewe, which would be operational by 2027.

He also backed plans for a much bigger revamp of Euston station - the HS2 London terminus - than the £1.2billion redevelopment currently planned.

He said he was asking HS2 Ltd and Network Rail to ‘develop more comprehensive proposals for the development of Euston’.

Sir David had concluded the station should be subjected to a more substantial revamp ‘that could truly stand the test of time’ and ‘whose effects will be felt for generations’.

Days gone by: Mr McLoughlin also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the Euston Arch - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s 'modernisation' of the station

Significantly it will mean the return of a once much-loved landmark - the Euston Arch - much of which is in storage.

He said: ‘This work should include proposals for the Euston Arch which should never have been knocked down and which I would like to see rebuilt.’

Built in 1837, as the entrance to Euston Station, the Euston Arch was demolished in 1961. But 60 per cent of the original stone has been located in the bed of the River Lea at the Prescott Channel in East London, and much of that removed intact.

The arch is likely to be rebuilt as part of a wider development of shops, flats and amenities.
