A dog that was almost starved to death by its cruel owner has had to go on a diet - after doubling in weight at an RSPCA rescue centre.

Molly the Victorian bulldog was virtually skeletal when she was found at a home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and was so thin rescuers did not realise she was pregnant with three puppies.

She weighed just 20kg and underwent an emergency caesarean and lost one of her puppies, but gave birth to youngsters Berkeley and Winston.

But after being taken in by the RSPCA last November, four-year-old Molly's weight went up to 38kg.

From death's door to diet: Molly the Victorian bulldog was severely malnourished when she was rescued. Now she is thriving so much RSPCA staff are being forced to cut her calories to help her drop the pounds

Horrific: Molly was just 20kg when she was rescued. She was so severely malnourished that RSPCA staff did not even realise she was pregnant with three pups and feared she would not survive

Until the conviction of her previous, 
owner Molly was classed as a 'case dog', and was therefore largely 
confined to her RSPCA kennel and couldn't get much exercise.

She would also eat anything she could get her hands on because of the neglect she suffered.

Molly has now gone on a diet - but still have some way to go to reach her ideal weight of 25-30kg.

Terry Singh, manager of the Bradford and District RSPCA Centre in West Yorkshire, said: 'When Molly came to us, we didn’t even know she was pregnant because she was so thin.

'You could fit your finger and thumb around her bones. It was shocking to see. But we’ve actually had to put her on a diet because she’s put on nearly 20kg in six months, getting to 38kg at her heaviest.

'She just loves her food. I suppose it was down to lack of nourishment, and she probably didn’t think she would get another meal after what she’d been through.

'But we’re now being very strict with her to get her back to where she should be.'

Molly’s previous owner, Caroline Marshall, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was banned from keeping animals for five years by Bradford Magistrates Court on June 4.

The mother-of-ten pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and was also given a curfew and was electronically tagged.

Terry added: 'When we found her we had to be put her on a drip and we didn’t think she was going to pull through.

'When we realised she was pregnant, we performed an emergency caesarean and she gave birth to two puppies, but a third sadly died.

'It was one of the worst cases we’ve come across.

'We really didn’t think she would make it. She was looked after by the staff here, who cared for her day and night to build her strength.

'She is an absolutely lovely dog now, and Berkeley and Winston are a credit to her.'

Terry said the centre wanted to give Molly and her puppies ‘the perfect home’.

He said: 'They need to go to people who have the time to care for them and introduce them to their homes.'

'We have had some enquiries already but it will be really sad to see them leave. We’ve all grown really close to Molly and her pups.

'They are all very friendly and have their own unique characters.'
