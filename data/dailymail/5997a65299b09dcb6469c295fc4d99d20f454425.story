Prince Harry has spoken out about how much he enjoyed serving as an equal alongside his fellow soldiers, saying that his stint in Afghanistan was 'as normal as it's going to get' for him.

He has been pictured helping out with chores at his base in Camp Bastion, wiping down counters and joking around with other officers.

The prince paid tribute to his comrades who allowed him to get on with his day job in relative anonymity and treated him as 'one of the guys'.

He was relaxing today after flying out of Afghanistan at the end of his 20-week deployment in the country.

While on duty as an Apache helicopter pilot, the man known as Captain Wales shared a room with another pilot in an accommodation block made of modified shipping containers.

When he spent time with the 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, he described the situation as 'completely normal', and could use the facilities at his base without being disturbed.

However, when he entered the more public areas of the camp, he admitted he sometimes received unwanted attention.

'For me it's not that normal because I go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp, and that's one thing that I dislike about being here,' he said.

'Because there's plenty of guys in there that have never met me, therefore look at me as Prince Harry and not as Captain Wales, which is frustrating.

'Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs [patrol bases], away from it all.

'But yeah, it's completely normal. It's as normal as it's going to get. I'm one of the guys. I don't get treated any differently.'

Harry was accompanied by officers from SO14, the Metropolitan Police Royal Protection Branch, at all times when he was at the base.

However, in Afghanistan his security detail was smaller than usual, and they did not accompany him when he flew on missions 'outside the wire'.

After leaving the country on a regular personnel aircraft last night, the prince was taken to an undisclosed location for a 24-hour 'decompression' period alongside other troops.

The decompression usually takes place in Cyprus. Soldiers are said to be given four cans of lager each and are allowed to relax on the beaches as they prepare to return to the UK.

It was revealed yesterday that Harry had killed Taliban militants during his deployment in Afghanistan, as he opened up about topics such as the naked pictures of him in a Las Vegas hotel room and the news that he is to become an uncle.

The prince's closest friends at the camp were the other crew members on the two aircraft he flew.

While on duty waiting for call-outs they played the military board-game Uckers, watched films, played computer games and chatted.

Captain Simon Beattie, the commander of Harry’s flight of four men, is also a co-pilot gunner and has known the prince for over a year.

'It's easy to put aside the fact he's the third in line to the throne,' the 30-year-old from Bath said. 'He's a normal guy.

'He's someone I consider a friend and someone I enjoy working with, so it's not something you notice.'

He added that soldiers were not shy about joking around with the prince, saying that 'he's pretty forward on the banter as well'.

Mr Beattie added: 'It's just part of us all being together. If you put a group of guys together anywhere, take the beers out of the equation, you still get the fun and the messing around that happens.'

Sergeant James John, another pilot in 662 Sqn, said: 'Captain Wales is just another member of the squadron and another member of our flight, and we all work together, the same as we would with anyone else that comes in and out of the crews, so it's a situation-no-change.'

The 27-year-old from Bridgend in south Wales revealed Harry's closest colleagues are protective of him and try to help him lead an ordinary life.

'It's important to have a normal job, I imagine, in such a high-profile place,' he said.

'It's nice to be able to just get on and do your job, which is what everyone tries to give him while he's here, and he's finding it great.'

Chain of command: Despite his royal status, Harry was subordinate to a number of other officers

Comrade: Corporal Graham Carr was responsible for re-arming Harry's helicopter in the middle of missions

Harry's squadron commander, Major Ali Mack, likened his unit to a 'family', and said the royal settled in quickly when he arrived in September last year.

'He is, as far as I’m concerned, given no special treatment,' the 37-year-old from Glasgow said. 'I treat him very much as I do the rest of my officers within the squadron.'

Corporal Graham Carr, who was responsible for re-arming the prince's helicopter, spoke about the strange experience of finding himself in charge of a Royal.

'He might be third in line to the throne, but that’s how it works out here,' the 28-year-old said.

'Harry comes through the gates - all the aircrew’s kit is stored in our shack, so they come in there. We see them every day. He’s a good laugh, good banter.

'Sometimes after they’ve got down, they’ve got time to sit and chat and have a brew. To be honest, it’s just normal stuff. Football, the UK, what you’re missing and that sort of stuff.'

However, Mr Carr admitted he would never forget his time in close quarters with Prince Harry.

'It’s certainly an honour, and it’s something that I’ll tell the kids about, and the grandkids, in the future,' he said.

After it was announced yesterday that Harry was heading home from Afghanistan, Twitter lit up with messages about the prince within minutes.

@SPWhittaker73 wrote: 'Go Prince Harry! Knows how to party hard in Vegas... and what to do when faced against the Taliban. Harry 1 - Taliban 0 #shoots&scores.'

That sentiment was echoed by @JLock4820, who wrote: 'So I guess Prince Harry is the real life 007.'
