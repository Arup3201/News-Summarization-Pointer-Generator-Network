Pregnant women are often told they are at their most beautiful when they are expecting. And, of course, their bump is protecting very precious cargo.

And now they can preserve the image of their bump for posterity as a pair of British bodycasters launch a company offering sculptures of baby bumps for women to keep forever.

Sculptor couple CJ Munn and Andre Masters, both 40 from Maidstone in Kent, use special effects make-up to help make the bumps, and their intricate designs range from blue and white florals painted like china, to stone sculptures studded with mirrors or a more traditional bronze.

The couple worked in television and film before they started creating the baby-bump casts as a hobby for friends.

Two British bodycasters have discovered a way to record and decorate pregnancy bumps from traditional blue and white China to bronze statues

Sculptor couple CJ Munn and Andre Masters worked in television and film before they started creating the baby-bump casts as a hobby for friends and now make a whole range of designs

Speaking about the casts, which can be rendered in traditional plaster, more elaborate stone and even bronze, Andre said: 'We believe our belly casts are some of the most beautiful in existence in the world.

'Coming from such diverse creative backgrounds we work in so many different materials and we love being challenged to try new things.

'So what you'll see in our pictures is that every single belly cast we make is unique and utterly special to the owner of that piece.

'We love really personal requests where people will have us engrave or paint a piece with personal symbols or patterns - perhaps inspired by something to do with their home or family heritage.

Before and after: The two bodycasters used to work in TV and used special effects make-up to create the castsÂ 

They did the very first bump cast for one of their friends and then everyone wanted one, so the business snowballed from there

The casting session takes up to 60 minutes but it's only after 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed

'We'll go to the ends of the earth to search out new techniques or materials to work with to satisfy our clients.

'We love what we do and we think that level of care shows in our work.'

The casting session takes between 30 to 60 minutes to complete.

However, it takes 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed.

Andre's partner, CJ explained how the pair turned these belly-casts into a business.

'Bellycasts are a bit like Marmite and people either love them or hate them,' she said.

'We did the very first bump cast together and then all my pregnant friends wanted one, and all their pregnant friends wanted one, and it snowballed from there.'

This progressed into learning how to do all the different body parts.

'I love hearing everyone's stories, and then welcoming the clients back later to collect their bumps and sometimes cast the new babies.

'Clients often come back and back 
with new siblings and other family members, so it's really wonderful 
seeing families grow and change over the years.

'We love to make the casts as personal and individual as possible. Some people even have us engrave poems or song lyrics into them.

'Nothing is too wacky or wild a request, and the only limits are budget and imagination.'

Clients often return to the couple's studio with new siblings and other family members to get theirs done

Say no request is too wacky or wild - only budget is a constraint
