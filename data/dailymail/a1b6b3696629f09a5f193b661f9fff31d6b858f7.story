An association for football managers has apologised after it appeared to dismiss racist, sexist and homophobic text messages allegedly sent by former Cardiff City coach Malky Mackay as 'friendly banter'.

Mackay has been accused of exchanging a series of offensive text messages with his former colleague Iain Moody while they worked at Cardiff City football club and today the identity of a woman agent 'victim' was revealed.

After the allegations were revealed by the Daily Mail, the League Managers Association (LMA) - which calls itself the 'voice of football management' - released a statement appearing to play down the scandal.

Victim: Agent Carly Barnes was discussed in offensive text messages allegedly sent on Iain Moody's phone

The association claimed Mackay 'was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter'.

The LMA rowed back on the statement today, apologising for the 'inappropriate' comments, which it admitted have 'been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature'.

Mackay and Moody are under investigation over text messages which called South Korean players 'Fkn chinkys', referred to one agent as a 'gay snake' and referred to another female agent's 'falsies'.

Today that agent was revealed to be Carly Barnes, an agent and lawyer. She was unavailable for comment.

The text exchanges date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market.

As the world of football expressed shock at the claims yesterday, the LMA put out a statement appearing to play down the seriousness of the allegations.

It said: 'Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures.

'These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.'

The bizarrely worded statement caused outrage in the world of football, with  the organisation branded 'bumbling dinosaurs'.

Former-England striker Stan Collymore wrote on Twitter: 'Disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the "banter" of casual racism.'

Ex-Blackburn striker Jason Roberts tweeted: 'LMA actually wrote this. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that... WOW!'

Cardiff City FC called for the resignation of LMA chief executive Richard Bevan over the incident.

The club stated: 'We find it entirely reprehensible that the LMA should put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as 'friendly banter'.

'If that is the view held by the LMA, as appears from its statement, we consider that Richard Bevan's position is untenable and we call for his resignation.'

After widespread anger at the response, the organisation hastily apologised today, insisting it is completely against discrimination.

They stated today: 'The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention.'

But for some in the game, the apology came too late.

Troy Townsend, the education and development manager for Kick It Out, said: 'I wish this was the statement they (the LMA) had prepared yesterday.

'Does today undo the damage from yesterday? I don't think it does. It is welcome but yesterday will stick in people's minds. I wish (the LMA) had taken a step back and said "this would have been more appropriate in the first place".'

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter. 

The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention.

It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable. The LMA remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour.

The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation, other than to repeat that both the LMA and Malky will be cooperating fully.

We will continue to work with all of the game's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms.
