A Royal Navy submarine had its silent running breached today when the Military Wives Choir came on board to reunite one of the singers with her submariner husband.

Eleven members of the choir, comprising wives and girlfriends of military personnel brought together by impresario Gareth Malone for the BBC2 series The Choir: Military Wives, went on board HMS Turbulent in Plymouth Sound before she arrived back at her home base of Devonport.

It was an emotional reunion for choir member Victoria Forth, 28, whose husband Tim, also 28, has been away on the sub for five-and-a-half months since his last leave.

Making waves: The Military Wives' Choir takes HMS Turbulent by storm with a flawless rendition of their charity Christmas single Wherever You Are on board the submarine in Plymouth Sound yesterday

The choir's arrival on board was a surprise known only to a select few.

Leading Engineering Technician (LET) Forth and his wife were reunited after the choir performed a pitch-perfect rendition of their Christmas charity single, Wherever You Are, in the cramped control room next to the periscope.

The crew - and LET Forth - looked on in stunned amazement as they burst into song.

Mrs Forth, after greeting him with tears and a hug, said having him home was better than getting the Christmas Number One - pipping X Factor winners Little Mix.

'But with a very, very close, almost equal second, the Christmas Number One,' she added.

'If we get the number one, it means we raise that much more for the Royal British Legion and SAAFA (Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association).

'It will be a really magic Christmas this year.'

The song is in prime position to be the Christmas Number One, according to bookmaker William Hill.

The choir has been backed by figures such as Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, who has been urging listeners to support the single, and last Sunday they performed on Strictly Come Dancing.

They have also been invited to meet Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street.

Tomahawk-equipped submarine Turbulent has been away for 284 days, spending 190 of them submerged. The vessel was East of Suez for much of her deployment.

Singer Nicky Kenyon, 36, whose husband Adrian serves with 29 Commando Royal Marines, said that she had left her husband to look after their children - and do all the Christmas shopping.

'He said: "You support me when I go away (on active service) for six months, the least I can do is support you when you do this",' she said.

There will be no problem with the Christmas dinner, as Mr Kenyon is a master chef with the commando unit, based in North Devon.
