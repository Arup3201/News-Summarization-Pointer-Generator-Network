It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

There's a Scottish manager manager who is impressing in East Anglia and a Spanish boss who brought some style to Manchester, plus a broadcaster put before the Twitter jury for his lack of film knowledge.

WHAT'S HOT

LUIS ENRIQUE

The Barcelona coach took touchline chic to new levels when he appeared at Manchester City looking set for a night out in the nearby Northern Quarter. Memo to Manuel Pellegrini: Don’t try and copy this look.

ALEX NEIL

Where are all the bright, young British managers? In the Championship, it seems. The latest is 33 and manager of Norwich City. He has won seven out of nine since taking over and previously managed at Hamilton Academical. No, I’ve absolutely no idea how they found him either.

Alex Neil has made a good start to life as Norwich manager 

BRENTFORD

Still in the Championship, Mark Warburton’s team caught the eye with a remarkable 42 shots in their win at Blackpool. A question, though. Given that only four of them went in, what on earth happened to the other 38?

PAUL GASCOIGNE

A coup for BT to coax Gazza on to the ‘Fletch & Sav’ programme and a blessing to see him looking so well. Those who dismiss him as a dim-witted boozer should read his book. They may think again. It’s only because of his remarkable spirit that a true genius is still with us at all.

WHAT'S NOT

TWITTER SNITCHES

Rugby League commentator Eddie Hemmings is the latest analyst to be hauled before the social media jury after mistaking one black actor, Djimon Hounsou, for another, Samuel L Jackson, in the crowd at St Helens. Confusing two black men does not make you a racist. It just means you should watch more films.

NANI

Manchester United have more wide men than an episode of Fat Club and this one has complained that Louis van Gaal has not been in touch during his spell at Sporting Lisbon. He also mentions, in the same interview, that he has changed his phone number.

THE CAPITAL ONE CUP FINAL

We love the League Cup and Sunday’s final should provide a decent showpiece. What a shame, then, that it may be overshadowed by the two Premier League matches taking place on the same day. Why is this allowed to happen?

London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham will do battle at Wembley on Sunday for the first piece of silverware 

CARDIFF CITY

Owner Vincent Tan maintains a strong interest in the affairs of Malky Mackay, the man sacked when the club was 17th in the Premier League last season. Two managers later, Cardiff are closer to the foot of the Championship than the top. It looks a long way back.
