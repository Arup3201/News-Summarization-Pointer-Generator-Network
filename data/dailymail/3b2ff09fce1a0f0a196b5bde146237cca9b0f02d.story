The good thing about being a line judge at Wimbledon is you get to see the action, up close and personal.

But it can have its drawbacks... as this line judge discovered after getting hit in the right eye with a ball served at 118mph just as she was calling it out.

The incident occurred on Monday during a fourth-round match between France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Mardy Fish from the U.S.

After tenth seed Fish unleashed a particularly forceful serve, one tennis commentator cried: 'Oh, ouch that's no so good. She got hit in the eye. That stings, wow.'

As she was escorted away by an umpire, he added: 'She is being ushered to the sidelines and will in all probability have to be replaced.'

Remarking on her bravery, he said: 'She was putting her hand up there, determined to make the call... she still made the call. A real sting in the eye there.'

The line judge, whose identity has not been revealed (in keeping with Wimbledon policy), was applauded by the crowd when she was escorted away by an umpire after being hit by the 118mph ball

A spokesman said that while it is Wimbledon policy to make known the names of chair umpires, the names of line judges are not made public.

The game itself turned out to be a real case of the hokey cokey on Court No 2.

Not
only did the players go in, out, in, out as they took shelter from the 
intermittent drizzle over SW19, but each also needed to head off to the 
locker room at separate stages for medical timeouts.

The match between Mardy Fish (left) and Tsonga, which had started at 4pm 
on Monday, did not finish until 5.20pm yesterday, when a thumping ace 
from the Frenchman, his 20th of the contest, secured a 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 
6-4 fourth-round victory

Fifth seed Tsonga will today play Philipp 
Kohlschreiber in an attempt to replicate last yearâ€™s run to the last 
four.

When play resumed at noon yesterday, Fish was leading by a set to love.

But Tsonga, 27, was the one to benefit from the overnight delay, holding serve and breaking in the next game.
