We go on holiday to get away from it all, but three-quarters of us end up bumping into someone we know while on our travels.

Proving that it is a small world after all, a third of Britons say they have encountered an old friend while on holiday and an unlucky quarter have run into a work colleague.

A new study found that old neighbours and ex-lovers are among the people holidaymakers see while travelling abroad, with an unfortunate one in 20 bumping into a former boss.

Fancy seeing you here: Three-quarters of Britons have bumped into someone they know on holiday

And we are most likely to encounter a familiar face when we're in a pub.

A fifth of people have seen someone they know in a bar abroad, while a quarter have spotted a friend on the beach, according to the research by Lastminute.com.

The most likely destinations where we will see an acquaintance are Spain and France, but you'll also struggle to get away from people you know in the USA, Greece and Portugal. 

Despite over half admitting to finding out that we are holidaying with someone we know, just under two in five (38 per cent) of us actually met up when away or stay in touch when we get back.

Awkward moments: One in 20 Britons have bumped into a former boss on their travels

And almost a quarter (23 per cent) of people going out of their way to get away and avoid awkward chatter.

Deliberately hiding, changing restaurants, relocating to another beach and getting an early flight home were cited as some of the extreme measure Britons go to, to avoid seeing someone they know.

Psychologist Dr Ben Voyer said: 'We often believe that we have choices when it comes to holiday destinations, but the people we spend time around unconsciously shape our preferences – a phenomenon psychologists call social influence.

'We thus tend to form holiday preferences based on the people we like, the ones we are close to, and the ones we would like to resemble. From bankers in the City, to advertising managers in Shoreditch, every professional group tend to have its own stereotypical holiday destination, from the bling-bling holiday spot like St Tropez, to the more bohemian one.

'People love to self-stereotype, so it is not uncommon to find that they end up choosing a holiday destination that corresponds to the typical destination from their industry or work place.' 

Hotels, airports and sightseeing experiences were also shown to be common sites for an unexpected rendezvous.

But the study revealed that it’s not just limited to the destinations close to home - incredibly, walking along the beach in Fiji and picking up baggage in Los Angeles airport were mentioned as locations where Brits had bumped into someone they knew.

Bonding moment: The most likely place for spotting a familiar face is the pub... closely followed by the beach

More than one in ten Britons have realised they are on holiday with someone they know through the social media updates that have been shared from the sun lounger or same resort.

Dr Ben Voyer added: 'Social media has made us more aware of the fact that our holiday destinations have much in common with the people we spend time with. This can also be explained by the fact that our social circles are not as big as we might think – it is estimated to be around 150 people.

'Given that we are, on average, 6 connections away from any complete stranger on earth, it makes sense that we would easily bump into people that we are directly connected to.'
