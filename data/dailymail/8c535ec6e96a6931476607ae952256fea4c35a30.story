Chris Martin was honest to the point of bluntness. After a full Scotland debut he instantly wanted to forget, the Derby striker is simply left hoping he gets another chance to prove his worth.

Martin had made four previous substitute appearances in dark blue before an ankle injury to Steven Fletcher opened the way for him to start against England on Tuesday night.

The stage was set at Celtic Park — the ground his father Gerry used to visit as a fan — for the 26-year-old to properly announce his arrival. Ultimately, though, his individual display was emblematic of the collective ease with which Gordon Strachan’s side were swept aside in a 3-1 defeat.

Martin was utterly dominated by Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling, lasting just 45 minutes before Strachan withdrew him at half-time.

His big night wasn’t supposed to be like this. Lamenting the loss of his club form when it truly mattered, the Suffolk-born forward knows he has to radically improve to threaten Fletcher’s spot at the apex of the national side.

‘It was a tough 45 minutes, both individually and as a team,’ admitted Martin. ‘We struggled a little bit.

‘Personally, I didn’t get hold of the ball and it is important that I learn from it. It was my first taste of starting at this sort of level against a very good side in England with some very good players.

‘I have to review it and see where I went wrong. That is all I can do. I am disappointed with myself. That is one of the worst games I have played for a long time.

‘I think I am better than that. I don’t want to be remembered for that game and I hope I get another chance to prove I am better than that and I will have to bide my time and wait and see.’

A four-month shutdown for Scotland means Martin will have to wait until at least March, when Gibraltar visit on Euro 2016 business. Starring for Derby in the interim is all he can do.

‘Most players are probably their own biggest critics because that is how you improve as a person and player,’ added Martin.

‘Everyone has to do that. This was a big game for me against players performing week in, week out in the Champions League and that is a big step-up from what I am used to in the Championship with Derby. It is a great learning curve for me.’

Strachan’s decision to substitute Martin delivered a public verdict on his performance, but the former Norwich man admitted he had no complaints.

‘The manager wanted to win the game and felt he needed to change the team,’ he said.

‘I’m not going to take any offence to being taken off. He trusted me to start me but I obviously didn’t do enough to stay on the pitch. That’ s quite simple.

‘The manager wanted to change it to try to get back into the game. I respect that.

‘I’m not sure if I’ll speak to the manager in the months ahead. What I have to do is knuckle down and play well for Derby so I can get called up again.

‘Overall, the better team won. England played better than us and created more chances. We didn’t play as well as we have done, which is disappointing because it would have been nice to see how we matched up to them.’

The ease with which England sampled success on their first trip north in 15 years provided a comedown after the ecstasy of Friday night’s 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier victory over the Republic of Ireland.

‘You have to have the feeling that we won the game that mattered most,’ admitted Martin. ‘That’s not just because we lost this one and everyone wants to look back.

‘We won the big game against Ireland, where we picked up three points. But don’t get me wrong, we are all very disappointed with the performance tonight. We want to be better than that.’

Those feelings were echoed by captain Scott Brown, who insisted Scotland could not use the immense effort invested against the Irish as mitigation for last night’s display.

‘We got a good few days recovery in,’ said Brown. ‘That was no excuse. There are no excuses.

‘We just didn’t do enough on the ball or create chances. We didn’t put England under pressure. I feel like we let ourselves down.

‘We know we are a lot better than that and can play better. We know we have much more to offer.

‘We are aware we have let ourselves and the fans down. More than 100,000 have turned up in these two games and it was another great atmosphere.

‘The biggest problem is we know we can compete. We showed it at Wembley last year. It wasn’t a case of us underestimating England.

‘They are a great side. They have a squad full of world-class players, playing in the Premier League every week. But so do we, so there are no excuses.’

Once that anguish fades, Brown admitted he would happily accept a 2015 that displayed the same progress as the current year.

‘It’s been a great year but next year is even more important,’ he added. ‘We have got to try to maintain this level in 2015 and keep trying to get the wins to stay up the table.

‘It’s not a case of it being a reality check. We have really kicked on.

‘There is always going to be a stumble here or there and, thankfully, it came in a friendly match.’
