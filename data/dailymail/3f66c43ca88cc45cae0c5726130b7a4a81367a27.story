Give him a patch of grass and a football and he has total mastery of his surroundings.

But send David Beckham into the Amazon rainforest and he turns from sporting hero ... into a big wimp.

Well, that’s what veteran explorer Michael Palin called him at the launch of a BBC documentary about the former footballer’s journey deep into the Brazilian jungle.

David Beckham was pictured at the weekend with a greying beard, pictured left. On Monday, after his interview with Michael Palin, the silver had all but disappeared, shown right - suggesting he had resorted to dyeing it

And perhaps he wasn’t joking, considering the list of things that got Beckham’s skin crawling, including snakes, spiders and frogs.

But the real horrors were the uncomfortable hammocks and lack of showers.

The Armani underwear model told Palin, who interviewed him at the launch, that the greatest challenge was going without running water for days.

Becks was jokingly labelled as a 'wimp' by veteran explorer Michael Palin at the launch of his BBC documentary about his journey into the Brazilian jungle

He said: ‘Showers and baths were clearly at a premium. That was the toughest part. As everyone knows, I like my cleanliness.’

He added: ‘Sleeping in a hammock was terrible. I couldn’t work out how to do it at first.’

Beckham, 39, admitted he found the wildlife especially creepy, saying: ‘On this trip I was like, “Snakes, not a big fan of, spiders, also not a big fan of”.

'But frogs were the thing I was kind of not sure I wanted to come across. And one of the first animals that we saw was a bright orange frog which unnerved me even more.’

The Armani underwear model spoke about his experiences with 
Michael Palin, shown above. When Becks whimpered at the sight of a 
frog, Palin said: 'You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would've interviewed it'

Watching footage of Beckham whimpering at the sight of a frog climbing onto his hammock, Palin joked: ‘You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would have interviewed it.’

He also admitted he found the steep dirt tracks they had to travel on ‘quite terrifying’, while the machetes used by guides to cut a path through the jungle made him nervous.

But he said he was delighted when he met members of the Yanomami tribe deep in the jungle who had no idea who he was, or even what football is.

He joked: ‘It is the first time I have ever had to explain what soccer is to anybody apart from Victoria.’
