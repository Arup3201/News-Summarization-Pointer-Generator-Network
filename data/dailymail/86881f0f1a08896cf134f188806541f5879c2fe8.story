China's deadly pollution has joined its Great Wall and achieved the dubious honour of being seen from space.

Fluffy white clouds over the world's fastest-growing economy are surrounded by a thick, grey pall of smog in a satellite photograph which lays bare the perilous state of the country's skies.

Released by NASA, the image, taken on a day pollution reached highly dangerous levels earlier this week, shows a dense band swirling 750 miles from Shanghai to Beijing and billowing out across the East China Sea.

It takes your breath away: This satellite image shows smog stretching 750 miles from Beijing (top centre) to Shanghai (bottom right). Clouds are white and smog appears as grey swirls. When this photo was taken on December 7, harmful particles in Beijing were at 480 micrograms per cubic litre of air, almost 20 times WHO guidelines

Only mountaintops appear to be saved from the smog, which remains at highly hazardous levels in some of China's smaller cities today.

Suzhou, which lies a few miles from Shanghai and has more than a million citizens, currently has a composite Air Quality Index (AQI) pollution level of 411. Safe levels are below 50.

In nearby Wuxi, one and a half million citizens are in almost as much danger, with an AQI level of 399.

Chinese authorities announced yesterday that pilots would have to 'fly blind' in visibility as poor as 400 metres, to bring an end to catastrophic delays caused by the fog.

Fewer than one in five flights leave on time from Beijing Capital International Airport, according to a travel industry monitor - the worst delay record of any international airport.

The new rules will take effect on January 1.

Pea-souper: Shanghai was barely visible through the dirty air in this photo, taken on Monday. The pollution is attributed to coal burning, car exhaust, factories and weather

Beijing also plans to replace its oil-burning buses with greener models by 2017 to help clear the smog, the state news agency Xinhua said.

Nearly 14,000 new buses powered by electricity or natural gas will be bought to replace two-thirds of Beijing's bus fleet and halve carbon emissions.

Air pollution in Beijing hit unprecedented levels in January when particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) shot up to a staggering 755 micrograms per cubic litre - 38 times the level recommended by the World Health Organisation.

A few days ago, that figure once again hovered around 400 in Shanghai and Beijing, posing serious risk of cancer and lung diseases to the 26 million people crammed into the two sprawling cities.

Citizens were ordered to stay indoors and construction workers had to abandon their posts as visibility dropped to just a few dozen metres.

The PM2.5 figure was lower today as it appeared the latest wave of severe pollution was clearing, at least for now.

Danger: A motorcyclist tries to go about their business in Fuyang, Anhui Province, where the AQI pollution level is currently 245 or 'very unhealthy'. Below 50 is safe

Citizens: This woman wore a mask as she stood in Beijing's Tian'anmen Square. Citizens were told to stay indoors this week and builders had to abandon their posts

Pollution: A woman wearing a mask on a bridge in downtown Shanghai on December 5, when the latest pea-souper began. Authorities are to introduce low-carbon buses

Ghostly: Some residents obeyed orders and stayed in their homes and wore masks, but others were fascinated by the way the skyline took on an otherworldly dimension

Covered up: Women wear improvised cloth masks to protect themselves from the band of smog in Xuchang, Henan Province, where pollution has reached harmful levels

The PM2.5 index is around 170 in Shanghai and 92 in Beijing, but these levels are still classed as dangerous to human health - especially for people with conditions like asthma. The World Health Organisation limit is 25.

China's worsening air quality is a result of it chasing economic growth at all cost in the past 30 years, a pursuit that turned it into the world's second-biggest economy, but which also poisoned much of its air, water and soil.

Rising public concern over the health dangers of China's air pollution has worried its stability-obsessed leaders, who fear the issue may become a rallying point for wider dissatisfaction.

Desperate measures to curb pollution include only allowing half of cars on the road at any time - alternating odd and even numberplates - and closing schools when the smog is particularly heavy.

Meanwhile, state media was condemned for trying to put a positive spin on the problem.

The tabloid Global Times claimed smog could be 
useful in military situations because it could hinder the use of guided 
missiles, while another outlet listed five 'unforeseen rewards' for smog - 
including aiding the Chinese sense of humour.

Although almost everything on Earth can be seen from space thanks to satellites and advanced cameras, the folklore that the Great Wall of China was the only man-made structure visible to the naked eye was exposed as a myth.

China rewrote school textbooks in 2004 about the ancient monument, which Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei searched for without success for more than 21 hours while he was in orbit.
