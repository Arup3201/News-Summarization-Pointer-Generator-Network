A group who violently beat two gay men in Philadelphia's city center last week might have finally been tracked down thanks to internet sleuths determined to bring them to justice.

After police officers shared surveillance footage on Monday showing a group of clean-cut men and women believed to be behind the attack, Twitter users got to work tracking them down.

The sleuths, including former Real Housewives of New Jersey castmate Greg Bennett and an anonymous New Jersey man, eventually IDed the group using Facebook and Twitter and called the cops, Gawker reported.

The attack unfolded after the two victims, aged 26 and 28, were walking in Center City on September 11 and were approached by the group, who asked if they were boyfriends, police said.

Who are they? Philadelphia cops released this screengrab from surveillance footage showing a group of men and women in their 20s after they allegedly beat two gay men in Center City last week

Night out: The group allegedly approached the men and asked if they were boyfriends before beating them

'"’What is this your f'ing boyfriend?"' one of the victims recounted to CBS. 'And I said "yes this is my f'ing boyfriend"... Three guys just started pummeling me and knocked me to the ground.' 

The group then allegedly made 'disparaging remarks' about gay people before launching a violent attack on the two men - kicking them in the head, chest and face.

One of the victims was only released from hospital on Monday and will need his jaw wired shut for eight weeks. The other suffered bone fractures and cuts to his face. The group also allegedly stole one of their bags.

On Monday - with no arrests made - police released surveillance footage of the suspects and offered a $10,000 reward for any information. 

Crackdown: Greg Bennett, a former Real Housewives of New Jersey star, later tweeted this composite image showing the surveillance footage and an image (bottom right) of the group apparently out earlier that night

Close up: The image, which he got from 'a friend of a friend of a friend', shows some of the group wearing similar clothing to that in the footage. After sharing the image, other Twitter users IDed the restaurant

After seeing the footage, Former Real Housewives of New Jersey castmate Greg Bennett tweeted an image apparently showing the group enjoying a night out at a restaurant before the attack.  

The image shows the large group grinning for the camera, with some clothes appearing similar to those worn by the suspects in the surveillance footage. 

Bennett explained that he had been given the photo from 'a friend of a friend of a friend', but did not know where it had been taken.

Then 'FanSince09', another Twitter user living in South Jersey, retweeted the photo - and his followers immediately started pointing out that the stone walls and chandeliers looked as if they were from La Voila, a restaurant on 16th Street. 

Sleuth: Another Twitter user, FanSince09, said he had checked the restaurant's Facebook page (La Voila) and noticed some had 'checked in'. He then matched up the group photo with their profile pictures, he said

Thankful: Police Officer Joe Murray thanked the sleuths and said their work was priceless

Ongoing search: Murray added on his Twitter account that the investigation was still underway

Speaking to Phillymag, the restaurant confirmed that they had had a large group on the night of the attack - but that they had thrown away that night's reservation sheet, so could not identify them.   

Good work: Gregg Bennett, a Real Housewives of NJ cast member, helped with the online sleuthing

FanSince09 then took over the sleuthing by going to the restaurant's Facebook page and seeing who had 'checked in' on their Facebook profiles while there. 

He tweeted that he had found people who checked in on the night of the attack and managed to match up people in the photos with their profile pictures.

He added that some of their Facebook pages were 'filled with gay slurs'. 

The unidentified sleuth then called police - who thanked him in a series of their own tweets. 

'This is what makes my job easy,' Philly police officer Joe Murray tweeted. 'Sure, it's up to me to make the arrest but we are all in this together.  

'This is how Twitter is supposed to work for cops. I will take a couple thousand Twitter detectives over any one real detective any day.'

But he pointed out that no arrests have yet been made and that detectives continue to investigate.

ABC6 reported that some of the suspects had retained lawyers, who were calling the police to make arrangements, perhaps to surrender.

There had been a $10,000 reward for catching the thugs, and if the sleuth, FanSince09, gets it, he will give half of it to LGBT charities, he tweeted.
