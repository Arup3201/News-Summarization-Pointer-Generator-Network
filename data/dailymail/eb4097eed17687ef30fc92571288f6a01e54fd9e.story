A blind man finally caught a glimpse of the loving wife who acted as his guide for over a decade after being fitted a bionic eye.

Allen Zderad screamed with happiness when Carmen came into focus, before embracing his wife and erupting into tears of joy.

The man from Forest Lake, Minnesota suffered from a genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa which stole his eyesight over the course of his life according to Kare.

Now thanks to a pair of electronic glasses which send signals to the electrodes planted in his damaged retina's, the 68-year-old has finally been able to see his wife and ten grandchildren again. 

Regarding the device which took over £200million and decades to develop, he said: 'It's crude but significant, it works.'

The glasses have not perfected Allen's vision, but they do allow him to perceive shapes and light.

Mr Zderad, whose genetic disorder progressively wore away his retina, became the first Minnesotan and 15th person in the country to receive the technology.

He remembers the faces of his older grandchildren, but has never seen most of them. Before the device was switched on, he said: 'I have a lot of fun with my grandkids and family.

'I think it would be good to recognize when they come in the room, and observe their growing and things like that. 

'My grandkids in Oregon love playing hide and seek. They don't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room,' Zderad joked.

The bionic eye, known as the 'Second Sight Argus II' acts as a retinal prosthesis and was finally approved for use by the Food and Drugs Administration in January 2014 - after decades or research.

Retinal surgeon Dr Raymond Iezzi who selected Mr Zderad to receive the bionic eye said: 'It's a bionic eye, in every sense of the word. It's not a replacement for the eyeball, but it works with interacting with the eye.'

He equipped his patient with a pair of dark-tinted sunglasses with a camera on the bridge and a fitted computer which sends information to the electrodes implanted in Zderad's retina - which replace the damaged cells.

Breakthrough: The glasses worn by Allen took decades to develop and send electrical impulses to electrodes fitted to his damaged retinas

Step by step: The glasses do not perfect Allen's vision, but they allow him to perceive shapes and light

On the mend: Before receiving the treatment, Allen joked: 'My grandkids in Oregon love playing hide and seek. They don't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room'

Once the glasses were turned on, Zderad exclaimed: 'It's the flash and I've got to be able to interpret the changes in that shape.'

Dr Iezzi added: 'Mankind has been seeking to cure blindness for 2,000 years or more, but only in the past quarter of a century have we had the electronics and the packaging and all the other things come together to build a retinal prosthesis that could restore sight to the blind.'

Two weeks after these pre-operative tests, Zderad was surrounded by his loving family in the Mayo Clinic when the glasses were turned on again.  

'His whole life we have heard "nothing can be done, nothing can be done" - it's all we've heard, until now,' said Carmen Zderad. 

Dr Iezzi is already planning on implanting the device in a second patient, while researching future uses for patients who have other eye conditions besides retinitis pigmentosa, like patients with glaucoma, or soldiers who may have lost their eyes in combat.

In a healthy eye, the rods and cones convert light into tiny electrochemical impulses that are sent through the optic nerve and into the brain, where they are decoded into images. 

If the photoreceptors no longer function correctly the first step in this process is disrupted, and the visual system cannot transform light into images.

The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System ("Argus II") bypasses the damaged photoreceptors altogether. 

A miniature video camera housed in the patient’s glasses captures a scene. 

The video is sent to a small patient-worn computer (i.e., the video processing unit – VPU) where it is processed and transformed into instructions that are sent back to the glasses via a cable. 

These instructions are transmitted wirelessly to an antenna in the implant. 

The signals are then sent to the electrode array, which emits small pulses of electricity. 

These pulses bypass the damaged photoreceptors and stimulate the retina’s remaining cells, which transmit the visual information along the optic nerve to the brain, creating the perception of patterns of light. 

Patients learn to interpret these visual patterns.
