Monsoon-like conditions forced the abandonment of Sunday's A-League match between the Brisbane Roar and Wellington Phoenix - a decision that could have implications on the title race.

After torrential rain had left the Lang Park pitch covered in large puddles, making even short passes difficult, referee Alan Milliner decided to bring things to a premature conclusion on 73 minutes.

League leaders Phoenix were leading 2-1 at the time and move four points clear at the top of the table because the result was allowed to stand.

But Roar coach Frans Thijssen reacted angrily to the decision to call off the match despite the wild weather turning proceedings into a farce.

Brisbane are in contention for the play-offs and Thijssen criticised the rule that states a replay is required if the match is abandoned before half-time but the result stands if it ends after the break.

He said: 'Of course I'm disappointed because this is a crazy end.

'I've never seen this, because the choice is replay if it happens in the first-half, they're the normal rules, and if it happens in the second-half you have to play the second-half again.

'We all want an honest competition and Adelaide and Perth, they're not happy with this because they are in a competition to be champions.

'And we're in a competition to be in the play-offs, so of course it's disappointing.

'When we had a free-kick in a dangerous position where we could score, they just call off the game and they give three points to one team and no points to the other team, that's not an honest competition.'

Brisbane led after five minutes through Andrija Kaluderovic before Michael McGlinchey equalised for the visitors 10 minutes later.

Then, moments before the half-time whistle, Australia international Nathan Burns pounced to put Wellington ahead.

They are now four points ahead of Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Perth Glory, who are all tied on 38 points in second place.
