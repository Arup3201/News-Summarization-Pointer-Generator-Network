AC Milan are exploring the possibility of Atletico Madrid taking over their two-year loan of Fernando Torres from Chelsea. 

Sportsmail revealed Atletico’s interest in Torres earlier this month while Milan want to cut short the loan to spend his salary elsewhere. 

Ideally, coach Filippo Inzaghi would like Alessio Cerci in exchange from Atletico.

Cerci has barely played since his £13million summer transfer from Torino. Inter Milan also want Cerci.

Torres spent 12 years with Atletico Madrid as he progressed through their youth system and into the first team. 

The World Cup-winner moved from Atletico to Liverpool before being bought by Chelsea for £50m, but his form and fortunes have dipped since then and has only scored one goal since moving to Italy on loan
