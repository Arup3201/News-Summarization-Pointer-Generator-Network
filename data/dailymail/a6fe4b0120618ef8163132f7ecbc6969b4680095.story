Her hair is still a garish lilac, or ‘wisteria hue’, as she prefers it to be described. And the bejewelled cat’s-eye ‘face furniture’ is as unmistakable as her trademark greeting: ‘Hello Possums!’ Dame Edna Everage has been a fixture on television screens and the stage for more than 40 years, but now there has been a rather surprising change: there is somewhat less of her.

She’s been on a diet – or at least her creator Barry Humphries has – and the result is dramatic.

Humphries, 78, who says he attributes his longevity to a ‘lifelong aversion to exercise’, has shed 2st 5lb over nine months on the dieting programme Jenny Craig.

‘I loathe exercise,’ Barry says, from his Melbourne home which he shares with fourth wife of 22 years, Lizzie Spender. ‘However, the weight has been creeping on for a few years now. It got to the point where I really didn’t like what I saw in the mirror and my increasing girth was causing all sorts of headaches for my tailor. I was also having to give expensive suits away to the Salvation Army as I just couldn’t get into them any more.’

After years of excusing himself his indulgences, Barry finally took his weight problem seriously last year. ‘I really didn’t want to, but my wife helped me with the decision to tackle my food intake. It was fortunate I was also offered the chance to become Jenny Craig’s ambassador, as their approach appealed to me.

‘I do not like the word diet, I do not like hardship. I have been in some health farms at various points in my life and have always run away in the evenings to go to a five-star restaurant and eat some decent food.’

He adds: ‘I didn’t feel ill due to the excess weight, but uncomfortable, and I was getting very tired and needing to have a lie down during the day. I easily got out of breath when walking. My blood pressure was high and a few years ago, I developed a hiatus hernia [in which part of the stomach pushes through the muscle of the diaphragm causing indigestion], which I took tablets for. I think it was because of my eating habits.’

Back in the days: Dame Edna Everage, before she lost two stone through a £10-a-day ready meal diet

Jenny Craig is basically a spoon-fed diet plan: once a month, the company delivers low-calorie ready meals that cover breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Dieters are allowed to supplement this with fruit and vegetables. This is the ‘weight loss’ part of the programme, which for someone like Barry, who wanted to lose 33lb, may last three to four months.

Customers pay about £10 a day, and once the desired weight loss is achieved, they are weaned off ready meals and encouraged to cook their own food while remaining on a healthy eating plan. This maintenance regime costs much less – dieters can continue with some ready meals and with a weekly counselling phone call, or just opt for a phone-call service (£11 per call).

People in this age range who are losing weight for the first time must do it with medical supervision, says Prof Haslam.

‘For those with certain problems – such as kidney disease – being overweight is actually protective, something we call the obesity paradox,’ he explains. ‘Each case needs to be individually assessed.’

Even those with little or no associated health risks need a carefully balanced programme of nutritional and activity advice.

Another problem facing the  over-70s dieter is sarcopenia,  the gradual loss of muscle mass due to age.

‘It is vital to make an effort to improve muscle mass, through exercise and increased protein intake,’ says Haslam.

Set up in the early Eighties by husband-and-wife team Jenny and Sydney Craig, it’s been an international success, with more than five million members worldwide over the past 25 years. Past celebrity patrons include Kirstie Alley and Cheryl Baker – though they are no longer on the programme and admit it didn’t work for them in the long term, having put the majority of the weight they lost back on. Spice Girl Mel B is a current patron.

After Humphries decided to take action, a daily programme of food intake that varied between 1,200 and 1,500 calories was organised. A typical day’s diet consists of about 60 per cent carbs, 20 per cent protein and 20 per cent fat.

He was perhaps a tougher challenge than the Jenny team first anticipated. After starting in late March, he was expected to hit his target by July. This was pushed back to September because he hadn’t lost the weight, then again to December, when he finally hit the target, almost five months behind schedule.

The Jenny counsellor called him daily – a service not normally offered to members. Humphries said: ‘I needed that. I have a big weakness for cheese and desserts, so I had to train myself to have much smaller portions.’

So, does Jenny Craig work? A 2010 study showed that it did help dieters lose weight, but the research was criticised as participants were invited to take part and didn’t pay for the programme. Humphries wants to show people of his generation they are not too old to bother with dieting. Professor David Haslam, of the National Obesity Forum, says: ‘Weight peaks at 70 years on average. Anyone in this age range, if they are obese, has an increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, joint problems and a lower quality of life in general.’

Losing weight will lower those risks significantly. Humphries managed to get his BMI down from 29.5 to just under 25. He is now 13st 5lb – scraping into the healthy range for his 6ft height, with a BMI of 24.9. However, he still relies on the ready meals at times.

‘If I travel, I take Jenny Craig meals with me. Last year I started my farewell tour, Eat, Pray, Laugh, in Australia, which I am bringing to the UK this October, and as the weight dropped off my energy levels definitely improved.

‘This has been the easiest, most relaxed way of changing your lifestyle that I can imagine. Having your meals organised for you really does take the strain out of depriving yourself of certain pleasures.’

He adds: ‘I feel so much better in myself. I have gone down three dress sizes, and I feel like a new man.’

Or, in his case, a new Dame.
