Blackmailer: Daood Hussain, 28, who demanded £10,000 and sex in return for not publishing the lingerie photos

A blackmailer who repeatedly raped a Muslim woman and pocketed her life savings after threatening to publish lingerie photos of her has been jailed for 17 years.

Unemployed electrical engineer Daood Hussain demanded £10,000 from the woman or he would publish the pictures and advertise her as a prostitute.

The 28-year-old was described at Birmingham Crown Court as a man who wanted control and would not take no for an answer.

Judge Peter Carr told Hussain: 'You treated her, on the evidence that I have heard, in a demeaning and degrading fashion and with complete contempt.

'The prosecution were right in their submission to the jury in that you were a man who wanted control and you were not going to take no for an answer from her.

'You also made a demand for £10,000 which she paid.'

The judge said the effects of releasing the photos would be 'potentially devastating' on the victim and her family.

Following a trial, Bordesley, Birmingham, was found guilty of blackmail and 12 charges of rape.

As well as the long prison sentence, he was ordered to register as a sex offender for an indefinite period and was banned from contacting the woman or her family on his release.

In a police interview, the woman said Hussain had demanded a meeting during the summer of 2012.

He showed her a leaflet he had created which included lingerie shots, her address and telephone number - and a caption advertising her as a prostitute.

She agreed to meet him ten times for sex sessions in the run up to Ramadan, in June and July 2012.

The meetings took place in his car and hotel rooms across Birmingham before the woman contacted police.

Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, told the
 court during the trial that the victim was terrified of what would 
happen if she did not give in to his demands.

He
 said: ‘This case is all about financial and sexual exploitation by this
 man. She was fearful of what he would do if she did not comply with his
 requests.

‘Her family would
 have been horrified to find she was allowing pictures to be taken in 
that way. She simply couldn’t bear to face the consequences that would 
follow if her family saw the document.’

In
 a tearful interview played to jurors, the woman told police: ‘I begged 
him not to do anything and told him about the situation at home.

'My
 mum had been in hospital. I told him he wouldn’t achieve anything 
but... he wasn’t listening to anything I said. He made up his mind 
that’s what he was going to do and that’s what he did. 

'I tried so hard not to cry in front of him so he wouldn’t know he was getting to me. I’m in shock, devastated.’

Farah Ramzan, defending, said: 'He is the youngest of six siblings and comes from a very close-knit family.

'Clearly, this is going to have a devastating effect on the whole family.'
