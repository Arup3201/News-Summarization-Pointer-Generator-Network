A council has been forced to issue a ‘complete and utter’ apology for squandering over £500,000 of taxpayers’ money.

Forest of Dean District Council accepted a humiliating motion criticising it for ‘scandalous waste’ over the past eight years after an ambush by Labour members.

They forced through the vote, demanding an ‘unqualified apology’, when the ruling Conservatives were left short of numbers at a meeting this week.

Forest of Dean District Council was forced to apologise for squandering over £500,000 on renovation work

The council was criticised for spending nearly £400,000 on renovating a reception area at its offices and another £120,000 on demolishing a building which they failed to sell and which has lain empty for four years.

It was also attacked for shutting the district’s tourism information offices and imposing charges for pest control, bulk waste and garden waste collections and car parking.

The apology has already been posted on the authority’s website and in press releases.

Labour councillor Di Martin, who introduced the motion, said the Conservative administration, which has run the council in Gloucestershire for eight years, ‘has failed miserably to listen to the people of the Forest of Dean and as a result they have been badly let down, an unqualified apology is due’. 

Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion

She added: ‘An apology is needed for the scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money on the refurbishment of the district council’s reception area [at a cost of £383,320].

‘The cost of refurbishment was meant to be recouped by the sale of Lawnstone House, which is now to be demolished at a further cost of £120,000.’

Last night Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained why his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion, which he dismissed as a ‘blatant piece of electioneering’.

‘We didn’t take part in the debate. We were down on our numbers and we weren’t sure we’d have the support to win in the chamber so we didn’t vote,’ he said. ‘We don’t regret it because it’s a stupid motion – it’s ill-founded and if anybody should hang their head in shame it is Di Martin.

‘We were voted the most-improved council in the country in 2013 and if that’s something we should apologise for, she’s completely lost the plot.’

Mr Molyneux added that the renovation work to the council’s offices – which included £13,550 to replace a CCTV system – was essential as it made the building more accessible to the disabled.

‘It does seem like a lot but the old block where the reception was wasn’t disabled friendly. If she thinks that’s a waste of money, she’s missing the plot.’

Independent members of the council criticised the ‘mud-slinging contest’ between the two main parties.
