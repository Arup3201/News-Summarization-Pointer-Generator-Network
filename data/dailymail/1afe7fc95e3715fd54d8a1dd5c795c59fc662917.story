A male friend of the Indian gang-rape victim who was with her when she was attacked has described how he had to carry her bleeding body into a police van on his own - because none of the officers wanted to touch her.

The 28-year-old said no passersby stopped to help them as they lay naked and bleeding in the road after they were thrown off a Delhi bus on which the gruesome ordeal occurred on December 16.

When the police finally arrived they wasted two hours arguing over which police station was responsible before finally taking the victims to a hospital which wasn't close to the crime scene, he said.

Claims: Awindra Pandey, the male friend with Miss Singh Pandey when she was subjected to the brutal gang-rape ordeal, spoke out in an interview on Indian television

Treatment: The rape victim was taken to intensive care at a Singapore hospital but died of her injuries

Police in India today denied the man's claims.

The 23-year-old woman died on December 29 in a specialist hospital in Singapore after a 13-day struggle to survive injuries so grievous that her intestines had to be removed.

She underwent three major surgeries and suffered a cardiac arrest in India before being flown to Singapore for treatment.

The horrifying crime has appalled India and brought simmering anger about widespread crime against women to the boil amid angry calls for safer streets, more sensitive policing and changed social attitudes.

In an interview with Hindi TV channel
 Zee News, the victim's friend said the gang of six men aboard the bus - fitted with 
curtains and tinted windows - had planned to trap them.

Once on the bus, he was attacked and his
 23-year-old friend was gang-raped by a group of allegedly drunk 
men, including the driver, who also violated her with an iron bar 
causing immense internal damage that led to her death.

The man, believed to be the only witness in the case, said he did his best to fight off the attackers.

'They
 beat us up, hit us with iron rod, snatched our clothes and belongings 
and they threw us off the bus on a deserted stretch.

'From where we boarded bus, they moved around for nearly two and a half hours. We were shouting, trying to make people hear us,' said the 28-year-old, who suffered a broken leg in the attack.

'But
 they switched off the lights. We tried to resist them. Even my friend 
fought with them, she tried to save me. She tried to dial police control
 room number 100, but the men snatched the mobile.'

Police officer Vivek Gogia has denied claims that officers debated for half an hour before taking the rape victim and her friend to a hospital.

In a statement, Gogia said police vans reached the spot where the rape victim and her friend were dumped within three minutes of receiving the alert.

'Police vans left the spot for hospital with the victims within 12 minutes,' the officer said.

That time was spent borrowing bed sheets from a neighboring hotel to cover the naked rape victim and her friend, he said.

Indian police personnel stand guard outside the district court Saket in New Delhi after fears of mob violence against the suspects

Public interest: Indian citizens queue to enter the Saket district court in New Delhi - where two of the five men accused of raping Miss Singh Pandey today begged to be allowed to turn witness for the prosecution

The friend of the rape victim made the comments after her alleged killers were kept away from court on Thursday amid fears of mob violence.

'After throwing us off the bus, they tried to mow us down, but I saved my friend by pulling her away in the nick of time.

'We
 were without clothes. We tried to stop people passing by. Several auto 
rickshaws, cars and bikes slowed down but no one stopped for about 25 
minutes.

'Then someone on patrol stopped and called the police,' he told Zee News. 

He claimed three police vans arrived at the scene after about 45 minutes, 
but wasted time in deciding under which police station’s jurisdiction 
the case fell. 

He alleged nobody, including the police, gave them clothes or called an ambulance.

'They
 were just watching us,' he said, adding someone gave them a part of bed
 sheet to cover his friend after repeated requests.

'My
 friend was bleeding profusely. But instead of taking us to a nearby 
hospital, they (police) took us to a far away hospital.'

He said he carried his badly injured friend to the PCR van on his own as 
the policemen didn’t help them because the girl was bleeding profusely.

'Nobody
 from the public helped us. People were probably afraid that if they 
help us they would become witness to the crime and would be asked to 
come to police stations and courts,' he told the channel.

'Even
 at the hospital we were made to wait and I had to literally beg for 
clothes. I borrowed a stranger’s mobile and called my relatives, but 
just told them that I met with an accident. My treatment started only 
after my relatives came,' he said.

'I
 was hit on the head. I was not able to walk. I was not able to move my 
hands for two weeks,' he said, detailing the injuries he suffered 
on that horrific night.

Five people have been formally charged over the rape and murder of the student paramedic, with one named as Ram Singh.

It has emerged that a sixth suspect,
 who is believed to be a juvenile and is expected to be tried 
separately, was the cruelest of all.

According to The Hindustan Times, a
 police charge sheet reveals in horrendous detail exactly what he is 
alleged to have done to the unconscious victim - after she had been 
raped.

The newspaper reported that he pulled her intestines out with his bare hands and was also responsible for suggesting that she be thrown naked from the bus.

Yesterday, her father called for the hanging 
of those responsible for the attack saying 'the death penalty is 
compulsory for a crime so great.'

The trial will be held in a fast track court.

'Of all the persons in the bus, two 
had engaged in the most barbarism - Ram Singh, the main accused in the 
case, and the juvenile ' said an officer according to the paper.

'Both of them had subjected her to 
sexual abuse twice. Singh was the first to rape her followed by the 
juvenile and then Akshay. Later, when she lost consciousness, Singh and 
the juvenile raped her a second time.'

Authorities
 are waiting for the outcome of a bone marrow test before deciding 
whether the sixth suspect in the attack will be charged as a juvenile or
 an adult.

Calls for hanging: In an interview the victim's father said 'The death penalty is compulsory for a crime so great - the assailants must be hanged'

The results of the test, intended to determine the suspect's exact age, are expected to arrive soon.

The other five men are expected to appear in court on Monday for pre-trial proceedings.

Police plan to ask for the death penalty in the case. The men - the bus driver, his brother
 and four of their friends - are residents of a south Delhi slum near 
the site of the attack.

Indian Chief Justice Altamas Kabir 
said the accused should be tried swiftly, but cautioned that they needed
 to be given a fair trial and not subjected to mob justice.

'Let us not lose sight of the fact 
that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty,' he said 
yesterday, while inaugurating the new fast-track court.

Criminal lawyer Ajay Digpaul told India 
Today: 'In my view, it should not take more than 10-15 effective 
hearings to decide the case it as there is plenty of evidence.'

Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar 
Council said that 2,500 advocates registered at the court had decided to stay away to ensure 'speedy justice'.

'We have decided that no lawyer will 
stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the
 case,' he said to AFP.

The government is to set up four 
other such courts in the capital to hold timely trials in sexual assault
 cases, which often get bogged down for years in India's notoriously 
sluggish court system.

Women's activists hope the rape and 
killing of the university student on December 16 will mark a turning 
point in India's behavior towards women.

Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city

Yesterday the father of the 
physiotherapy student paid tribute to his 'fiercely determined' daughter
 in his first interview since the attack happened.

In an interview with the BBC the day 
after he scattered his daughter's ashes on the sacred waters of the 
River Ganges, her father revealed how his daughter wanted to be a doctor
 and had promised to lift the family from their poverty.

He said: 'She was very adamant about whatever she wanted.

'When
 we used to stop at a sweetshop on the way to school she was adamant 
about wanting a sweet and even the shopkeeper had to relent.

'It
 was the same in high school. She wanted to be a doctor and said it was 
only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor (all our 
suffering) it will end.'

'I remember asking her once, who are all your friends? She replied, Dad it's only my books I am friends with.'

Her
 father moved the family to Delhi from a rural part of India in order to
 improve her chances of realising her ambition of a career in medicine.

The dream was cut short on December 16 
when she was attacked by six men after as she caught the bus home after 
going to the cinema to watch The Life of Pi.
