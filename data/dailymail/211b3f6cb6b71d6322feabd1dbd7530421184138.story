A student at a Virginia high school has been told to remove his 'Duck Dynasty' T-shirt or turn it inside out because its slogan was 'threatening.'

Hunter Spain was wearing the T-shirt, recently worn by Si Robertson, one of the A&E hit show's eccentric personalities, which sports the words, 'I Will Hurt You Physically and Metaphysically.'

While any fan of the show, which follows the lives of bearded millionaires who run a duck-call business, knows the slogan means no harm, the officials at Dinwiddie High School insisted Spain remove it, something which angered his mother.

'For this to be considered a threat to the school, I couldn't understand it,' Hunter's mom, Edna-Jo Spain, told WWBT.

'Anybody that ever watches Duck Dynasty knows that Si Robertson is famous for his little funny slogans.'

Mrs Spain added her son's strict grandmother was the one who gave him the controversial T-shirt as a gift.

'[This is] a lady who would not even 
buy my daughter ripped up jeans to wear to school,' Mrs Spain said. 'She
 viewed that as inappropriate.'

The
 school defended its decision to ban the T-shirt, claiming the slogan's 
meaning could have been misconstrued as encouraging violence.

'If you are a 'Duck Dynasty' fan, you understand the meaning of the shirt,' Dinwiddie High School's superintendent David Clark told WWBT.

'But if you haven't watched 'Duck Dynasty,' you may question if the shirt implies violence. As a school division, we would like to keep our slogans on student shirts as non-violent as possible.'

Rather than turning the shirt inside-out, Spain said he went home and got a new T-shirt.

'I'm not going to look stupid in front of all these young ladies in the school,' he told WWBT.

'So I decided to get a different T-shirt.'
