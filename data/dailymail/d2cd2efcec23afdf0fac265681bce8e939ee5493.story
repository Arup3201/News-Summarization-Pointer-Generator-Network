Lee Tomlin pulled off the prank of the transfer window, as he hinted at a move away from promotion-chasing Middlesbrough on deadline day - only to later insist it was just a joke.

The 26-year-old, who has been in impressive form for Aitor Karanka's side so far this season, gave some Boro fans a bit of a shock after a series of Tweets from his Twitter account indicated he was on his way to Premier League outfit Leicester City.

Tomlin started it off by posting 'It's snowing bad in Leicester', prompting some panicked fans to reply back in less than favourable terms to the midfielder.

Although some realised that Tomlin was having a laugh, he continued with the joke later tweeting 'Sorry pal @liammoore93 took your spot in the changing room' and 'Huth is bigger than I thought'.

He eventually put some worried Boro fans out of their misery tweeting: 'Hahahah only joking lets get promoted this season we can do it #UTB'.

With Leicester currently fighting against relegation in the Premier League and Middlesbrough flying high near the top of the Championship - just one point off the joint  leaders Bournemouth and Derby - such move would have come as a surprise, anyway.
