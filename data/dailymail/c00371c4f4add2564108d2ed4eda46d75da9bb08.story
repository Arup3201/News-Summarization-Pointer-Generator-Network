Claim: Parents who beat their daughters said it was 'acceptable' in their native Nigeria (posed by model)

A mother and father who beat their young daughters with phone chargers and a wooden spoon told a judge it was 'acceptable' in their native Nigeria.

The couple have been spared jail despite social workers uncovering the extent of the abuse on the children - who are all aged under eight - and taking them into care for their protection.

Instead the pair, who moved from Nigeria to Northampton, were handed 180 hours of unpaid work each after they admitted three charges of child cruelty at Northampton Crown Court.

A judge heard they regularly hit their three daughters on the arms and legs, locked them in their rooms when they misbehaved and made one kneel with her hands in the air.

The abuse went undiscovered until a routine interview at school between a social worker and the eldest girl, which was arranged because the family had arrived in Britain from another country.

Prosecutor Mary Loram said the girl revealed she was regularly hit on the back with a phone charger wire, and her parents struck her with their hands on her arms and legs.

The girl told social workers she was battered with a large spoon and locked in her room for long periods of when she misbehaved.

'The child said she was also made to kneel with her hands in the air for a long period of time and then punished if she let them drop,' the prosecutor added.

But Kehinde Atanda, defending, said the charges had come about due to a cultural misunderstanding about 'appropriate chastisement' in Britain.

He said: 'In my client's home country children are punished like this and it is acceptable.'

Hitting a child is always treated as a crime by police, but British law allows parents to use the defence of 'reasonable chastisement' in court.

That means the assault was proportionate to discipline the child - a defence which has been supported by prominent MPs including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

He told the Mail on Sunday in 2013: 'I’m not opposed to smacking. It is to be used occasionally. Sometimes it sends a message – but I don’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school.'

However, all assaults on children that leave bruising, swelling, cuts or grazes have been illegal since the 2004 Children's Act. Any adult found guilty can face up to five years in jail. 

Judge Lynn Tayton ruled that the punishments dished out by the pair were unreasonable, but their behaviour had not been severe enough for them to be sent to jail.

'You thought you were doing the right thing; something that would happen in Nigeria,' she said.

'You thought it was appropriate chastisement.'

Judge Tayton sentenced the man and woman to a community order including 180 hours of unpaid work.

They were also given a three-month curfew from 7pm to 7am.

The children involved have since been taken into temporary care, where they are living with foster carers and have supervised visits from their parents.

It is believed the couple, who the law says must be kept anonymous to protect their children, will fight to regain custody in care proceedings later this month.
