An Australian fashion label has caused a stir for their most recent campaign, which is modelled by a young girl with a skeletal figure.

Manning Cartell subscribers recently received an email containing the three images of the skinny model.

The 'disturbing and distressing' photos were posted on news website Mamamia on Wednesday, reigniting the debate on the fashion industry's role in promoting unhealthy bodies.

The model poses three different looks while she wears a two-piece set which exposes her emaciated limbs.

Website founder Mia Freedman expressed her frustration at the images, describing them as 'the body of a girl who looks like a starving child'.

Mamamia founder Mia Freedman is outraged by the fashion industry's lack of action against emancipated models

'How astonishing is it that nobody involved in this shoot stopped to say, "Hang on. This girl looks incredibly underweight. The clothes literally bunch and hang off her emaciated limbs, child-like torso and non-existent hips. Is that the message we want to send to our customers and the world about our brand?",' she wrote.

One reader, Julie, shared Freedman's outrage.

'Absolute joke! When will the fashion industry wake up! Stop using skinny models that perpetuate false images that girls try to live up to,' she said in response to the Mamamia post.

Another reader, 'Redqueen', wrote: 'What this industry is really saying is: "you can't sit with us until you reach a size 0". They know most women will never look like the stick figures featured in these magazines, it's a never ending treadmill keeping women feeling s**t about themselves.'

Others were more sympathetic towards the model and her size.

'I can't believe people are upset over this girl's body. She is obviously a slim build but does not look dangerously unhealthy,' Liz wrote.

'I look like the girl in the ad. Naturally. I eat, I exercise to keep strong and I just can't gain weight. I find things like this so offensive. I'm sitting here now wondering if people think I'm sick..."or just stupid." I'm neither!' Lala wrote.

Cassi Van Den Dungen made headlines earlier in the year when she walked for Australian designer Alex Perry's show at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney

The 21-year-old looked revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and sunken cheeks

Earlier this year, the body image debate was reignited after a gaunt looking Cassi Van Den Dungen faced backlash after walking for Australian designer Alex Perry's show at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney in April.

The 21-year-old looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self, where she first appeared on television series Australia's Next Top Model, as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and sunken cheeks.

Freedman dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health

Perry later admitted he was wrong to put models like Cassi Van Den Dungen on the runway.

He added that everyone in the fashion industry needs to work together to make a difference.

However since then, Freedman believes nothing's changed.

In Australia, there's currently no code of conduct which requires a certain average Body Mass IndexÂ  for models.

The World Health Organisation considers a BMI below 16 as starvation.

Manning Cartell was founded in 2005 by Sydney sisters Cheryl, Vanessa and Gabrielle Manning.

A spokeswoman for Manning Cartell is yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia.
