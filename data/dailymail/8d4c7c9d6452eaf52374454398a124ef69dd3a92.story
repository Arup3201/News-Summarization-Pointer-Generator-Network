It was a house fit for James Bond.

And whoever buys the former home of Roger Moore will be able to live just like 007 in the sprawling 11-acre property.

Moore lived at Sherwood House when he shot his first three spy movies, which has gone on sale for £4.5million.

This quintessentially English property a short Aston Martin drive from the centre of London is leaving potential buyers shaken and stirred

It's the former home of James Bond star Roger Moore, where he lived when he shot his first three 007 movies in the 1970's

Moore's sprawling former home has a wine cellar - perfect for grabbing a bottle while cooking in this huge kitchen

Aspiring spies can wander through the drawing room, study, library, lobby, and even the boot room at the plush mansion

The huge home lies 20 miles west of central London in the village of Denham, Buckinghamshire.

The 007 star in 'Live And Let Die' has put his plush home on the market

Moore's former home includes five bedrooms, a drawing room, study, library, lobby, boot room, conservatory, games room, gym, a wine cellar and swimming pool.

But just in case the buyer gets tired of all that luxury, they have an annex and guesthouse they can retire to.

Moore was the longest serving James Bond actor, spending 12 years in the role and featuring in seven Bond films from 1973 to 1985.

He lived in the house for eight years between 1970 and 1978, during which time he shot 'Live and Let Die', 'The Man with the Golden Gun' and 'The Spy Who Loved Me'.

Moore sold the estate after his first 
divorce and the house, which was built in 1920, has had two owners since
the actor moved out.

The 
85-year-old is now married to his third wife, Danish-Swedish 
multi-millionaire Kristina 'Kiki' Tholstrup.

He spends his time flitting between his
homes in Monaco and Switzerland.

The 11-acre property, which features a swimming pool set in stunning gardens also has an annexe and guesthouse

Any potential buyers wanting to live the life of one of Her Majesty's Secret Agents will have to find £4.5 million for the property

According to estate agents Savills, the property is a 'fantastic example of an English country house.'

The property has been meticulously maintained during its 90-year history and the whole estate is about the same size of five football fields.

The house is close to Denham Golf Club and just over a mile from train links into London.

The entrance hallway is decorated in dark wood panelling which continues up the giant staircase.

The reception rooms of the library and drawing room share a central chimney breast with an open fire place on either side.

The house is accessed via security gates and approached via a lengthy drive way.

A Savills spokesman said: 'The grounds are superb for family living with space for football pitches, children's play areas, as well as having an outdoor pool and tennis court.

'The gardens are bordered on the Western boundary by an area of woodland with lovely pathways and walks.

'The area immediately to the south of the house is a well maintained formal garden complete with well manicured lawns, beautiful water features and exceptional hedging offering privacy and shelter.'
