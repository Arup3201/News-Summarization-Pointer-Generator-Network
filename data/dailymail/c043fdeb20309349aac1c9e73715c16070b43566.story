An illegal immigrant made it into Britain after clinging to the bottom of a coach bringing school pupils back from France - for 220miles.

The 35-year-old stowaway, from Sudan, risked his life by hanging on to the axle underneath the vehicle all the way from Calais to Birmingham.

He was arrested by police after shocked pupils spotted him after the group arrived back at Perry Beeches Academy in Great Barr, Birmingham, late on Saturday.

Liam Nolan, head of Perry Beeches Academy in Birmingham has hit out at authorities after an illegal immigrant was able to sneak under his school's bus in Calais and cling on to an axle all the way to the Midlands

Executive head Liam Nolan said the man fell out onto the concrete in the school car park suffering from severe exhaustion following his marathon journey.

Mr Nolan said: 'He just stumbled out from underneath the coach, and the teachers looked after him, rang the police and called the headteacher.

'A lot of us today have been thinking about that man, and the pupils have been asking after him.

'He was of no danger at all to the pupils or staff at the school. His interest was not to endanger anyone, but, I presume, to come to the UK to better his own life.'

The drama came at the end of a four-day trip to show pupils the Bayeux Tapestry in Normandy, northern France.

Mr Nolan said the incident could jeopardise future school trips and criticised authorities for failing to spot the man at the French port.

He added: 'Can't we take our children to the Bayeux Tapestry because of the Border Agency? It is outrageous.

'We take the children to historical events and that is being hampered.'

Worried parents also reacted angrily to the incident, saying the stowaway could easily have been a terrorist.

Paula Bowen, 43, said: 'It is very worrying and I'll be thinking twice about letting my daughter go on school trips abroad in future.

'He could have been anyone, its terrifying to think he had been under the bus for all that time.'

Another parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The first coach arrived back about 11pm and people heard a banging noise from the back of the coach.

'We couldn't believe it when a man appeared from underneath it. I am appalled immigrants are even using school trips as a way of sneaking into Britain.'

Tom Brew, 25, whose 12-year-old brother George was on the coach, added: 'What if this guy had a bomb?'

The Port of Calais has seen increased numbers of immigrants in recent months all trying to get to Britain

A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed an investigation had been launched into the incident.

He said: 'Police were called to Perry Beeches School in Great Barr just before 11pm on Saturday 20 September after a man was found on the axle of a coach returning from a school trip to France.

'The 35-year-old from Sudan was arrested and is being dealt with the UK Border Force.'

The government has pledged £12 million to help France tackle the problem of illegal immigrants trying to enter Britain through Calais.

The deal was announced on Saturday by home secretary Theresa May, and France's minister of interior, Bernard Cazeneuve.

Officials in France have even threatened to close the port if more is not done to tackle the issue

It will also see increased co-operation between law enforcement agencies and the UK will give £4million a year for three years to a joint fund.

It will be used to build robust fences and bolster security at the parking area of Calais port, which migrants use as a staging post for efforts to cross the Channel.

Yesterday, Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'The security of the UK border is our first priority, which is why the Government has spent millions of pounds on strengthening controls and upgrading technology at Calais and Coquelles.

'As our border controls become stronger, we are seeing illegal immigrants taking increasingly dangerous risks to enter the UK.

'We are working with the French authorities to help tighten up security even more to stop this from happening.'
