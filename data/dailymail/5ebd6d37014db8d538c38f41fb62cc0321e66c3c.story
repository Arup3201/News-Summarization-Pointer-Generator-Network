Social mobility has stalled in Britain because young people from modest backgrounds lack aspiration and no longer believe they can make it to the top, David Cameron suggested yesterday.

Endorsing his predecessor Sir John Major’s comment that there are too many ‘posh’ people in top jobs, he said the Government and the professions need to move ‘further and faster’ to change that.

Mr Cameron said it was ‘not enough’ to provide children from poor families with ‘equality of opportunity’, as so many are not confident enough to seize the chances presented to them.

Sir John Major, who rose from a council estate to Downing Street, said it was 'shocking' that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs

Singling out the Army and the judiciary for special criticism, the Prime Minister called for senior figures in those professions to actively ‘find’ poor but talented students and ‘get them to raise aspirations’, rather than sitting back and simply waiting for them to apply.

‘I do believe it’s not good enough just to make changes and sit back,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to get out there and try and attract talented people. Don’t just open the door and say we are in favour of equality of opportunity – that’s not enough. You’ve got to get out there and find them, win them over, get them to raise aspirations and get them to think they can get all the way to the top.’

The comments, which come after Mr Cameron said many British youngsters are less qualified for the world of work than immigrants, are likely to anger some voters. He was educated at Eton and Oxford and presides over a Cabinet packed with millionaires.

Sir John Major, who rose from a council estate to Downing Street, said last week that it was ‘truly shocking’ that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs in politics and other professions.

‘In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class,’ he said. ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’

Speaking yesterday as he flew to India ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka, Mr Cameron said: ‘I agree with John Major that we need a far more socially mobile country, and that is something we need to do far more about.

‘He’s raised a very important issue. You only have to look at the make-up of Parliament, the judiciary, the Army, the media, it’s not as diverse, there’s not as much social mobility as there needs to be.

‘I want to see a Britain where, no matter where you come from, what God you worship, the colour of your skin, the community you belong to, you can get to the top in television, you can get to the top in the judiciary, you can get to the top in the armed services, you can get to the top in politics.

‘We are making some progress in those areas, that is not fast enough, we need to go further and faster. So I absolutely agree with the thrust of what John Major said.’

Mr Cameron defended his appointment of public schoolboys to his Cabinet and private office staff but boasted that he has increased the number of ethnic minority MPs in the Conservative Party.

‘I employ people on the basis of: are they the right person to do the job, and have they got the skills and talents? I’m obviously choosing in terms of Parliament from the current pool of MPs. There’s always more that could be done.

‘In some areas I’ve had some success. There were no MPs on my side of British Indian or British Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, now there are. We’re making some progress. Is it fast enough? No.’

The Prime Minister also pointed out that he appointed Patrick McLoughlin as Transport Secretary. ‘I don’t think the last Labour government had a former working miner in the Cabinet,’ he said.

Mr Cameron insisted the Government has already done much to improve social mobility, citing the pupil premium, which channels extra money to schools with poorer pupils, improved childcare.

Despite the increase in university tuition fees, ‘the number of people going to university from deprived backgrounds is actually at record levels’, he said.

But Labour frontbencher Kevin Brennan said: ‘David Cameron has shown shocking complacency towards the one million young people unemployed under him.

‘Now he tells them that they lack aspiration. It is he who is locking out opportunity for the next generation and standing up only for a privileged few.’

Former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, now a social mobility adviser to the Government, said ‘elitism is entrenched’ in British society – but insisted Sir John was wrong to blame the situation on the last Labour government.

‘Deep-rooted inequality and flatlining mobility have been decades in the making,’ he said. ‘Some say it is an impossible task to undo them. I do not succumb to that pessimism.’
