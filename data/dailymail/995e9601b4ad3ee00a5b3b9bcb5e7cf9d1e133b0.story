Singer Jessie J is one of 20 generous celebrities lending her support to a new BBC Children In Need fundraising campaign.

Actresses Emilia Fox and Helena Bonham Carter are also endorsing the Show You Care With The Lindt Bear campaign, which aims to raise £100,000 for Children In Need by auctioning limited edition porcelain Lindt bears signed by celebrities.

To help reach this target, 20 celebrities have signed a gold porcelain version of the trademark chocolate Lindt bear for an online auction, which will take place in phases on eBay over the course of five weeks.

Singers Tom Jones, Olly Murs, Emma Bunton and Alexandra Burke are also taking part.

Each week, four of the little bears will be added to the auction site in a sale that will last for ten days with 100 per cent of proceeds going to the charity.

As part of the campaign, Jessie J, Emilia Fox, Arlene Phillips and 
Angela Griffin took part in a  photo shoot with renowned 
fashion photographer Lorenzo Aguis.

Jessie J said: 'The Show You Care With The 
Lindt Bear campaign is a great way to raise money for BBC Children in 
Need, it's a great charity.

'I was so happy to be able to be involved to 
help raise funds. Make sure you go online and get bidding! And eat lots 
of chocolate!'

Meanwhile, Spice Girl Emma Bunton's bear's top bid is £51, DJ Sara Cox's is at £31, and Helena Bonham Carter's is at £43.

But if you’re not lucky or quick 
enough to secure a signed celebrity bear of your own, don't panic - you 
can also 'share a bear' on Facebook.

Upon reaching 25,000 Facebook 
shares, £25,000 will be donated to the Children in Need fund, another 
way you can help Lindt raise money for this fantastic charity.

The Lindt team said: 'We are thrilled to be supporting BBC Children In 
Need this year, a truly worthy charity close to the hearts of all at 
Lindt.

'Our loveable chocolate Lindt bear was launched with a resounding 
success last year and the celebrity signed versions we're sure are going
to be just as popular!

'Get online to support your favourite celebrity 
and bid for their signed limited edition Lindt bear, we wish you the 
very best of luck in the auction.'
