A veteran TV anchor in Denver, Colorado, was rushed to the hospital and underwent reconstructive surgery after a dog that appeared on her morning show bit her in the face during a live TV segment.

Max, an 85-pound Argentine Mastiff, sunk his teeth into Kyle Dyer's face when she bent down to pet him Wednesday morning during a morning show segment on KUSA-TV.

Ms Dyer, who had been working at the station for over 15 years, had reconstructive surgery on Wednesday and is going to be out for several weeks while she recovers.

Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.'

The dog, whose full name is Warrior Maximus, 
recently survived a harrowing rescue from a freezing pond and was on 
the show as part of a mini-reunion between him and his rescuers.

'I know that she is a great journalist
who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary 
Shapiro said in a note to fans.

The station's news chopper captured 
video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday 
after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out.

'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said.

'Max and his owner spent about 45 
minutes in the newsroom before they went on the air, and many members of
the staff greeted them and petted Max. He seemed perfectly normal.

'During the interview Kyle petted 
him, and talked to the two guest. At the very end of the segment, Max 
snapped at Kyle for whatever reason and got some of her lip.'

Bitten: Ms Dyer was rushed to the local hospital in Denver and has been examined by a trauma team to determine how to repair the damage to her face

Fined: Max was locked up for observation because he didn't have rabies shots and his owner was fined by animal control officers

Now, Max has been caged by animal control officers and his owner, Michael Robinson has been fined.

The station says Miss Dyer, who is 
married and is a mother, is in fair condition, recovering from the bite 
at at Denver hospital.

Argentine mastiffs, also known as the Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have gone after wild boars and pumas.

While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs.

The breed first appeared in 1928 as a relative of the Cordoba Fighting Dog.

The dogs are very possessive and protect both their physical territory and their owners by using their strength and sharp teeth.

Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado.

Aurora is the neighbouring city to Denver, where the broadcast took place.

The animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute them.

A trauma team is evaluating the injuries to her face.

Mr Robinson says he was walking Max Monday when he saw a coyote and ran off after it.Â 

Authorities
say Max spend 20 minutes swimming in the pond before a firefighter in a
dry suit dove into the frigid waters and pulled him to safety.

The TV station aired the harrowing rescue and invited the firefighter, Mr Robinson and Max into their studios Wednesday morning for a reunion.

That's when Max attacked Ms Dyer.

The station says the attack was not broadcast, but it later released a short clip of the bite.

Denver Animal Control Director Doug Kelley told CBS4 Denver Ms Dyer's injury was 'a pretty major bite.'

Station executives confirmed that Ms Dyer was out of surgery at around 2pm Wednesday.

'She's
doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her 
and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis.

'Kyle-
of all people!- is the biggest dog lover and even yesterday we were 
talking about how, as dog lovers, we think every dog belongs to us.

'Kyle will be back in a period of weeks- probably several but she will be back.'

Max, who did not have proper rabies vaccinations, will be quarantined 10 days to ensure he is healthy.

Mr Johnson was cited for a dog bite violation, having the dog off his leash and not having proper vaccinations.

When Mr Shapiro posted his lengthy 
update on Ms Dyer's condition on the station's Facebook page, fans and 
viewers responded with 928 'likes' to the fact that she was recovering 
and doing well.

There were also 451 comments, and 
while there certainly were a significant amount of well-wishers, there 
was also a surprising number of angry respondents who were siding with 
the dog.

'I totally agree with all those saying it was her own fault and she should have known better,' wrote Cassandra Hughes Kramer.

'The dog was being a dog, defending 
itself in a stressful situation. He didn't jump on her and maul her, he 
nipped her lip....and she shouldn't have been trying to kiss him. Maybe 
it's a hard lesson to learn, but hopefully she learned it.'

Treatment: Ms Dyer is now recovering after surgery Wednesday afternoon at Denver Health Medical Center

'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said

Others were extremely upset at the thought of the dog being put down- which has not been formally suggested- and said that the station should ensure that does not happen.

'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake?Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto.

Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.'
