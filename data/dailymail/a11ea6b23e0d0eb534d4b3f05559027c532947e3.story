Jailed: Rhiannon Brooker, 30, has been jailed for three and a half years after she falsely accused her boyfriend of rape so she would have an excuse for failing her legal exams

A lying law graduate has been labelled 'utterly wicked' after she falsely accused her boyfriend of rape so she would have an excuse for failing her legal exams.

Rhiannon Brooker, 30, has been jailed for three and a half years after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by claiming Paul Fensome, 46, forced her to have sex with him on five occasions.

The Birmingham law graduate even faked injuries to suggest Mr Fensome had beaten her, and alleged that he caused her to have a miscarriage by punching her in the stomach.

Bristol Crown Court heard that Brooker falsified the allegations because her party lifestyle led her to fail her bar assessments.

She repeatedly told an exam committee that her performance suffered from 'extenuating circumstances'.

Mr Fensome, a 6ft 8in heavy metal fan, was arrested, charged and held in custody for 36 days before police realised he had clear alibis for the dates of the alleged rapes.

Brooker, of Frampton Cotterell, South Gloucestershire, denied 20 charges of perverting the course of justice between May 2011 and January 2012.

But a jury of 10 men and two women convicted her of 12 charges - five false rape claims, six assaults and one of false imprisonment - earlier this month.

Jurors were discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the eight remaining charges.

Judge Julian Lambert said Brooker, who did not wish to be present in court as the sentence was passed, had lied in an 'utterly wicked' way.

'Rhiannon Brooker was a bright star and shining example of what can be achieved by those who lack special privileges,' the judge said.

'All that went terribly wrong with tragic consequences when she began to lie. These lies had a terrible, corrosive effect. The effect was like ripples spreading through a pool of sadness.

'The effect continues today. Rhiannon Brooker lied and lied and lied again and was relentless in her attempts to mislead.'

Judge Lambert said Brooker began to circulate false stories about being sexually abused by Mr Fensome in 2011.

Her lies led to Mr Fensome’s arrest, 
charge and detention in Horfield Prison, where he was subjected to abuse
 by fellow inmates.

'She does bear the ultimate responsibility for circulating then doggedly pursuing false rape allegations,' the judge said.

'Prison
 is a terrible humiliation and degradation, particularly for a person of
 previous good character. The irony is that is what she inflicted on her
 former partner.'

Judge 
Lambert said he had sat through 'hour after hour' of video interviews in
 which Brooker told officers how she had been raped, during the 
eight-week trial.

'What I 
observed was someone of high intelligence who went to significant 
devious lengths to pervert the course of public justice,' he said.

'The conduct was utterly cynical, calculating, determined and repeated.'

Judge
 Lambert said two people suffered 'dreadfully' as a consequence of 
Brooker’s actions - Mr Fensome and Brooker’s nine-month-old baby, who 
cannot be named for legal reasons.

'What the defendant did here was cold, calculated, sustained, repeated and under any analysis utterly wicked,' he added.

Judge Lambert sentenced Brooker to three and a half years for each of the five false rape allegations, to run concurrently.

He imposed nine-month sentences for 
the remaining six false assault allegations and one charge of false 
imprisonment, also to run concurrently.

Prosecutor
 David Bartlett had told the court that Brooker’s actions could have 
resulted in Mr Fensome, an innocent man, receiving a substantial prison 
sentence.

'There can be no doubt that if Mr 
Fensome was convicted of five rapes, six assaults and one false 
imprisonment, he would have faced a very long term of imprisonment, 
measured in double figures,' Mr Bartlett said.

'Despite his good character, a sentence of life imprisonment would have been considered.'

'Prison is a terrible humiliation and 
degradation, particularly for a person of previous good character. The 
irony is that is what she inflicted on her former partner.'

Mr
 Bartlett said Brooker submitted a statement containing the false 
allegations to her tutor at the University of West of England on April 
11 2011.

Police were called and began their investigation on May 24 that year, with Mr Fensome arrested on August 1.

Brooker
 continued her lies in interviews with police between August 2 and 
August 22 and further interviews in November that year.

Mr
 Fensome spent 36 days in custody, after which he was subjected to an 
electronic tag and curfew and had to report to police by phone call six 
times per day.

In January 2012, prosecutors offered no evidence against Mr Fensome as phone records and work rosters from his railway signalman job proved he could not have committed the attacks.

Mr Bartlett said Brooker even used a secret second phone to send abusive messages to herself - then pretended they were from Mr Fensome.

'Miss Brooker has shown no remorse,' Mr Bartlett said.

In a victim impact statement, Mr Fensome, who has since received £38,000 in compensation from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'My life has been turned upside-down and ripped apart. My family and I have been put through an immense amount of stress and heartache, which continues to the present day.

'We cannot come to terms with why we have been put through this. If I had not been able to prove my whereabouts, I could have been locked away for something that I had not done which would have lost me my career, my home - everything I have worked so hard for.

'Please be assured I have the utmost sympathy for anyone who has been through a genuine attack but I also feel strongly that false claims must be dealt with strongly to send the message that such acts will not be tolerated.'
