Mercedes

Engine: Mercedes

 

 44 Lewis Hamilton (GBR)

Age: 30

Grand Prix: 148

Wins: 33

7 Nico Rosberg (Ger) 

Age: 29

Grand Prix: 166

Wins: 8 

Hamilton has got the confidence, but we do know that he can be fragile — his gaffe during qualifying for the British Grand Prix last year is a good example. Rosberg has a lot to prove, but he will undoubtedly learn from his mistakes. He will come back stronger.

Red Bull 

Engine: Renault

 

3 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus)

Age: 25

Grand Prix: 69

Wins: 3 

26 Daniil Kvyat (Rus)

Age: 20

Grand Prix: 19

Wins: 0

Williams 

Engine: Mercedes

 

19 Felipe Massa (Bra)

Age: 33

Grand Prix: 212

Wins: 11

77 Valtteri Bottas  

Age: 25

Grand Prix: 38

Wins: 0 

The flair and experience of Massa is balanced by the steely determination of Bottas, who I expect to lead the charge to Mercedes on a consistent basis. Massa is a great character and I hope he gets some good results, such as his pole position in Austria last year.

Ferrari

5 Sebastian Vettel (Ger)

Age: 27

Grand Prix: 139

Wins: 39

7 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin)

Age: 35

Grand Prix: 213

Wins: 20 

There is less pressure on Vettel because it is a fresh challenge. It is the first time he has flown the nest and I expect to see him develop. Kimi was fantastic at races in 2013 but at the same events last year he was nowhere. The car will be better and I hope it gives him what he needs.

McLaren

Engine: Honda

 

14 Fernando Alonso (Spa)

Age: 33

Grand Prix's 236

Wins: 32

22 Jenson Button (GBR)

Age: 35

Grand Prix's 268

Wins: 15  

All team bosses nominated Alonso as the driver they would want, but he clearly has problems. Keeping Jenson was right, too, but the car is not where it needs to be. They finished fifth in 2014 with the best engine but have changed to Honda, so my gut says they will not improve.

Force India

Engine: Mercedes

 

27 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) 

Age: 27

Grand Prix: 77

Wins: 0

11 Sergio Perez (Mex) 

Age: 25

Grand Prix: 77

Wins: 0 

Hulkenberg is one of the stars but he has not been in the environment to win races, and I don’t know if he’ll achieve that at Force India. Last year Perez outshone him. Hulkenberg needs to be dominant if he wants to join a big team like Perez did at McLaren.

Toro Rosso

Engine: Renault

 

55 Carlos Sainz Jnr (Spa) 

Age: 20

Grand Prix: 0

Wins: 0 

33 Max Verstappen (Hol)

Age: 17

Grand Prix: 0

Wins: 0 

It is the youngest driver pairing in F1 history, but I like it. With greater experience, Jnr is who you would expect to lead the team, but I think we are going to get a big surprise from Max. He hardly made a mistake in testing, doesn’t miss apexes or lock brakes and looks in control.

Lotus

Engine: Mercedes

 

8 Romain Grosjean (Fra)

Age: 28

Grand Prix: 64

Wins: 0  

13 Pastor Maldonado (Ven)

Age: 29

Grand Prix: 77

Wins: 1

I’m a big Grosjean fan, but the car was not very good last year and he struggled. If the team can deliver on performance — they have changed from Renault to Mercedes engines — we will see him up there. Pastor can deliver but he also crashes. He must reduce those incidents.

Sauber

Engine: Ferrari

 

9 Marcus Ericsson (Swe)

Age: 24

Grand Prix: 16

Wins: 0

12 Felipe Nasr (Bra)

Age: 22

Grand Prix: 0

Wins: 0

A new driver line-up, with Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez leaving. Marcus Ericsson failed to set the world alight at Caterham in 2014, while Brazilian rookie Felipe Nasr battled for last year’s GP2 championship. Each brings £12m in sponsorship to the cash-strapped outfit.

Manor

Engine: Ferrari

- Will Stevens (GBR) 

Age: 23

Grand Prix: 1

Wins: 0 

Will Stevens has got his chance but the big story here is that the team are on the grid and that really makes me smile. I am very pleased for all the guys there because they are racers with real passion. Why not give Paul di Resta a chance alongside the former Caterham driver? He would be exactly the type of character that Manor needs.
