Leeds United’s players failed to receive their wages as scheduled on Friday but club owner Massimo Cellino insists there is no lack of cash and a banking technicality is to blame.

The club’s bank account has been frozen because Leeds face a winding- up petition, filed by former managing director David Haigh, over money he claims he is owed by the club.

Leeds are confident the petition will be thrown out when heard in court on 9 June. Haigh, meanwhile, remains in a Dubai jail, accused but not yet charged of fraud and embezzlement.

A Leeds spokesperson said: ‘FA rules prohibit the payment of players’ wages from a personal bank account. We are making strides to unfreeze the club’s bank account.’

A source close to Cellino said: ‘The players will get their money, definitely. It’s there but it’s just a case of working out how to get it to them.’

Leeds’ immediate future is likely to remain chaotic with Cellino preparing for a face-to-face showdown with manager Brian McDermott and his squad on Monday as Cellino assesses who will stay at the club for next season.

It seems unlikely McDermott will remain in his current role but Cellino is wary of sacking him if that will entail a big compensation payout. He could stay in a different role although is unlikely to want that.
