Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers was warned in the Commons today that the threat downgrade could be 'counter-productive'

Ministers were today accused of being ’premature’ in downgrading the terror threat in posed by dissident republicans from Northern Ireland.

The Home Office downgraded the threat for Great Britain from substantial to moderate, meaning an attack is possible but unlikely.

But Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader in Westminster, warned against any ‘complacency’ by security services.

In a statement to MPs, Home Secretary Theresa May said the decision to downgrade was taken by the security service not ministers.

She added: ‘Today the Security Service reduced the threat level to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate.

‘This means that a terrorist attack is possible, but not likely. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism remains at substantial, which means that an attack is a strong possibility.

‘The threat level to Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely. Neither of these two levels has changed.’

However, Mr Dodds told the Commons that many people will be concerned that the downgrade ‘may be both premature and somewhat counter-productive’.

He urged newly-appointed Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers to give an assurance that ‘there won't be any reduction in security or any complacency on the part of the security forces’.

Ms Villiers replied that in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the Government was focused on defeating terrorism and would ‘use all means at our disposal to do that’.

Ms Villiers replied: "I can give him that assurance that we will continue to be vigilant in the face of the continuing threat in relation to Northern Ireland-related terrorism.

‘He will appreciate that the change announced today as he says relates to Great Britain, the threat level in Northern Ireland remains at severe.

‘In both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the Government is focused on defeating terrorism and we will use all means at our disposal to do that.’

Ms Villiers added that her office would ‘certainly be in discussions’ with the chief constable Police Service of Northern Ireland) and the Treasury about extending the £200 million Treasury reserve funding announced in 2010 to help deal with the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland.

The threat assessment was increased in September 2010 after Jonathan Evans, the director-general of MI5, warned that dissident Irish republicans could attempt a new wave of terrorist attacks on the British mainland.
