Stoke striker Bojan Krkic continues to step up his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, posting a video on his Instagram account proving his progress.

The 24-year-old suffered the injury during Stoke’s 4-1 FA Cup win at Rochdale at the end of January and subsequently had surgery on February 11 back in Barcelona.

The video shows the Spaniard running on the spot in a swimming pool and then on the treatment table with some peculiar apparatus assessing his leg muscles.

However the Stoke forward is all smiles in the quick video and hopes to be back in light training by May.

Since surgery last month the former Barcelona striker has documented his recovery on social media, accompanying this Instagram video with the caption ‘#Day27 #ComingBackStronger’

Bojan began to hit top form for Mark Hughes’ side with five goals this season before the injury struck and is evidently determined to return in the same form.

Providing that his recovery continues without complications, Bojan will be fully fit and ready to go on the first day of pre-season for next campaign with the Potters.
