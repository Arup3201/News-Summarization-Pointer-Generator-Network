Michelle Obama put her campaign to end childhood obesity on hold as she helped cook up some turkey, stuffing and mac and cheese.

The First Lady dubbed herself ‘hostess in chief’ as she welcomed the country into her family’s home for the holidays.

‘This is the time when I throw “Let's Move” out the window for a moment, and get that mac and cheese. Everybody deserves their mac and cheese,’ she told The Today Show this week.

In her seasonal role Mrs. Obama oversaw the festivities and hearty cooking, making herself available to welcome the ‘thousands and thousands of visitors’ that stopped by the White House for a holiday visit.

‘It’s the one time of the year where we really open up the White House,’ she said.

‘It’s beautiful, everything looks great, the smells are magnificent, so it’s just special, and I feel very blessed to be able to be here during these times.’

First daughters Natasha and Malia Ann love the fact that the house is full of people, friends and music, Mrs. Obama told Today Show correspondent Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former U.S. President George W. Bush.

The First Lady welcomed Jenna back home before they sat down for their interview.

Mrs. Obama, 48, said she appreciates the opportunity to turn a spotlight on America’s military families, ‘which is something that we try to do every year through the holidays.’

‘I try to remember that this is the time when the White House is truly the people’s house,’ she said.

Before the festivities at the White House came to a close, the Obama family and their dog Bo headed to Hawaii -- where President Barack Obama grew up – to celebrate Christmas.

The Obama family will perform in a talent show while they are there, Mrs. Obama said. She said that she doesn’t know what kind of performance she will do yet and that she wouldn’t disclose it to the public if she did.

President Obama, who was recently named TIME magazine's ‘Person of the Year,’ will then come back to more negotiations with Republicans in Washington to avoid a fiscal cliff dilemma in the New Year.
