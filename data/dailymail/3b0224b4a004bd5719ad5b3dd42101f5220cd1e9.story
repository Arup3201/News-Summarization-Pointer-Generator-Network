For Royal Marine Andy Grant an operation to amputate part of his leg after he stepped on a bomb in Aghanistan had a surprising consequence. 

The Liverpool fan from Plymouth in Devon woke up to be told by his doctor that while the operation to remove his leg below the knee had gone well, his tattoo in tribute to the football club had suffered.

Instead of reading 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the father-of-three discovered it now had the word 'Alone' missing after a flap of his skin had to be moved.

Former Royal Marine Andy Grant had his leg amputated after he stood on an IED in Afghanistan and doctors had to move a flap of his skin to cover the bone, changing his Liverpool tattoo to read 'You'll Never Walk'

But rather than let the amputation hamper him, Mr Grant said he was inspired by the 'You'll Never Walk' tattoo to become a medal-winning runner and plans to compete in the paralympic games. He also uses the anecdote in motivational speeches. 

'It is ironic that it says I will never walk as I have gone on to run 10k in 40 mins,' said the 26-year-old. 

'At the moment I am just two minutes off a record for the 10k for a single leg amputee and I have that in my sights.

'It is bizarre and I just laugh about it. But it adds to my story I guess.

'The fact is that regardless of what the words says, the operation allowed me to walk and run and do so much else. You have got to see the funny side of it.' 

As well as completing several runs Mr Grant won gold medals at the Invictus Games and has abseiled down the shard.

The tattoo, originally reading 'You'll Never Walk Alone' now reads 'You'll Never Walk', which the father of three said he finds funny and has used to inspire him to try and complete record-breaking runs 

Mr Grant had the operation four years ago and endured vigorous rehabilitation sessions for 18 months.

In 2009 he was serving with 45 Commando when he accidentally stepped on an IED. This severed his femoral artery and took out a 'big chunk' of his thigh.

He broke both the fibula and tibia in his right leg and lost 6cm of bone.

But two years after he decided to have his right leg amputated after watching comrades with similar injuries enjoying activities with their prosthetic legs.

He can still recall the conversation he had with surgeon Anthony Lambert when he woke up.

Mr Grant suffered was a 20-year-old commando in Afghanistan when he stepped on the IED

The blast severed Mr Grant's femoral artery, took out a section of his thigh and broke bones in his lower leg

Mr Lambert told him: 'Well, we had to raise a flap of skin on your leg to cover the bone ends... and it's meant that your Liverpool Football Club tattoos are a bit messed up.

'The Liver bird is a bit all over the place, and your tattoo now says "you'll never walk."'

The date of his blast, February 3, and the date of his amputation, November 25, are both anniversaries that Andy marks.

He said: 'I am very proud of my achievements and like to turn my story around to try and inspire other people about what they can achieve in the face of adversity.

Mr Grant had the amputation in 2010 and now competes in 10k races and does motivational speaking

'I am all about looking forward. I cannot undo what happened and I have no regrets. I am all about making the best of a bad situation.'

Mr Lambert now works as an inspirational speaker, going to events around the world. He has also determined to keep up his fitness. 

He added: 'I have three children and an amazing family, I'm looking to row across the Atlantic, and I'm hoping to be picked for the Paralympics next year.

'My life has moved on in an amazing way and it's all down to what happened.

'It's given me more of a life than I probably would have had.'
