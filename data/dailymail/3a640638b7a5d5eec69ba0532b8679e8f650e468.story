Jailed for a year: Gordon Burton (pictured) agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught flouting road regulations

More than a dozen drivers paid one man to accept their points for offences - before police realised what had happened when they saw his licence had 49 points, a court has heard.

Gordon Burton, 45, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught speeding, flouting a red light, driving without a seatbelt or using a mobile in the car over a six-year period.

Police only became suspicious when it was realised that Burton had 49 penalty points on his licence - the majority of which were not his.

Officers noticed that they had received many notices of intended prosecution - sent when a vehicle is seen or photographed committing a driving offence - naming Burton.

A huge amount of documentation relating to him between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed, and the scam was uncovered.

Drivers are generally banned from the road when they accrue 12 penalty points.

But now, six of the group have been jailed and most of the others given suspended sentences after admitting perverting the course of justice at Newcastle Crown Court. One of them had his sentencing adjourned.

The 13 men and one woman include a council worker, retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer, roofing business owner, scaffolder and director of a construction company.

Judge Deborah Sherwin said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician Chris Huhne,  who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003.

Sentenced: Businessman Alan McGreevy (left), 53, was sent to prison for five months, while Alan Russell (right), 27, a director of a construction company, was jailed for ten months

She told the group: ‘People need to realise that offences of this sort may seem easy and victimless, however, they are viewed seriously by the court. I accept their remorse has been demonstrated.

‘I accept they’re isolated incidents, unlikely to be repeated. I also accept that, at the time, it was not appreciated how seriously the court would view this offending.

‘You would come to realise how seriously that court takes matters such as these by press articles into the case of Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce in 2013.’

Anthony Dunnen, prosecuting, said after the 14 drivers were caught breaking road regulations, they got in touch with Burton and he agreed to take their points for them.

In court: Hotel manager David Tate (left), 53, was sent to prison for eight months, while William Thirwell (right), 68, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months

Involved: Kenneth Smith (left), 57, the owner of a roofing business, and bus driver Alan Riddell (right), 27, both got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months

Notices of intended prosecution are sent by the relevant police force to the registered keeper of the vehicle. That person then has to state whether they were driving the vehicle at the time and, if not, who was. The recipient then has to sign, date and return the notice.

Council worker: Susan Latimer, 53, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months

The court heard that, when each of the defendants received their notices of intended prosecution, they named Burton as the driver at the time of the offence.

Mr Dunnen added: ‘Police began investigating this matter as a result of a large number of occasions they received a notice of intended prosecution naming Burton and a large quantity of documentation relating to Burton between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed.

‘Photos taken by speed cameras also showed Burton was not in fact driving some vehicles at the relevant time. There was also one incident where further details emerged from mobile phone exchanges between the defendants Burton, David Tate and Kenneth Walker.’

Mr Dunnen said that one text message, sent by Walker to Tate, in January 2012 said: ‘I need the guy’s full details who is taking the points ASAP, mate. Is he covered with insurance?’

All the mitigating barristers said their clients were all remorseful and were lightly, if at all, convicted. The court heard they all had jobs and had not realised the severity of their actions.

Katherine Dunn, for Burton, said he was a chronic alcoholic. She said: ‘He has difficulties with literacy, numeracy and communication.  

No immediate jail term: Andrew Weeks (left), 30, a plasterer, and retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer Joseph Hamilton (right), 72, both got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months

Infamous case: The judge said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician Chris Huhne (pictured), who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003

'He thought many of these defendants were his friends. He is clearly a vulnerable individual who is described by many as having a limited intellectual capacity.’

Scaffolder: Phillip Barnett, 51, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months

Gordon Burton, 45, was sent to prison for 12 months, while scaffolder Phillip Barnett, 51, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Robert Fish, 43, was sent to prison for eight months, Stephen Grieveson, 51, was jailed for six months, and retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer Joseph Hamilton, 72, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Susan Latimer, 53, a council worker, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. And Robert Dunbar, 52, a plastering business owner, had his sentence adjourned.

Businessman Alan McGreevy, 53, was sent to prison for five months, while Alan Russell, 27, a director of a construction company, was jailed for ten months. 

Kenneth Smith, 57, an owner of a roofing business, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and hotel manager David Tate, 53, was sent to prison for eight months. 

William Thirwell, 68, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and Kenneth Walker, 61, a manager of a property investment company, got a six-month jail term, suspended for 12 months.
