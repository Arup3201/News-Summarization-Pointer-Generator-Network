Despite people in their 60s embracing late-life marriage like never before veteran actress Maureen Lipman is not planning to join their ranks.

According to Jack Malvern of The Times newspaper, the 68-year-old stage and TV star 'can't really see the point' in remarrying new love Guido Castro.

The frank admission was made by the actress in an interview with The Lady, which will land on shelves this Friday.

Lipman was widowed ten years ago when her husband Jack Rosenthal passed away from cancer, but has found love again with the 70-year-old retired computer engineer. Mr Castro fled persecution in Egypt in 1956 and came to study at the University of Oxford.

So why does the actress not see marriage in their future? 'I could if we were going to be left without a penny or were going to have children, but I can't really see the point of people of my age getting married - that's about ritual or if you're really religious,' The Times reports.

'I'm profoundly Jewish but I'm not really profoundly observant - it worries me, marriage, as a concept'.

Currently starring in the West End production of Daytona, Lipman leaves no doubt as to whether she's found the real deal. 'He's wonderful, adorable, sweet lovely man and it's love. I'm bloody lucky to have two men in my life who have really loved me,' she says.

She also speak candidly about her experience of losing her husband. 'There's no PhD in widowhood. When it's very new you are often 
surrounded by friends, but there's a point when people think you should 
pull yourself together and get over it. That point comes for some after 
12 months, or after 12 years and for some people, never.'

She also admits that in certain ways she is full of remorse about her marriage, something she says will never go away. The actress explains that you can never do as much as you can to make a 
marriage work and never take back cruel comments or 
uncaring jibes.

It may come as no surprise that Lipman, known for her stirring performances and her wit, used humour to cope with her husband's suffering and passing.

In the interview she says 
she sometimes had to take her husband to the Royal Marsden Hospital dressed in 
full oriental costume during her role in Thoroughly Modern Milli and describes
standing next to his bed with chopsticks in her hair and eyes pulled up at the sides 
while her husband was hooked up to a drip.

She also said comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm gave her and her children an outlet during the painful time and says they'd watch two episodes a day.

Figures from the Office of National Statistics found marriage is most on the rise amongst people aged between 65 and 69 but these stars are bucking the trend:

Mick Jagger remained unmarried despite 13 years with L'Wren Scott (who passed away in March)

Dame Judi Dench lost her husband Michael Williams in 2001 and has said she does not want to remarry

Sir Michael Gambon, 73, has two children with his long-term partner Phillipa Hart but is still married to wife Anne

Oprah Winfrey, 60, has been with Stedman Graham since 1986 but has said that marriage is not on the cards

Jane Fonda, 76, met Richard Perry in 2009 but has no plans to marry for a fourth time
