This is the astonishing moment a biker went crashing into the back of a car at 70mph before landing in a standing position on top of its roof.

The man, riding in Belarus, seemed on course for certain injury or death after he was catapulted through the air and forced into an involuntary somersault.

But amazingly, he lands perfectly on to the moving vehicle - in a standing finish that would make an Olympic athlete proud.

The spectacular footage was caught on a camera attached to the dashboard of a car travelling behind.

The video, which has already been seen by millions, has had many calling it a fake  but Belarus' media have insisted it is genuine  - even quoting local police who are said to have confirmed the incident.

They say that the BMW had tried to pull into the fast lane just as the Suzuki travelling at a much higher speed attempted to do the same. 

After landing on top of the vehicle, the biker instantly converts to surf-mode in a desperate attempt to keep his balance.

As the car comes to a stop the biker can be seen climbing off - apparently completely unhurt.

Despite the collision taking place on July 30 the video was only posted online this week.

Local government spokesman Eugene Zilina also confirmed the incident and said: 'He was incredibly lucky, I wouldn't have believed it was real if I had not spoken to police who were at the scene.' 

The crash took place on a bridge over the Dnieper River on Koroleva Street in Mogilev, a city in eastern Belarus, about 76 kilometres from the border with Russia's Smolensk Oblast.
