Taliban fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades stormed a prison in north west Pakistan and freed 400 prisoners, it emerged today.

The raid by more than 100 fighters was a dramatic display of the strength of the insurgency gripping the nuclear-armed country.

Police said at least 20 of the inmates set loose were 'very dangerous'.

Authorities fear the escaped prisoners may now rejoin the fight, giving momentum and a propaganda boost to a movement that has killed thousands of Pakistani officials and ordinary citizens since 2007.

The attackers battled their way into the prison before dawn in the city of Bannu close to the Afghan border and near Peshawar.

Bannu prison superintendent Zahid Khan said they used explosives and hand grenades to knock down the main gates and two walls.

'They were carrying modern and heavy weapons,' said Mr Khan. 'They fired rockets.'

Once inside the building, the attackers headed straight to the area of the prison where death-row prisoners were being kept, he said.

Police officer Shafique Khan said they fought with guards for around two hours, setting part of the prison on fire before freeing the 380 inmates, including at least 20 'very dangerous Taliban militants'.

The raid took place in Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the early morning hours

Miian Iftikhar Hussain, the provincial information minister, said the militants first set up the roadblocks around the prison and then broke in through the main gate

One escaped prisoner, Adnan Rashid, was on death row for his involvement in an assassination attempt against former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, said Zahid Khan.

The prison in Bannu housed 944 inmates.

A Taliban spokesman, Asimullah Mehsud, claimed the movement's fighters freed 1,200 of their comrades. The group is known to make exaggerated claims.

Where the jail is

Pakistan's military has launched a series of operations against the Pakistani Taliban group in the northwest, where it is strongest and has forged alliances with al-Qaida and other transnational militant movements based there along the Afghan border.

The movement is closely linked to the Afghan Taliban, which is battling U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan.

Soldiers and police have killed or arrested hundreds of militants, but the insurgency has proved resilient.

Insurgents have carried out suicide bombings and other attacks across the country in retaliation, raising doubts in some quarters over whether the county can survive.

Prison breakouts like the one Sunday have been rare.

Bannu city is the main gateway to North Waziristan, the most militant-infested region along the border.
