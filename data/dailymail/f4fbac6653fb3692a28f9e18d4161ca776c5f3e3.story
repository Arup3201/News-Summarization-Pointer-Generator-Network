After nearly a year at sea and having sailed more than 40,000 miles across the globe, this is the moment competitors from the Clipper Round the World sailing race arrived back into London.

Passing underneath Tower Bridge in central London, the race was won by the Henri Lloyd, captained by Canadian skipper Eric Holden, with the GREATBritain in second place and the OneDDL hanging on in third.

Thousands of spectators lined the banks of the River Thames to welcome home 270 international amateur crew on 12 70-ft yachts as they formed a Parade of Sail which concluded with Tower Bridge lifting for the top three teams.

Crew members included doctors, lawyers, 
farmers, housewives and students aged between 18 
and 74. Around 40 per cent had never sailed before they took part in the race.

A total of 670 crew from 42 different countries have battled hurricanes, survived a tornado and dealt with medical evacuations during the event which saw one man rescued after going overboard in the Pacific Ocean for 90 minutes.

The race was founded by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who became the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world in 1968-69.

Competitors departed from London on September 1 last year, and arrived back in the capital earlier this morning before a celebration ceremony at St Catherine's Docks.

Around 670 competitors taking part in the world's longest race, a 40,000 mile journey across the globe, arrived back in London today after nearly 11 months at sea

Crew are given just 26 days of training in either the UK or Australia before taking part in the race, and can chose either the full stint across the world, or to take part in any of the eight stages

The race begins in the UK travelling from London to Europe, then across the Atlantic to Rio de Janiero in South America, then via Cape Town in Africa. Sailors then travel around Australia to Indonesia, then up to China, across to the West Coast of America through Panama then back across the Atlantic to the UK

Well-wishers took to the waters of the Thames today to welcome home the 670 crew taking part in this year's race, including 75 Londoners
