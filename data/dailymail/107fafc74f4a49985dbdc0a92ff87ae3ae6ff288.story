MIchael Gove last night accused Nick Clegg of  having a split personality over school reforms, veering between ‘Good Nick’ and ‘Nasty Nick’.

The Education Secretary said the Deputy Prime Minister pandered to disaffected Left-wing voters by attacking the reforms he once backed.

It escalates an acrimonious rift in the Government over schools policy since Mr Gove decided to sack Labour-supporting Baroness Morgan as head of Ofsted last week.

Mr Gove said some Lib Dems wanted to ‘emphasise differences’ within the Coalition to appeal to former supporters ‘who don’t agree with the changes we are making now’.

‘Good Nick, the angel on one shoulder, is saying, “What Gove is doing is socially progressive, socially mobile, and in tune with good old Gladstonian principles”,’ he said.

‘Wicked Nick,  sitting on his other shoulder, is saying, “Yes! But some of your more radical activists dislike it, so pander to them”.

'He will have to decide whether it’s the good or the bad Nick that he indulges.’

It comes after Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws rekindled the Coalition row over education by confirming for the first time that he had opposed the sacking of Sally Morgan.

In an interview, Mr Laws hit  out at Mr Gove over his decision to axe Baroness Morgan from the schools regulator.

He then opened a new rift by saying a system was needed to prevent cronyism in appointments, since any suggestion that a watchdog was pursuing a political agenda was ‘fatal’.

Mr Gove insisted the decision not to renew Baroness Morgan’s contract was not based on her politics – she is an ex-aide to Tony Blair – but because he wanted a ‘new perspective’.

But he refused to rule out appointing a Tory donor, Theodore Agnew, who runs a chain of academies, to head the watchdog instead.

Yesterday Mr Laws, who rarely speaks to the media, admitted he was not consulted about the move, and said he wished Baroness Morgan had remained in post. ‘I don’t think it is one of the best decisions Michael Gove has ever made,’ he told The Independent.

‘I personally think that Sally Morgan has done a fantastic job as chair of Ofsted. I would rather she had remained and had her term renewed.

'We just cannot end up in a situation where posts of this type are selected on the basis of which political party you are in rather than your competence for the job.

‘While no organisation is ever going to be perfect, it is important that there should be confidence in Ofsted and it should be seen to be arm’s length from  politicians.

'Otherwise people [working] in schools or early years would be able to say it is pursuing an agenda that is not about educational standards. That would be fatal. It has got to be independent.’

Mr Laws was previously seen as united with Mr Gove on the schools agenda, but relations between them now appear strained.

He said that when he was told of the decision to axe Baroness Morgan he demanded an equal say over the make-up of the panel to choose her successor.

He also suggested the academies programme, vastly expanded by Mr Gove, could do with more scrutiny – and called for powers for Ofsted to investigate chains of academy schools.

Academies now account for 54 per cent of state secondary schools after massive growth spearheaded by the Tories.
