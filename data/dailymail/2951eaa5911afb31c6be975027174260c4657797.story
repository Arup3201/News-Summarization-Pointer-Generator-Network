Basketball star LeBron James was forced to make a major defensive rebound yesterday after tweeting that his mobile had crashed, despite the fact he is a spokesman for phone giant Samsung.

The Miami Heat player told his 12 million followers that his phone had suddenly rebooted deleting everything that was on it.

But after presumably realising that such publicity wouldn't paint the South Korean electronics firm in the best light, he quickly deleted the tweet and posted a follow up to say he had managed to retrieve the lost data.

'One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life.'

Samsung were reportedly alerted to the problem telling the TMZ website: 'We are following the situation.

James has starred in a series of high-profile adverts to promote Samsung's Galaxy range of phones and tablets.

In 2012 it emerged that his signature Nike basketball boots, which feature electronic sensors to communicate with smartphones, will only work with Apple products.

According to a recent survey James is the sixth richest basketball star behind Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Hakeem Olajuwon with a net worth of $185million.

Past endorsements include deals with McDonaldâ€™s, Samsung, Coca Cola, Dr. Pepper, Gatorade, Geico and the Boys and Girls Club of America.
