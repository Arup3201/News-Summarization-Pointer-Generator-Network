From carpets that switch to wooden beams at the touch of a button, to floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors – the bedroom of the future is set be a high-tech affair.

Experts predict that, within the next decade, we could also be sleeping on bedding with built-in cooling and heating systems,and surrounding ourselves with 3D printed ornaments.

And for people who don’t have a scenic view, smart windows could be used switch between rainforests scenes, valley views and even double up as projector screens.

The bedroom of the future (illustrated) was designed by London-based Betta Living. Its predictions include carpets that switch to beams, floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors

Betta Living, the bedroom furniture firm, also details how many of these so-called futuristic concepts are already in the making, or available to buy.

Starting with a morning routine, Betta Living claims that mirrored glass on wardrobe doors will be superseded by virtual mirrors.

In September, the National Sleep Foundation released its first international Bedroom Poll.

It compared the amount of sleep and attitudes, habits and bedtime routines of people living across the United States, Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany and Japan.

The results discovered that while a third of Britons prefer to sleep naked, Germans have to air their bedrooms weekly to achieve a good night's sleep and half of both Japanese and Americans take naps every two weeks to catch up on their shut eye. 

Oral B has already developed a similar smart mirror prototype for the bathroom, and Betta Living believes they will become commonplace in bedrooms within five years.

The intelligent interactive surface will not only display the contents of the wardrobe, but micro-tagged clothes could be tried on virtually using gestural technology.

This means users can virtually swipe through choices, and see how items look when worn together.

It could also be used as a personal stylist, helping people to decide what to wear depending on their diary entries, when linked with a smartphone, or the weather.

Users will also be able to shop online from these mirrors, to find shoes and accessories to match existing items.

Elsewhere in the futuristic bedroom concept, clear glass windows will be replaced with ‘smart windows’, automated to the time of day and season, or personal preferences.

The screen could be translucent, fade completely to black, work as a virtual window blind, display a scene of the user’s choice, or be used as an interactive screen to watch TV, check the weather and even browse and update social media accounts.

Samsung has already created a similar design, called Transparent Smart Window.

On to the beds of the future.The next-generation mattresses and beds could use a cantilever mechanism to store the bed in the ceiling rather than a wall, according to Betta Living. 

At the touch of a button, the bed could elevate up into a spot lit surround, and disappear into the ceiling. 

The bedding could be high-tech too.

Duvets of the future, for example, could be connected to body monitoring systems, telling sleepers to heat up if their body is getting too cold.

To boost and monitor health, future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets. The system would be able to optimise the heat and light to a person’s exact needs. Honeywell’s evohome (pictured) already lets users schedule, and personalise heating and hot water wirelessly

This trend has also been seen recently with products such as LightwaveRF (pictured) - that controls everything from power sockets and light dimmers from smartphones - and Beddit’s ultra-thin film sensor, which connects wirelessly to a smartphone to provide sleep analytics

And thanks to an in-built cooling system, this bedding will cool the body down to prevent night sweats.

Pillows could incorporate the same light technology used in lamps to combat light sensitivity, and could light up gradually as people wake.

To boost and monitor health further, future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets.

The whole system would then be able to optimise the heat and light to suit a person’s exact needs - even down to heart rate and core body temperature.

This trend has already been seen recently with products such as LightwaveRF - that controls everything from power sockets and light dimmers from smartphones - and Beddit’s ultra-thin film sensor, which connects wirelessly to a smartphone to provide sleep analytics.

And Honeywell’s evohome lets users schedule, zone and personalise their heating and hot water wirelessly, using a touchscreen controller or an app.

On the subject of fitness, Betta Living also predicts that bedrooms of the future will double up as gyms. Homeowners will be able to elevate the bed to reveal a home gym, such as the Domyos Training Box. This box (pictured) contains a weight-lifting bar and selection of weights and a weight bench

Experts also predict that the flooring will be interchangeable at the flick of a switch. This means that carpets could be switched for laminate flooring at the touch of a button, and it could be cleaned using Roomba vacuums (pictured) that can be set to clean whenever the owner wants

Energy-bills will be substantially less too, as lighting becomes more energy-efficient.

In addition, self-iron fabrics could spell the end of ironing duvet covers.

Homeowners will be able to elevate the bed to reveal a home gym, such as the Domyos Training Box.

This box contains a weight lifting bar and selection of weights, a weight bench and cardio step, and mat all in a storage box.

The bedroom of the future will also be decorated with homemade, and home-designed, 3D-printed frames, ornaments, vases and more.

And the flooring will be interchangeable at the flick of a switch.

The Sleep Council recently created a similar bedroom of the future concept, (pictured) with adaptable furniture and augmented reality displays to show constellations or flight paths overhead. It also featured a holographic Colin Firth that read people bedtime stories

Pillows could incorporate the same light technology used in lamps to combat light sensitivity, and could light up gradually as people wake. The Sleep Council's simialr prediction is illustrated

This means that carpet could be switched for laminate flooring at the touch of a button, and or graphics and patterns could be beamed onto the floor for parties, or for children to play on.

And it could be cleaned using Roomba vacuums, or Dyson's latest automated vacuum, that can be set to clean the floor whenever the owner wants. 

Barry Rourke said: ‘Our bedroom of the future is all about multi-functionality to make the most of space, fabulous design and making home comforts even more sophisticated.

‘As people flock to popular urban areas, domestic spaces are shrinking but in our transformative bedroom, even the smallest of spaces will not restrict the homeowners in the future.

‘Windows will adapt to whatever we want our view to be and interactive living surfaces will mean we have access to our lives and wardrobe in one clever screen.

‘Even the traditional bed will become tech driven and be linked to everything else in the room by clever sensors and smartphones. There are so many exciting things being developed our problem designing the bedroom of the future was what to leave out.’
