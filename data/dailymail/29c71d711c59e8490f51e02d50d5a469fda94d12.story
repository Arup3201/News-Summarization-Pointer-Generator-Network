Suggestions that Liverpool should dispense with Brendan Rodgers are complete rubbish insists Luis Suarez after he launched an impassioned defence of his former manager.

The Barcelona striker, who left Merseyside for £75million in the summer, insisted the Reds must qualify for next season’s Champions League and asserts Rodgers is the man to guide them there.

Liverpool have withered since earning the right to play in Europe’s top club competition, failing to clinch the Premier League title and struggling badly domestically.

That is largely thought to be down to the sale of Suarez, although the way in which the club reinvested that fee has come in for strict criticism.

Now out of the Champions League and facing a real fight to finish in the top four, the Uruguayan has urged them not to waste the previous good work.

‘Liverpool will be disappointed not to progress out of their group, but the most important thing is that they were back playing at the highest level this season - and it gives them something to build on,’ Suarez said.

‘The reason they were back playing Champions League football is because of Brendan Rodgers - and he is the right man to guide them back there again next season.

‘They must qualify for The Champions League next season. If it comes via the league or winning The Europe League - it is not important how. This season can't be a one off though, because The Champions League is where the club belongs - and it is what the fans expect.’
