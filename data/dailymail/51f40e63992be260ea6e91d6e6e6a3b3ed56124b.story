Cari Thomson has been cleared of wrongdoing after she lent her prescription inhaler to a seventh-grade student suffering an asthma attack

A middle school principal has been cleared of wrongdoing after a student's parents complained that she gave their son her inhaler, even though it may have saved the boy's life.

Police investigated  Cari Thomson after she lent her prescription inhaler to a seventh-grade student suffering an asthma attack.

The boy's parents complained after they found out the Woodland Middle School Principal had given their son - a severe asthmatic - her inhaler - without contacting them.

But Woodland Police Chief Phillip Crochet said this week that while she may have acted illegally, her actions were considered common sense to help the student and may have saved the boy's life. 

City of Woodland Prosecuting Attorney Fred Johnson decided against pursuing criminal charges, Chief Crochet added. 

According to the police report, Ms Thomson told her superintendent that her actions had been illegal.

But Superintendent Michael Green had told her that 'it was a good thing she violated policy' because her action may have saved the student's life.

The student's father Jason Birrer told police he believed she was trying to help, but was worried Thomson's inhaler may have been too strong. 

A police report said that former middle school english teacher Holly Royle had witnessed the incident at the school in Washington in December. 

But she waited almost a month before writing a witness statement, dated January 2, and gave it to another teacher - Cheryl Nesbitt - who brought it to the Birrer family to sign before bringing it to police. 

Mr Birrer said Ms Nesbitt, a former middle school physical education teacher, was the first to inform him of the incident.

'It was just the fact that she gave him the inhaler without even contacting us (that bothered me),' he said, according to The Daily News. 

'I thought (my son) had his inhaler that day, and afterwards he told me he forgot it.'

Ms Nesbitt then reported the incident to police on January 5, two weeks after she and Ms Royle were fired from their positions. 

They claimed they were terminated after bringing concerns about the principal's lack of leadership and breaches of professional conduct to her and Superintendent Green.

At the time the Birrers were asked to sign the witness statement, Ms Nesbitt bought the family pizza - which some have criticized as being akin to a bribe.

But Mr Birrer rejected this, adding: 'She gave me some very good information, and I believe Cheryl Nesbitt did the right thing,'

And Ms Nesbitt insists she would have reported the incident to police without the family's signature and had brought the pizza to thank the family for their time.

'There was no coaxing,' she said. 'I didn't need (the parents') approval. I was there just to tell them what happened.'

Ms Royle said she reported the incident in January after she was advised to do so by a teacher's union representative.  

School officials told police they attempted to contact the student's parents 'multiple' times before Thomson gave the student her asthma inhaler. 

The school nurse had been unavailable at the time.

But Mr Birrer says his wife was at home at the time of the asthma attack. 

He added staff did not tell him later that day that his son had been given another person's inhaler. 

A petition calling for the removal of Principal Thomson, which has attracted almost 500 signatures, accuses her of misconduct.

Started by Parents of Woodland Students, the petition claims she has committed 'unprofessional acts' which include swearing during the school day, discussing her purchase of pornography, sharing her personal sexual activities with staff and pulling students from class to do her personal chores.
