Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green’s retail success could easily be turned into a business bestseller.

The new life of his sister Elizabeth, however, has all the elements of a Hollywood romcom.

Six years after divorcing her graphic designer husband David Neville, she has been dabbling in romantic liaisons with men she’s met on dating websites.

Lucky in love: Elizabeth Green, the sister of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip, has written the autobiography of soul singer Oscar Davis after meeting him on a dating website

Now these contacts have opened up a career for her as a writer, after completing 75,000 words of a biography of one of her dates: U.S. soul singer Oscar Davis.

‘The first thing that attracted me to Oscar was the fact that in his description of himself he said he wanted to write a book about his life. I wrote back saying I would write it for him,’ says Elizabeth, who lives in North London and recently became a grandmother.

They met in New York, where she is a regular visitor, but after an initial flurry of passion, romance quickly took a backseat as Elizabeth began writing Oscar’s life story. 

Now they communicate across the Atlantic via Skype. Dreadlocked Oscar, who she says has a great ‘soulful voice’ and who has appeared with Quincy Jones, has ‘lived five lives in one’.

‘He has a very unusual and unique story to tell,’ he says.

They met after sociology graduate Elizabeth visited blackpeoplemeet.com. So what drew the mother of three to such sites in her hunt for Mr Right? She says she was fed up  with many of the men she’d encountered. Among them were a Disney executive, a Kabbalah enthusiast who only talked about Madonna, and a blind date who boasted he had his own hair and teeth.

‘I tried Jewish dating websites because I am Jewish and I met a lot of men, but they aren’t my type,’ she says. ‘What I like about these sites is the American thing. I find you can never be too loud, too outspoken or too talkative for an American.’

There’s no stopping Prince Philip. In April, two months short of his 92nd birthday, Philip — who, as I revealed, is the oldest ever male royal — flies to Toronto to present new colours to the 3rd battalion the Royal Canadian Regiment.

By coincidence, Philip, who became Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment in 1953, succeeded the Duke of Connaught, who he overtook in the longevity stakes on Monday.

Blessed with a multi-billionaire husband, three children, homes across the globe and a £100 million super- yacht, ex-beauty queen Kirsty Bertarelli is the first to admit she is the most fortunate — as well as the richest — woman in Britain.

Country-pop passion: Former beauty queen Kirsty Bertarelli is now the richest woman in Britain

‘But I have an unfulfilled ambition: I want to be taken seriously as a pop singer,’ she tells me at a champagne reception to showcase her album, Love Is, at the House of St Barnabas in Soho.

‘I had some success before I got married,’ says modest Kirsty, whose song Black Coffee was a No 1 for girl band All Saints in 2000 and who has supported Simply Red.

‘But then babies came along and I had to give it all up.’

A former Miss UK, Kirsty, 41, is married to handsome Swiss-Italian pharmaceutical tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli. The couple, who live on Lake Geneva and have a home in Knightsbridge, use their estimated £7.4 billion wealth to support a number of philanthropic causes.

But country-pop is Kirsty’s passion.

On the verge of securing a distribution deal for her album, she says: ‘I realised I wanted to perform myself.

‘It’s hard to hear your own feelings on radio when someone else is performing them!’

Dame Helen Mirren has at last disclosed the naked truth — where she found the courage to disrobe so frequently on stage and in films as a young actress.

It was all down to Glenda Jackson and Vanessa Redgrave.

‘Especially Glenda Jackson,’ she says. ‘I remember her on the set of Women In Love.

'She took off her dressing gown, cleared her throat and went: “OK everybody, this is what it looks like from the front . . . And this is what it looks like from behind. Now just let’s get on with it.” 

'I thought that was great.’

The Queen will be relieved to hear there is nothing so revealing from Dame Helen, reprising her role as HM, in The Audience on the West End stage.

Model
of the moment Cara Delevingne may be getting as famous for her hard 
partying as for sashaying down the catwalk. But for all the attention 
she remains level-headed.

Asked
about her future, the daughter of property magnate Charles Delevingne 
and former society model Pandora Stevens reflects: ‘In five years I’ll 
probably be living on a desert island catching fish and growing 
vegetables .’

Model Cara Delevingne said she will probably living on a remote island growing her own vegetables in five years time

Mind 
you, quite what her godmother Joan Collins makes of Cara’s  recent 
bleary-eyed appearances may be instructive. In her book, The World 
According To Joan, the actress deplores many modern trends. ‘Why has the
desire to eat, dress and talk properly become something scorned, a 
source of ridicule?’ she wonders.

‘You
see people sitting in restaurants, elbows on the table, boisterously 
drunk and talking loudly with open mouths of food. Even the F-word seems
commonplace.’

Could it be that party animal Cara hasn’t yet finished reading her own copy of Joan’s tome?

Only comedians who appear on TV get their books on to the  bestseller lists, says Judy Finnigan.

Judy, 64, whose thriller Eloise is out in paperback, tells me: ‘If I was still on TV regularly I don’t think it would matter in terms of books sales. Comedians and people like that might sell more books because they are on TV.’

Judy, who with husband Richard Madeley hosted This Morning for 13 years, has no ambition to return to TV. ‘I don’t miss it a bit,’ she says at the Romantic Novelist awards at the RAF Club.

‘I’d just had enough. The world of writing is much more refreshing.’

After hearing rave reviews, Michael 
Heseltine joined a clutch of politicians to see This House, a play about
the Labour governments of 1974 to 1979.

Sitting
near the front row at the Olivier Theatre, he looked none too pleased 
during a scene re-enacting one of the most famous incidents in his 
career — when he caused uproar by seizing the Commons mace and 
brandishing it at Labour MPs in 1976.

During
a break in the programme, Lord Heseltine stood up and declared to those
nearby: ‘I simply don’t recognise myself at all. The characters are 
just very badly drawn.’

Others
suspect the peer did not like the scruffy appearance of the actor 
playing his role. ‘We could not stop watching Hezza’s reaction,’ noted 
former Times editor James Harding. ‘He did not look too happy.’

A
po-faced Edwina Currie, meanwhile, tip-toed out of the theatre — no 
doubt worrying about how her affair with John Major will be portrayed on
the stage one day.

In Scotland, a deep-fried Mars bar is a delicacy. But for Sir Benjamin Slade, the calorific confectionery has provided a winning formula. He appears on ITV’s Food Glorious Food, where judges Carol Vorderman and Tom Parker Bowles awarded him a rosette for his Aunt Freda’s Maunsel House pudding — named after his mansion — of Mars bars, apples and crumble.

‘It was a top-secret family recipe my aunt invented,’ says Sir Ben, 66. ‘Freda used to make it for me when I was young. Up until she passed away at 82 she drove, hunted, drank sherry for Somerset and lived on Mars bars — and it never did her any harm.’
