They are among the most arresting images of an asteroid ever seen.

Nasa today released two new images taken from its Dawn spacecraft as it left the giant Vesta asteroid. 

The first set of images is a color-coded relief map of Vesta's northern hemisphere, from the pole to the equator. 

Nasa's Dawn mission has revealed the topography of the northern and southern hemispheres of the giant asteroid Vesta.

Vesta was discovered in 1807, the fourth
asteroid to be identified in the great belt of rocky debris orbiting 
between Mars and Jupiter.

At the time, its great scale meant it was designated as another planet 
but it later lost this status as researchers learnt more about the 
diversity of objects in the Solar System.

It incorporates images taken just as 
Dawn began to creep over the high northern latitudes, which were dark 
when Dawn arrived in July 2011.

The other image is a black-and-white mosaic that shows a full view of the giant asteroid, created by synthesizing some of Dawn's best images.

'Dawn has peeled back the veil on some of the mysteries surrounding Vesta, but we're still working hard on more analysis,' said Christopher Russell, Dawn's principal investigator at UCLA.

'So while Vesta is now out of sight, it will not be out of mind.'

The images mark the end of Dawn's year-long encounter with the 330mile-wide asteroid Vesta, making the mission the first to enter orbit around a main-belt asteroid.

The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, 117million miles from Earth.

The asteroid looks like a punctured football, the result of a colossal collision sometime in its past that knocked off its south polar region.

Dawn will now depart for its second destination, the dwarf planet Ceres.

This will make it the first spacecraft to orbit two solar system destinations beyond Earth.
