A stalk carries a newborn baby, a hummingbird flutters in front of an exotic flower and a colourful parrot takes flight ... or so it seems.

At a first glance these incredible images could be mistaken for portraits of our feathered friends, but on a closer inspection it's clear to see they feature painted models.

The set of fascinating photos was created by expert bodypainter Kate Dean who transformed naked men and women into birds using nothing but a lick of paint and inventive photography.

The collection, called Life In Flight, tells the story of human life through birds, from finding a partner and settling down to having children then watching them grow up and leave the nest.

The peacock symbolises the search for a mate, the lovebirds perched on a branch represent the intimacy of a relationship, and the stalk delivering a baby stands for birth.

The incredible images took eight months to plan, paint and perfect, and Kate juggled creating the collection with being pregnant with her first daughter Jemima.

Kate, 32, from Bristol, started face painting aged 17 but it wasn't until 2005 when she went to an event that specialised in her niche that she decided to make the switch from the face to entire bodies. 

'I had a part-time job doing face painting when I was 17 and it was something I kept doing through university' said Kate.

'I started to do high-end corporate events and celebrity parties but it wasn't until I went to the World Body Painting Festival in 2005 with my two sisters, who are both models, that I really got into it.'

Kate says that it was meeting other talented artist like herself that encouraged her to improve her craft even further. 

'Somehow we fell in with the right crowd and we became mates with some of the best body painters in the world.

'When you hang out with the best you have to up your game so I went home and did a bit of work, put it online and got some really good recognition for it.'

Kate's more intricate creations can take up to 15 hours to complete and include up to 12 painted models - including this peacock

Kate produced six images of birds for her project Life In Flight - including this hummingbird 'representing the intimacy of a relationship'

After trying it out Kate realised that she wanted to turn her hobby into a full-time job despite not having professional qualifications in the area. 

'About five years ago I decided that body painting would be my main profession.

'I've not had any formal training but I've always been creative - it is something that comes naturally to me and I love doing it.'

Kate wasted no time in getting started despite the fact that she had recently become pregnant. 

'I came home one day and decided I was going to get together a really high quality set of images. We had just decided to have a baby at the time so that put a bit of time pressure on it.'

Kate juggled her project with her first pregnancy which actually helped to influence the message behind the work 

The final collection is the result of seven to eight months of continuous work 

Kate's recent life development seemed to have influence on her work with settling down and pregnancy taking a subconscious theme in her work. 

'When I made the images I didn't really have anything in mind apart from the fact that I wanted to create six images of birds.

'I painted them in the order they appear in the collection without actually realising that they tell a story of human life and of my life at that time.

'They show how you find a mate, settle down, have kids and then they grow up and leave the nest.'

Some of the more intricate body painting took as long as 15 hours to get right. Kate ensures that every part of the process is entirely organic, never relying on computer trickery to perfect her images. 

'Everything you see in my work is a person - there's no props, it's just my painting and clever photography. Even the colourful backgrounds are done with lighting.

'The collection is the result of about seven or eight months' work. The more complicated images can take up to 15 hours to paint the models and get the right shot.

'I'm really proud of the collection - it's the best work I've ever done.'
