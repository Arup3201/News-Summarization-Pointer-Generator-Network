An Australia Zoo keeper has been taken to hospital after he was bitten on the leg by a tiger.

The 42-year-old man received a puncture wound on his left leg when 10-year-old Sumatran tiger Juma bit him on the leg.

An Australia Zoo spokeswoman said the incident occurred as the keeper was moving Juma from one enclosure to another.

'First aid protocol was followed, the same as Australia Zoo renders all staff, and the keeper is going to be fine,' she said.

'Juma the tiger is fine as well.'

A Queensland Ambulance spokesman told Daily Mail Australia an ambulance was called to the zoo at 11.46am and the 42-year-old was taken to Nambour Hospital.

A Nambour Hospital spokeswoman said he was in a stable condition.

In November last year Australia Zoo keeper David Styles, pictured here with a Sumatran tiger named Kaitlyn, suffered puncture wounds to the neck when he was attacked by a tiger

'He's still in emergency department, still having some tests done,' she said.

'We're not sure if he's going to be admitted at this stage.'

It's the second such incident at Australia Zoo in eight months.

In November, a 114kg Bengal tiger, Charlie, became 'overexcited' and bit his handler Dave Styles on the neck and shoulder during a tiger show.
