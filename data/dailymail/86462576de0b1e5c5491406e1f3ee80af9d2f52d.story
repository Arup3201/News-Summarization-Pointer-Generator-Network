A third of intensive care  beds at weekends are taken up by patients critically ill from  alcohol, according to the NHS’s head of critical care.

Dr Bob Winter said it had become socially acceptable for people to drink themselves into an ‘anaesthetised state’ on Friday and Saturday nights, and he also warned of the trend of ‘front-loading’ – becoming intoxicated before going out.

The prices at supermarkets and off-licences were so cheap it was possible to buy enough alcohol to ‘die from’ with a £10 note, he added.

Drunk: Dr Bob Winter, head of NHS critical care, warned of 'front-loading', drinking plenty before going out

Dr Winter called for an urgent change in the culture of drinking and said the Government needed to take responsibility for the problem by banning cheap booze. Official figures show that alcohol costs the NHS an estimated £2.7billion a year, including £1billion in A&E alone.

Last year, 1.2 million patients went to casualty as a result of drinking too much alcohol – a rise of 50 per cent since 2002.

Dr Winter said that last Sunday, he counted the patients in intensive care at five NHS trusts in the East Midlands. A total of 25 out of 85 patients had illnesses such as liver disease, conditions affecting the pancreas or were seriously injured as a result of drinking too much.

Addressing the NHS Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester, Dr Winter said: ‘If you just go into the centre of any major conurbation on a Friday or Saturday night, you see people going into town in the state I would have gone home in when I was a student.

‘People drink themselves into an anaesthetic state and their friends think it is acceptable. They think it is reasonable for an ambulance to come if needed.

‘People vomit all over the inside of the ambulance and then it is off the road for 45 minutes.’ Dr Winter, an intensive care consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘It was never socially acceptable in my youth to go out and drink to the point of vomiting but somehow it is now, and that is just wrong.

‘We need a change in the culture of drinking. It must start with education.

‘It should be physically impossible to buy enough alcohol to die at 10am for £10. We laugh at America for having relaxed gun laws, but here you can go out with a tenner  in your back pocket. You can buy  a bottle of vodka that would take the paint off your car and then drink it.

‘Local authorities need to take some responsibility for the licensing of these places and the Government needs to take some responsibility in terms of minimum pricing.’

Plans for a lower limit of 40p per unit were dropped in July to avoid penalising responsible drinkers

Dr Winter said that on one New Year’s Eve, he went out with an ambulance crew and all 25 patients they treated were ill through alcohol.

They included a student suffering from hypothermia after jumping in a river and a man on the street who was doubly incontinent and vomiting.

‘People think it is funny,’ he said. ‘There was a big group of people taking photographs.’

The Government dropped plans to bring in a minimum price for alcohol over the summer and has since been accused of caving in to the drinks industry.

David Cameron had initially pledged to introduce a lower limit of 40p per unit, claiming it would save 900 lives by the end of the decade.

But these plans were dropped in July, with ministers saying there was not enough evidence it would be effective without penalising responsible drinkers.

It later emerged that ministers had held 130 meetings with drinks firms and supermarkets before the U-turn.
