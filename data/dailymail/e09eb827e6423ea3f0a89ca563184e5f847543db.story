A 'vice queen' and her two male accomplices are facing jail after being convicted of operating a lucrative prostitution racket that ran for nine years.

Margaret Paterson, 61, Robert Munro, 61, and Ian Goalen, 59, operated a brothel and escort business from Edinburgh, but were today found guilty of proceeds of crime and immoral earnings.

Paterson and Munro provided prostitutes and former bank manager Goalen was a driver for the women, who worked in Edinburgh, West Lothian, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

Their lucrative scam came to an end when police raided their premises in September 2011, finding sex toys, designer shoes and evidence showing Paterson had gone on a £462,000 shopping spree.

Credit card records detailed how she bought luxury items from Harvey Nichols, Louis Vuitton and Mulberry - and police officers who searched her home also found £205,000 in cash.

They also discovered mobile phones which people rang in order to book sessions with the women, and that Paterson and Munro kept records of those who were using their business.

Prosecutors told the trio that they will be subject to proceeds of crime proceedings. Sentencing of the three has been deferred in order for the court to obtain reports about their characters.

After conviction today, temporary judge Michael O’Grady QC said: ‘These are serious offences.’

Edinburgh’s High Court also heard how police discovered that the ex-night manager of the George Hotel in Edinburgh, Roderick MacLeod used to phone the agency for guests who wanted sex.

Paterson set up AaBella Escorts in October 2002 and it quickly became a lucrative money-spinning venture for her and business partner Munro. The firm advertised in a number of newspapers.

The trial heard from Kellie Ann Bolton, 31, who said she worked for Paterson and Munro as a prostitute just before the business was closed down in September 2011.

She said that she would charge punters £150 for an hour long session.

When prosecution lawyer Paul Kearney asked Bolton - who worked under the name of Colette - if women who worked for the business needed to have sex with customers, she said yes.

The court also heard from Mr MacLeod, 45. He told Mr Kearney that ‘somebody’ provided him with a telephone number for the escort agency when he started working for the hotel.

Mr MacLeod said that whenever a guest wanted an escort, he would telephone AaBella and that they would send girls to the hotel.

He told the court: ‘I telephoned the agency infrequently. A guest would come to me and ask for an escort. I would phone the agency, speak to Trish (Paterson) and I would put the call through to the guest’s room.'

Mr MacLeod said that he used the agency once during his time working at the hotel. He added: ‘It was because I was very, very drunk.’

Kitchen manager Martin Cumberbatch, 44, of Bathgate, West Lothian, said he used the agency in 2010 after splitting up with his wife.

He told the court that he paid £140 for a young Polish woman to visit him at his home.  Mr Cumberbatch told the court: ‘It was just a bit of companionship.’

The court heard that in September 2011, police received a tip off that Paterson was running a brothel. Officers raided the premises and Paterson’s home address just a few weeks later.

Detectives found sex toys and condoms. They also discovered two whips and a red riding crop. Stunned policemen also found handcuffs and leaflets for a sexual health clinic for prostitutes.

The trio will be sentenced on July 8 at Edinburgh’s High Court.
