Scott McManis has been jailed for 34 months after he hit pedestrian Neil Wilcock while racing another car near his home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire

A judge has described his sentencing powers as 'ludicrously inadequate' as he jailed a hit and run driver for 34 months after he hit a pedestrian while racing against another car.

Scott McManis, 21, fled the scene after he hit Neil Wilcock while racing in his father's Ford Mondeo.

Mr Wilcock had to spend four weeks in intensive care with serious head and lung injuries, fractures to his skull and spine and two broken legs.

The 52-year-old still requires 24-hour care, has permanent damage to his legs and has not returned to work following the incident last December.

Jailing McManis at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Robert Bartfield said he could not give a sufficient sentence to match the crime.

He said: 'This is going to be one of those rare occasions when I say the sentence is ludicrously inadequate.

'It allows me in no way to do justice to what happened here.'

The court heard McManis took his father's car without permission and was racing with another car at speeds of up to 50 mph in a 30mph zone near his home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

One witness said she heard the cars revving 'as though the engines were being thrashed' before Mr Wilcock was hit at 7.20pm on December 12.

After the incident McManis rang his father Gary, 48, who told him to hand himself in but he refused and said he was going to torch the silver car.

Gary McManis then told his daughter Stacey, 25, to ring the police and report the car as stolen, prosector Ian Goldsack told the court.

The family thought they had got away with it but police found a wing mirror at the accident scene and the make and model of the car was narrowed down.

After officers searched their database they found Stacey McManis had reported a similar car as stolen and the family were questioned at their home but stuck to their story that the car had been stolen.

Mobile phone cell site evidence also put Scott McManis at the accident scene and again located him at woodland in Deepcar, near Sheffield, where the car was discovered burned out.

Scott McManis eventually handed himself into police on December 29. The other driver has never been traced.

In a victim impact statement the victim's sister said he was unconscious for weeks and they thought he was going to die.

'This is going to be one of those rare occasions when I say the sentence is ludicrously inadequate. It allows me in no way to do justice to what happened here' 

- Judge Robert Bartfield

Scott McManis admitted aggravated vehicle taking and conspiring to pervert the course of justice while his father and sister also admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

Rebecca Stephens, for Scott McManis, said he was 'utterly ashamed' and wanted to apologise to the victim and his family.

Jailing him, the judge said: 'Mr Wilcock suffered the most terrible injuries. Nothing can give him his life back.

'Both legs were fractured, he underwent multiple operations and he was in intensive care almost a month. It is a miracle he survived. I am satisfied you were vehicle racing, it was driving for fun on public roads.

'You knew you had knocked somebody down. Your reaction was to leave the scene and your counsel has rightly described you as a coward. You thought more of saving your own skin than of seeking assistance for that man.'

Gary McManis and his daughter both wept in the dock as the judge said their lies had impeded the investigation, adding anguish to the victim's family.

As well as being jailed for 34 months, Scott McManis was banned from driving for three years and told to take an extended test when he comes out.

Gary McManis was given 12 months in jail suspended for a year with 120 hours of unpaid work while Stacey McManis received an eight-month jail term suspended for a year with 80 hours of unpaid work.

After the hearing Inspector Pete Serhatlic, of South Yorkshire Police's road policing group, said: 'The McManus family have been brought to justice after a long and protracted investigation.

'I would like to wish the victim every success in his determination to regain good health and I would like to thank those members of the public that assisted us.

'Leaving the scene of an accident is morally irresponsible and the actions of a coward.'
