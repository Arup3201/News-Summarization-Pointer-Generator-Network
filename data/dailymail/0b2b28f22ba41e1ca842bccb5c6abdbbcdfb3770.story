If you think seeing a rocket launch from Earth is impressive, then take a look at these onboard views from Soyuz Flight VS07.

The Arianespace rocket, which deployed Sentinel-1A to into orbit, provided the world with a front-row seat in space last week.

Recorded last week during its 23-minute mission from French Guiana - an overseas region of France on the South American coast - multiple cameras covered the action from final countdown to separation of the mission’s payload.

Scroll down for video... 

Highlights of the launch include the Soyuz first stage separation, the fairing separation - the nose cone that protects the rocket - and ejection of the rocket’s rear section.

The video begins with the pre-launch steps as seen from two cameras - mounted on opposite sides of the medium-lift launcher.

As the rocket emerges from the clouds and through the planet’s atmosphere, the Soyuz’s first stage boosters are ejected and make a fiery fall to Earth.

Up and away: As seen by two downward-looking cameras on opposite sides of Soyuz, the launcher begins its ascent through the clouds and away from Earth's atmosphere

Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services.

The first Sentinel-1 satellite was launched on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on 3 April 2014. 

The satellite will form the core of Europe’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network.

Copernicus will provide operational 
information on the world’s land surfaces, oceans and atmosphere to 
support environmental and security policy making.

After a 617 second burn, Sentinel-1A was separated at around 434 miles (700km) above the Earth to begin its life in orbit.

The satellite’s solar panels and antenna were then deployed in a complex sequence that took around 11 hours.

Flight VS07 was Arianespace’s seventh mission from French Guiana, and its Sentinel-1A passenger will form the core of Europe’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network.

Copernicus will provide data on the world’s land surfaces, oceans and atmosphere to support environmental and security policy decisions in Europe.

‘The launch of the first Sentinel-1 satellite marks a change in philosophy for our Earth observation programmes,’ said Volker Liebig, Esa’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes.

‘In meteorology, satellites have been providing reliable data for weather forecasts for over 35 years.

‘With the Copernicus programme, we will now have a similar information source for environmental services as well as for applications in the security and disaster management domain.’ 

Ejection: A payload fairing - the nose cone used to protect a spacecraft - is separated from the rocket

Fiery fall: The rocket's second state and the upper assembly are discarded as the rocket gains momentum

Final destination: Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. It is pictured her just after the rocket released it into orbit
