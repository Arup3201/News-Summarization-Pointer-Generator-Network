You may think Spiderman’s ability to scale vertical walls is pretty neat, but the superheroes abilities are nothing compared to a gecko’s.

After years of wondering whether the lizards have to exert energy to stick to walls, biologists have proved their talent is effortless.

Researchers found that the adhesive power comes purely from the adhesive toe pads on the underside of gecko feet.

And they came to this conclusion by sticking dead geckos to slippery surfaces. 

The lizards, which are found in places with warm climates, can cling to even shiny vertical surfaces with the most remarkable strength. 

The tests were carried out by biologists at the University of California, Riverside.

‘With regards to geckos, being sticky doesn't require effort,’ Timothy Higham, an assistant professor of biology at the university said.

Together with William Stewart, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, Assistant Professor Higham found that ‘dead geckos maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals, eliminating the idea that strong adhesion requires active control.’

‘Death affects neither the motion nor the posture of clinging gecko feet.

‘We found no difference in the adhesive force or the motion of clinging digits between our before- and after-death experiments.’

For years, it has been presumed that the ability to stick to surfaces has required muscle activity instigated by a gecko to push its foot and toes onto a surface to enhance adhesion.

Geckos climb on a wide variety of surfaces, including smooth surfaces such as glass.

They have adhesive pressures of 15 to 30 pounds (6.8kg to 13.6kg) per square inch for each limb, meaning a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe.

A gecko's toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure of stalk-like setae - 100 microns in length, 2 microns in radius.

From individual setae, a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae - approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest - branch out and contact the climbing surface.

These hairs create an electrostatic force known as Van der Waals. 

It causes neighbouring molecules to be attracted to each other.

Although very weak, the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko's toes, allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces. 

To test the well-held belief, the biologists used a device involving a controlled pulling system.

This device applied increasing pulling forces to a gecko foot and measured ‘clings’ by pulling it in a controlled manner along a vertical acrylic sheet. 

It also recorded adhesion with video cameras.

The experiments showed that the adhesive force, or motion, of a gecko foot when pulled along a vertical surface was similarly high and variable when the gecko was alive and immediately - within 30 minutes - after death.

Geckos can climb a variety of surfaces, including smooth glass.

Their sticky toes have even inspired climbing devices, such as so-called Spider-Man gloves.

The toe pads on the underside of gecko feet contain tiny hair-like structures called setae, which stick to surfaces through frictional forces as well as forces between molecules, called van der Waals.

These tiny structures are so strong that the setae on a single foot can support 20 times the gecko's body weight.

The controlled experiments  are the first to show that dead animals maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals.

The results refute the notion that actions by a living gecko, such as muscle recruitment or neural activity, are required for gecko feet to generate forces.

‘The idea that adhesion can be entirely passive could apply to many different kinds of adhesion, Professor Higham said.

‘This is clearly a cost-effective way of remaining stationary in a habitat. For example, geckos could perch on a smooth vertical surface and sleep for the night - or day - without using any energy.’

The new work suggests that the ‘active’ component of gecko adhesion is actually a reduction of adhesion force when the gecko lifts its feet by curling up the tips of the digits, while the rest of the foot remains on the surface.

Dr Stewart explained: ‘We found that the dead animals were more likely to experience damage to their adhesive system, which suggests that the active control may actually prevent injury.

‘In other words, when the forces become too high, the gecko likely releases the system using its muscles.’

The study, which was published in the journal Biology Letters, may now be used to develop new robots.

A climbing system inspired by geckos has turned Spider-Man fiction into fact by making it possible for a human to scale vertical glass.

During tests, an 11-stone (70kg) volunteer crawled up a 12ft (3.6 metre) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet.

The gadgets employ the same natural molecular forces that allow gecko lizards to scurry around on ceilings.

Hair-like setae on a gecko's toe pads create an electrostatic forces known as Van der Waals, which causes neighbouring moleules to be attracted to each other.

Although very weak, the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko's toes, allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces.

Scientists created tiny tiles called 'microwedges' to generate Van der Waals forces and produce a dry adhesive even more efficient than the gecko's.

During the experiment, the volunteer testing these microwedge attachments simply peeled them on and off the glass.

The US team led by Dr Elliot Hawkes, from Stanford University, wrote in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface: 'Using this system, a human of mass 70 kilograms (11 stone) successfully ascended a 3.6-metre (11 ft) vertical glass wall with 140 square centimetres of gecko-inspired dry adhesives in each hand.

'The synthetic adhesion system creates a nearly uniform load distribution across the whole adhesive area, improving upon the adhesive-bearing structures of a gecko's toe and enabling a human to climb vertical glass using an area of adhesive no larger than the area of a human hand.'

The demonstration was reminiscent of the way Spiderman scales skyscrapers in the Marvel comics and films, (illustrated left), as well as the way Tom Cruise clings to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai during Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (pictured right)
