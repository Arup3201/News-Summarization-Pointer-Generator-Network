Police are refusing to prosecute a Polish immigrant caught on camera stealing scrap metal, because he didn't realise he was committing a crime.

Businessman George Pasparakis caught the culprit red-handed after fitting CCTV outside Wessex Industrial Doors in Yeovil, Somerset - following a number of raids on the company.

Officers quickly tracked down the thief and he even admitted his actions - but police chiefs decided not to prosecute him, because he claimed taking scrap metal is legal in Poland.

Target: George Pasparakis has been targetted six times by scrap metal thieves

Mr Pasparakis, 37, is 'gobsmacked' by the decision.

He said: 'I’m not sure how bad a crime has to be where you can claim ignorance before they take action.

'We’re so frustrated at what we were told. I was gobsmacked and I think the police officer was too.

'He almost seemed embarrassed. Is Polish law operating in Yeovil?'

The price of scrap metal has skyrocketed in recent years from £80 per skip to between £300 and £400 per skip.

Mr Pasparakis had six skips emptied in the last few months and spent more than £500 on 24-hour CCTV surveillance system.

The company has also spent hundreds 
of pounds building a large retractable container to protect a skip 
outside the premises used to store metal off-cuts.

So when the CCTV picked up a good 
shot of the Polish man and his vehicle in June they thought they would 
be able to bring a successful prosecution against him.

On the first occasion the thief even brought his young daughter with him.

The businessman was stunned when the police decided not to prosecute because the thief didn't know he had committed a crime

Mr Pasparakis said: 'The first time he took scrap metal he bought his little girl along.

'We watched on CCTV as she ran around looking bored as emptied the skip. It was dumbfounding.'

But police decided it was not in the 'public interest' to charge the man, who has not been named.

Sergeant Richard Downing said: 'We received two reports of theft from a skip. These incidents were fully investigated.

'A man was arrested and questioned. The man fully admitted the incidents and was unaware it was a crime.

'On consideration it was decided it was not of public interest to prosecute this man.'

A police spokesman added that to prosecute the man they would have to prove there was an intent to commit a crime.

Police can't prosecute because they can't prove intent to commit a crime
