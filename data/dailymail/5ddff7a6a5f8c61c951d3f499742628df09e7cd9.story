Manuel Pellegrini admitted that Manchester City were simply not good enough as their Champions League hopes suffered another blow on Tuesday night.

City were held 1-1 by Roma after veteran Francesco Totti cancelled out Sergio Aguero’s early penalty to become the oldest scorer in the competition at the age of 38.

It leaves the Premier League champions adrift of the Italians and five points behind Group E leaders Bayern Munich, who won 1-0 at CSKA Moscow, and facing an uphill battle to qualify for the knockout stage. Next up are successive games against CSKA.

'We have just one point from six but also we are just three points behind Roma, so there is a lot of things (to play for),' said Pellegrini.

'We hope next game in Russia we can win and we will see what happens against Bayern Munich.

‘We didn’t play well, especially in the first half. We improved but I think the draw was the real (right) thing for both teams. Playing at home it is never good just to draw, but we played against a very strong team in a good moment.

‘In the last 20 minutes we played more like the team you usually see here. Today was not our day.

‘Maybe we were not accurate in our passing and when we lost too many balls we did not have enough midfielders to recover. I think the most problem was we lost many easy passes.’

A subdued atmosphere inside the Etihad, with lots of empty seats, did not help.

Asked how difficult it would be to qualify for the knockout phase now, Pellegrini said: 'We don't know. It depends on the way we play the next game.

'We have 12 more points to fight (for) and we will fight to the end to try and qualify.'

Although City finished the stronger of the two side, they were fortunate not to concede again.

Pellegrini played down suggestions he might have been taken aback by Roma's bold approach. 

'It was not a surprise for me,' said the Chilean. 'They are a team in form with great players. They made it difficult for us, it was a difficult game but I thought we could win it in the last 20 minutes.'

Pellegrini refused to single out any players for blame for the equaliser, which Totti finished with a superb flick over Joe Hart after being afforded plenty of space.

Pellegrini said: 'I think that when the other team scores a goal it is not just a problem of one or two players. I think that he had too much space in that play.

'Maybe it was an easy goal for them but you must have the quality and the capacity to return to your normal performance.'
