Free: The case against Rebecca Leighton, linked to the deaths of three patients, has been dropped

The nurse charged over an alleged murder plot involving tampering with saline drips walked free last night.

Rebecca Leighton said: ‘I have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something I had not done.’

The 27-year-old was held over the poisoning in which seven patients at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, died and up to 40 patients were affected in June and July.

The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against her  yesterday, saying it was ‘no longer appropriate’ for them to pursue a prosecution.

Miss Leighton's solicitor Carl Richmond was flanked by her parents outside the family home as he read a statement from her.

She said:'First and foremost I would wish to thank with all my heart all of those people who have supported me and have not given up on me and never doubted my innocence during this living nightmare.

'If it was not for the unerring love and support of my family, my mum Lynda, dad David and brother Darren, my fiance Tim, and all my friends, I do not know how I would have coped.

'I would also like to thank the members of the public who have also supported me and have believed in my innocence.

'I have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something I had not done.

'Nonetheless, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff at HMP Styal for their love and support.

'It was so frustrating for me knowing that the person who has actually carried out these terrible acts is still out there..

'My life has been turned upside down. All I ever wanted to do was to pursue a profession in nursing and to care for my patients.

'I think it is unbelievable that anyone in the medical profession would ever put patients' lives at risk.'

Family and friends of Rebecca Leighton never doubted her innocence.

Neighbours did not have a bad word to says about the nurse who shared a flat in Heaviley, Stockport with fiance Tim Papworth above the darts shop he owns.

They described her as 'popular', 'lovely', 'nice', 'wouldn't hurt a fly.' Messages of support poured in via Facebook.

Her parents, David and Lynda, attended her first court appearance at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Walking hand in hand with them was Mr Papworth.

It was also revealed she had received 'considerable support' from ex-patients.

Anyone visiting the Facebook page of the former Open University student would have seen numerous photographs of a happy-go-lucky young woman who enjoyed an active social life.

The only theme among her Facebook wall updates which revealed this fun-loving character was the many messages referring to her feeling tired from work and long night shifts at the hospital.

Miss Leighton had been charged with contaminating the saline drips and also with theft of medical supplies.

The
contamination charges have now been dropped because of lack of 
sufficient evidence and the theft charge was dropped because it was not 
in the public interest to continue.

At
a bail application last month, lawyers representing Miss Leighton said 
the case against her was ‘weak’. But her appeal then to be released 
before an anticipated plea hearing in mid-October was rejected at 
Manchester Crown Court on the grounds of her own protection.

Yesterday
the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, Nazir Afzal, said it was
‘no longer appropriate’ to continue the case against Miss Leighton.

He said: ‘She was charged on the basis
that there was a reasonable suspicion that she had committed the 
offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the 
investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable period 
of time.

‘The inquiries have not provided us with a stronger case which would meet the test of a realistic prospect of conviction.

‘There is the prospect that further 
evidence may emerge which we would consider. The law does allow us to 
reinstate charges in those circumstances, particularly where the 
allegations are serious.’

Miss Leighton remains suspended from 
her job at the hospital. Her registration has been withdrawn by the 
Nursing and Midwifery Council pending an internal investigation.

Last night, at her parents’ home, in 
Denton, Tameside, her mother, also a nurse, said the last few 
weeks had been a ‘nightmare’.

She added: ‘We just want to be left in peace now so we can get on with our lives.’

Unsolved: Police are continuing to investigate the deaths at Stepping Hill Hospital, which occurred in July

Police insisted they weren’t back to ‘square one’.

Assistant Chief Constable Terry 
Sweeney of Greater Manchester Police said the investigation - one of the most complex since the 1996 bombing of the Arndale Centre by the IRA -  may continue
for many months.

He added: ‘This is one of the most challenging and 
complex investigations we have faced.

‘We have to work within a crime scene 
which is a very busy hospital where staff, visitors and patients have 
some degree of access to products within the hospital.’

Officers have interviewed 200 out of 
700 people they want to speak to. Their list includes hospital staff, 
patients and visitors.

He added: ‘All these people who came 
into the contact of the hospital were particularly poorly people so we 
have to understand the impact of contamination, although we are clear 
there was contamination in a number of saline products.’

George Arden, brother of Tracey Arden,
one of the victims, said that he believed police would find the person 
who killed his sister.

Asked what he thought about Miss 
Leighton being freed, he said: ‘It doesn’t make any difference. I don’t 
know the facts and I don’t know what happened. I think the police will 
find the right person.’
