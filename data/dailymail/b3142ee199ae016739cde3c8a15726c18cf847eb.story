He is meant to be helping to save the planet. Yet Lord Prescott has clocked up more than 40,000 air miles in five months – all while travelling to and from climate change conferences.

Since February the ex-Deputy Prime Minister and former Environment Secretary has attended all-expenses paid summits in Europe, North America, India and China.

There he has delivered lectures on the perils of damaging the environment and discussed new legislation which could restrict the ability of others to fly or drive cars in future.

What a gentleman: Lord Prescott carries the bags while Lady Prescott brings up the rear

But he has been leaving a substantial carbon footprint of his own.

The circumference of the globe is about 25,000 miles, meaning the former Hull East MP has travelled around the world almost twice in less than six months.

Analysis of declarations made by Lord Prescott in the House of Lords register of interests shows that between February 4 and 8 the former Environment Secretary was in Delhi to speak at a sustainable development summit.

The flights – more than 4,000 miles each way – were funded by the British Embassy. Transfers and hotel accommodation were provided by the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute and Lord Prescott’s expenses were paid by Globe International, an organisation for parliamentarians involved in green policy making.

Between February 26 and 28, Lord Prescott was about 4,000 miles away in Washington to attend and speak at Globe’s Climate Legislation Summit. His flights, hotel and subsistence were paid for by Globe International. His next trip was to Berlin on April 1 and 2, for meetings with Globe members, ministers and ‘climate negotiators’. Again, his travel and expenses were paid by Globe, while overnight accommodation for the 1,200-mile round trip was provided by the British Ambassador’s residence.

Lord Prescott then visited Paris on May 19 and 20 in order to attend meetings with climate negotiators, with subsistence and travel expenses paid for by Globe.

He flew to Mexico City – 5,545 miles away – between June 5 and 8 to attend meetings at the Mexican Congress with ‘climate negotiators’ organised by Globe, which paid for the peer’s hotel and travel expenses.

And last month he visited Guiyang in China from July 8 to 12 to attend the Eco-Forum Global (EFG) annual summer conference, where he gave a speech at the opening ceremony. Flights totalled about 11,000 miles for the round trip and were paid for, along with his accommodation, by Beijing-registered EFG.

Last November Lord Prescott flew to Cuba for a week’s holiday to write an article for The Guardian Weekend Travel Magazine.

His flights for the 9,000-mile round trip were paid for by travel firm Journey Latin America.

His hotel and subsistence were paid by the Cuban Tourist Board.

Lord Prescott did not return calls requesting a comment.
