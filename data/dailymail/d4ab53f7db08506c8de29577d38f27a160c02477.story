A shameless thief sneaked out of her grandmother's funeral so she could burgle her own mother.

Marla Everett, 33, who earlier this year was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in squalor, raided her mother's house in Immingham, Lincolnshire, and stole a laptop, two cameras and a television pay-per-view box containing money.

When her mother Susan Everett returned home she realised her neighbour's description of the thief was her own daughter.

Shameless: Marla Everett, 33, who earlier this year was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in squalor, sneaked out of her grandmother's funeral so she could burgle her own mother

Grimsby Crown Court was told that that both Everett and her mother had been at the funeral, but the younger woman had left early.

'Susan left home in the morning and the property was secure. She was going to the funeral at 11.30am,' said Martin Haworth, prosecuting.

'The defendant was present at the funeral and it was noted that they (Everett and an accomplice) left saying that they were going into Grimsby.'

He said the mother returned home at about 2.30pm and discovered 'items appeared to have been moved suggesting someone had been in her house'.

'The wooden cover of the catflap had been moved,' Mr Haworth said.

'She discovered that the laptop and two cameras were missing. A black pay-per-view box was missing from the main room.' 

Family gathering: Grimsby Crown Court was told that that both Everett and her mother had been at the funeral, but the younger woman (pictured) had left early 

'[After getting information from a neighbour] She made a call to her daughter asking that the goods be returned. She said she had spent the money from the TV box. 

'It seems that all the goods were recovered except the TV box, money and one camera charger.

'She said in interview "last night I robbed my mum's house while she was at a funeral".

Police went to the defendant's home in Duke Street and she was arrested.

Vicky Lee, mitigating said: 'It's maintained that there was £100 in the TV box.

'She hasn't been before a court for anything like this previously and has made full admissions. She has already returned most of the property back to her mother.'

Ms Lee asked Deputy District Judge Andrew Pascoe for Everett to be released on bail before she is sentenced, adding: 'She is desperate not to be in custody pending sentence for this.'

However, Judge Pascoe determined the matter would go to Crown Court for sentence as Everett was still on licence for her previous offence and remanded her in custody until her sentencing later this month.

In February she was jailed after  police found her three young boys living in appalling scenes of 'squalor' in a filthy and cluttered flat.

Squalor: Earlier this year Everett was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in this squalid flat

Mess: When an officer gained entry to the property in Grimsby, he was hit by a swarm of flies and a stench of urine, excrement and stale alcohol

Tip: The flat was full of rotting food, empty beer cans and discarded fast food wrappers

When an officer gained entry to the property in Grimsby, he was hit by a swarm of flies and a stench of urine, excrement and stale alcohol, with the flat full of rotting food, empty beer cans and discarded fast food wrappers.

Police were called to the home after a passerby spotted a two-year-old child on the balcony of the third-floor flat, swinging his legs through the railings.

When police arrived, Everett's partner Matthew Cartwright was drunk, was possibly under the influence of drugs and was in no fit state to look after children, Grimsby Crown Court heard in February. He had drunk eight to ten pints of lager.

Discarded: Two images show the mess around the television and children's play equipment left abandoned

Bathroom:There was barely any room to move in the bathroom, with toys and a pram filling the space

Bedroom: One of the children's bedrooms - which is virtually full with old toys, dirty washing and rubbish

Kitchen: The kitchen surface is filled with old food cans, discarded wrappers and empty pans

Eating habits: Food waste can be seen in the sink while the kitchen cupboards are left bare

A very drowsy Everett then appeared, apparently under the influence of something. She had smeared excrement on her neck and bra strap.

She and Cartwright, 39, each admitted three offences of cruelty to the boys, who were all aged under three and were taken into foster care.

She was jailed for a year by Judge David Tremberg, who allowed the couple's names to be published so that the case could be reported, and was on licence for those offences when she committed this latest crime.

Rotting: Old food left rotting in pans is left under the boiler, while a baby bottle sits in the dirty sink

Filled with rubbish: A wide shot of the kitchen shows rubbish on the floor and the work surfaces

Cruel: Food and pans are left in the sink while a chair and a bike wheel is left by the rubbish bin

Barricade: A stack of childrens' toys and other debris fills the hallway of the Grimsby flat

Trash: Empty bottles, cans of baby food and piles of paper left on surfaces in the living room
