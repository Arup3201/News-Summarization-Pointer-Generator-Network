A search is underway for an 18-year-old who was swept off rocks by a massive wave and into the ocean at Laguna Beach, California.

Anthony Parnell, from Las Vegas, Nevada, was on the rocks with his girlfriend and two friends just south of Thousand Steps Beach on Sunday when he was hit by high surf and washed away.

His devastated father, who rushed to California with his wife and other children when they learned the boy was missing, said he couldn't believe his son had been so close to the water.

'That boy was scared of the ocean,' Foster Parnell told the OC Register.

Fears: Anthony Parnell, pictured left and right with his girlfriend, was standing on rocks in Laguna Beach, California on Sunday afternoon when he was swept into the ocean by a massive wave

Scene: Searchers gather on the rocks close to where Parnell was last seen before the wave took over

'For him to be on those rocks? He swam, but wasn't a strong swimmer... He screamed underwater on a dive trip when he saw a fish.'

The group of friends had been exploring the rocks when the large wave hit them on Sunday afternoon - and when it washed away, they realized Parnell was gone.

Orange County lifeguards and the U.S. Coast Guard launched a massive search on foot and from the air, but as of Tuesday, the boy had still not been found. 

Jason Young, chief of Orange County Lifeguards, suggested that Parnell was swept into a crevasse and could be trapped in the maze of rocks beneath the surface.

He said his team were looking into the rocks and using tools to see if his body was down there.

Searchers told the family on Sunday that their job had changed from a rescue mission to a recovery mission - but the Parnells said they were not leaving the area until the teen's body was found.

'I just wish we could find him,' Mr Parnell told NBC. 'It's killing my wife, we just want to bring him back to Vegas... so we can have some closure. That's the bottom line. It will be hard to leave here without him.' 

Shock: His father, Foster Parnell, said they did not want to return home to Nevada without the boy's body

Concerns: A relative comforts Parnell's girlfriend as they wait for news on the beach

Parnell's parents say the teenager played football at Centennial High School in Las Vegas and had recently signed up for the Army - following in the footsteps of his two older brothers.

He was scheduled to start training this summer, his family said. 

He had four siblings - three brothers and a sister - and was close to all, his parents said.

Orange County Fire Authority Captain Steve Concialdi said that the area was popular yet dangerous. Nine people have died along the Orange 

'It's an area that has been a concern to local officials due to the dangerous conditions,' he said. 'No one should have to lose their life in such a beautiful place.'
