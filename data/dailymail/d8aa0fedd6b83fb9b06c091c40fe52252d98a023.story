A ‘terminal’ rift has severed relations between Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair over reports of the former premier’s friendship with the entrepreneur’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, it was reported yesterday.

Mr Blair has always stated that his relationship with Miss Deng is platonic.

But the media mogul has refused to speak to him since filing for divorce from Miss Deng in June, it is claimed.

A 'terminal' rift has severed relations between Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair over reports of the former premier's friendship with the entrepreneur's ex-wife Wendi Deng, it was reported yesterday

The breakdown of the friendship between the two men – described as a ‘terminal’ argument – is said to stem from claims Mr Blair and Miss Deng, 44, met on a number of occasions without the media mogul’s knowledge.

Staff at Mr Murdoch’s Californian cattle ranch claimed Mr Blair and Miss Deng twice stayed overnight on the same weekends in October 2012 and April this year.

They also stayed overnight at Mr Murdoch’s home in Los Angeles and met in London and New York, the Mail on Sunday said. There is no suggestion of impropriety by Mr Blair or Miss Deng.

In June, Mr Blair was forced to deny unfounded internet rumours which linked him with Mr Murdoch’s divorce.

At the time, his spokesman told the Hollywood Reporter: ‘If you are asking if they are having an affair, the answer is no.’

The divorce of Mr Murdoch, 82, and Miss Deng was finalised last week in a US court.

Yesterday, friends of both Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair embarked on a war of words about the breakdown of their friendship.

Mr and Mrs Blair married in March 1980. They have four children. Mrs Blair still works as a leading lawyer and is a respected recorder. Mr Blair travels the world in his role as a Middle East envoy for the United Nations

An acquaintance of the media tycoon, whose newspaper empire includes The Sun and The Sunday Times, said: ‘Rupert Murdoch will have nothing more to do with Tony Blair. Not ever.’

Another friend told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If you think that Rupert made a decision to end his  marriage and a long-term friendship without just cause, you are sorely mistaken.’

A close friend of Mr Blair told the Mail on Sunday that ‘the ridiculous stories about Wendi and Tony’ were ‘not true’.

Friends insisted the relationship between Miss Deng and Mr Blair was ‘entirely innocent and above board’. One added: ‘They never  met alone, there were always others around.

‘They are friends and Blair is godfather to one of the couple’s children, for heaven’s sake.’

Tony and Cherie Blair kept a low-profile and did not emerge from their townhouse in Connaught Square, Westminster, or their Grade I listed stately home in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, yesterday.

Mr and Mrs Blair married in March 1980. They have four children.

Mrs Blair still works as a leading lawyer and is a respected recorder. Mr Blair travels the world in his role as a Middle East envoy for the United Nations.

Yesterday Andy Hubble, Mr Blair’s neighbour in Wotton Underwood, said: ‘I heard he left early this morning or late last night, around 1am.

‘I don’t know if it was just him that left. They come here most weekends.’

A friend of Rupert Murdoch

Mr Blair and Mr Murdoch formed a powerful political alliance in 1997, when The Sun newspaper dramatically switched its support from the Conservatives to Labour with just six weeks to go before the general election.

Mr Murdoch’s support was seen  as crucial to the following three  elections, which kept the Labour leader in Downing Street from 1997 to 2007.

The pair formed a strong friendship and Mr Blair became god- father to the Murdochs’ daughter Grace in 2010.

A source close to Mr Blair said claims of an affair were ‘categorically untrue’.

The source said it was ‘a matter of public record’ that Mr Murdoch filed for a ‘no fault’ divorce.

Mr Murdoch met his third wife Miss Deng, a Yale business school graduate, in 1997 on a business trip to Shanghai when she agreed to act as a translator.

At a divorce hearing at New York’s Supreme Court, last week, a judge was told they had come to an  ‘amicable’ deal to end their 14- year marriage.

Spokesmen for both Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair declined to comment.
