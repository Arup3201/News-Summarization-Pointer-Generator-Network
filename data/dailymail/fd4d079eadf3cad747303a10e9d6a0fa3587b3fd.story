Pupils had been set to return from their Christmas holidays today but the school in Featherbed Lane remains shut while investigations continue.

A force spokesman said a detailed forensic examination of the scene was taking place, with officers hoping to have completed their work so the school can reopen on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said: 'Pupils were due to return to school tomorrow following the Christmas holidays but the decision has been taken to keep the school closed while investigations continue.

'Police hope to have completed their examination of the site tomorrow to allow the school to reopen on Wednesday.

'A date and time for the post-mortem has not been set yet.

'No more information regarding the deceased will be made available before formal identification has taken place.

'The deceased's next of kin has been informed.

'No additional information is available at this point.'

The body was found just 500 metres further along the same road where Julie Mercer, 47, was found dead at local business Shrewsbury Transport Ltd on Christmas Eve.

A man was arrested on suspicion of her murder but has been bailed while detectives continue their investigation.

Police are not linking the two murders and believe they are unconnected.  

Mother-of-three Georgina Hughes, 39, whose eight-year-old daughter goes to the school, said: 'As a parent it is very worrying.

'They have very high security fences so I have no idea how they have got in there. The body was found in a doorway by a side entrance into the school.

'So they have managed to get well and truly on the site, which is also very concerning.

'I'm not sure whether a teacher or staff member found the body or not - but it is very shocking nonetheless. 

'The school has been closed today anyway due to a personal development day and will probably be tomorrow now as well.

'The sooner we can get back to normality the better because it feels quite unnerving '

Another 79-year-old neighbour, who did not want to be named, added: 'I have lived on this street for 30 years and I have never known anything like it.

'This is a nice and peaceful street and always has been, but maybe its just a sign of the times. Unfortunately these things seem to be happening all over the place.'

Harlescott Junior School caters for 277 boys and girls from the age of seven to 11. It received a rating of 'Good' in its most recent Ofsted inspection in July 2013.

Joe Thomas, 33, whose house backs onto the school fields, said: 'I came back from work earlier and saw all the police.

'I think the people were arrested here at the back of the field. Loads of people go on the school field to mess about.

'It's quite far from the front of the school where the body was so maybe they did a runner.'

One 32-year-old father, whose six-year-old son attends the school, added: 'The school has been very proactive in getting in touch with parents to keep us informed.

'But it sends shivers down your spin to think there was a dead body in the playground where your children are playing.

'Thank goodness the school was closed - the thought of a young child returning from their Christmas holidays to find a corpse is like something from a horror movie.

'It doesn't give me great comfort about the security of the place - as people can get on site so easily.

'I know the people involved are probably unrelated to the school but I think I will still feel very nervous and apprehensive for a while about sending my boy off in the mornings.'

Another neighbour added: 'It's terrible to hear what has happened.

'There is quite a big estate here behind the school but no-one is near the front so we don't know what happened.

'You see kids jumping the fence and going on the field on weekends but these people are older so it's rather strange.'
