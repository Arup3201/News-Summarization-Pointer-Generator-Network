Gregg Stevenson, who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, walks with the revolutionary Genium X3 knee - which is controlled by Bluetooth and uses Wii technology

A former soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan has told how being fitted with the world’s most advanced bionic knee has transformed his life.

Gregg Stevenson, 29, is the first wounded serviceman to wear  a ground-breaking prosthetic limb which has a Bluetooth remote control to switch from walking, jogging, cycling and even golfing modes.

It can also automatically sense and react to his movements, enabling it to adapt seamlessly when he breaks out into a run or tackles a flight of stairs.

The device is also waterproof, meaning he can keep it on in the shower or at the beach.Yesterday Mr Stevenson, who lives with wife Melanie and two-year-old son Harry in Foulridge, Lancashire, said the new limb would give him ‘almost complete freedom’.

‘Before, I had to switch between different knees for different activities – this is much, much easier,’ he said. ‘I feel blessed that I’ve regained this much mobility.’

Mr Stevenson was just a fortnight from the end of his first tour of duty with the elite 24 Commando Engineer Regiment supporting the Royal Marines in Helmand Province in 2009 when a Taliban IED exploded.

He lost his left leg above the knee and his right leg just below it.

Last month he was given the new Genium X model of knee, funded by the Ministry of Defence.

The £70,000 limb, the first to be fitted in the UK, is programmed from a laptop and can be switched manually between different modes.But what makes it particularly ground-breaking is it also uses Wii-style sensors to anticipate when the wearer is breaking into a run – to catch a bus, for example – and adapts accordingly, just like a human leg.

It was designed with the US military and was attached at Lancashire Teaching Hospital’s Specialist Mobility Rehabilitation Centre in Preston.

Yesterday, Mr Stevenson said:  ‘I’ve just started kicking a football with my son. He will have to keep up with me now.’

He added: ‘Since I was injured, I haven’t been able to go back to work as an engineer because the prosthetic legs that I was using before really limited my movement, but now I’m hoping to get back to work. It’s fantastic.’

The limb, developed in part with the Ministry of Defence, can switch between modes to allow the user to perform several different everyday actions

The knee (pictured left on the nearest leg and right being adjusted) can change between modes - such as swimming, running, driving and biking, using a Bluetooth remote. Previously Mr Stevenson would have to change prosthetic in order to do different activities

The prosthetic was funded by the Ministry of Defence.

The prosthetic is made from aluminium, steel and carbon fibre and costs £70,000.

It
 gives the wearer the most anatomically correct walking posture and 
provides a similar gait - or walking pattern - to a human leg.

The knee operation automatically bends when the user picks their foot off the ground - and so simulates natural walking style.

It has a battery life of five days - much longer than any other previous models and is the first to be completely waterproof.

It is the first prosthetic that allows the wearer to walk backwards and up stairs and over obstacles.

It
 is capable of doing several modes - including biking, golfing, driving,
 walking and running - all of which are programmed in to the prosthetic 
by a computer before fitting. The user can switch between modes using a 
Bluetooth remote.

The 
knee also uses similar technology used in Wii gaming consoles and 
smartphones to sense when the user is about to go change activity - and 
so can automatically switch between walking and running modes.

There is also a mute button so that it can be silenced for 
things like meetings or trips to the cinema.

The
 war veteran said today the 'fantastic' prosthetic will give him 'almost
 complete freedom' to play with his young son Harry, 2. He also hopes it
 will mean he can return to work as an engineer.

He
 said: 'It feels fantastic, we’ll balanced and comfortable. I can now 
walk up and down stairs, backwards and it’s waterproof which is really 
important. 

'It sounds like a small thing but I will be able to take Harry for swimming lessons and go to the beach.

Mr Stevenson's new leg is programmed by a computer to execute a variety of settings. The father says he will have far more freedom to play with his child now he has the prosthetic

'Before I had to switch between different knees for different activities, this is much, much easier.

'I’ve just started kicking a football with him and got him some mini golf clubs. Harry will have to keep up with me now.'

Lancashire
 Teaching Hospital’s Specialist Mobility Rehabilitation Centre (SMRC) in
 Preston also became the first in the UK to fit the world’s most 
advanced prosthetic knee.

Mr Stevenson said: 'I am so pleased to be the first person to use this new leg and I am so grateful to the staff at the SMRC.

'Since
 I was injured I haven’t been able to go back to work as an engineer 
because the prosthetic legs that I was using before really limited my 
movement, but now I’m hoping to get back to work.

'It’s
 fantastic. The encouragement of my friends, family and the soldiers 
from the regiment has been immense. I feel blessed that I’ve regained 
this much mobility'

Dr 
Fergus Jepson, Consultant at the SMRC said: 'It’s so pleasing to see a 
young man who is a double amputee, as a result of fighting for his 
country, being given a new lease of life thanks to this amazing new 
technology.

We know how
 much this will enhance Gregg’s life and give him new opportunities and 
we are so proud to be the first centre in the UK to provide this piece 
of kit for one of our patients.'

In 2010 the Government announced plans to invest £15 million to support and improve prosthetic services for military veterans.

Following this, staff at the SMRC have been working in partnership with
 the Veteran’s Prosthetic Panel and Ottobock, who have designed the new 
Genium X3 knee, to develop new prosthetic technology.

The leg has previously only been used by a handful of veterans with similar disabilities in the USA.

Materials:  Uses corrosion resistant materials such as titanium, hard
 anodised aluminum, stainless steel, and coating.Waterproof:
 The prosthetic has undergone stringent waterproof testing and is completely 
submersible.Battery life: 5 
days. Charging point is at the back of the knee and 
can even be charged through clothing. Sensors: The Genium X3 has additional sensors. From the moment the heel strikes the 
ground until the toe lifts off, the sensors tell the microprocessor 
exactly where the wearer is in the walking cycle, as well as measuring the 
amount of force acting on the knee - helping give the user the 
most natural movement possible. New technologies: An accelerometer and a gyroscope 
intuitively know where the leg is in space, using the same technologies
 from Wii gaming systems and smartphones, for a virtually natural gait.
 Activity modes: Offers five activity modes including –biking, 
golfing, and more – activated using a key fob-sized remote. Run: Innovative Walk2Run mode detects 
start-and-stop running - such as crossing a street or trying to catch a 
bus.
