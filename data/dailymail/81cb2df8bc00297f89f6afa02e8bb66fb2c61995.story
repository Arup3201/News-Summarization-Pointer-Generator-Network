KFC may have disqualified Taylor Swift from a coveted Triple J Hottest 100 spot after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown.

The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers.

The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict  policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote.

KFC is offering a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989, which may see Taylor Swift disqualified from the Triple J Hottest 100

'The #‎tay4hottest100 campaign is going strong and she’s got our vote,' KFC announced on it's Facebook page last Thursday.

'Tell us which Taylor song is your favourite for your chance to win a voucher for $19.89! (Generous, we know). #‎taylortribute'.

The voucher may be in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'.

While ABC has declined to comment officially, former Triple J announcer Angela Catterns told The Drum on Monday that Swift had been disqualified.

'You probably know that there was a push to get a Taylor Swift song in (the Hottest 100), which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process,' Ms Catterns said.

Take that! If Taylor's number 75 ranking on Social Hottest 100 is an accurate prediction, hipsters nationwide may well hurl into a fits of range come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves

Haters gonna hate! Swift's catchy tune Shake It Off has a good chance at cracking Triple J's Hottest 100

The response to the potential blow KFC may have dealt to the #tay4hottest100campaign  has been as divided as the movement itself.

'Thank you KFC!!! You just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it!!!' said one Facebook user.

'I hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now I know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish'.

'You've ruined #Tay4Hottest100 KFC! Arrghh!!!' said another user.

Other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome.

'Fantastic. For the first time ever KFC has done something useful and gotten Taylor Swift disqualified from the hottest 100,' said one Facebook user.

'if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then I hereby pledge to only eat KFC when I have that fast food craving....' said another. 

A spokesperson for KFC  

We know many of our fans are music lovers and our recent post has caused a bit of a stir so to avoid any more confusion we have removed the post. The post simply asked our fans to tell us what their favourite Taylor Swift song was for the opportunity to win a voucher, we were not incentivising people to vote for the Hottest 100.

Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy.

If Taylor's number 75 ranking on Social Hottest 100 is an accurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves.

Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters

More than 20,000 votes were tallied to come up with the Shake It Off singer's double digit spot, beating out hits by Triple J favourites Vance Joy and Banks.

Peking Duk ft. Nicole Miller's tune High came in at number one while Chet Faker takes second and third position with Talk Is Cheap and 1998, respectively.

Milky Chance are at number four with Stolen Chance, and Peking Duk return in fifth place for Take Me Over ft. Safia.  

'Here we go, after countless hours of tallying the votes of those kind individuals who shared them on social media, our predicted #hottest100,' the poll's Twitter account wrote.

Songs that are eligible for the list this year have to be released between December 1, 2013 and November 30, 2014, according to the radio station's site.

The campaign to get Taylor on the list kicked off after super fan Joe McKenzie tweeted ABC boss Mark Scott about the omission of Swift's hit Shake It Off from the voting list.

Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS

'Triple J is refusing to let me vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100 I personally blame @mcscott [Scott's Twitter handle],' he wrote.

To which, Scott replied: 'Shake it off Joe.'

The tweet sparked a social media campaign, with fans of Swift boycotting the Australia Day tradition by voting for her songs and trending the hashtag '#Tay4hottest100'.

In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters, some with death threats.

'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS. 

A Triple J spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia last week she could not comment on the movement.

'We don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open, as it may influence the results of the poll,' she said.
