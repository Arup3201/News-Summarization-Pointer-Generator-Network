West Ham have been kicking off their pre-season in New Zealand and have found time to unwind between the rigorous sessions.

Birthday boy Stewart Downing had a bash at a crazy golf course in Auckland, with the club posting a picture of the former England man teeing off a tricky-looking zig-zag hole.

Sam Allardyce's side trained at the North Harbour Stadium in the city with hundreds of far-flung Hammers turning up to catch a glimpse of their heroes.

They line up first against Wellington Phoenix on Wednesday before heading south to take on Sydney FC.

Star attraction in Auckland was homegrown hero Winston Reid, who captains the New Zealand national team.

Supporters at the ground hailed from all over the world, delivering a stirring, international version of cub anthem I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles.
