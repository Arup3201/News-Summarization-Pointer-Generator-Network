Intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one-off consultation, claim researchers.

A new study shows a brief rehab programme can help patients just as much as 20 sessions of physio over three months.

Intensive physio is often recommended for people with whiplash injuries, costing insurers millions of pounds each year.

Intense physio sessions to help car crash victims recover from whiplash injury offer no more relief than a one-off consultation researchers from the University of Sydney have claimed

But the study shows a one-off meeting with a physio, information leaflet and follow-up telephone call were enough to help them cope with pain.

Pain expert Dr Zoe Michaleff, of The University of Sydney in Australia, said 'Our study provides further evidence that prolonged expensive clinical interventions for chronic whiplash injury are no more effective than briefer treatment programs that teach the patient how to self-manage their pain.'

Between September 2009 and February 2012 researchers randomly allocated 172 chronic whiplash patients to one of two types of recovery programme.

There were still almost half a million whiplash compensation claims in 2012 and the Government is planning a crackdown on whiplash injury fraud

They had all been in a motor accident over three months before the trial began, but no more than five years had passed since being injured, says a report in The Lancet medical journal.

One group received just a single half-hour consultation with a trained physiotherapist who went over a pamphlet that provided information on whiplash-related disorders, suggestions on how to self-manage pain, and a simple exercise routine.

They could telephone the physio for advice if needed, but this was limited to two calls.

A second group were given 20 one-hour, bespoke physiotherapy sessions during a 12-week programme.

The sessions used posture re-education, stretching training and exercises, scapular training, aerobic exercise, and strength training to help recovery.

Researchers found that for both groups pain was reduced at 14 weeks, six months, and 12 months after the first session and there were 'no clinically meaningful differences' between the two.

Dr Michaleff said 'The need to identify effective and affordable strategies to prevent and treat musculoskeletal disorders should be an important health priority.

'This is especially true for those with chronic whiplash-associated disorders because most patients have tried and failed previous treatments, and their continuing symptoms mean they would be unlikely to pursue more of the same approaches.'

There were still almost half a million whiplash compensation claims in 2012 and the Government is planning a crackdown on whiplash injury fraud.

Insurers say these claims cost them more than £2billion in payouts and lead to an average premium increase of £90 for drivers.
