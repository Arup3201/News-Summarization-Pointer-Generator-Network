We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Tess Daly's legs.

When Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly's legs are on display, they always look super-toned.

Tess may not be a fitness addict, but she enjoys yoga, Pilates and swimming

The 45-year-old mother-of-two (pictured) is not a fitness addict, but enjoys yoga, Pilates and swimming to keep herself in shape.

'I'm not militant about it,' she says. 'I try to make fitness a part of my everyday routine.'

She and her husband - fellow TV presenter Vernon Kay - prefer home workouts to the gym.

'Vernon puts the exercise bike in the front room, so I can workout while watching TV,' says Tess.

What to try:

The single leg circle is a Pilates-type move that really tones the leg muscles.

Lie on your back on the floor with arms by your sides, palms down. Point your left foot and extend your leg towards the ceiling.

Breathe in, then draw an imaginary circle in a clockwise direction on the ceiling with your left foot, moving your whole leg but keeping your hips still.

Repeat five times and then change direction. Repeat with the right leg.
