A young couple jailed for burglarizing Miley Cyrus and stealing her $100,000 sports car have said they were inspired by the notorious Bling Ring.

Aspiring models Naomi Charles, 21 and boyfriend Tylor Scott, 19, both pleaded guilty to breaking and entering the singer’s home on May 30 this year.

It has now emerged that just like the infamous teen gang, the young woman was the leader of the two, and the lure of fame the trigger.

Bling ringed: Aspiring models Naomi Charles, 21, and boyfriend Tylor Scott, 19, burglarized Miley Cyrus home in Studio City, LA in May, stealing jewellery and her $100,000 car, after being inspired by the Bling Ring gang

Crime: The couple scaled a fence to enter singer Miley Cyrus' home and stole jewellery, purses, clothing and her $100,000 Maserati

Charles and Scott scaled a fence and entered the We Can’t Stop singer’s home in Studio City, LA, while she was on tour and stole an unknown amount of jewellery, clothing and purses, as well as her 2014 Maserati Quattroporte.

Miley Cyrus’ assistant reported the burglary the following day after noticing items out of place in the home.

The car was found a few days later in Simi Valley, 45 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, LAPD said at the time.

Charles, a Los Angeles resident, and Scott, from Arizona, were arrested on June 5 in North Hollywood, after being recognised from the surveillance video of the theft – just like the infamous Bling Ring members.

The Bling Ring was a group of seven teens and young adults based around Calabasas, California who burglarized the homes of several stars, including Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox, Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Lindsay Lohan, in the late noughties.

Inspiration: Charles told police the couple were inspired by the infamous Bling Ring, a group of teen burglars whose story was brought to the big screen in 2013, starring Emma Watson and Katie Chang

Hot wheels: The couple also stole Miley's $100,000 Maserati, which was found abandoned 45 miles from Los Angeles a few days after the burglary

Talk to the hand: Miley, pictured in concert during her Bangerz Tour in Mexico City on Friday, have yet to comment on the guilty verdicts

Last year, the Bling Ring story was turned into
 a movie directed by Sofia Coppola and starring Emma Watson as the best 
known of the bunch – Alexis Neiers.

After
 pleading guilty in 2009, Ms Neiers went on to star in a reality-tv show
 about her life, in effect, gaining minor fame as a result of her 
crimes, something which may have inspired Charles.

Before
 committing the burglary, Charles shared photos of expensive cars and 
wads of cash on Twitter, with the caption: ‘Life goals.’

The ‘fitness model’ also posted on social media that she wished she ‘was like Miley’.

The Bonnie and Clyde-couple both pleaded guilty to guilty to felony residential burglary on Monday, September 22, telling police of their inspiration, TMZ reports.

Charles was sentenced to one year in county jail and four years probation, while Scott, who has a previous criminal record, was given a harsher sentence.

Scott,
 who also pled guilty to felony grand theft and admitted to bringing a 
firearm to the burglary, was sentenced to five years in state prison.

Miley Cyrus, who is currently on her South American leg of her Bangerz Tour, have not made any comments on the verdicts, instead posting snaps of herself in bed and on stage on her Instagram.
