One of the Duchess of Cambridge's favorite fashion labels has landed on U.S. shores at Bloomingdale's.

Hobbs, which launched in 1981 in North London, has witnessed a surge in popularity over recent years thanks to the 32-year-old royal's endorsement.

She and her younger sister Pippa Middleton, have been seen wearing a number of designs from the brand which prides itself on making clothing, shoes and accessories the 'modern woman loves to wear.'

Prices for Hobbs’ collection start at $149 for knitwear, with dresses starting at $175 and pants at $225.

As well as the main collection there a several special ranges including 'Invitation' - consisting of occasionwear - and the more playful line, 'NW3'.

Other pieces in her wardrobe from the brand include a white and beige summer dress and a Dalmatian-print coat.

Her 30-year-old sister Pippa turned heads at Wimbledon in 2011 as she stepped out in a bright red dress from Hobbs' NW3 collection. Instantly the item sold out.

Tennis star Andy Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears and singer Joss Stone are among other celebrity fans of Hobbs.

Clare Dobbie, the company's marketing and e-commerce director, said the partnership with Bloomingdale’s follows on from the launch of a dedicated U.S. website late last year.

A number of British retailers have attempted to expand in the U.S. and failed. However, fashion brands including Paul Smith, Ted Baker, Topshop and Burberry have succeeded.

Ms Dobbie told WWD that sales 'took off like a rocket' when Hobbs' U.S. website launched and currently online trade is up 50per cent on last year.

Alongside the Bloomingdale’s concessions, Hobbs has franchise stores in the United Arab Emirates and Sweden and, according to Retail Week, there are plans to open in China.

Hobbs chief executive Nicky Dulieu concluded: 'We believe customers will be attracted to our rich British heritage and reputation for quality tailoring, footwear, coats, dresses and accessories.'
