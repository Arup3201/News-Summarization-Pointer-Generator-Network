'It has been a long summer and I've been waiting a long time to finalise the deal,' Tavernier told Wigan's official website.

'Now that it has been completed, I'm delighted.

'Wigan Athletic are a Premier League club and I've always known them to be a Premier League club and hopefully I can help get us back where we belong.'

The Bradford-born full-back progressed through Newcastle's youth system and has also had loan spells at Carlisle, Sheffield Wednesday, MK Dons and Shrewsbury.
