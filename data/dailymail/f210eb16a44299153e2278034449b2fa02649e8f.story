Russian Boxer Magobed Abusalamov, 32, is in a coma after losing to heavyweight champion Mike Perez in a 10-round duel on Saturday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York.

The fighter's family and his manager are outraged and curious as to why the state boxing officials let the bloodied and severely injured boxer leave the arena on his own.

New York Magazine reports that according to the fighter's manager Boris Grinberg, doctors who inspected Abusalamov after the fight in his dressing room failed to recognize the severity of his injuries.

'He says, "Count one, two, three, four, five …," and then he tells him to make sure he goes to hospital tomorrow because his nose might be broken,' Grinberg says. “They give him no attention! No ambulance!'

They tested his urine for drugs. They then allowed him to leave the venue.

Abdusalamov known as the 'Russian Tyson,' walked out of the garden like any other fan, and hailed a cab with the help of his manager Boris Grinberg's son and a passerby.

The fighter took a cab to Roosevelt Hospital where he struggled to get immediate medical attention. He vomited a second time, complained of headaches, and finally passed out.

He wasn't helped until his Manager yelled out, 'He is fighter from Madison Square Garden.' He is former champion of Russia,' Grinberg says.

When ER staff took over, he was put through a CAT-scan machine. Doctors later performed surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. They removed a portion of the fighters skull to lessen some of the pressure from brain swelling.

Doctors also medically induced a coma, hoping that he would start to heal.

The New York Daily News reports that while the fighter was in stable condition on Sunday, Liz Dowling, assistant director of affairs at Roosevelt Hospital, says he is now in 'critical condition.'

'I am not afraid to say it. New York State Athletic Commission is horrible. It is dangerous for these people to be so careless and not do anything,'said Grinberg.

The fighter's wife and three daughters and other family members are saddened by the lack of aid given by the Athletic Commission. They are also worried about the medical bills which will go beyond the $10,000 insurance policy that the state requires promoters to hold for fighters.

Dagestani boxer Magobed Abusalamov was no match against Cuban fighter Mike Perez who studied at the rigorous and technically based Cuban amateur program. New York Magazine reports that Perez fought over 300 matches before working professionally.

Abdusalamov started boxing in his early twenties and relied on brawn over technical skill. He managed to go pretty far--knocking out 18 of his opponents before the fifth round prior to Saturday.

On Saturday night, after breaking his powerful left hand in the first round, he'd lost his golden fist.

Perez punched his opponent to the point where Abdusalov asked his manager, 'How's my face look?' in the sixth round.

Abdusalamov's promoter, Nathan Lewkowicz, says he couldn't tell his fighter was in serious condition until after the fight. He partially attributes this to the language barrier.

Lewkowicz believes his fighter will survive. He told the Daily News, 'We're pretty bullish he'll make it through.'

Lewkowicz told reporters, 'I spoke to his manager around 10 a.m. and he said he was stable. It's possible they might have been saying that (he's in critical condition) because he's in the ICU.'

The Athletic Commission released a statement on Monday saying, 'It is reviewing the circumstances surrounding Mr.Abdusalamov's injuries. We are hopeful he makes a complete and speedy recovery.'
