David Cameron faces fresh humiliation at the hands of Nicolas Sarkozy after the French president stole a march on the British in preparations for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

The Prime Minister was last night accused of ‘dragging his feet’ over the important commemorations in 2014 and letting the French race ahead with spectacular anniversary plans.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal they will include a £25 million state-of-the-art Museum Of The Great War to be announced by Mr Sarkozy on Remembrance Day next month.

The French president, who last week told Mr Cameron to ‘shut up’ and stop interfering in the eurozone crisis talks, is also pledging millions for other events across France.

Even Belgium is years ahead, with firm proposals including a memorial garden in London made from soil from the battlefields of Flanders.

Last week, a slanging match broke out at Westminster over the lack of planning, with MPs saying neither the Department for Culture nor the Ministry of Defence was taking the lead.

First World War experts urged Mr Cameron to get a grip on commemorating the centenary of a conflict that cost the lives of 750,000 Britons.

Respected war historian Professor Hew 
Strachan, a trustee of the Imperial War Museum and the man who was asked
 by the Coalition to draw up proposals for the Government’s military 
covenant, said: ‘Regrettably, other countries involved in the Great War 
are more advanced in their preparations for what will be a momentous 
occasion.

'It is vital we catch up to ensure Britain’s contribution to 
the historic conflict is properly reflected.’

Last night, Whitehall sources said the
 deadlock had been broken, with news that No 10 had chosen Tory MP and 
ex-Royal Navy surgeon Andrew Murrison to be the PM’s representative for 
the centenary.

The 100th anniversary of the 1914-18 
conflict is expected to be a huge event across Europe, but there has 
been mounting concern at the failure of Britain to take the lead.

Sources said one problem was that the MoD preferred to mark the 
centenary of the end of the war, rather than its start.

Labour peer Lord Faulkner, chairman of
 the all-party War Heritage Group, wrote to Mr Cameron last July to warn
 it was not just France that was outstripping Britain.

Australia had already set up a 
centenary commission, while in the US, a Bill was passing through 
Congress to create a national centenary committee, Lord Faulkner said.

In his reply, Mr Cameron confirmed  there were as yet no agreed detailed
 plans ‘for this important anniversary’.

He added: ‘The Government is focused 
on plans to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen next year 
as well as host the Olympic Games.’

The Mail on Sunday has established just how far ahead France was. MoD sources in Paris revealed the centrepiece of the French commemorations would be a new museum at Meaux.

The location, near the site of two great battles of the Marne, raises fears the French will downplay the role of British ‘Tommies’.

An MoD source said Mr Sarkozy, who is up for re-election next year, would make the most of the commemoration plans.

‘He wants to confirm himself as the world leader who sees remembrance of the Great War as one of the century’s most important events,’ said the source.

The Imperial War Museum said it was marking the centenary with ‘a vibrant programme’ including the opening of permanent First World War galleries.

No 10 said announcements about the anniversary ‘will be made shortly’.
