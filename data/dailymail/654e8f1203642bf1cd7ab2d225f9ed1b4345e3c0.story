They arrived at court together sporting broad grins. But for once the Chuckle Brothers had to be separated so they could give evidence independently in support of Dave Lee Travis.

Speaking in broad Yorkshire accents, Barry and Paul Elliott – best known for their BBC children’s show ChuckleVision – dismissed allegations that the former Radio 1 DJ molested a female stage hand at a pantomime in the early 1990s.

The comedy duo also denied the suggestion that there was a policy of keeping Travis, 68, away from female cast and crew members because of his reputation with women.

Sex abuse trial: The Chuckle Brothers, Barry Elliott and Paul Elliott, were giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court today and said they did not remember a sex attack involving DJ Dave Lee Travis when they were in panto

Allegations: One stage hand has accused Travis of groping her during a panto season in Crawley where one of The Chuckle Brothers walked in on them, the court heard

Earlier
 in the trial, the Chuckle Brothers were said to have disturbed Travis 
as he groped a 21-year-old woman in his dressing room at a theatre in 
Crawley, West Sussex, during a six-week production of Aladdin.

Yesterday
 they told Southwark Crown Court they could not remember the alleged 
attack and said they would have been informed if it had taken place.

In the panto the Chuckle Brothers played the Chinese policemen while Travis was evil wizard Abanazar.

In the witness box Barry, 69, called Travis ‘just a jolly nice chap to work with’.

He
 said: ‘He was very nice. We did two pantos with him. He was fine. He 
was great. I mean everybody seemed to get on. He was just like everybody
 else – we used to play cards together sometimes.’

Asked if he remembered Travis ever ‘struggling’ with a young woman in his dressing room, Barry said: ‘I don’t remember that.

‘If it was something serious we probably would, but I don’t remember anything like that at all.’

His
 brother Paul, 66, was asked by defence barrister Stephen Vullo if he 
recalled any inappropriate behaviour by the former Radio 1 star.

Dressing room allegations: A stagehand said Dave Lee Travis, who was playing evil uncle Abanazar in a production of Aladdin (pictured), groped her from 'head to toe' until a Chuckle Brother walked in on him

He
 replied: ‘No sorry, I don’t. It is a complete surprise to me. He was 
very professional. He seemed to go home straight away after the show 
every night and that was it.’

Paul said he had never heard about a formal or informal policy of keeping women away from Travis at the pantomime.

‘I think I would remember,’ he told the court. ‘Nobody told us about it if there was.’

Another
 witness, former senior BBC producer David Tate, told the court he had 
never heard of any complaint about Travis’s behaviour over the 30 years 
he worked with the DJ.

Travis,
 of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who is being tried under his real name 
of Dave Griffin, denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual 
assault.

Yesterday morning a female DJ told the jury claims Dave Lee Travis groped a 
carnival princess at the opening of a hospital radio station are 
'fantasy'.

Evidence: The Chuckle Brothers told the court that Travis was a 'fine man' and did not require a chaperone around women

The woman, 
who worked as a presenter at the station in Hertfordshire, said she 
watched Travis closely when he appeared as a guest at the launch in the 
early 1970s at the time of the alleged incident.

She
 told jurors at Southwark Crown Court in London it was 'utter nonsense' 
to suggest Travis became separated from a group of eight people meeting 
patients on the hospital's wards.

Addressing
 the witness, Stephen Vullo, defending Travis, said: 'The jury has heard
 from a complainant to suggest he and her separated from this group 
while inside the hospital?'

The
 woman replied: 'He was with his wife the whole time. I was watching 
what he was doing the whole time because he was an idol to me.

'It's utter nonsense or fantasy that anything like that happened.'

The woman, appearing as a defence 
witness, told the court that members of the press at the event wanted 
Travis to 'pick up' two carnival princesses at the launch for a 
photograph.

'I think I was a little miffed because the press were more interested in the carnival princesses than myself,' she said.

The woman, who was 17 at the time, told the court Travis was 'a lovely man' and 'very professional' during his guest appearance.

'He was, he is, a great DJ, an amazing person,' she said.

'It was just really, really exciting to have him come and open the radio station.'

The alleged incident is not part of the charges against Travis as he stands trial accused of a series of indecent assaults.

The
 68-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, is accused of indecently assaulting 
10 women and sexually assaulting another in incidents dating back to 
1976 and the height of his fame.

Appearing
 in court under his birth name David Griffin, the alleged offences 
occurred when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic 
Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in 
panto.

Meanwhile, an ex-senior BBC producer today said he had never
heard of any complaint about Travis behaving inappropriately towards women in
30 years of working with him.

David Tate, who worked on Radio 1 before moving to the World
Service, also revealed he never heard of a sexual complaint being made against
anyone at the BBC during his long career at the station.

Quizzed over his views on Travis, Mr Tate said he did ‘not
recognise the description’ of Travis as a ‘sexual predator’.

Asked if he ever saw Travis acting untoward towards women,
he told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Absolutely not. I didn't see anything of that
nature at all, whether it was untoward or inappropriate.

‘I would say that Dave is a very warm, open, friendly person
in my experience.

‘He would come to see us at the World Service once a week
and he might come up to me and give me a hug around the shoulder.

‘That might be inappropriate nowadays but I took that to
mean he is not just a colleague but also a friend.’

Mr Tate, who joined the BBC in the 1960s and worked on
Travis's teatime show on Radio 1, insisted the Corporation would not have
ignored women if they had come forward with allegations at the time.

He said: ‘I strongly believe they would be taken seriously,
because in that era the BBC was like a civil service environment.

‘It was very strict, some of the attitudes were very old
fashioned and there were different ways in which things happened at that
organisation.

‘Certainly there were avenues by which if a sexual complaint
had been made it would have been acted upon.

‘The BBC, in my experience, would not shy away from its
responsibilities in respect of where it was required to face up to the
responsibilities of taking action.’

He said comic Kenny Everett was taken off-air after making
inappropriate comments and he believed the BBC would have disciplined other
stars if complaints were made.

He said: ‘I honestly think, as an organisation, they would
have faced up if an official complaint had been made.’

Asked by Stephen Vullo, defending, if there were ‘big stars’
at the BBC who would have ‘got away with’ groping women, he said: ‘I honestly
don't think so.

Fame: The former Radio 1 presenter is currently on trial for sex offences. He denies 13 indecent assault charges and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame.

‘When you work in the environment we were working with all
those people at the time and they were very famous.

‘Some were nice, some weren't. To us they weren't that
special. They were just people. If inappropriate behaviour had been spotted I
think it would have been acted upon.’

He said in the 30 years he has known Travis he ‘never once
came across inappropriate behaviour or heard of any behaviour from Dave Lee
Travis’.

Earlier jurors had heard from John Dean, who toured as
Travis' warm-up DJ for 25 years. Mr Dean said Travis would often let female
fans sit on his knee and pose for photos.

But he insisted nothing inappropriate ever happened.

Describing Travis, he said: ‘Very friendly, he would very
often pose for photos with them with his arm around them.

‘He would sometimes sit down and do his autographs, and they
would sit on his knees and have photographs taken. But there was always a room
full of people. Always.’

Travis denies all the allegations against him. The case was
adjourned until 10am tomorrow morning.
