A photographer waited for three months in freezing temperatures to capture this dazzling display of light above the Rocky Mountains in a set of spectacular photographs.

Ricahrd Gottardo, 29, camped in the -37C mountains throughout the Winter, hoping to photograph the breathtaking Northern Lights.

He captured the natural phenomenon on April 13, just days before he was due to leave the expedition.

Mr Gottardo, from Calgary, Canada, took the pictures in Revelstoke, British Columbia and hired a snowmobile to reach the perfect vantage point.

While he waited for the Lights, which are notoriously difficult to forecast, Mr Gottardo, merged almost 4000 pictures of the sky taken from the mountain range.

Starry night: the Northern Lights illuminate the sky above Revelstoke, British Columbia. The photograph looks like a CGI construct, but was taken using long exposure techniques

Fluorescent: Northern Lights is a name for aurora, a natural light display. these shots of  the aurora borealis are a reflection of recent solar activity which has caused some amazing light shows

No need for a torch: Richard Gottardo experienced brutal Winter weather during his three-month wait. He said: 'The tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating I had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla'

Forget me not: The sky turns an unforgettable bright blue against the icy peaks of the Rocky mountain range in freezing conditions

He created a timelapse video of the 
display but revealed most people will never experience these incredible 
sights because there is too much light in cities.

The pictures of of circular star 
trails are formed by merging multiple photos taken over the course of 
several hours. The movement of the Earth means the stars appear in
 different places in each image.

He said: 'I have experimented with 
this type of photography before when I was in Toronto but you can't 
really see the stars because too much light is given off in cities.

'I went out into the mountains with 
the goal of shooting the stars over the mountains and then I just kept 
getting more ideas from there and going back for more.

'In total I spent three months over 
the winter in the freezing cold getting the pictures together - camping 
out at night with my dog both covered in sleeping bags to stay warm.'

All weather endeavour: At the end of his trip, Mr Gottardo hired a snowmobile to make sure he could get the best view possible. he waited to see the Northern Lights for three months, before they could be photographed in April

Optical illusion: Some of the spectacular pictures, which are constructed by layering images on top of each other, look like they have been painted or drawn

Snowy peaks: Mr Guttari spent his expedition in the Rock mountain range. He said he camping out at night with his dog and a sleeping bag to stay warm

Brushstroke effect: The camera's shutter stays open for longer, so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced. Mr Gottatrdo's results are stunning

'The tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating I had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla.

'But it was definitely worth it to experience such beautiful skies. To make the timelapse video I layered between 3000 and 4000 pictures together. It took some time but it's something I will never forget.'

The paths of moving sources stand out
 in this form of photography, becoming clearer than the elements around 
them. Long exposures are easiest to achieve at night-time or when the 
subject is a lot brighter than its background.

The camera's shutter stays open for longer, so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced.

Long-exposure photography is becoming
 popular for its ability to turn everyday objects into romantic 
portraits and capture sources of light in great detail.

But after almost running out of 
patience he turned his attention to creating star trails - before his 
gruelling trip incredibly ended with the bright night sky being 
spectacularly lit up with stars and the aurora clashing overhead.

Psychedelic: The moving stars and aurora create an intense portrait of a landscape. The colour scheme makes the sight all the more incredible

Spectacular sky: Some of the images are almost other-worldly in the way they brighten stars

Day and night: One of the rare daytime pictures proves long-exposure photography can be just as effective during the day, when used properly
