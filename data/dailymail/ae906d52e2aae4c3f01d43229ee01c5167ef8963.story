Anger: Israel's newly-elected chief rabbi David Lau has provoked fury after he was accused of making racist remarks about professional basketball players

Israel's newly elected chief rabbi has provoked fury after he was accused of making racist remarks about professional basketball players.

David Lau, who is one of two men who serve as spiritual authorities for Israelis - made the apparent racist remark while addressing a group of ultra-orthodox yeshiva students.

During a speech, Lau made reference to young people watching basketball on television in public rather than spending time studying the Torah.

As reported by the Huffington Post, he said: 'Why do you care whether these [k]ushim  who are paid in Tel Aviv beat the kushim who are paid in Greece?"

The word kushim is a derogatory Hebrew term for black people.

The comment angered members of the Israeli parliament with some calling for Lau to apologise.

Speaking to the Jerusalem Post, Labor party representative Nachman Shai said the comment stands in contrast to the remarks made earlier this week by Pope Francis in reference to not judging gay people. 

But despite angering many, some also leapt to Lau's defence.

Naftali Bennett, a minister of religious services and economics, told the newspaper that public figures should not be stalked by the media.  

It is believed that Lau's argument in speaking to the youngsters was supposed to highlight that by watching basketball on television in public could undermine the case for youths not being drafted into the Israeli Defense Forces.

Lau was elected last month to a 10-year term as Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi.

He canceled a planned vacation abroad after the reports about his comment.

Basketball is extremely popular in Israel and is a strong source of national pride.

Amare Stoudemire of the New York Nicks was recently invited by President Shimon Peres to play for Israel's national team.
