Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared in a video promoting ‘remarkable’ e-cigarettes after his party received £25,000 from a British manufacturer of the alternatives to tobacco, it emerged today.

In the 90-second film, smoker Mr Farage is seen puffing on a large refillable e-cigarette, declaring ‘as a smoker, frankly I haven’t yet given up but I could do very easily’.

It came just seven months after the makers of Totally Wicked e-cigarettes gave Ukip tens of thousands of pounds, but today the firm told MailOnline it wished it had made donations to other political parties instead.

Blackburn-based Pillbox38 Ltd, which makes Totally Wicked e-cigarettes, gave Ukip central party £25,000 on May 9, 2013.

Jason Cropper, the founder of Pillbox38 who stepped down in June, also donated £11,000 as an individual on July 21, 2013.

The company says it gave the money at the time because it thought Ukip was the only party making any attempt to oppose EU moves to ban refillable e-cigarettes outright. There was no connection between the donation and the video, Pillbox238 said. 

As the EU’s plans were being finalised
 in mid-December, Mr Farage appeared in the video, posted on the YouTube
 page of the EFD Group of the European Parliament.

‘Well,
 there is no end to the interference,’ he says, complaining of a meeting
 in Brussels between officials and MEPS on the subject of e-cigarettes. 

Puffing
 on a smaller e-cigarette, he tells the camera: ‘They are going allow 
these little ones, mostly made by the giant pharmaceutical lobby and by 
big tobacco.

‘But into this 
vacuum there have been a whole host of entrepreneurs producing these 
kind of things with refillables,’ he adds, before picking up a larger 
e-cigarette shaped like a cigar. ‘These things are remarkable,’ he 
declares. ‘Let me show you.’

As his face is obscured by ‘smoke’ 
vapour, Mr Farage puffs away and tells viewers: ‘I have to say, as a 
smoker, frankly I haven’t yet given up but I could do very easily.

‘And there are 1.8million people in Britain that are using these things. It is cutting down tobacco consumption massively.

‘It is spawning a whole new industry and yet these refillable, larger e-cigarettes are now due to be banned.

‘I want to see the British government stand up and say we under no circumstances will accept this. Will they? I am not so sure.’

The European Commission eventually agreed
 that to cap the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, allowing a nicotine
 level of 200mg in a 10ml refillable e-cigarette container, instead of 
banning them outright.

The 
video has raised questions about links between the £25,000 donation – 
its sixth largest of 2013 – and its policy on e-cigarettes.

Pillbox 38, which manufactures Totally Wicked refillable e-cigarettes, gave Ukip £25,000 in May last year

Keith Taylor, a Green party MEP, told the FT: ‘While Mr Farage is free to promote any product he likes, it is worth bearing in mind that this video sees him marketing a product from an industry which gave his party £25,000 last year.

‘Considering Ukip’s dismal record in 
actually turning up to the European Parliament, it’s astounding just how
 much time and effort the party has put into opposing legislation on 
e-cigarettes.’

Mr Farage also threw his weight behind e-cigarettes in a newspaper column on December 2.

Writing
 in The Independent, he said: ‘As I’m sure many people realise, I am 
quite a keen smoker. I’ve always prized myself on being rather good at 
it.

Green MEP Keith Taylor raised questions about the donation

‘But when a couple of old friends who have been smoking several packets a day for decades tell me that they haven’t touched a cigarette in a month because they’ve been using these new e-cigarette products it made even me want to try them out.

‘And I tell you what; they work much better than any of the stop-smoking products which have been on the market for years.’

Today Mr Farage defended the video: 'UKIP have supported the freedom to smoke E-cigarettes for a very long time. I have been extremely careful on the issue of donations and only accepted these because the public position of UKIP on E-cigs was already very clear.'

A Ukip spokesman added: 'Nigel has always been campaigning on this type of thing.

'The only response we’re giving is that Nigel Farage is well known for his libertarian views on such matters.'

Fraser Cropper, who took over from his brother Jason as chief executive of Pillbox38 last year, said there was no link between the donation and the video.

At the time of the donation ‘the only party who seemed to be making any noise on this issue was Ukip’, he said.

Mr Cropper told MailOnline: ‘Other parties and MEPs have done a sterling job since then. It was probably not the wisest thing to do.’

He said Conservative MEP Martin Callanan and Lib Dem Chris Davies had done more to stand up for users of e-cigarettes.

‘There are certainly MEPs of different political parties who I would have wanted to provide support to.

‘If I had £25,000 to donate today and I had to give it to a party it wouldn’t have been to Ukip.

‘It would have been to the Tories and Lib Dems, certain MEPs, in isolation, [who] have been acting independently.’

Pillbox38 has no plans to make future political donations, Mr Cropper added.
