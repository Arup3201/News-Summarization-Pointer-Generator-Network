Lynsey Horn, 22, has been charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication after she passed out on the train tracks

A 22-year-old woman in Auburn, Alabama is lucky to be alive after falling asleep on the train tracks and being hit by a speeding train.

Lynsey Horne, 22, isn't just alive, she's miraculously unharmed.

Capt. Lorenza Dorsey told AL.com that officers discovered Horne awake on the tracks near Ross and Gay streets after responding to a report saying someone had been hit by a train at 9:10 a.m. yesterday.

'She was just very fortunate,' Dorsey said. 'I have never seen anything like it.'

Dorsey speculates that Horne's small size and a train that contained just one car and two engines is what saved her from serious injury or death.

'The train went by her very quickly,' Dorsey said.

'It wasn't like it was a long freight train'

Even though Horne is physically unharmed, she faces charges for disorderly conduct and public intoxication.

The train was halted and an ambulance came to the scene and a helicopter was put on standby.

It's unknown as to why and how Horne ended up on the tracks but police say they believe she fell asleep not long before the train passed over her.

Horne was sent to a hospital to check for wounds despite having no visible injuries.

Friends describe Dorsey as, 'a great person with an amazing soul.'

One friend told the Mail Online that he didn't know why Horne was intoxicated at 9 a.m. but that 'it doesn't really seem like her.'
