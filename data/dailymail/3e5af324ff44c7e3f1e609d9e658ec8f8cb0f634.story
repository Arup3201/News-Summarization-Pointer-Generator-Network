More and more nude photos are emerging, some of which are child pornography, say attorneys for 18-year-old Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, whose nude photos leaked onto several pornography sites were taken when she was underage.

Maroney's attorneys have written letters to sites like Porn.com demanding that they remove the nude photos of the teenager, who turned 18 in December, from their website.

Maroney's lawyers confirm that the photos of Maroney were taken when she was under 18-years-old; despite the fact that she tweeted the photos of her were 'fake' yesterday.

Another attorney wrote a letter saying that Mckayla Maroney owned the copyright  to the nude photos.

A rep for Porn.com told TMZ that they removed the photos of Maroney as soon as they received the letter from her attorney.

'Shout out to my fans for defending me all day long.. even when things got weird u stood by me. and that meant the world, ' Maroney wrote on her Twitter yesterday.

Friends and fellow gymnasts have taken to their own twitter accounts to defend the privacy of Maroney.

'This scandal is not a joke and it is upsetting that an invasion of privacy results in entertainment for some,' said Aly Raisman, a fellow member of the 2012 Gold medal team.

'Please respect the fact that the photos were private and not for the whole world to see. My heart is broken for the women who were violated,' she added.

Gymnast Gabby Douglas also spoke out against the invasion of privacy saying, 'Love ya girl. #WeAreStrong #Champions.'

Leaked: Also leaked were underage photos of MTV actress Liz Lee who was only 16 in the photos posted online by an angry ex-boyfriend

Reddit's online community called The Fappening has been the main source for finding the leaked photos of celebrities since it is one of the few mainstream websites that isn't deleting links to all the photos, reports The Daily Dot.

Also displayed on Reddit are underage photos of MTV actress Liz Lee who was only 16-years-old when her leaked photos were taken by her then boyfriend.

Reddit has spoken out against the photo-sharing and says they will delete all photos of the underage celebrities.

'Effective immediately: any images/galleries/torrents/mega dumps/ etc. containing Mckayla Maroney or Liz Lee will be immediately removed due to the fact that they were underage (<18) in the photos taken,' wrote moderator SickorSane.

Reddit is also telling users to delete the underage photos from their hard drives as they are considered child pornography.

it's not exactly clear how photos of Mckayla Maroney, Liz Lee, and starlets like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton were leaked but Apple has confirmed that hackers probably used iCloud's reset security questions to break into accounts.

Since information about celebrities is easily found online, their security questions are easy to break into.

For now, Reddit has decided the let the sub-community The Fappening remain despite the fact that child pornography has been found on their site before, reports The Daily Dot.

Reddit admins say they may remove The Fappening down the line if illegal photo-sharing continues to be a problem.
