The moment that Ahmad Benali decided that English lower league football was perhaps not for him came when he was told to train on his own for two weeks for wearing a hat.

A former England youth midfielder - born and raised in the shadow of Maine Road - Benali was on loan from Manchester City at Rochdale in 2011 when he reached what he views now as a fork in the road of his career.

'I had captained all the youth teams at City and had been told I was one for the first team in the future,' Benali reflected in his broad Manchester accent.

2014-15 - Brescia - Four goals in 20 appearances

2013-14 - Brescia - Four goals in 34 appearances

2012-13 - Brescia - 10 appearances

2011-12 - Rochdale - 2 apperances

'I went on loan to Rochdale but wasn't in the team. They were just lumping it up to the strikers and that wasn't my style so I was on the bench.

'I turned up for a game one Saturday and was wearing a woolly hat - it was cold - and that was it.

'I was hammered by the manager and spent the next two weeks training on my own. I decided then that I had to do something else.'

For Benali - who had been at City since he was eight - the choices were stark.

A change of ownership at his boyhood club had eventually led to a change of manager and words of encouragement from Mark Hughes were not followed up by his successor Roberto Mancini. In the summer of 2012 - at the age of just 20 - Benali left Manchester to join Brescia in Italy's Serie A.

'It was obvious that when City got all the money things would change and they did,' he reflected.

'I used to train with the first team at that time and I saw a future there if I proved myself good enough.

'I had been given a pro contract by Sven Goran Eriksson and I saw other young English players like Joey Barton and Michael Johnson breaking through a few years ahead of me.

'All I wanted to do was play for them and I really thought I would one day.

'But after the club changed hands doors began to close for people like me. I saw the big foreign players like Robinho being bought at the top level and I knew it was over.

'I could have gone in to the lower leagues but the Rochdale experience scarred me.

'At clubs at that level the coaches talk about nice tactics and systems in pre-season but as soon as they lose a few games they panic and just start whacking it up the pitch.

'In England, you get thrown in like that and it can ruin you if you are a smaller, skilful player.

'I have seen too many good young, technical players get lost in the English league system. They go down the leagues and never come back. They disappear.

'It was depressing and I didn't want that to happen to me. When I got the chance to move to Italy I took it with both hands.

'It was scary as I was so young. But I thought it may save my career and it did.'

Two-and-a-half seasons on, Benali is a Libyan international and vice-captain of his Italian club. A regular in his Brescia's midfield, he returned to Manchester for his winter break recently to reflect on his time at a club that has now been hit by financial troubles.

The day we met, in a cafe in the suburb of Didsbury, Benali was due to fly back to Italy to resume his season. 

That morning he had been paid for the first time in three months and he has decided to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season.

There is an offer from Inter Milan - ironically coached by Mancini - but Benali knows the intention would be to loan him out.

'I have learned so much in Italy and have become a much better player,' he recalled.

'I would come back to England to play now if I got the right club. It's my home, after all. But I have an open mind as to where I go next.

'It was a real eye opener when I went there two and half years ago. I didn't speak Italian and had to learn quickly. And the training there is so different from England.

'It's all tactics and eleven v eleven games.

'I have become a tactical robot. I know every system on the planet now!

'The Italian players can't believe the days off the English get. They don't want time off. They want to learn. They develop you.

'I arrived as a nobody and I am a senior player now. I would never have believed that.

'I have a wife and two children and I am proud of all that.'

Benali is not bitter that he didn't make it at City. Other City graduates of similar age - such as Burnley duo Ben Mee and Kieran Trippier - have gone on to play in the Premier League and that only serves to encourage him.

He is rightly proud of the rather different road he has travelled and laughs when told about the new facilities his old club have at their new £200million academy.

'It wasn't quite like that at the old Platt Lane but I loved it there,' he said. 'I wouldn't change it.'
