Bob Geldof has said he blames himself for the death of his daughter Peaches from a heroin overdose earlier this year.

The Boomtown Rats singer said he ‘goes over and over and over’ what he could have done to help the 25-year-old mother of two who had started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death.

Peaches was found dead by her husband Tom Cohen at their home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7, and Geldof admitted he knew she was battling heroin addiction before her overdose.

He said: ‘You blame yourself. You’re the father who is responsible and clearly failed'.

Geldof said:‘For anybody watching, who has a dead kid and you’re a parent. You go back, you go back, you go back, you go back, you go back, you go over, you go over. What could you have done? You do as much as you can.

Asked if he knew about Peaches’ drug addiction, he said: ‘Yes, of course I knew about it and we did more than talk about it, yeah. But I don't want to go into that too much. 

'She was an adult. When they are 18 they are off and running. But you advise, you are there - the usual dad stuff. When they mess up you try to clean up the mess. You admonish. I'm certainly not benign about the whole thing'. 

‘I was never afraid to cry so I did. It is a ten minute thing and then on you go', he told BBC 5Live.

He said newspaper attacks on his daughters following their mother Paula Yates’s death from a drug overdose in 2000 had also ‘damaged’ them.

'She was super bright. Too bright', he said.

‘She could never be still so you look for something that sedates you I suppose. 

‘A very errant mind that could focus intensely on a book which she would consume and just absorb it.

‘But the rest was a franticness. She knew what life was supposed to be and God bless her she tried very hard to get there. And she didn’t make it.’

Geldof said performing with the Boomtown Rats helps him to escape the grief of losing his daughter.

‘I put on my snakeskin suit and I can be this other thing,’ he said. ‘It is utterly cathartic. Those two hours and I am drained. In every sense it empties, it drains my mind. On stage I’m lost in this thing and it’s a very brief respite.’

An inquest in July heard that Peaches had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two and a half years.

Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead.

At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was ‘sudden’ and ‘unexplained’. But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet. He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple’s two-year-old son, Astala. Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother.

Police found heroin and syringes in the house. A forensic scientist said the drug had a purity of 61 per cent – much higher than the average drug sold on the street.

A pathologist told the inquest that Peaches’ blood contained a high level of heroin, along with traces of codeine, methadone and morphine. There were puncture marks on her arms and legs. 

Geldof told 5Live: 'My life turned out to be extremely episodic.

‘I certainly do not want the two little chaps caught up in our story and I supposed because of Paula, because of the girls, because of me, we have been in the British people’s face for 40 years, much to their irritation, I think a lot of the time, but I have to say they have been very kind.’
