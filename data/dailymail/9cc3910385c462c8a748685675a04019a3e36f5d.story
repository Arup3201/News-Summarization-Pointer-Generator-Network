An Ohio college student has been killed by a falling tree after taking a walk in a park to 'clear her head' during strong winds.

Rachel Schmidt, 21, decided to go for a stroll in Massillon Park in suburban Canton, Ohio, following a day of intense studying.

But as she walked down a path, a large tree - standing at 80-foot tall and measuring six feet in circumference - fell onto her.

The student, who attended Kent State University's Stark County campus, was taken to hospital with serious injuries to her head and body following the accident at around 4pm on Sunday

But despite medics' best efforts, she died at Affinity Medical Center an hour later, Harry Campbell, chief investigator for Stark County Coroner's Office, told the Independent in Massillion. 

Miss Schmidt, a third-year communications major, also sustained internal injuries from the impact, said Stark County Coroner Dr. P.S. Murthy, who performed an autopsy yesterday. 

According to the National Weather Service, wind speeds at the time of the freak accident were around 20 to 22mph, with gusts as strong as 35mph.

Massillon Safety-Service Director Al Hennon said emergency crews, who were called to the scene by a passerby, described the wind as blowing 'pretty good' when the tree fell over. 

He added that the tree had completely covered the path on which Miss Schmidt was walking, with some of it even landing in a creek. 

Massillion police officers worked throughout the night to identify the student, who lived in Perry Township, and inform her relatives of her death.

Today, Miss Schmidt's grandfather, Wayne Hannum, paid tribute to his hard-working granddaughter, who he said dreamed of becoming a social worker.

He said she often went for walks, including trips to South Sippo Park and McKinley Monument in Canton, to 'clear her head' after studying and doing homework.

He added that Miss Schmidt's death was 'just starting to seem real'.
