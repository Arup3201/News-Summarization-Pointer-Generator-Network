This little critter's certainly got to work hard for his dinner.

Eita, a three-year-old red panda from the Maruyama Zoo in Sapporo, Japan, was filmed as he determinedly licked apple slices from the glass walls of his enclosure.

By using his sharp claws and teeth he eventually pries the fruit off and munches it up.

Footage shows him repeating the same action over and over as he spots another slice of apple stuck before him.

One piece proves particularly difficult to ease free but Eita finally manages to paw it away.

He is then seen standing with the apple in-between his paws, gently nibbling it up.Â 

The apples sure seem to taste good after all that effort! Along with fruit, red pandas are partial to acorns, roots, and eggs.
