Privacy and civil liberties campaigner: Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis

The extent to which mobile phones act as ‘spies in our pockets’ has been exposed  by a senior Tory MP.

Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis discovered how closely we can be watched when he asked his phone provider for the information it held on him – and found it could track his every move.

Mr Davis investigated after American whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the security services were forcing phone companies to hand over  data on their customers.

The campaigning MP, who writes about his discoveries in today’s Mail on Sunday, says the list of times and  co-ordinates – known as metadata – showed ‘where  I had been at any one time for a year’.

It was so detailed that Mr Davis was able to plot out his movements over a day.

The one he chose was during last year’s party conference in Manchester, and the data mapped his meetings with members of the public, journalists and parliamentary colleagues.

‘I could see exactly where  I had been at pretty much every point of the day,’ writes Mr Davis.

‘So in conjunction with those people’s phone records, the data would show everybody I met that day.’

Mr Davis has been an opponent of efforts by Home Secretary Theresa May to introduce a ‘snooper’s charter’ extending the State’s power  to monitor communications.

Sinister: Mr Davis found that metadata collected by phone firms tracked his exact location and movements

He added: ‘The State rarely asks for information which isn’t of use to it. With this metadata they can learn as much about me as they can by reading my emails or eavesdropping on my calls.

‘Since the Snowden revelations, we know that  our security services have engaged in legally dubious monitoring of our metadata.

‘We know that they, along with many Ministers, want the legal power to do this on an even bigger scale.

‘This has serious implications for our privacy.’
