This has to be one of the wackiest ascents of Africa's highest peak ever.

Briton Paul Goldstein, 49, is climbing Mount Kilimanjaro for charity with a nine foot toy tiger which weighs 30lbs on his back.

And having agreed to take on two marathons in a week, this was not exactly what people were thinking when the 49-year-old, from Wimbledon, said he needed to paws for thought.

Paul has already completed the 
Brighton marathon on Sunday with the weighty passenger on his back, in an impressive six hours, and are now 
ascending Africa’s fearsome peak.

They then hope to take on the London marathon on Sunday, two days after scaling Kilimanjaro's 5,895m (19,341ft) summit.

Paul, a wildlife photographer and tour guide, stopped long enough to pose for a few pictures as he boarded a Kenya Airways flight from London Heathrow to Nairobiout on Monday - while having only just got his breath back after finishing the Brighton Marathon the previous evening.

Then the pair surveyed the impressive peak that awaited them.

This morning, when Paul last made contact, he was at around 4,260m (13,976ft).

He said: ‘Rain now turning to snow, this just a whole lot harder.’

Paul, who was supported at the East 
Sussex event by his children Joshua, five and 18-month-old Lucas, said of his first marathon: 
‘There was a fairly strong wind which added to the challenge of running 
with a nine foot tiger on my back.

‘At around three o'clock yesterday the
tiger's roar had been reduced to a whimper. But six hours, a personal 
best, God knows where that came from.’

Paul has embarked on the week-long 
challenge to support a charity project to protect the Bengal tiger.

He 
is hoping to raise more than £25,000 for the Friends of Conservation 
charity project in Bandhavgarh National Park, India.
