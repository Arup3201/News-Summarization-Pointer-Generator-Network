An Australian farmer has dramatically pitched a tent in front of a coal train to protest against the expansion of the mining industry.

Annette Schneider lay on a mattress over the tracks near Mangrove Road in Sandgate, north of Sydney, near Newcastle.

The 54-year-old farmer, from Monaro in southern New South Wales, started her protest at 7am on Monday, but was taken into police custody about 10.30am.

Annette Schneider, 45, spent three hours of Monday morning locked to a railway track near Newcastle

She had cut holes in the mattress to slot her arms through and locked them into a pipe running along the railway line.

A group of 20 to 30 people were also on-site to support Ms Schneider. 

A spokeswoman for environmental group Front Line Action on Coal told Daily Mail Australia Ms Schneider wanted to make a statement about the expansion of the coal mining industry and the effects of climate change.

In particular, the 54-year-old is worried about their impacts on farm land.

Ms Schneider was trying to make 'a statement' to the government to ask them to consider issues surrounding the expansion of coal mines and climate change

'She wanted to do this because she was frustrated with the government,' Front Line Action on Coal's Alex Walker said.

'The government is not listening to scientists. We’re not following the world and not listening to the world. We're kind of behind the times in Australia. 

'[Ms Schneider's] passionate about climate change and she wanted to make a statement.'

A new report done by the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) estimates the annual costs of health-related issues caused by the five coal fired power station in the Hunter Valley costs $600 million.

'The coal industry is continuously dragging us down... and there are consequences and we need to do something about it before it's too late,' Ms Walker told Daily Mail Australia.

Police came to arrest Ms Schneider three hours after she started her protest on Monday morning

The group claims surrounding mines are causing severe health problems in the areas as well as impacting on farming lands

'In local communities, there has been an increase in severe health risks from breathing in coal dust.

'There's been a rise in asthma-related instances in children. People aren't sleeping as well as shortness of breath.

'Just the general implications you would get from breathing in dirty air, especially if it leeches into the water too.'

A New South Wales Health Report from 2010 reported the Hunter regions most affected by open-cut coal mining and coal-fired power generation have higher rates of asthma and respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease compared with the rest of the state, according to the CAHA report.
