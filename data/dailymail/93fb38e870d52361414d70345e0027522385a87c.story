An Australian entrepreneur is revolutionising the cost of private education for parents by offering last-minute discounts for their child's education.

In a world-first, 25-year-old Jeremy Wein has partnered with a number of Australia's leading independent schools to offer parents between 10 and 40 per cent off the price of their child's enrollment via School Places.

The idea, similar to travel website Wotif.com, came to Wein who wanted to apply the ease of the travel website to the complexity and expense of private school placements.

CEO Natalie Mactier said independent schools are inflating fees to cover their running costs

The website launched on Tuesday and nearly 500 people from NSW have already registered their son or daughter for a spot.

The aim is to give parents flexibility and choice while helping them overcome the inflating costs of private education. It also eliminates the need to cue a child for a competitive private school placement from as early as birth.

'The high cost of running schools is growing faster than family incomes,' School Places CEO Natalie Mactier said.

'The kinds of fee increases we’ve seen in recent years just aren’t sustainable.'

NSW and Victorian schools which have registered pay a commission to the site when a vacancy becomes available 'similar to what a travel agent might charge you for booking a holiday,' Ms Mactier said.

It allows parents to enroll their student at the last-minute without having to 'lock them in' to the private education system at an early age.

'While many parents prefer to lock in their options well ahead of time, School Places caters to those who prefer to keep their options open or who need to find a new school in a hurry.'

Among the schools with quoted reductions are Macquarie Grammar in Sydney's CBD, Masada College in in Sydney's north and several other Victorian colleges.

Parents can 'claim' a vacancy for their year 11 child at Macquarie Grammar School in 2015 for an annual fee of $17,000 - a reduction of 15 per cent on the full fee.

The same institution also offers a reduction of 15 per cent on year 7 entrants - the hardest year group to find a place - at a cost of $15,300.

If the same year 7 student was to enroll for the rest of the 2014 year now, it would cost a parent $10,800.

At Masada College in the city's north School Places has 30 per cent reductions on a year 11 spot, however its prices are not quoted.

In some cases parents can make savings of up to $8,000 off a child's yearly fee.

Other schools in the system are Scots Bathurst in NSW, and The New Generation College and Plenty Valley Christian College in Victoria.
