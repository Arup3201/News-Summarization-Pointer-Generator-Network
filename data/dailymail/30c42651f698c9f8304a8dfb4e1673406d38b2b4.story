A church has had its application to retune its 282-year-old bells turned down because the 'old-sounding ring' should be preserved.

St Michael's Church, in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire, had applied to have its bells, which have not been rung for 30 years, retuned as part of a wholescale refurbishment.

The six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years, but in a rare ruling Mark Ockleton, deputy chancellor of Hereford and a judge of the Church's Consistory Court, decreed that they must not be fixed.

The ancient bells were installed at the church in 1732 and have chimed the same notes since.

However, Hereford's Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC), which oversees around 400 churches, recommended they should be re-tuned to make their peel more melodious.

The church agreed that now was a good time to do so, as the bells has to be temporarily removed while the building was refurbished. 

But Deputy Chancellor Ockleton refused permission on the basis that sounds of the past - melodious or otherwise - should be preserved for posterity as they were.

Rules on British churches dictate that all major work has to go through a DAC, who check over the plans before passing on the final decision to a Chancellor.

Chancellors, who are often former High Court judges, then make the call on whether the plans are in the interest of the Church.

Turning down the call for re-tuning, Deputy Chancellor Ockleton said he found it 'a little troubling' that the DAC had called for the tune-up 'on the basis that if an old thing can be 'improved' by being modernized, it should be'.

He continued: 'Tuning bells is irreversible. We do not have many sounds preserved from before the days of sound recordings and those that survive are a valuable part of our heritage.'

He added: 'Irreversible tuning of a complete old ring is a serious matter, not merely to be accepted 'on the nod.' 

The six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years, but it was decreed that they must not be fixed (file picture)

He said that the ring of the bells at St Michael's Church appeared to be untouched, save for the effect of a crack on one bell which is to be repaired by welding and which will then sound more or less the same again.

'If the bells are then restored for ringing the sound they make will be the same as when they were installed in 1732. That is something to be valued and to be proud of,' he said.

He said that he would not rule out re-tuning if the bells were so bad that 'the mission of the Church was affected', if they 'let the church down in some way' or if bell-ringers were reluctant to ring them.

But he continued: 'There is no suggestion of that here. Indeed it is not apparent whether the parish even realise that they have an early-eighteenth century sound that they propose to destroy.

'The mere fact that the bells are not listed for preservation is not a reason for not preserving their sound where the work is not shown to be necessary.' 

Grandmother Lynne Lloyd, 65, who lives and works on a farm near the church with her husband Royston, 67, said she was looking forward to hearing the bells when they are put to use, as they have not been rung for 30 years.

'I quite like the sound of the bells, so they won't bother me even if they are a little out of tune.

'My in-laws are buried in the churchyard so we have a strong connection. We got to the harvest festival and at Christmas.'
