Many young people write letters to Santa, but this one is different. 

A seven-year-old western Sydney girl asked Santa not to deliver any presents this year because she wants to give her gifts to homeless people instead. 

Mum Belinda and dad Greg are 'very proud' of their daughter, Madison Priest, from Casula, after she took a stand for those less fortunate.

Taking a stand: A seven-year-old girl wrote her letter to 'Santa Claws and Mrs Claws' in pink pen

'Dear Santa,' wrote Madison, who is going into Year 2 next year. 'I don't want any presents this year because I want to give all my presents to the homeless people.'

She told Santa about a canned food drive she inspired at Casula Public School for OzHarvest, a food collection company, in early December, before her letter continued.

'My family and me are going to go down to the city one Sunday and give a homeless (person's pet) dog food and a lady that lives in the city we will give her some food as well,' she wrote in pink pen.

'Thank you Santa Claws and Mrs Claws, love from Madison'. 

Belinda Priest said her daughter's passion for helping homeless people was sparked after she overheard her father, Greg, talking about the issue. 

'She felt sorry for them, that they had no food or shelter,' Mrs Priest said. 

'Dear Santa, I don't want any presents this year because I want to give all my presents to the homeless people.

OzHarvest came to my school in a yellow big truck and took the cans of food people donated and gave them to the homeless people.

My family and me are going to go down to the city one Sunday and give a homeless (person's pet) dog food and a lady that lives in the city we will give her some food as well. Thank you Santa Claws and Mrs Claws

Love from Madison

Her parents describe Madison as a straight A student. She is a prolific writer, having also sent a letter to a cancer-stricken teacher at her school after learning of her illness. 

'She just has that empathy,' Mrs Priest said. 

Despite her stand, tomorrow there will certainly be something under the tree for Madison, who is certainly on Santa's 'nice' list.  

'That was a bit of a controversy,' Mrs Priest said. 'We actually finally convinced her that a couple of presents from Santa would be OK.

'She was like, "no, I don't want any.'

The Priest family are planning to give food to the homeless early next year. Madison is planning to buy a homeless person's dog some food with money from the tooth fairy.
