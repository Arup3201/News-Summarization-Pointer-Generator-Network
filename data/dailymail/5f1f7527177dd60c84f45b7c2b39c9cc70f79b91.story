Andy Murray has ended the most barren spell of his professional career by reaching his first final since winning Wimbledon 15 months ago.

Murray came from a set down to beat Juan Monaco 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 in the Shenzhen Open in China to set up a showdown Sunday morning with Tommy Robredo.

‘He was dominating the match,’ said Murray, who has never endured such a lengthy period without reaching a final from the moment he won the first of his 28 titles in 2006.

‘I found it very tough in the sun — it’s extremely hot and humid and I’m not used to that where I come from.’

The 27-year-old Scot’s return to form in China also boosts his prospects of qualifying for November’s season-ending World Tour Finals in London.

Murray’s place at the O2 Arena is in serious doubt. Only the top eight in the world qualify and he has nosedived to 11th in the rankings during a disappointing year.

Rafael Nadal, whose place at the O2 had also been in doubt because of a wrist injury, makes a return to action this week at the China Open.

Nadal has not played since a shock fourth-round defeat by Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon.

The world No3 injured his wrist while practising on his home island of Mallorca in late July and was forced to drop out of the US Open, where he was the defending champion.

‘I cannot say I’m 100 per cent because I still feel something when I start for the first five minutes of the practice,’ said Nadal. ‘But in general the injury is not limiting me to compete.’

Nadal has a tough opening game against France’s Richard Gasquet, while Murray, seeded six in Beijing, takes on Poland’s Jerzy Janowicz in the first round.

Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova backed up her lopsided win over Eugenie Bouchard at Wimbledon with another emphatic victory over the Canadian to capture the inaugural Wuhan Open.

Kvitova, who dropped just three games thrashing Bouchard at the Wimbledon final, was made to work harder this time before winning 6-3, 6-4.

Bouchard’s cause was not helped by an injury when she jammed her finger with her racket on a follow-through. ‘I have hit a million forehands in my life and I still can’t hit one without hitting myself,’ she said.
