It was a bad year for Sheldon Adelson.

Earlier this month Businessweek revealed that the owner of some of the largest casinos in the world was the target of Iranian hackers, who brought down servers at the Las Vegas Sands Casino.

The cyber assault, in retaliation for comments from Adelson, 81, about threatening to nuke Iran, was followed by another embarrassment - seeing his personal fortune drop by $8.9billion in 2014.

Losses: Sheldon Adelson, 81, dropped to 23rd wealthiest person in the world in 2014 after suffering a $8.9billion drop in his personal fortune

Bloomberg Billionaires, which indexes the fortunes of the wealthiest individuals in the world, showed Adelson was joined by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, 50, who lost $7.5billion, and IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, 88, who fell $8.4billion, in racking up the highest losses in 2014.

Bezos, who owns 84 million shares in Amazon, suffered by owning an 18 percent stake in a company that is struggling to make gains even as sales expand.

The online retailer dropped serious coin in 2014, the New York Post reports, buying up gaming site Twitch and expanding company warehouse locations.

The company also gained 10 million Prime members able to enjoy free two-day shipping, a costly expense for Amazon, who started gifting Prime customers $1 every time they decided to forgo rush shipping, Huffington Post reported in June.

On the other end of the spectrum, Bezos's counterpart in China made a killing in 2014, shoring up his fortune by $25.2billion.

Jack Ma, 50, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, began the year with a lowly $3.6billion before multiplying his fortune thanks to a successful September IPO and shot up to number 21 in the world, just one step above Bezos.

Drop: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, 50, lost $7.5billion in a year where the online retail giant acquired a number of new operations, causing profit forecasts to flag

Winner winner: Microsoft founder Bill Gates, 59, added an impressive $9.1billion onto his existing fortune, causing him to jump back to the top of the list over Mexico telecom billionaire Carlos Slim

At the very top of the chain, there was a re-establishment of the old order, as Bill Gates rose to reclaim the number one spot earlier in 2014.

He had been briefly overtaken by 74-year-old telecom billionaire Carlos Slim in 2007, according to Fortune, before losing the spot for several years starting in 2010.

The two have duked it out at the top for years, but the Microsoft founder and philanthropist added $9.1billion while Slim lost $786.8million, causing him to fall into third behind 84-year-old Warren Buffet.
