A Health Service hospital has been forced to cancel dozens of operations after a rat was found in its operating theatre.

Pest controllers were called and a deep clean was ordered after the rodent was spotted scurrying in the room last Tuesday night.

The operating theatre at King’s Mill Hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was not in use at the time, but more than 40 scheduled operations had to be cancelled for fears the rodent may have spread potentially fatal diseases.

The rodent, which can spread salmonella and carry potentially fatal Weil's disease, was spotted at Mansfield's King's Mill Hospital, causing several operations to be cancelled

Rats can carry salmonella and the deadly Weil’s disease, also known as mud fever, which is spread by contact with infected urine and is thought to kill two or three people a year in Britain.

The embarrassing incident will alarm patients, but hospital bosses insisted there was no longer any cause for concern, although the fate of the rat is unknown.

Karen Tomlinson, director of operations, said she was shocked but said it was a ‘minor, one-off incident’.

‘As soon as we became aware the following morning, we immediately took steps to thoroughly clean and sterilise the entire theatre area and called in external pest control experts to completely eradicate the problem,’ she added.

‘We have apologised to any patients affected for the inconvenience caused.

Earlier this year it was reported that a hospital patient was bitten by a rat more than a dozen times as he lay sedated

‘We took immediate and comprehensive action to rectify matters and to restore services with the minimum of disruption. We are fully operational again.’

No other rats are believed to have been found on the premises.

It is not the first time pests have caused chaos in British hospitals this year.

A recent investigation found that hospital kitchens are failing to meet basic standards of cleanliness, with infestations of mice, rats and cockroaches reported across the country.

At Lewisham Hospital in South-East London, environmental officers found ‘widespread mouse activity’ and an infestation of cockroaches, while at Wolverhampton’s West Park Hospital a dead rat was found in a cupboard close to where food was being prepared.

In total, health officers found 541 out of 731 hospital kitchens were dirty and flouting hygiene rules.

This year a patient was reportedly bitten more than a dozen times on his back and neck by a rat at a hospital.

The family of Jason Ketley, 42, claimed he was savaged by the rat at a specialist care unit in Surrey, with staff spotting him stumbling around a corridor with the rodent hanging from his neck by its teeth. Nurses eventually knocked it off and killed it.

The most serious concern about rats infesting hospitals is the potential threat of Weil’s disease, which is caught through contact with infected rat urine.

Also known as leptospirosis, it is thought to have caused the death two years ago of British double Olympic gold-medal winning rower Andy Holmes after he fell into the water during a 26-mile sculling marathon in Boston, Lincolnshire.

The latest incident at King’s Mill is another embarrassment for the hospital, which is struggling with debts. Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs it, lost almost £6million in the first quarter of 2012.

Last month it emerged that about 120 breast cancer patients had been given false negative results  by the hospital, leading to many not receiving the treatment they needed.
