They were described as the ‘homes of the future’, with an eco-friendly design that would keep bills low.

The 45 super-insulated houses, built with £5.6million of public money, were even held up as a ‘model’ of environmentally-friendly construction.

But 18 months after the social housing complex in Bradford was completed, residents have complained of bills that are double what is normal and faulty equipment that was supposed to save them money.

Home sweet home: Residents moved into the Pavilion Gardens complex in Bradford with the promise they would get cheaper bills in their eco-friendly houses

'Super-insulated': The houses are either heated by biomass boilers or air heat pumps and are equipped with solar panels to provide electricity

Council bosses admit there is a 
‘serious problem’ with energy use at the Pavilion Gardens site and 
promised to reimburse residents for excessive bills, blaming the 
original builder.

Resident Danny Hall, 27, a redundant 
sales adviser, his wife Jacqueline, 28, and their three children have 
had problems ‘from day one’.

Rising costs: Danny Hall, pictured, who shares a three bedroom house on the complex with his wife and three children, says he received a £1,600 electricity bill for six months

‘The houses were supposedly the most 
energy efficient in Bradford,’ he said.

‘We weren’t really told what 
expected bills would be but with solar panels, heat exhaust and all this
 fancy stuff you would expect it to be considerably lower than what we 
used to pay.’

Instead the family received a £1,600 bill after six months.

Energy bills were almost double what they paid at their previous home, he said.

When the family moved in, there was no water in the toilets because the water recycling system had not been activated.

When it was turned on, water ‘poured through the light fittings’.

The homes are equipped with an 
eco-heat exhaust pump that recycles warm air, solar panels, and 
rainwater-harvesting systems to cut water bills.

Twelve of the homes, 
supposedly built to the highest standards for sustainability, are heated
 by a communal biomass boiler.

Sunny Tanday, 23, a tenant who lives 
with wife Raquel, 23, and their two young children, said it was proving 
an expensive disaster.

He said: ‘We thought it was going to 
be our dream house.

'They are lovely houses on a nice street, but they 
are not what we expected them to be in terms of power-saving and being 
cheap to run.

‘We moved in here to be a family, but 
it’s just tearing us apart because the big bills are making us argue all
 the time. There are people in the street who already want to move out 
because it’s just too expensive.’

The eco-housing complex is located in West Bowling, Bradford, West Yorkshire

Costly: An electricity bill from E-on shows an outstanding balance of £894.19 for one property

Mr Tanday said his electricity bills averaged £500 a quarter since December 2011.

The highest was £949 and he has had to borrow to cover the charges.

A spokesman for Bradford Council said:
 ‘We appreciate that it is a serious problem and we are working with 
residents, the building contractor, the energy company and our managing 
agents to find a solution.’

New development: Solar Panels can be seen on the roofs of the houses in the complex which was only completed in July 2011 at a cost of £5.6million

'Dream homes': Many residents say they cannot afford to live in the properties because of the costly bills

Investigation: The council has pledged to reimburse residents who have seen their bills soar while investigators get to the source of the problem
