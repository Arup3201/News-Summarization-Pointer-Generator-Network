A comic book fan has become the proud owner of a full-sized, working replica of the Batmobile, but will have to wait a few years before he can use it to catch criminals as he is only six years old.

Alfie Wilde is the envy of the school after his grandfather converted an old Daihatsu into the iconic superhero car.

Alan Dennett, 63, spent more than £5,000 so that his grandchild could dress up and act out his favourite fight scenes from the Caped Crusader comics.

Alfie even has his own Batcave - his grandfather’s garage in Rhyl, North Wales - and he travels from his family home near Manchester most weekend’s to get behind the wheel of his Batmobile.

Mr Dennett, a retired mechanic, converted the old Daihatsu after the car failed its MOT, modelling it on the old fashioned Lincoln Futura driven by Adam West in the 1960s TV series.

He cut off the roof, adding a red trim, wings, an elaborate exhaust and a custom windscreen, as well as flashing lights, a red Batphone and Batman's iconic logo stuck on the steering wheel.

Mr Dennett said: ‘When we gave the car to him he was absolutely amazed.

‘He couldn't believe his eyes, he was so excited, it was worth all the effort just to see the look on his face.'

Dark squire: Despite being eleven years away from a licence, Alfie is the proud owner of a car, and his grandfather believes he will be able to take it on the road in the future

‘He loves Batman but he tells me that I'm his real hero now. He comes down whenever he can he loves playing games in the car.

‘He
sits in the drive pretending to be batman, singing the theme song and 
acting out fight scenes, shouting ‘Kapow, smash, biff, boff’.

‘It's a big toy for him, something that he will remember all his life.’

Although not allowed on the road lacking an MOT, Alan believes with a few minor 
modifications the Batmobile will be road worthy.

Thankfully, Alan has plenty of time to make the changes as it will be another 11 years before Alfie is eligible to apply for a driving licence.

In the meantime, Alfie, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, and the Batmobile will be forced to remain on the drive, but this does not seem to damped the mood of the six-year-old.

Alfie said: ‘It's great, I love it. I have been into Batman since I was two.

‘It is brilliant, I really enjoyed getting in it. I like Batman because he is a hero.’

His proud grandfather added: ‘He first got into Batman by watching the original TV series, he started watching it when he got home from school.

‘That's the one he loves, he isn't really a fan of the Dark Knight Rises.’
