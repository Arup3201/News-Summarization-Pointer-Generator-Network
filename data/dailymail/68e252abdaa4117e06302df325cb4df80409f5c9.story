Nico Rosberg has vowed to avoid a repeat of the pain of Formula One world championship defeat to Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton this season.

A wheel has yet to turn in anger in the new season but the expectation already is that Mercedes will continue to dominate.

It means the fight for the drivers' crown is likely to be a further showdown between reigning champion Hamilton and his team-mate Rosberg.

Nico Rosberg is determined to gain revenge on his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton and win the Formula One drivers' championship in the 2015 season, which gets underway in Melbourne this weekend

Rosberg and Hamilton will once again have the strongest car on the grid this season

Last year Hamilton reeled in Rosberg's early advantage with a run of six victories in the final seven races to clinch his second title.

Rosberg, though, is determined to gain revenge as the 29-year-old German said: 'I have focused on pushing myself even harder for the rematch with Lewis.

'In the end, it comes down to who can put the best season together overall, and I have to make sure it's the other way around this time.

'Having said that, my team-mate is one of many strong competitors I have to beat if I want to be world champion, so I'm just focused on being the absolute best I can be.

'I now know the feeling of winning races and I intend to do a lot more of that, but I also know the feeling of not winning in the end and I don't intend to repeat that experience.

'It's a huge motivation for me and gives me even more determination for 2015.'

Hamilton is equally fired up to write his name into F1 folklore and join a rare breed of three-times champions.

'There are many good drivers out there and all of them want to win - you just have to want it more than they do,' said Hamilton.

'I feel fresh, I feel fit, I feel relaxed, I feel positive...I feel ready.

'As a driver you get stronger with every season, so I plan to be better than last year.'
