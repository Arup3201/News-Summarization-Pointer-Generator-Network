Gaming has long been seen as the preserve of boys staring intently at glowing screens, while their girlfriends, arms crossed, look on disapprovingly.

But this old stereotype is beginning to change, with new figures showing that there are now more women than men involved in gaming.

The trend has been driven by 25 to 44-year-old women downloading free puzzle and trivia game apps on smartphones, a recent report claims.

More women are now gaming than men, according to a new study. The trend has been driven by 25-44 year old women downloading free puzzle and trivia game apps on smartphones, a recent report claims

The research, undertaken by the Internet Advertising Bureau UK (IAB), revealed that women account for more than half of people who have played some form of video game in the last six months.

Overall, the gamer audience in the UK has now hit 33.5 million, which accounts for 69 per cent of the population, it said.

From that pool, more people over 44 years old playing games than children and teenagers. The over 44s make up 27 per cent of the gamer population and children and teenagers make up 22.

Meanwhile, a third of 65 to 74-year-olds have played a video game in the last six months.

Six in ten games used in the last six months were free and apps are now the most popular video game format played by 55 per cent of the online population.

One third of respondents said trivia and puzzles were their favourite game genre. Action, adventure and shooter games are the next favourite, cited by 18 per cent of all respondents, rising to 45 per cent of 16 to 24 year old males and 26 per cent of men 25 to 44

As a result, smartphones are now the most popular device for playing games, cited by 54 per cent of people who took the survey.

'The internet and mobile devices have changed the gaming landscape forever,' says Steve Chester, Director of Data and Industry Programmes at the Internet Advertising Bureau.

Separate research by social media network Pixwoo.com found that the average gamer, who will spend up to 12 hours a week glued to their console, is actually 35-years-old and married, and earns £23,000 a year.

But researchers found that the hobby isn't always good news for relationships, with the average gamer rowing with their partner twice a week over their pastime.

More than one in twenty of those in relationships say it is a constant source of their rows while 15 per cent have broken up with someone because of it.

Around three quarters even admitted they don't think they will ever grow out of their love for computer games.

'They've brought down the barriers to entry, making gaming far more accessible and opened it up to a whole new audience.

'In the past you needed to go out and buy an expensive console and the discs on top to get a decent experience, now you can just download a free app.'

The average gamer aged also spends around 11 hours gaming a week, compared to 20 hours for 8-15 year olds.

The survey spoke to 4,058 people in the UK aged 8-74 in June of this year.
