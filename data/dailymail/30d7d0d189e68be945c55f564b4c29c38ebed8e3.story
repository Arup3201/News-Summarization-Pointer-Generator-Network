Thailand's holiday islands will be made a 'gun free zone' within a year following the killing of British tourist Stephen Ashton.

The 22-year-old was shot dead at a New Year's Eve beach party on the island of Koh Phangan.

The move comes as the Foreign Office updated its travel advice to Brits visiting Thailand warning them that Westerners can be subject to 'vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs' on the party island.

Governor Chatpong Chataraputi said gun 
licenses will no longer be issued or renewed as part of raft of tighter 
security measures aimed at restoring confidence.

Authorities said they will also carry out more searches on people arriving on the island and confiscate any weapons found.

The measures will be taken in Koh Samui, and Koh Phangan - known as the Samui archipelago - and other tourist spots said the Governor of Surat Thani Province.

But the move is being viewed by many as a knee-jerk reaction to the negative publicity surrounding the death of Stephen Ashton which will have little effect.

New travel advice for Thailand on the Foreign Office website says: 'Seven British nationals have been murdered in Thailand since January 2009.

'Western tourists have been victims of vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs in Koh Phangan. These attacks are particularly common around the time of the Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars in Haad Rin on Koh Phangan.

'On 1 January 2013 a British national was killed in a shooting incident while at a beach party in Haad Rin. Exercise caution when in this area at any time, especially after dark.'

Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, has been charged with killing Mr Ashton and carrying a weapon following the incident on the paradise island of Koh Phangan.

21.5million tourists visited Thailand last year including 800,000 British visitors

Today, he told a court in the neighbouring larger island of Koh Samui that the shooting was a mistake. 'I was aiming at someone else but the foreigner got in the way', he said.

The court heard he already had his finger pressured on the trigger.

Kaewkla was remanded in custody to prison in Koh Samui for 12 days.

It is not clear when the full case will be heard. But under Thai law the trial should begin within 84 days.

The court has not accepted a plea from him for charges which police said would be manslaughter and illegal possession of a gun.

In court and handcuffed, Kaewkla said 'sorry' to the media and other foreigners.

Mr Ashton, a former city trader from Purley, south London, was enjoying New Year celebrations when he was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between rival gangs.

Police on Koh Phangan said Mr Ashton was with a group of friends and 300 other tourists celebrating the countdown to 2013 at a pub and restaurant called the Zoom Bar when he was shot by a home-made gun at Haad Rin beach shortly after 4am.

Last year, up to 21.5 million tourists visited Thailand, higher than the projected 20.5 million.

The government aims for 21 million arrivals this year and hopes to receive up to 22.2 million in 2014.

Prakit Chinamourphong, vice president of the Thai Hotels Association, said the 'gun free' campaign should be extended to all resorts in Thailand.

He said: 'The country's image is being destroyed because many tourists had been killed, robbed or raped in key tourist destinations like Pattaya, Phuket and Krabi.'

'If the government wants to see continual growth in tourism, then they 
should move to protect visitors and end this problem.'

Thailand has the highest number of guns per capita of any country in Asia.
