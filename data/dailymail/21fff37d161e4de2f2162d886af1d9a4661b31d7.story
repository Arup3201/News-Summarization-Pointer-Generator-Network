Help find him: Police are urging the public to help them trace a 13-year-old boy who has gone missing from his Birmingham home

Fears are growing for a 13-year-old boy who went missing on Saturday after being told he couldn't go to a library.

Munasar Jiniqow disappeared on Saturday night when he sneaked out of his home in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

The schoolboy failed to return home and his worried family have not seen or heard from him since.

Birmingham South police said the teenager disappeared after being told he wasn't allowed to attend an educational event taking place at the Library of Birmingham.

Inspector Andrew Tanner, from Birmingham South police said: ‘This behaviour is out of character for Munasar as he has not been missing before.

‘We are very worried about him and need to make sure that he is safe and well.

‘Anyone who sees Munasar, knows of his whereabouts, or has information to help us trace him is urged to contact us as soon as possible.’

The teenager is described as black, of large build, around 5ft 5in tall, with short afro black hair.

He was last seen wearing a khaki coloured parka jacket, a black and white baseball top, black jogging bottoms with a single white line down the leg and black shoes.

Anyone able to help the police inquiry should call Birmingham South Police on 101.

Missing: Munasar Jiniqow has not  been seen since Saturday night when the teenager sneaked out of his  home after being told he wasn't allowed to attend an event taking place at Birmingham Central Library

The Library of Birmingham is Europe's largest public library, costing £180million.

The newly-built library replaced the city's 1970s Central Library - which was likened to an ugly book-burning incinerator by Prince Charles.

It was officially opened by inspirational teenager Malala Yousafza in September last year.

The library contains around a million books and 
access to a vast film and television archive belonging to the British 
Film Institute.

It is also the new home of the second largest repository
 of Shakespeare's works in the world.

The
 31,000 sq m (333,000 sq ft) library - dubbed the' People's Palace' by 
Dutch architect Francine Houben - is clad partly in gold and covered in 
5,357 interlocking metal circles supposed to reflect the ‘values of 
universality, timelessness and unity.’
