Walking free: Rachael Thompson, 40, sliced her four-month-old's heels with a blade but was given a suspended sentence because it was a 'cry for help', a judge ruled

A mother has been spared jail despite causing 'horrific' injuries to her baby son's feet by slashing them with a razor blade.

Rachael Thompson, 40, sliced her  four-month-old's heels and then told doctors the child kicked the blade when into fell into his bath.

Jurors at Plymouth Crown Court took just two and half hours to convict her of assault after hearing that her son's wounds could only have been caused deliberately.

But Recorder Vasanti Selvaratnum spared Thompson jail because he believed her cruel attack was a 'cry for help'.

He also ruled that  the assaulted baby should stay with her despite her conviction.

Sentencing her to 50 weeks, suspended for a year, he told the mother: 'You clearly love your son. The injury you caused him was a cry for help and out of character.

'There is no suggestion in any evidence I have seen that the injury the jury found you caused to your son was anything other than an isolated incident and he remained in your care for two years or more.'

Plymouth Crown Court had heard how heard Thompson took her son into hospital two days after hacking at his feet in September 2011.

Jo Martin, prosecuting, said Thompson told medics she had been bathing the child when she left him with her partner.

She claimed she had come back to find the child's feet bleeding and a razor blade lying in the tub.

The court heard doctors grew suspicious and contacted police and social services.

A&E nurse Emma Congdon said she was suspicious because of the two-day delay in bringing in the baby.

She said the mother told her the baby had 'kicked' the razor into the bath.

She told the court the boy's wounds were 'horrific', adding: 'You would not leave a four month old baby on its own in the bath.'

Ms Martin said police consulted an expert who said a falling razor would be unlikely to slice into a baby's feet.

And even if it did, it would cut in a 'criss-cross' fashion rather deliver a clean, identical wound to both heels, she said.

The little boy spent a night in hospital before being released as the injuries were only superficial.

His mother was subsequently arrested and told police 'she would not hurt her child'.

The court heard Thompson had a history of self-harm and suffered from a personality disorder caused by childhood abuse and bullying at school.

She has also suffered from the eating disorder bulimia for most of her adult life.

Thompson's child will remaining living with her in Plymouth, Devon, but she will remain under probation supervision for a year.
