Blackburn Rovers. The hilariously optimistic Steve Kean, the farcically inept Venky’s. Out they tumbled of the Premier League in disgrace when vociferous chants against the ownership of the club were far more frequent than home goals at Ewood Park.

They were only heading in one direction. You felt for the supporters, but couldn’t help but laugh: they were a joke.

Even more so when Kean was ‘forced to resign’ in September 2012 with the the club third in the Championship. Further still after the dismissal of Henning Berg 57 days into the post. His replacement, Michael Appleton, last just a week-and-a-half longer. 

He's going nowhere! Blackburn Rovers have no intention of selling striker Jordan Rhodes to Hull City 

Awareness: Anuradha Desia (left, with Venkatesh Rao and Balaji Rao) want to keep supporters on side

It was scarcely believable. Venky’s had to change. They dispensed of the flamboyant yet flappable ‘global advisor’ Shebby Singh and serial caretaker Gary Bowyer was handed the job full-time. 

That appeared to be a sign of realignment in the second tier, but Bowyer has made moves in his 15 months in charge to suggest that they are ready to kick on.

Jordan Rhodes is the man any manager outside the top flight - and more than a few in it - wants leading his line. The much-maligned Rudy Gestede is proving to be a terrific foil, too. Gestede has nine goals in his last eight for Rovers; Rhodes is typically on more than a goal every other game.

It is the ongoing situation of the latter that will offer a real insight into where the East Lancashire side are going before the transfer window slams shut.

Hull City have made no secret of their desire to spend the money earned from the sale of Shane Long to Southampton on prising away the Scotland international.

The offer is touching £12million. The answer is a categoric no. Rhodes only signed a new contract last month and there is absolutely no reason for Venky’s to sell.Sportsmail understands that defiance isn’t borne out of negotiating a strong position for themselves in the market - this isn’t about the money, it boils down to perception.

Boiling over: Blackburn fans have made their feelings known about the owners, Venky's, in the past 

What a difference: Gary Bowyer has steadied the ship at Ewood Park since taking the job permanently 

Rovers’ Indian owners - particularly Anuradha Desai - are very aware of their standing among the club’s support. They want to keep their star striker, who scored in the win against Bournemouth on Saturday, to build bridges - to show they mean business. There has been a fair amount of relationship rebuilding going on since Appleton was given the boot and selling Rhodes would see some good work wiped out in an instant - there is a realisation of the bond between supporters and the player.

They do, however, have Financial Fair Play to worry about, which represents a reasonably strong argument to part with the Championship’s best front man for a quick buck. It is not so long ago that the club posted a pre-tax loss of £36.5million following relegation from the Premier League and - in a bid to make a swift return - they overspent on the wages of Danny Murphy, Nuno Gomes and the like.

Problems of the last four years have derived from ill-judged decisions stemming from poor advice taken by the owners, rather than an inherent disregard of the club. They are desperate to rectify that.

All smiles: Rhodes celebrates with Ben Marshall after finding the net against Bournemouth on Saturday 

The monetary situation remains precarious and they could still do with profiting from the sale of players in order to balance the books for the next set of accounts. But allowing Rhodes to depart would be counterintuitive.

This season is one where they can attack the top end of the division. Bowyer has made some shrewd signings and they have seven points from their opening four games. This is not a league full of quality rivals. There is an opportunity to win promotion with a solid foundation and a man - or men in this case - finding the net frequently. Add Craig Conway and Tom Cairney into the mix and they’ve a side capable of upsetting the favourites.

Rovers recognise they also need new players. Bowyer is over in Pune at the moment and likely to fly back to England with the blessing of Venky’s to go and sign a couple of new faces and utilise the loan market.

This isn’t a Kean visit to India. He hasn’t been summoned, he doesn’t have to go every month to provide updates. Bowyer commands their respect and there is a rapport; trust is the operative word. And at the moment, it seems rather tranquil up in Blackburn.

They scored almost a quarter of League One’s goals this weekend. Andrew Cole’s son Devante - on loan from Manchester City - get in on the act as they thrashed Gillingham 4-1 at Oakwell. 

After a miserable couple of seasons at the bottom of the Championship, the Tykes are just looking forward to winning games regularly this season.

When will it end for the German? He has won just three games of 16 in charge of Fulham since taking over in February. 

They were thumped 5-1 at Derby County at the weekend and there is growing talk that the Cottagers could ‘do a Wolves’ and suffer consecutive relegations. Unrecognisable after players have left the club in the last three months.

TALENT SCOUT: DANNY ROSE

Danny Rose was someone who made an immediate impact on loan at Bury last season with three goals in six substitute appearances. So when the chance to snap him up permanently from Barnsley arose last week it was a no-brainer for David Flitcroft. 

The 20-year-old has now found the net twice in his first two fixtures for the Shakers - against Luton and then Plymouth - and provides the sort of firepower Bury will need if they are to get out of League Two this season.
