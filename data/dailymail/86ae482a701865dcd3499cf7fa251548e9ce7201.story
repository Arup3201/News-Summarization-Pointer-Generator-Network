This was the moment a blast ripped through an old Soviet-style block in southern Russia today sending it crashing down like a house of cards.

The nine-storey building in the city of Astrakhan, 800 miles south east of Moscow, collapsed in an explosion believed to be caused by natural gas.

Two people died following the blast and 12 people were injured.

A further 11 people living there haven't been accounted for. Rescue workers are searching through the rubble for more possible victims.

The explosion, captured on film, punched a hole through the bottom three floors of the apartment block in southern Russia

The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted regional Investigative Committee spokeswoman Aanna Konyaeva as saying the blast first blew out a lower section of the building.

As people rushed to help, the upper six stories collapsed.

Explosions of gas canisters in Russian residences and businesses are common because antiquated infrastructure has not been modernised in the last decades.

A nine-storey apartment block in southern Russia collapsed after a gas explosion as rescuers battled to find up to 14 people still feared trapped under the rubble, the emergencies ministry said.

The block, part of a housing complex in the southern city of Astrakhan, disintegrated and collapsed in a heap of rubble and dust after the explosion blew out its lower floors, pictures on state television showed.

The cause of the blast, which took place around lunchtime, is believed to have been a gas leak, the emergencies ministry said on its website. Some reports said the leak could have been prompted by an attempted suicide inside the housing block.

'The fate of 14 people is still unknown,' said Russiaâ€™s deputy emergencies minister Pavel Popov, quoted by the Interfax news agency.

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the creation of a special commission to examine the causes of the disaster

The health ministry said 12 people were injured, including two children who are among seven people still hospitalised.

The emergencies ministry said it was despatching two giant Ilyushin-76 planes to Astrakhan with rescue specialists and machinery on board.

Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu also arrived at the scene.

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the creation of a special commission under Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov to examine the causes of the disaster, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement to Russian news agencies.
