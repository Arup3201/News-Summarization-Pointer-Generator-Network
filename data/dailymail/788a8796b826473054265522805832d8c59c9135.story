Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is spinning off the company's prized stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding in a move that will let Yahoo avoid paying billions in future taxes.

A newly formed entity called SpinCo will inherit ownership of Yahoo's 384 million Alibaba shares when the tax-free spin-off is completed toward the end of this year.

The stock of the new company will be distributed pro rata to Yahoo shareholders, resulting in SpinCo becoming a separate publicly traded company.

Alibaba operates an online ecosystem that lets individuals and small businesses buy and sell. 

It doesn't directly sell anything, compete with its merchants, or hold inventory.

It has been described as China's answer to eBay, but it actually handles more packages annually than eBay and Amazon combined. 

Most of Alibaba's 279 million active buyers visit the sites at least once a month on smartphones and other mobile devices, making the company attractive to investors as computing shifts away from laptop and desktop machines. 

Alibaba has come to power four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in China and has also branched out into areas such as e-payments and financial investment. 

If Alibaba were a country, its GDP would be above Vietnam and just below New Zealand.

Tuesday's much-anticipated announcement about the management of Yahoo's 15 percent stake in Alibaba overshadowed Yahoo's results for the final three months of last year.

Yahoo's current market value is $45 billion, of which $40 billion is in Alibaba shares.

'We have actively engaged experts in tax-efficient structures over the past two years and have considered a variety of alternatives,' Yahoo chief finance officer Ken Goldman said in a statement.

'We remain aligned with our shareholders and our plan is designed to achieve the most advantageous return of capital to Yahoo shareholders with the absolute highest probability of success.'

Yahoo will continue to operate its core business and hold its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.

Yahoo said separately its profit in the fourth quarter fell 52 percent from a year ago to $166 million while revenue was essentially flat at $1.25 billion.

'I'm pleased to report that our performance in the fourth quarter and in 2014 continues to show stability in our core business,' said chief executive Marissa Mayer.

'Our mobile strategy and focus has transformed Yahoo and yielded significant results.'

Investments in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan are the main reason Yahoo's stock has more than tripled since Mayer defected from Google to become Yahoo's CEO two-and-half years ago. 

Yahoo is retaining its nearly 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.

The handling of Yahoo's Alibaba stake is so important to shareholders that one activist investor, hedge fudge manager Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value, has threatened to spearhead an attempt to oust Mayer if she didn't adopt a strategy that minimizes taxes. 

Smith also has been pressuring Mayer to commit to returning most of any future Alibaba windfalls instead of spending the money to buy other companies — unless she embraces his call for Yahoo to merge with rival AOL Inc.

A tax-free spin-off of the Alibaba stake ranked high on Smith's agenda.

Other stockholders also liked Mayer's decision. 

Yahoo's stock gained $3.49, or more than 7 percent, to $51.48 in extended trading.

The website, which aims to connect companies with wholesalers, is known for selling everything - including some strange offerings. 

One company in particular, Zhongshan City Elephant Sculpture Art, is leading the way with its silicone-wax celebrity statues.

A popular piece is the life-size, obese statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

The sculpture is completely naked, apart from shotgun and sunglasses, and it could be yours for £9,900 ($16,800).

In the event you need the services of a camel, then you can purchase 500 for around £350 ($600) each.

With many of the items bulk buy, your will need to order 24,000 pieces to get your hand on what is described as 'lovely used panties'.

But if beauty products are more your thing, then Alibaba has some intriguing offers.

The female electric nose lifter, for instance, promises to give you a firmer, higher nose by zapping it with vibrations for just three minutes a day.

Not to be left out, there is also a wide array of male grooming product for sale.

Lovers of Apple products, who also happen to have an embarrassing ear wax problem, can get their hands on a Steve Jobs-banded ear cleaner tool set.

The pack contains eight items for ear cleaning and manicuring and is priced at 50p ($0.8) at a minimum order of 2,000 sets.
