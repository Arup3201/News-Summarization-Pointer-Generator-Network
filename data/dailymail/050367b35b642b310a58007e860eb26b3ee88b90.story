It is said there is no such thing as being over-prepared, and this is clearly a motto the Lithuanian government has taken to heart as it publishes a 98-page guide on how to survive an invasion.

The small Baltic state has released the manual, entitled How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War, so its three million citizens will know exactly what to do should war come to their home soil.

Its handy hints include keeping calm, using Facebook to organise resistance and - if all else fails - simply doing your job a little worse than you did before. 

Lithuania's government has released a manual entitled How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War

The guide advises: 'Keep a sound mind, don't panic and don't lose clear thinking. 

'Gunshots just outside your window are not the end of the world.'

The manual, which the Defence Ministry has sent to the country's libraries and is planning to distribute at army events, says Lithuanians should resist foreign occupation with demonstrations and strikes, 'or at least doing your job worse than usual'.

In the event of invasion, the manual says Lithuanians should organise themselves through Twitter and Facebook and attempt cyber attacks against the enemy.

It also suggests the best exit routes from the country, should residents want to flee, as well as advising people to keep their car tanks full. 

Indeed, the government is so worried about a possible invasion, it is also considering requiring all future buildings to incorporate a bomb shelter on the premises. 

But while the idea of a war in Lithuania may seem somewhat unlikely to an outside observer, government ministers have explained the move was sparked by recent tensions between their far larger neighbour Russia and the Ukraine. 

The guide was compiled in reaction to Russia's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states 

Less than 500 miles separate Moscow from its border, and it is increasingly worried about Russia, not least because of a military drill in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad last month that featured 9,000 soldiers and more than 55 naval vessels. 

'The examples of Georgia and Ukraine, which both lost a part of their territory, show us that we cannot rule out a similar kind of situation here, and that we should be ready,' Defence Minister Juozas Olekas explained. 

'When Russia started its aggression in Ukraine, here in Lithuania our citizens understood that our neighbor is not friendly,'

Already, the country - which spent most of the last century under the control of the Soviet Union, but clearly plans on being its own boss in this one - has increased recruitment for both its army and paramilitary reserve force.

Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last year, and Western governments say they have overwhelming evidence that it is supplying troops and weaponry to pro-Russian separatists who have seized parts of eastern Ukraine, an accusation that Moscow denies.
