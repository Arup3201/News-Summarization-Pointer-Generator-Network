A self-described non-partisan organization promoting affordable health care has received a $1.1million grant to create a database of Obamacare success stories, it was revealed today.

The Washington, DC-based non-profit group Families USA was awarded the grant October 4 by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

On the foundation's website it states that the money was made available to Families USA 'to publicize the available insurance options under the Affordable Care Act.'

The description of the grant goes on to say that the $1.1million will be used to increase the organization's capacity 'to expand its well-established story-bank operation to produce' more stories from real Americans about their experiences with Obamacare. 

The story was first reported by Capitol City Project - a right-wing investigative news group based out of DC.

On its website, Families USA asks users to share their stories relating to the Affordable Care Act in an effort to illustrate 'the human need for health reform.'

Storyteller: Ron Pollack, the co-founder and executive director of Families USA said the purpose of the Story Bank is to 'bridge the information gap' for people who can benefit from Obamacare

‘Now that we’ve crossed the finish line, it's time to educate the public about health reform and how it will affect them,’ the site proclaims. ‘The best way to do that is to tell your story, giving a real example of the status quo and the impact of change.’

In the 'Story Bank' section of the portal, Families USA outlines the kind of examples it's interested in collecting, among them tales of individuals and small businesses who will buy insurance on the new exchanges; people who have been hit hard by the lack of Medicaid expansion in their state; patients with pre-existing conditions who now can get insured, and others.

‘The purpose is to bridge the information gap for people who can significantly benefit from the Affordable Care Act,’ Ron Pollack, the co-founder and executive director of Families USA, told Time Magazine last month.

Capitol City Project has challenged the charity's claim of being an independent and non-partisan entity, revealing that Families USA is 'extremely close to the Obama administration' as well as Enroll America, whose stated mission is to 'maximize the number of uninsured Americans who enroll’ in Obamacare.    

The news of the grant comes just one day after yet another embarrassing setback for the much maligned Affordable Care Act.

On Wednesday, the White House 
announced that the online health exchanges for small businesses will now
 be delayed until November 2014.

Uphill battle: President Obama's signature piece of legislation extending health care to the uninsured has been plagued with a series of glitches and delays from the start

Weeks earlier, Politico reported that the White House promised to get the Internet marketplaces, known as SHOP, up and running by the end of this month.

The launch of Obamacare has been plagued with glitches and delays both big and small.

The Obama administration has been forced to push back several deadlines in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which has been hampered by the faulty federal healthy exchange site, Healthcare.gov.

Although only 26,794 people signed up in health plans through the federal site the first month of open enrollment, 993,635 applied for coverage and were waiting to finalize decisions.
