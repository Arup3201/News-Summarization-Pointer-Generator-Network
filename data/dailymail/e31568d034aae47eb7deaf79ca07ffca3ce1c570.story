Democrats' support is
softening for Hillary Clinton, their party's presumed 2016
presidential front-runner, with nearly half now in favor of an independent
review of the private email account she used exclusively when she was America's top diplomat.

And most Americans now say they don't want to see political retreads running for president. 

Support for Clinton's candidacy has dropped about 15
percentage points since mid-February in her own party, with as
few as 45 percent saying they would support her in the last
week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.

Democrats likely to vote in the party primaries, however, backed off their support for her in slightly smaller numbers.

Reuters also found that 46 percent of Democrats believe there should be an independent probe of all of Clinton's emails to ensure she turned over
everything work-related when she left the Obama administration.

 

NOT SO FAST: New polls show Hillary Clinton's star is fading and both Democrats and Republicans don't want past presidential candidates to have another bite at the apple

There was sizable support among Democrats – 41 per cent – for a congressional effort, backed by Republcians, to force Clinton to testify about the emails.

'Bottom line is if she didn't do anything wrong, she's
fine,' North Carolina resident Renetia Lowery, 48, told Reuters. Lowery is a
Democrat who participated in the poll.

Separately, a new Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday found that 54 per cent of likely U.S. voters from both major parties want to see fresh faces running in the 2016 presidential contet. 

Among Democrats, just 22 per cent would be satisfied with a candidate who has run before. Fifty-seven per cent disagreed.

That could spell trouble for Clinton, a 2008 also-ran who took the silver medal when Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination on his way to the White House.

It also bodes ill for other former big political names whose names have been floated as Hillary's star wanes, including former Vice President Al Gore, current Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry.

Kerry and Gore were the unsuccessful Democratic nominees in 2004 and 2000, losing to George W. Bush in the general elections.

The scandal that Washington wags have Christened 'email-gate' could ultimately be Clinton's undoing.  

Even Democrats who said they were not personally swayed one
way or another by the data-security flap told Reuters pollsters that it could lower Clinton's prospects next year. 

The Reuters online poll sampled opinions of 2,128 adults from March 10 to March 17. 

Clinton has tried to tamp down accusations that she used her
personal email account to keep her records from public review,
which would support an old political narrative that Clinton and
her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are secretive and
seek to play by a different set of rules.  

Democratic strategist Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for
President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said the email
controversy would help Democrats in the long run by urging Clinton to get serious about running. 

It's become a 'galvanizing call for the Clinton
campaign-in-waiting to build an organization,' by hiring top
political communicators who can defend her record, LaBolt told Reuters.

Clinton is expected
to announce as early as April that she plans to seek the White
House in the November 2016 election.

She is expected also to announce a communicatiosn team that includes former congressional and Justice Department spokesman Brian
Fallon, White House aide Jennifer Palmieri and Jesse Ferguson,
who has handled press for Democratic congressional campaigns.

Palmieri already has one foot out of the White House. Her replacement, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, will move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next month.

Clinton told a packed room of reporters this month that she
used her personal email for official business for the sake of
convenience, because it was easier to carry only one device. 

Clinton's office said she has since turned over paper copies
of more than 30,000 work emails last year at the State
Department's request, but did not hand over about 32,000 that
were private or personal records.

Among the emails turned over were 300 related to a 2012
attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi that led to the death of
a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, which were
subsequently handed over to a Republican-led congressional
committee investigating the incident.

The panel has subpoenaed Clinton's remaining emails and said
they would like her to testify on the matter before April.

About half of Democrats said they thought Clinton was
composed during the March 10 news conference, but 14 percent
found her evasive and 17 percent said she avoided answering
questions directly.

Survey respondent Tom Trevathan, 74, a retired math
professor from Arkansas, said he was 'less than happy' with
Clinton's performance at the news conference.

'It reminds me of a history she has had not responding
thoroughly to inquiries,' Trevathan said. 'If she would be more
open about the situation, and show more leadership in saying
what she did and why, I think it would be better.'
