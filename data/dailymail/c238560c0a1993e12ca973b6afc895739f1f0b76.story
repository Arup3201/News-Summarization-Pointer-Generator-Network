Jailed: Bank manager Celia Zarebska, 52, stole £315,000 from elderly and vulnerable customers

A bank manager who stole over £300,000 from elderly and vulnerable customers’ accounts so she could ‘fit in with the golfing wives’ in her village has been jailed for three years and four months.

Celia Zarebska withdrew £500 cash several times a month, targeting accounts with large sums of money which had been left dormant due to the owner’s ill health or age.

The 52-year-old, a £17,000-a-year manager at a Santander branch in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, said she had spent the money lavish holidays and expensive dresses.

Zarebska siphoned money out of customers’ accounts for seven years before she was caught, Leicester Crown Court heard today.

Her thefts were discovered when a woman tried to make a withdrawal from her aunt’s account, meant to contain £62,000, and found it was empty.

Zarebska denied any wrong-doing when quizzed by bank investigators, but admitted the offences when she was arrested by the police.

She told detectives she had spent the money on paying off the mortgage on her husband’s detached home and buying holidays and clothes ‘to fit in with the golfing wives’.

Around £315,000 was taken in total between 2004 and 2011. At least one of Zarebska’s five victims was living in a care home, and another died before she took their money.

Zarebska admitted a total of nine charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting. The Santander branch where she worked has since closed down.

Detective Constable Jenny Tattersall, of 
Leicestershire Police’s Serious Crime Team, said: ‘This was sustained 
dishonesty over a long period.'

‘Zarebska targeted very vulnerable victims - people with large sums of money who were unlikely to be able to check on their accounts,' she added.

‘Cases involving this amount of fraud are very rare, and I hope this sends a message to those in positions of trust who are tempted to abuse their authority.’

Santander has refunded all the money to the victims.

There will now be further legal proceedings to strip Zarebska of her illegally-gained assets.
