It has been dubbed 'Tinder for planes' - and promises to let you meet fellow passengers on your flight while you're still in the air.

Called Wingman, it was created by 24 old New York copywriter Gabe Whaley.

The app will use in-flight wifi or bluetooth to connect people, and is about to begin testing.

The Wingman app hopes to bring a Tinder-like dating experience to the skies

Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder.

Users create a profile with their picture, first name, age, occupation, flight number and the airline they’re traveling with - and whether they’re traveling for business or pleasure.

The app then displays a list of travelers on the same flight, and if you find one attractive, you can opt to start a conversation.

'The beta, much like the final version, will be extremely simple,' he told MailOnline.

'To create your profile, you simply provide a photo, your first name, age, and occupation.

'All the info you provide at your discretion.

'Once you board a flight, you will input your flight number, airline, and whether you are traveling for business, pleasure or both.

'The app will then match you with other wingman users who have similar data, and you can choose to pursue a conversation or not (much like how tinder works, although with Wingman you won't have to wait for mutually anonymous "likes" before being matched.)'

Wingman isn’t available yet, but you can sign up for notifications about its development.

The team have been working on it since December, and hope to release it in April - if Apple allows it.

However, they do have a backup plan, and will release the app as a web site if it is banned from app stores.

'I think it will make people curious, and you never know: someone might use it, and it might start a conversation that they might not have otherwise had,” Whaley said.

'It could turn out to be really good, or really bad. Either way, I think it’s really funny.'
