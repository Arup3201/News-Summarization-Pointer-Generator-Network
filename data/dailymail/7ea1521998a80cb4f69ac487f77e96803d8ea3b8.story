Heat makes ecstasy more lethal, new research suggests.

U.S. researchers found doses of MDMA that would not be fatal in cool conditions, can kill people when taken in hot, crowded settings such as nightclubs.

This is because the drug interferes with the body’s ability to regulate temperature.

Researchers at the National Institute of Health say some people believe MDMA is harmless when taken in moderate doses.

But, their new research in rats showed this is not the case in hot environments.

‘We know that high doses of MDMA can sharply increase body temperature to potentially lead to organ failure or even death,’ said Dr Nora Volkow. 

‘However, this current study opens the possibility that even moderate doses could be deadly in certain conditions.’

The researchers say it is currently impossible to predict who will have an adverse reaction to a low dose of MDMA.

However in this study, scientists gave the rats low to moderate doses that have been shown in past studies to not be fatal.

The drug interferes with the body's ability to regulate temperature so is dangerous in warm environments

They monitored the rats to determine drug-induced changes in brain and body temperature and in the body’s ability to cool itself through blood vessel dilation.

When rats were alone and kept at room temperature, a moderate dose of MDMA modestly increased brain and body temperature and moderately diminished the rats’ ability to eliminate excessive heat.

However, when researchers injected the same dose into rats that were either in a warmer environment or in the presence of another rat in the cage, brain temperature increased, causing death in some rats.

‘These results demonstrate that the use of MDMA in certain warm, social settings could be more dangerous than commonly believed,’ said Dr Eugene Kiyatkin, first author on the study.

‘Even with moderate doses, we saw drug-induced, fatal brain hyperthermia during conditions of social interaction and in warm environments.’
