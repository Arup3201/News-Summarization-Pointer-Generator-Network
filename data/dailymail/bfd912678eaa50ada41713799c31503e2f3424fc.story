Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released a video claiming to show the execution of two Libyan soldiers.

Footage shows three balaclava-clad gunmen standing behind the prisoners who are believed to have been captured in battles for the terror group's Libyan stronghold of Derna.

The soldiers - one of whom was reportedly a colonel - are then shot in the back of the head by the jihadists, understood to belong to the ISIS-affiliate Ansar Al Sharia.

One report said the men were accused of fighting for General Khalifa Hifter, who has been leading an offensive against Islamic militias for the internationally recognised Libyan government.

Fate sealed: Images purporting to show the two men. They were reportedly accused of fighting for General Khalifa Hifter, who has been leading an offensive against Islamic militias for the Libyan government

The shootings are the latest in a disturbing rise of executions in Libya in the wake of the terror group's advance across the North African coast. 

It has now gained control of a number of Libyan coastal towns including Benghazi, Sirte, Derna and Nofilia. 

Last month, the jihadists filmed the bloody executions of 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya as it seeks to take a stranglehold on the region.  

ISIS also claimed responsibility for a series of suicide bombings that killed at least 45 people in the town of Qubba, around 20 miles from Derna, nearly three weeks ago.

The extremist organisation's deadly grip now stretches across the Middle East and into northern-Africa where today, only the Mediterranean Sea separates the militants from Europe. 

Growth of terror: Since its formation as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in 2013 - ISIS has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya - while building support among marginalised Muslims in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria

It has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria.

And over the weekend, Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged its allegiance to ISIS, stretching its influence across the west Africa. 

The tyrannical expansion is part of its 'global strategy' to seize destablised countries to 'engage in all-out battle against the West,' the Institute for the Study of War told MailOnline last month.

Counter-terrorism analyst Harleen Gambhir said: 'What we've started to see is ISIS has begun to accelerate its operation to activate these sleeper groups that its reaching out to and it's having international effects.'
