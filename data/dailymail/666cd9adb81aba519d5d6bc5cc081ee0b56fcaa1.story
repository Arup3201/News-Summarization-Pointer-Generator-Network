Sheffield United's main sponsors John Holland Sales have warned they will consider tearing up their contract with the club if convicted rapist Ched Evans is re-signed.

The League One club confirmed on Tuesday they had not yet decided to re-sign Evans, but that the 25-year-old would be allowed to return to training following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association. 

Plenty have opposed Evans' return to professional football, most recently TV presenter Charlie Webster, who was one of three club patrons to resign from their roles on Wednesday.

And John Holland say they will 're-evaluate' their position if Evans is given a contract at Bramall Lane following his release from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence.

'The club has confirmed to John Holland Sales Ltd that the player has not been re-employed,' a statement read. 'The training is with a view to enable Mr Evans to return to a level of fitness which might allow him to seek employment within football.

'John Holland Sales is a long established family business and condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms.

'Whilst ever the 'ex-player' is not employed by Sheffield United Football Club, John Holland Sales Ltd remains committed to its commercial partnership. Should this situation change John Holland Sales will re-evaluate its position as shirt sponsor.' 

Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison

Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side'

'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model,' Clegg told LBC Radio.

'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime.

'It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people.

'I'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United.'

Back-of-the-shirt sponsors DBL Logistics, on the other hand, have promised to sever ties with the Blades if Evans is given a contract at Bramall Lane.

'DBL Logistics is a business that has been built with family values at its core. It strongly condemns rape and violence of any kind against women,' a statement from the transport company read on its Facebook page.

'DBL Logistics would end its back-of-shirt sponsorship with Sheffield United if the club employed a convicted rapist.

'However, whilst the current situation remains and Ched Evans is not contracted to Sheffield United, DBL Logistics will continue its business to business relationship with the club.' 

United manager Nigel Clough maintains the decision to let the former Manchester City player train was not rushed, and that Evans has a right to return to football.

'Everybody realises the gravity of the situation and seriousness of everything and that's why it has taken so long to even get to this stage,' Clough said. 'It has been prompted by the PFA and that's as far as it goes now.

'We deliberated as a club for some weeks and came to this decision. According to the law of the land he is entitled an opportunity to resume his career.'

Charlie Webster has decided to resign from her role as patron of Sheffield United after Evans' return

'Sheffield United haven't made a statement for four months and today, in fact, I had a conversation with the chairman. It was a positive conversation and I walked away from that… I read the statement and I looked at what the club were saying, and the stance that they've taken and the stance that the PFA have taken. 

'At no point has anyone made a decision and Sheffield United still haven't made a decision. They've succumbed to the PFA, the PFA have asked if they trained with him, the FA have said it's a 'dilemma' and at no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime.'

'Over 155,000 people now have signed a petition against Ched Evans going back to the club. Nobody's making a decision and I suppose I feel that I need to make a decision as patron of Sheffield United. My decision, which I informed the club earlier on, is that I resign as patron of Sheffield United and Sheffield United Community Foundation, which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport.

Webster appeared on BBC Newsnight on Tuesday night, and spoke strongly about her stance

'My decision is based on the fact that no convicted rapist, as in Ched Evans, should go back to the club that I am patron of, and go back into the community and represent the community. 

'He's not just going into a job, he's bandied as a role model and we cheer him on as a role model, and he's influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is. 

'I currently haven't had a response from the club but as I said I did have a conversation [with the chairman] which was very positive and friendly earlier on. They said to me that they still haven't made a decision but they have made a decision to let him come and train back at the club.

'I hope [that what I say now will have an impact]. I've spoken quite a few times now and now I'm here speaking to you. I'm trying to, I suppose, give victims of sexual abuse a voice because I think in this day and age, in 2014, we're a rich society – rich in education as well – and still there isn't an education on mutual consent.' 

[On the fact that Ched Evans has served his time] 'The PFA are the players' union so of course [chief executive Gordon Taylor] is going to say that – his interest is only for the players and to make sure the players get the best out of their situation. 

'It's the same union that has recently been sued for sexism because it didn't allow a woman into a dinner, so I don't know what you would take from the PFA. 

'Why have the club chosen to listen to the PFA and not the tens of thousands of fans that say they don't want Ched Evans back at the club…'

Webster said: 'At no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime' on Newsnight

'The point you've just made is that he scores goals, so why would the club bring him back to train? To me that's for one of two reasons: the club are bringing him back to get him match fit to play, or they're bringing him back to train him up to be sold in the January transfer window which is not a moral decision or a community decision, which clubs say they are all about. They are the heart of community. You cannot have it both ways.

[On the crime being sexual] 'There's a lot [on the Wikipedia list of sports stars' crimes] so maybe the FA, instead of saying 'This is a dilemma' which is what the chairman Greg Dyke said, he should maybe do his job which is impose rules. 

'Maybe the FA should make rules so that players can be told what they can and can't do. In my mind they can't go and rape and then go back into their job to influence the next generation. To me, it is personal, because I can comment on sexual abuse because I have been sexually abused, but also because I'm the patron of this club and of the Foundation, and I was brought up in the community of Sheffield, and I'm worried about my community.

'A lot of the fans have spoken up but the fans who are supporting Ched Evans maybe need to look at their own families and imagine what it would be like if it was their daughter or their wife or their mother, because one in five women in this country are sexually abused, which is a statistic that shouldn't exist in 2014. 

'The reason why is because nobody speaks about it and the reason why nobody speaks about it is because they get abused. Me speaking about it, I've been abused; the lady that started the petition, she's been abused… I got told I should have a slap around my face to get myself back in order.'

Evans scored 42 goals in 103 games for the Blades, having previously played for Man City and Norwich City
