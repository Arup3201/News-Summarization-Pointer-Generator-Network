Robots are set to give art fans a night at the museum with a series of after-hours tours around Tate Britain.

People from around the world will be able to view online as four camera-equipped mechanical guides roam the galleries for five consecutive nights, starting tomorrow.

There will also be a live commentary, and some visitors to the website for the After Dark project will be able to direct the robots themselves.

The IK Prize was set up by Tate Britain to ‘celebrate creative talent in the digital industry.’

There were four shortlisted proposals from a total of 51 entries. 

The runners-up included: Evan Boehm with Nexus Productions for Through the Eyes of an Eight-Year-Old. 

Adam Clarke from thecommonpeople.tv for TateCraft - an immersive experience where the museum was created in the land of Minecraft.

Storythings, by Matt Locke and Kim Plowright, for #TateText, which featured stories about the art work being shared on social media.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was among the judges on the panel for the inaugural prize.

Former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield has already tested the technology out from his home in Toronto, ahead of the launch.

After
 Dark was awarded the inaugural IK Prize 2014, which is handed out 
annually to schemes that widen access to the arts through digital 
technology.

It is thought to be the first project of its kind in a 
museum or gallery, and was created by London-based design studio The Workers.

The initiative runs from 13 to 17 August.

The 
public will be able to log on to the After Dark site on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday between 10pm BST (5pm EST) and 3am BST (8am EST).

There will also be another chance to log in on Friday, between from 7.30pm BST (2.30pm EST) to 00.30am BST (10pm), to allow children to log on.

The virtual tours are timed, and once a driver’s turn comes to an end, the tour passes to one of the other passengers.

There will also be a live commentary and some visitors to the website for the After Dark project will be able to direct the robots (pictured) themselves. The initiative runs until  17 August. Each tour is timed, and once a driver's turn ends, the tour passes to another passenger

As the robots move around the museum, a camera will shine a light on exhibits such as Torso in Metal by Sir Jacob Epstein (pictured)

As they make their way through the 
museum, a camera fitted with a light will shine on the exhibits and the 
visitors will be able to read details about the different art work on 
screen.

At the start of a 
session, four different tours will be shown at various points around the
 museum and visitors can choose the exhibition to visit.

The IK Prize was set up by Tate Britain to 'celebrate creative talent in the digital industry.’

The Workers is a digital design studio set up in 2011 by Tommaso Lanza and Ross Cairns, with support from fellow designer David Di Duca.

According to Lanza: 'We’re not trying to give you this perfect representation of the art.

'It’s giving the art a different angle, and different light.'

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was among the judges on the panel for the inaugural prize.

Jane Burton,
 creative director of Tate Media, added: 'The Workers' inspired robotic 
takeover of Tate Britain gets right to the heart of what the IK prize 
stands for, coupling outstanding digital creativity with the imaginative
 use of technology to bring art to ever wider audiences.

'We're 
looking forward to introducing new visitors from all over the world to 
Tate Britain. After all, who hasn't dreamed of wandering through a 
museum, alone, at night?'
