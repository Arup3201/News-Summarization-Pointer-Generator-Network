A Cambridge graduate has decided to follow her dream of becoming a mermaid after recovering from an extremely rare brain tumour.

Mairead Kelly, 25, has been training as an accountant for the last three years but when she’s not in the office, she is working as a professional mermaid.

Ms Kelly, from Cambridge, said: ‘I chose to do it as I love swimming and I have been wanting to get into performing for quite a while. This seemed like the perfect opportunity - it’s something different and quite unusual.

Mairead Kelly, 25, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2010. She has had two operations and is now fully recovered. After her treatment, she decided to pursue her dream of becoming a real-life mermaid

‘I was pretty tentative the first time I got in the water because after two surgeries my nose and sinuses will never be the same, and I wasn’t sure how they’d react to the pressure of being underwater but it’s given me no problems.’

Ms Kelly was diagnosed with a rare benign tumour of the pituitary gland, known as thyrotropinoma, as she finished her final year of university in 2010.

She had surgery in 2011 to remove the tumour but it started to grow back so she had to have a second operation in January this year, she has now made a full recovery.

She explained: ‘I had lots of health issues when I was at university. I was really tired, my hair was falling out and I bruised really easily.

‘I did swimming because it was one of the only forms of exercise I could do. It has been really helpful in my recovery.

‘I’m stronger than I have been in years. I love swimming. Swimming underwater is very zen, the rest of the world is blocked out and everything is just calm and peaceful.

Ms Kelly was diagnosed after she became very tired and noticed that her hair was falling out. She also found that her skin was bruising very easily. She was found to have a pituitary gland tumour

Ms Kelly said: 'I definitely don't think my degree has been put to waste. People may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation, but I feel that both of my careers are valuable'

‘The motivation of wanting to perfect swimming in a tail and monofin in order to start performing underwater was also really important in helping me regain my strength.’

Ms Kelly has teamed-up with Frankie Dubery, a fellow Cambridge graduate, and friend Demelza Hillier, 25, and together they take to the water as a pod of mermaids.

They train for up to ten hours a week in freezing lakes before dazzling crowds with their skills as they swim and sing at events across the country, including parties and black tie balls.

When Ms Kelly is not performing as a mermaid, she works as an accountant. She says that both jobs are fulfilling in their own way

The trio have even been asked to perform for crowds as far afield as Australia and Ibiza.

Known as Merlesque, they have been making a splash since the start of the year in their £3,000 silicon costumes complete with fins and scales.

Ms Dubery, 24, said: ‘Sometimes people don’t believe me when I say I am a mermaid. Different people have different reactions.

‘It is quite interesting how different people’s reactions are - mostly people are really fascinated.’

Ms Kelly, otherwise known as mermaid Ondine, has no regrets about choosing the unusual underwater role after graduating.

She said: ‘I definitely don’t think my degree has been put to waste.

‘People may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation, but I feel that both of my careers are valuable in different ways.

‘The majority of people don’t directly use their degrees in their future professional life - they use the transferable skills you develop through completing a degree.’

A thyrotropinoma is a pituitary tumour that secretes a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone.

An excess of this hormone caused hyperthyroidism which can be serious.

Thyrotropinomas are very rare - they represent just one or two per cent of all benign pituitary tumours.

Symptoms include irritability, nervousness, sweating, tremors, difficulty sleeping, weight loss, brittle hair and thinning of the skin.

Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumour, radiation therapy and medication.
