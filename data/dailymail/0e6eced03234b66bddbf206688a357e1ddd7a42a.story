When relationships turn sour name calling and claims of wrong doing are common place, especially when there is a child custody battle involved.

But few will go to the extreme lengths of crying rape.

That is what one jilted ex-girlfriend has done, according to her former beau and crime drama star Damian Chapa.

Damian Chapa (left) is suing his former mistress and mother of his child over 'false' rape claims. He is best known for his role in the 1993 drama Blood In Blood Out (right)

Now he is suing her for more than $1 million in damages for blackening his reputation and 'nearly ruining his life' with the allegations he claims are false.

Chapa, of Blood In Blood Out fame has filed a lawsuit against Roxanna Foell, the one-time lover he met in Germany at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival.

Their whirlwind relationship ended the following year but not before Foell fell pregnant with Chapa's child.

He proposed, the lawsuit states, and she confessed to already being married, promising to break it off with her husband and file for divorce.

But that never happened, TMZ reported, since Foell realised Chapa wasn't a rich Hollywood celeb, ready to sweep her off her feet with expensive gifts and dates.

Next thing he knew she had patched things up with the would-be-ex-husband, moved back to Germany and was calling time on their relationship.

Their child, a baby boy, was born in 2007 and Foell proceeded to make it very difficult for Chapa to see him, the suit claims.

Chapa took legal action to gain visitation rights, in response to which Foell told police in Germany that the actor had raped her.

He was arrested upon entering the country to try to visit his son and claims he was kept in custody for seven weeks before being released.

Chapa seeks at least $1.3 million in damages.
