They work together and play together but Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn are about to get competitive as they battle for the prestigious title of Model of the Year 2014.

The two young supermodels have been shortlisted in the Model of the Year category ahead of this year's British Fashion Awards.

The duo will compete for the title, along with Sam Rollinson, and the winner will be announced at the glitzy event on December 1.

Who will be this year's winner? Best friends Cara Delevingne, left, and Jourdan Dunn have been shortlisted in the Model of the Year category at 2014's British Fashion Awards

Cara, arguably the world's hottest model right now, claimed the title in 2012 and newcomer Edie Campbell took the crown last year.

While 22-year-old Cara has been busy working on her budding acting career, she's still managed to squeeze in a campaign for Topshop and several catwalk appearances.

Jourdan, 22, meanwhile, fronting Maybelline New York's latest beauty campaign and walked in countless shows over fashion month.

One model who is notably absent from the shortlist, despite her stellar success this year, is Cara's best friend, Suki Waterhouse.

The 22-year-old is currently the face of Burberry's beauty range but failed to make the contenders list.

This year’s British Fashion Awards will be hosted by British comedian, actor, author and television presenter, Jack Whitehall, at the London Coliseum. 

The nominees and winners are voted for by members of the global fashion industry.

Another familiar face who made this year's shortlist is Victoria Beckham, who opened her first standalone store in London this year and will compete with Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney to win Brand of the Year. 

Other awards on the night include the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator, which recognises a British stylist, make-up artist, photographer, art director or producer whose creativity has been a major inspiration and influence in the past year; and the BFC Outstanding Achievement award, which recognises someone whose work has had an exceptional impact on global fashion.
