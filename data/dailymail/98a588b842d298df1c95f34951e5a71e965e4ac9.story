Mauricio Pochettino isn't sure what reception he'll receive from the Southampton fans on Sunday, but has left them in no doubt he still loves the club.

The Tottenham manager upped sticks at the end of last season - a move to coincide with a mass walkout by the club's top players at St Mary's.

Pochettino has come in for some criticism after his decision to opt for a move to White Hart Lane after just 18 months in charge on the south coast.

And he isn't entirely convinced whether the travelling fans will applaud him this weekend.

‘I love Southampton. One year in the period of my life was amazing, but I left. I’ve got amazing memories, he said. ‘It’s football.'

Saints have gone from strength to strength under the guidance of Ronald Koeman and sit second in the Premier League.

That, says Pochettino, is something he's pleased about.

'When you start with a new project and new players then why not?' he said. 'The most important thing is belief and Southampton have a great force and power. They believe - I am happy.'

Pochettino's departure coincided with a player exodus including Luke Shaw joining Manchester United

Adam Lallana left, was another to leave Southampton in a £25m summer move to Liverpool

It is a fixture Spurs could really do with winning after a stuttering start to life under the Argentine and is an afternoon that takes on added importance to the boss.

'I have a lot of friends and a lot of people that I love in Southampton.'

Pochettino - who refuses to take credit for his former side's continued progression - added. 'I’m happy for their start to the league - the players and the people in the club. I have many good memories.

‘It’s a game that we need to get the three points. We need to fight with Southampton on Sunday. It’s emotional. Football is emotional.'
