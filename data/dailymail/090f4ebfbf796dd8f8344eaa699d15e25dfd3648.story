He has often been mocked for his bland casual clothes.

But David Cameron today reveals that his outfits are chosen for him by his wife Samantha.

Mr Cameron has worn his favourite navy blue polo shirt on every summer holiday for several years, and was accused of a fashion faux pas by teaming it with black shoes with no socks on.

In an interview with Woman and Home magazine today, the Prime Minister says he is ‘not really interested in clothes’ and is happy to wear whatever his wife selects for him – provided it doesn’t make him ‘stand out’.

Samantha Cameron has 'extremely good taste' in clothes, according to her husband. Here she is pictured yesterday while out and about in London

‘Samantha has extremely good taste,’ he says. ‘And I'm not really interested in clothes, mainly I like wearing clothes that don't make me stand out.

‘I tend to go for Marks & Spencer and Gap, and I do get put in the changing room at Gap and clothes are passed to me under the changing room door - a bit like feeding time at the zoo!’

In a soft focus interview, Mr Cameron says that his constituency house in Oxfordshire ‘feels more and more like home’, despite the attractions of Downing Street and his country retreat Chequers.

He describes himself as ‘optimistic and fun’, but also ‘driven’.

The Tory leader - who has been mocked for his fondness for ‘chillaxing’ – defends his practice of ‘taking breaks’ from work.

Asked how his friends viewed him, Mr Cameron says: ‘I hope they'd say I'm optimistic, I enjoy life and that I'm fun.

‘But also that I'm quite driven in doing what I believe in. I really profoundly believe in this job and what I'm doing but I try to keep a balance because although this job is a complete passion, at the same time it's my judgment that matters so I've got to keep good balance and pace to make sure I don't get frazzled and fried.

‘So I do take breaks - last weekend I did an eight-mile bicycle ride along the Windrush valley in beautiful cold sunshine with Samantha and two of our children.

‘That, to me, was a perfect Sunday morning.’

Asked about his perfect night in, he says: ‘It involves cooking - and eating - then watching a good detective drama on TV, or House Of Cards,’ he says. ‘Ideally we'd be at our house in Oxfordshire, which feels more and more like home.

No socks appears to be a recurrent theme - here are the loafers he wore while on holiday in Portugal a month earlier

‘I love cooking - it's a very good way to get your mind off things. Yesterday I made roast chicken and all the trimmings, and my signature dish is probably something slow-cooked - like belly of pork or shoulder of lamb.

‘I'm also an obsessive barbecuer; one of the most exciting moments of the year for me is when the cover comes off the barbecue!’

Mr Cameron also praises the ‘sensible’ way his children deal with life at Number 10.

‘My eldest two know that Daddy is Prime Minister, which means a lot of stuff in the newspapers, but they seem to channel it quite sensibly,’ he says. ‘They like their school, they've got lots of friends and they like seeing me as much as possible - at least I hope they do!

‘My youngest is only four and it probably hasn't sunk in for her yet. But she has a good school and if we provide stability for them at home, I'm sure they will be OK.’
