Treasurer Joe Hockey has warned multinational companies they won't get away with dodging tax in Australia for much longer, as the government works with the UK to crack down on profit shifting.

Britain has announced a 25 per cent 'Google tax' for multinationals that avoid paying tax locally and Australia has been exchanging information with its government.

The Australian government is considering charging the standard 30 percent company tax rate on overseas profits generated from sales made in Australia, the Australian Financial Review reported.

Treasurer Joe Hockey is considering charging a 'Google tax' on multinational companies that shift profits

ScrollBritain has set its 'Google tax' or Diverted Profits Tax at 25 percent – higher than the standard 21 percent company tax rate - in an effort to encourage multinationals to declare their profits in the UK. 

Companies use complex international tax structures to divert revenues away from Australia, meaning companies including IKEA, Apple and Google are paying minimal amounts of tax despite raking in massive profits locally.

IKEA has made an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in Australia since 2003 but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $103 million and paid $31 million in tax.

In 2013 Apple paid $36 million in tax despite making $6.1 billion in Australia, while Google paid just $7.1 million despite making $46.5 million.

It's estimated tax avoidance could cost the government between $1 and $3 billion each year.

Mr Hockey says Australia led the charge on tax avoidance throughout last month's G20 summit in Brisbane and is also cracking down on the practice domestically. 

The government has injected 60 new staff into the Australian Tax Office to uncover culprits. 

Mr Hockey says there are 'new and stronger' links between the ATO and other tax offices around the world and clever accounting to hide profits is 'coming to an end'. 

'I'm absolutely determined to ensure that everything is done to make sure people and companies who earn money in Australia pay tax in Australia,' he said.  

However, while Mr Hockey says new resources have been allocated to the ATO to focus on multinationals, the office has also shed more than 2000 staff in the past year.

Former Treasury official Mike Callaghan said the tax would be difficult to impose because multinational companies are operating within the law.

‘You have to be able to prove that the corporation has artificially diverted its profit and that’s a real challenge,’ Mr Callaghan said.

‘We need to look at how countries can change the law to try to stop the diversion of profits because that’s the problem, the law now is out of date with the way companies are operating.’

UK Chancellor George Osborne said that technology giants including Google and Facebook will face a 25 percent tax on profits generated from their economic activity in the UK from April.

But experts questioned whether it will be possible to raise much from the new levy at all, given how hard it is to know whether money is being artificially diverted.

The independent UK Office of Budget Responsibility gave the new tax a 'medium-high' uncertainty rating because it is based on 'assumptions that cannot be readily checked'.

It said predicting the response of multinationals – which could also include Amazon, Apple and Starbucks – to the tax is difficult but likely to be 'volatile and large'.

Graham Parker of the OBR added: 'They may find other ways of getting around these taxes.'
