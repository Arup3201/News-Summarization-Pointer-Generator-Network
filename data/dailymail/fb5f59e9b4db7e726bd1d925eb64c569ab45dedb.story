Hernias can be resolved with a routine operation today, but in the 17th century sufferers were forced to cope with incredible pain - as well as the risk of death - when their internal organs became dislodged.

Now CT scans and an autopsy carried out on a Korean mummy have revealed that one high-ranking official lived with the condition 300 years ago.

And while organs, including his liver and stomach, pushed though a hole in his diaphragm, experts do not believe he died from the condition.

CT scans and an autopsy recently carried out on a Korean mummy (pictured) has revealed that A middle aged man who lived in the 17th century ago suffered from a hernia

Experts think the man was 45 when he died in the 17th century.

He was probably married, as suggested by his top-knot hairstyle.

The man stood 5ft 3inches tall.

He was probably of high social status as he was buried in a royal tomb.

The man could have suffered from chest pains, breathing difficulties and nausea as a result of this condition, but he would not have known why.

Using CT scans and an autopsy, scientists revealed that the man had a hernia in his chest

Part of his liver, stomach and colon were found to be pushing through a hole in his diaphragm.

The man, thought to be middle-aged,  suffered from a hernia in his chest, LiveScience reported.

Examination of the mummy, which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of Korea's Chosun Dynasty in Andong, South Korea, reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death.

It is thought he was around 5ft 3inches tall (160cm) and was probably married, as indicated by his topknot hairstyle.

Experts also came across evidence of a hernia, which they described in the journal PLOS ONE.

Scientists revealed that the middle-aged man suffered from a hernia in his chest. An autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in his diaphragm and that part of his liver, stomach and colon were pushing through it.

Examination of the mummy, which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of Korea's Chosun Dynasty in Andong, South Korea (marked on the map), reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death

They found that he lived with a condition called Bochdalek-type congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time. The man could have suffered chest pains, nausea and breathing difficulties.

CDH hernias are caused by a birth defect where a hole forms in the diaphragm. This means that organs in the abdomen can push through the hole into the chest cavity with potentially fatal results if the heart or lungs are compressed.

Experts from a number of universities in South Korea placed the mummy in a CT scanner to discover the anomaly.

An autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in this diaphragm and that part of his liver, stomach and colon were pushing through it.

The scientists found that he lived with a condition called Bochdalek-type congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time. The man could have suffered chest pains, nausea and breathing difficulties from some of his organs squeezing though a hole in his diaphragm (shown in these CT scans)

It is thought that the man was around 5ft 3inches tall (160cm) and was probably married, as indicated by his topknot hairstyle. He was laid to rest in straw shoes and was well preserved (shown by his hand, right)

The team, which was led by Yi-Suk Kim of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea, do not think that the man died directly or his condition.

‘The CDH itself might not have been the main cause of death in his case,’ they wrote.

‘He could have lived with CDH in this lifetime while experiencing a few signs of respiratory disturbances.

‘We suspected that the functional defects caused by the CDH in the present male mummy case might have been largely compensated for as he grew older.’
