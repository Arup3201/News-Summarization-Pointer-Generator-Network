Senior executives in major British supermarkets regularly ignore food expiry dates, with one even branding the policy as 'ridiculous'.

In a major survey of some of the largest food retailers, the heads of Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op all said they all regularly ignored expiry dates and best-before dates at home, while executives at Tesco, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer all admitted ignoring use-by dates.

Dalton Philips, CEO of Morrisons said when at home he subjected food to what he described as a 'smell test' rather than relying on the best-before or use-by date on the package.

Supermarkets often heavily discount food just as it is approaching its sell-by date

Mr Dalton said the rules were 'ridiculous' especially concerning some cheeses which got better with age

Speaking to The Times, Mr Dalton said: 'Meat especially... I would smell it. Our date codes in the UK are pretty strict. But good, aged beef is nicer. I am always going over the date on my yoghurts. A sell-by date for lots of cheese is ridiculous - they get better with age. The rule is, smell it.'

Mr Dalton's view was supported by Mark Price, managing director at Watroise who admitted often eating fruit, vegetables, cheese, meat as well as sausages and bacon a few days after the use-by date.

Supermarket giant Tesco last year admitted throwing away almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste during the first six months of the year.

The average household could save in the region of £60 a month by reducing the amount of food they throw away, while Tesco admitted they were forced to dispose of 30,000 tonnes of food waste during the first six months of last year

Families can make great savings if they are willing to look past the sell-by date on food

Government figures this week showed that the average weekly spending on all household food and drinks in 2012 was £29.29 per person, an increase of 4.6 percent on 2011.

Food was the largest item of household expenditure for poor households after housing, fuel and power costs.

The average family could save £60 a month by reducing the amount of food it throws away, campaign group Love Food Hate Waste said.

Mary McGrath, from the charity Foodcycle, told The Times: 'Simpler and more accurate expiry dates would help consumers and supermarket bosses alike.

'We are wasting shocking amounts of perfectly edible food every day. I would have to question what they are doing about food waste.'

Best-before dates are intended to advise customers on when a food product may be past its best but still safe to eat, guidance from the Food Standards Agency says.

Use-by dates are meant to show when food is no longer fit to eat, while sell-by dates are used in some shops as instructions to staff to help with stock control.
