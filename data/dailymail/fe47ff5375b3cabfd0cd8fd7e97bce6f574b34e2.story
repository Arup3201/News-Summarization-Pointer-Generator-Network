A British hedge fund company is about to cash-in this week on a surprisingly secure investment - Madonna. 

The organisation bought more than 140 Madonna items, mostly costumes and jewellery she wore during her movie and singing career.

The goods included dozens of outfits from the 1996 hit musical Evita as well as the star's peach baseball dress and glove from her 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' and a vest top and jeans she wore for her music video of American Pie.

The most eye-catching item amassed by the London-based asset management company is the pink satin gown she wore for her 1986 music video for Material Girl.

The glittery gold cowboy hat from her 2000 video for 'Music' also made up the collection, as did a tuxedo jacket she wore in the 1985 comedy film Desperately Seeking Susan.

It is not known exactly how much money the group paid for the collection but it is estimated it could sell at auction for up to £400,000 this Friday, which would at least double their investment.

One of the reasons why the outfits have shot up in value over the last decade is because Marquee Capital has shown them off around the world in their 'Simply Madonna - Materials of the Girl' exhibition.

The display has helped raise the profile and interest in the items.

Marquee Capital was launched in 2005 looking for investors to raise a six-figure kitty to snap up celebrity memorabilia.

The group targeted Madonna material because the collectors' market for merchandise relating to the Beatles, Elivis Presley and Marylin Monroe was already well-established.

The deep pink satin gown worn by Madonna in the 1984 music video Material Girl is estimated to sell for $60,000 (£37,541) while the white fox fur stole worn with it is estimated to go for $6,000 (£3,755)

The group targeted Madonna material because the collectors' market for merchandise for the singer was less established than other stars - and it has proved to be a wise investment 

Chetan Trivedi, 42, the chief executive of Marquee Capital, said: 'We set up Marquee Capital in 2005 because nobody in the market had set up a fund to invest in entertainment collectibles unlike art funds and vintage car funds.

'We built up a network of investors who had to earn over £100,000 a year or who had £250,000 worth of assets not including a house.

'We then had to decide who were were going to invest in. Marilyn and the Beatles are a bit played out so we decided on Madonna as she transcends two generations and her stuff if quite rare on the open market.

Even just these song lyrics written by Madonna for an unknown song and scribbled on a piece of note paper is expected to reach $800-1,200 (£500 - £750) as die hard fans clamor to own any piece of the songstress 

Other items up for grabs are the Rockford Peaches uniform worn by Madonna, in A League of Their Own in 1992 (Est, $3,000 - 5,000 or £1,877 -£3,128) and, right, the American Music Award for Favourite Single (Est, $4,000-6,000 or £2,502- £3,753)

'In Evita, Madonna set a record for the number of costume changes, which was 88.

'We went to the costume house that supplied the dresses and bought 35 of them. We were cash rich and made them an offer they couldn't refuse.'

The fund sourced and bought dozens of other outfits, shoes and items of jewellery used by Madonna during her career spanning 20 years.

Mr Trivedi said: 'It was a 10 year investment but we didn't just want the collection to sit there and hope it would increase in value which is why she showed it off around the world.

'We have three years left to run but we feel that now is a prime opportunity to offload it as the market has picked up.'

The pink Material Girl gown is likely to sell at auction for about £37,000 while a blue taffeta dress Madonna wore while performing 'True Blue' on stage during her 1987 tour is tipped to sell for £40,000.

Darren Julien, of LA-based Julien's Auctions, said: 'Madonna is one of the most collectible living celebrities.

'We hope to break $100,000 with the pink dress that she wore in the video 'Material Girl'.

'Marquee Capital was very smart in investing in Madonna and we are going to show them a sound return for their investment. Madonna is not only a global pop icons but a blue chip when it comes to investing.'

The sale takes place on November 7.
