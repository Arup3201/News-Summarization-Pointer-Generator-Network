Lawmakers and activists are denouncing the Obama administration's collection of phone records for millions of Americans as an Orwellian, outrageous breach of privacy that calls for investigation, while the White House is defending the practice as a 'critical tool' for fighting terrorism.

'From a civil liberties perspective, the program could hardly be any more alarming,' said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director. 'It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.' The ACLU is demanding an investigation into the practice, which Jaffer says is unconstitutional.

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the 
Senate Intelligence committee, confirmed on Thursday that the Obama 
administration has been collecting telephone records of millions of U.S. Verizon customers. The top 
secret court order for the telephone records, which was
 reported by The Guardian newspaper late Wednesday, is actually a three-month 
renewal of an ongoing practice, she said.

Spying: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order, that was only revealed today

Double bind: Part of the order mandated that Verizon not tell its' customer's about the record transfer nor could they admit that the order existed

Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of 
Oregon damned the practice as an 'outrageous breach of Americans' 
privacy.'

The
 Obama administration defended the order on Thursday, calling it 'a 
critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats.'

A
 senior administration official said the practice 'does not allow the 
government to listen in on anyone’s telephone calls' and 'does not 
include the content of any communications or the name of any 
subscriber,' but rather 'relates exclusively to metadata, such as a 
telephone number or the length of the call.'

The order requires Verizon, 
one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, on an 
'ongoing, daily basis' to give the NSA information on all telephone 
calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and 
other countries.

The order was granted by the secret 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and is good until 
July 19.

Because of the lack of distinction, it means that the phone records are not just being collected for suspected terrorists, but the company's entire consumer base.

The only restriction set forth in the order seems to be the duration of the exchange.

It was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and it denoted that it would only hold water until July 19, so just shy of three months.

Verizon is believed to have nearly 150million customers across the U.S., all of whom could potentially be affected by the controversial court order.

Lashing out: Former Vice President Al Gore called the surveillance 'outrageous', not supporting his fellow Democrats

Timing: The revelation comes the same day as President Obama announced his appointment of Susan Rice (right) to be the new head of the NSA, replacing Tom Donilon (center)

This news comes just as the Obama 
administration is in the process of explaining itself for secretly 
subpoenaing the phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and
 Fox News without notifying either organization.

That case was tied to a national security leak, and caused uproar from which the Department of Justice is still reeling.

In this latest instance of unexplained government spying, the government order gives them records of all calls made from certain numbers, and lists what phone numbers they called and how long the call lasted.

The data does not include recordings of the conversation or a transcription of those calls.

The Guardian reports that the copy of the order shows that the court ordered Verizon to give the NSA 'all call detail records or 'telephony metadata' created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad'.

Wide-reaching: Millions of Verizon customers had their data turned over to the NSA, and it is not known whether similar orders were given to other phone companies as well

These records must 'continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order'.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, the Custodian of Records shall produce to the National Security Agency (NSA) upon service of this Order, and continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this Order....an electronic copy of the following tangible things: all call detail records or "telephony metadata" created by Verizon for communications (i) between the United States and abroad; or (ii) wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.

Telephony metadata includes comprehensive communications routing information,. including but not limited to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number... and time and duration of call.

Telephony metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication, as defined by 18 U.S.C. ? 2510(8), or the name, address, or financial information of a subscriber or customer.

The secret nature of the order means that Verizon was forbidden to disclose the nature of the order and the existence of the order itself.

As such, there is no way of knowing whether similar orders have been put upon other telephone carriers, making the web of possible victims unlimited.

An expert in electronic freedom practices says that it was unlikely that Verizon would be the only subject of such an order and that the other major carriers probably had similar orders against them.

'That's not the society we've built in the United States,' said Kurt Opsahl, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is suing the NSA over surveillance inside the country.

'It's not the society we set forth in the Constitution, and it's not the society we should have.'

He isn't the only one reacting to the news, as former Vice President Al Gore took to Twitter to call the revelation 'obscenely outrageous'.

His decision to come forward is an important one, as he served for two terms under former President Bill Clinton, who will most likely remain silent because of his close association with President Obama- particularly as his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for President.

Looking back, Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall warned that the government was abusing their privileges when it came to spying.

The two men, who sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee, cryptically warned that there would be backlash should any of the federal tricks be revealed.

'When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they are going to be stunned and they are going to be angry,' they wrote in a joint letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012.

'As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.'

The American Civil Liberties Union 
put out an immediate statement calling for an end to the program - which 
is scheduled to run until July 19 - and a investigation into the order.

'From a civil liberties perspective, 
the program could hardly be any more alarming,' ACLU deputy legal 
director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. 

'It’s a program in which some untold 
number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance 
of government agents.

'It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.'

The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed.

In 2005, the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls. Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls.

In addition, a former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier's main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions.

Verizon is the second biggest U.S. telephone company behind AT&T in terms of revenue. The vast majority of Verizon's overseas operations come from its acquisition of MCI Communications, which is also covered by the order although foreign-to-foreign calls are exempted from it.
