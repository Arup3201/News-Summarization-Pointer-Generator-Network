Warning: Lib Dem peer Floella Benjamin will call for lessons in extreme pornography

The dangers of extreme pornography would be taught in schools under Lib Dem plans to tackle children’s ‘distorted view of sex’.

Nick Clegg’s party will also call for web users to have to specifically request access to explicit material on electronic devices to curb access to internet filth.

Under current government plans, every householder will be asked whether or not they want online porn blocked. Pornography depicting rape will also be outlawed.

But in a direct challenge to the coalition’s own plans, a policy expected to adopted at the Lib Dem’s conference next month will call for a default setting where pornography is blocked unless users request access.

Former children’s TV presenter Floella Benjamin warns of the ‘long-term effects on young minds of early exposure to often violent and abusive sexual material’.

The Lib Dem peer said it is ‘is highly damaging to impressionable young people and may significantly alter their attitudes to sex’.

At the conference in Glasgow Baroness Benjamin will argued that the internet has many positive benefits but ‘it is the role of government to protect those too young to make an informed choice from potentially damaging experiences wherever possible’.

She will also raise ‘significant concerns’ about other adult material such as suicide and eating disorder sites that often actively target young people.

A motion to be debated at the conference calls on the coalition to ‘ensure that teaching about the dangers of the internet and the distorted view of sex provided by pornography forms part of sex education teaching’.

It will also urge ministers to work with the software industry to ‘introduce opt-in filters to explicit material on all new internet-enabled electronic devices’.

Adults wishing to view pornographic material should be required to opt in to websites containing such material by providing verifiable proof of age, possibly by logging in with a credit or debit card.

Opt-in: The Lib Dems want every web user to specifically request access to pornography on every electronic device

Last year education minister Liz Truss suggested pornography could already form part of lessons in schools.

She said: ‘The Government wants all young people to have high quality, age appropriate sex and relationships education.

‘The current non-statutory programmes of study for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education, which include sex and relationship education, can provide opportunities for schools to teach about pornography.’

The NSPCC has recently warned of an increase in the number of cases of children sexually assaulting other children.

The motion by Baroness Benjamin also raises fears about the ‘increasing number of cases of children being bullied or coerced into performing pornographic acts by their peers’.
