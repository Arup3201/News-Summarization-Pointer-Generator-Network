Out early: Lord Hanningfield has been freed under a curfew scheme

Two disgraced peers who fiddled their expenses have been released early from prison after serving only a quarter of their sentences.

Lord Taylor was jailed for a year in May for fraudulently claiming more than £11,000 in taxpayers’ money, while Lord Hanningfield received a nine-month sentence in July after falsely claiming £13,000.

Both men were expelled from the Conservative Party but they remain members of the House of Lords – enabling them to start claiming more expenses.

It is understood they were both 
released last week on home detention curfews. This means they are seen 
as low risk but must wear an electronic tag.

Lord Hanningfield, 70, was pictured at
his home in West Hanningfield, Essex, over the weekend looking relaxed 
and refused to admit any wrong-doing. Lord  Taylor, meanwhile, was seen 
visiting a beauty salon near his home in Ealing, west London.

Lord Taylor, who became the first black Conservative peer in 1996, was found to have lied under oath during his fraud trial.

The 58-year-old told the House of 
Lords members’ expenses office that his main residence was a house in 
Oxford. In fact, he only twice visited the property.

He was therefore not entitled to claim
money for travelling from there to London and staying overnight in the 
capital.

Lord Hanningfield, a former pig farmer, served as a Lords 
opposition frontbencher and leader of Essex County Council.

He falsely claimed £13,379 for overnight stays in London.

He lost his seat at Essex County 
Council as a result and is being investigated for alleged misuse of his 
corporate credit card by the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate.

Claims: Lord 
Hanningfield stayed at his home in Chelmsford, Essex, while claiming for
overnight stays for his work at the House of Lords

Lord Taylor, right, was jailed for a year 
for fraudulently claiming more than £11,000 while 
Lord Hanningfield, left, falsely 
claimed £13,000 and was also jailed

Tom Smith-Hughes, Lib Dem leader at 
the council, said Lord Hanningfield was treated ‘incredibly generously’ 
by the Prison Service.

Matthew Elliott, of campaign group the
TaxPayers’ Alliance, condemned the peers’ release as a ‘further insult’
to the public. He said: ‘Taxpayers will feel that justice has not been done.’

Three former Labour MPs jailed over 
the expenses scandal – David Chaytor, Eric Illsley and Jim Devine – have
already been released. However, unlike the Lords they were expelled 
from the Commons.
