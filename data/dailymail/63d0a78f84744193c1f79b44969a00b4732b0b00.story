She is the former star of The Only Way Is Essex who broke the rules by shunning fake tan, false eyelashes and skimpy body-con dresses in favour of a more natural and demure look.

And
 now, after a sell-out summer collection, TV star-turned-fashion-designer Lydia 
Rose Bright is channelling her love of retro fashion in yet another clothing range.

Taking inspiration from the vintage style she wears so well, Lydia has crafted the eponymous autumn/winter 13 collection using a nod to her love of timeless, feminine 
designs with a subtle, sexy twist.

She's back! Lydia Rose Bright has unveiled her third clothing collection and she says it's her best yet (Kylie dress, £75)

Speaking about the creation of her third collection, the 22-year-old said: 'The inspiration behind this collection remains very similar.

'I still wanted my pieces to have the same influences and tell the same story. The collection is very vintage inspired, glamorous, sophisticated and timeless.

'I have taken inspiration from my favourite 1950s Hollywood style icons like Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn.

'Along with watching all my favourite designers on the catwalk showcasing their A/W ranges and picking up new trends.'

Demure: Lydia says that she wants her clothes to exude sexiness without being too revealing (L- Spot, £70, R- Cara, £50)

Vintage: Evolving the brand's signature aesthetic, the new collection combines iconic vintage silhouettes with playful, feminine detailing (L-Talia £50, R- Sandy, £80)

Her first 10-piece capsule collection 
was a fashion hit so she extended her range into a 25-piece 
collection for spring and incorporated a lot more colour.

She explained: 'This collection is my first autumn/winter range so I could experiment with a darker colour palette. I have chosen a rich berry, blood red, deep navy, soft greys and of course the staple black.

'I feel like this collection is my best to date as I really feel my clothes have a real identity now and a signature look.

'I now have a real understanding of my bestsellers and customer feedback so I believe this range has something for everyone.'

Berry nice: Lydia's signature crochet detailing and unique ribbon ties have been recreated in a variety of rich berry shades for autumn (Evangeline £75)

Dressing up: A staple for the Lydia Rose Bright collection, the midi-dress returns for AW13, updated for the new season in an array of statement colours (L- Larna, £80, R- Effie, £70)

Unlike many of her former co-stars and Brentwood friends, Lydia has shunned the classic Essex look for a much more demure style - favouring vintage designs over figure-hugging bodycon dresses - and her new collection reflects this.

She said: 'Looking sexy I believe doesn't mean showing as much as possible. Looking sexy is about being confident and wearing something that leaves men lusting for more.

'A dress should bring attention to your best assets. That is why I have designed dresses for all shapes and sizes. But they should not show every asset. This I believe always attracts the wrong attention.'

Speaking about the pieces she like best from the new collection, she said: 'I have three drops for A/W13 and I have a favourite piece in every drop.

'It's hard to pick just one, but my I like pieces that sit off the shoulder.'

Personal favourite: Lydia, who designed the whole collection from start to finish, loves the £75 off-the-shoulder Kitty dress

'It's such a classic look and so hard to find dresses that sit on the shoulder comfortably. My favourite from the first drop is the Kitty.'

Lydia was born into a fashion-mad 
family - her mother Deb was a fashion buyer and her aunt was a designer - 
so it came as no surprise to the Bright clan when Lydia ventured into 
the world of fashion.

The budding fashionista and her 
sister Georgia May Bright were even honoured with a prestigious Drapers 
award for the Independent top 100 fashion retailers for their 
Essex boutique, Bella Sorella.

Speaking about her success, Lydia said: 'I feel I have grown as a designer as I now have a really good knowledge about the whole process.

Monochrome: Elegant pencil skirts and ladylike button up blouses complete the new Lydia Rose Bright collection (L-Penelope £50, R-Dolly, £75)

'From mood boards, drawing sketches, learning about the different qualities of fabrics, CADs, grading and buying meetings. I now have a lot more confidence with all these procedures and will carrying on learning more and more as each new collection evolves.

'I am still in love with my designing even when I have a break in between each collection I find myself cutting snippets from magazines and popping into vintage stores for inspiration. I am so grateful of the platform I have been given to launch me into the fashion industry.'

And after such a successful foray into 
the world of fashion, the future is most certainly looking bright for 
the young starlet - and she is loving every minute.

Fashionista: Lydia advises: 'Simply pair with chic courts and a slick of red lipstick for Mad Men inspired boardroom-to-bar style'

This year, she will start her designs for spring/summer 14 and hopes to move into other areas of designing like footwear and accessories.

She is also soon to start a UK summer tour of her store Bella Sorella where she will be opening seven pop-up shops around the UK in London, Bristol, Southampton, Liverpool, Glasgow, Redditch and Sheffield.

She has also recently launched her own YouTube channel and online fashion blog along with two new online shows called Dating Dilemmas and Spin The Bottle.

'It's a very busy year for me but I am loving every minute of it,' she added.
