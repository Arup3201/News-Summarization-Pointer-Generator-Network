A Michigan father whose wife is awaiting trial for attempting to kill herself and their autistic daughter has filed for divorce, claiming he'll never forgive her for what she did.

Speaking out for the first time since the incident 10 months ago, Matt Stapleton, from Elberta, said that raising their 15-year-old Issy was hard and at one point brought the couple to 'a cracking point,' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures.

'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he told People magazine of his estranged partner, Kelli Stapleton, who faces a maximum life sentence for attempted murder, with her trial beginning July 16.

'I still love her but I'll never forgive her.'

Mrs Stapleton told police that after years of physical abuse directed at her and other family members, she 'thought this would be the best solution... if Issy and her went to heaven.'

She has pleaded not guilty.

Mr Stapleton wrestles with his role in what happened.

'Maybe I could have done more - maybe I should have seen the signs,' he said.

Issy was diagnosed as autistic at 2, and barely slept until age 8 when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest.

However, when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school, 'just for the safety of the other kids,' Mr Stapleton said.

But the attacks continued at home.

Mrs Stapelton was twice left unconscious by Issy's fits and her younger sister Ainsley, 13, hid in her room to avoid outbursts.

The father said the family was at a complete loss as to what to do next.

'If
 somebody would have called me (then) and said this horrible thing had 
happened, I would not have been okay with it, but I would have 
understood it,' he told People.

But they finally got Issy into a residential autism treatment center in January 2013, which really helped. She was calmer and was learning how to control her fiery temper.

She was at the Great Lake Center for Autism Treatment in Potage for seven months. Mrs Stapleton acted just days after Issy was released.

She allegedly told her daughter they were going on a camping trip and then lit two charcoal grills in the van they were in with the windows up.

Both survived after being found unconscious.

'This is not an okay act for any parent of an autistic child,' Mr Stapleton said.

After 17 years of marriage, Mr Stapleton filed for divorce after the alleged crime, partly to show a welfare agency how he's determined to protect his children.

Thankfully, both Issy and her mom recovered.

Issy took some time to relearn all the things she struggled with.

But both parents believe they are lucky Issy is alive.

'Kelli feels like it's a miracle that Issy's alive and that she's alive. And she is thankful,' Mr Stapleton said.

As for himself, he said: 'I'm never going to complain about anything for the rest of my life.'

But, now faced with caring for Issy and their other two children alone, he does want to raise awareness of the lack of support there is for autistic kids and their parents.

'We need more research, more support and more therapies to help families manage both the challenges of autism and their own stress,' he said.
