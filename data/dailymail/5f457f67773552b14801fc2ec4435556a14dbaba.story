Harry Swordy drowned in the sea after paddling in the Cornish sea in the early hours of New Year's Day

A New Year's Day reveller who drowned after he went paddling in the Cornish sea during a storm has been identified.

Harry Swordy, 27, disappeared beneath 15ft waves when he waded into the swell in the early hours of January 1.

He was with his sister and several friends who managed to clamber ashore at Loe Bar, near Porthleven in Cornwall, and raised the alarm.

A body was found washed up a day later after coastguards spent hours searching for Mr Swordy in 50mph winds and 'atrocious' conditions.

It was identified as Mr Swordy, from Guildford in Surrey, who was in Cornwall for New Year celebrations.

His death came as authorities begged Britons to steer clear of coastal areas while the country is pounded by mega-storm Hercules.

Mr Swordy's friend Tom Luddington said on his blog: 'Harry was such an amazing character, so full of life, warmth and plans for the future. He will be so missed.

'Harry, amongst other talents, was a professional story teller. His stories were full of beauty, wonder and they were clever and moving.'

Mr Swordy's friends are now campaigning for the storm to be renamed Storm Harry in his honour.

Storms are typically named in the United States from a pre-prepared list and are not given a name on this side of the Atlantic.

But Mr Luddington added : 'We are campaigning that the storm, named by the US media as Hercules, be re-named Storm Harry in his memory.

'If feels right that a legend begin about wonderful Harry that he danced up the biggest storm ever, barefoot in the sea.'

Cornwall Coroner's office confirmed that the death of a man named Harry Swordy had been reported.
