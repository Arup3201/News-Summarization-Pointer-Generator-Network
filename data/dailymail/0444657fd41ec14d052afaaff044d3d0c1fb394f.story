Prime Minister David Cameron is to unveil the extension of the party’s flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder

First-time buyers under the age of 40 are to be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes.

David Cameron is to unveil a dramatic extension of the party’s flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder.

Under the scheme, 100,000 houses would be built on so-called ‘brownfield’ land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes.

The ‘starter homes’ will be available throughout England and offered at prices 20 per cent less than their market value. 

So a house worth £200,000 could be bought by a first-time buyer for £160,000 – a reduction of £40,000.

The discount will be possible because a Conservative government would exempt housebuilders from some taxes and allow the release of cheap brownfield sites – land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes – to build these homes on. Builders would be obliged to pass their savings on to buyers.

The scheme, to be announced at the Conservatives’ final party conference before next year’s General Election, is the latest attempt to echo the focus on property ownership of Margaret Thatcher’s government.

Mr Cameron will say: ‘We want to help more young people achieve the dream of home ownership so today I can pledge we will build 100,000 homes for young, first-time buyers.

‘We will make these starter homes 20 per cent cheaper by exempting them from a raft of taxes and by using brownfield land. I don’t want to see young people locked out of home ownership. 

'We’ve already started to tackle the problem with Help to Buy mortgages – and these new plans will help tens of thousands more people to buy their first home.’

As well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home, Tory strategists believe the policy will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families’ prospects.

Developers will have to demonstrate before planning approval is given that the houses they are planning to build will be at least a fifth cheaper than comparable houses in order to qualify for the cheaper plots and tax exemptions.

The developments will avoid most of the taxes and regulations that are normally imposed on other new homes, like the community infrastructure levy, imposed by local authorities, and the ‘Section 106’ requirement that a certain number of homes must be affordable.

Starter homes will also be exempt from the zero carbon homes standard, an environmental levy. They will be built on brownfield land already zoned for development that is no longer needed for industrial or commercial uses, including surplus land owned by public sector organisations.

It costs less than other land, but is not normally made available to build houses on. First-time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a Help to Buy mortgage, meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable.

Young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home under another new Tory scheme.

The ‘rent to buy’ programme will offer first-time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years. 

They will then be given the right to buy the home. 

The £400million plan from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles aims to give young workers a ‘springboard’ on to the property ladder. 

The scheme is designed for single people earning £33,000 or less and couples on up to £66,000.

Housing associations will run the scheme, but ministers will insist the new one- and two-bed flats are given to ‘hard-working’ people who have never owned a home.

The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced last year to offer buyers a 20 per cent Government loan to buy new properties, worth up to 95 per cent loan to value. It was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020.

Housebuilding under Labour fell to levels not seen since the 1920s. The number of first-time buyers also collapsed, falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009.

Although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to June of this year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the Government says more must be done.

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said: ‘Increasing housing supply is a huge and complex challenge and significant constraints remain.

‘Enabling more first-time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership and introducing policies that allow more land to come forward and increase house building would clearly be positive.

‘The industry is keen to work with government to develop any policies that would allow the country to build more high quality homes in the right places.'
