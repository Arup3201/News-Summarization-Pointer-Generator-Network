An 18-year-old man arrested in connection with a street attack which left a football fan critically ill has been released on police bail.

West Midlands Police said the teenager was bailed until April 8 pending further inquiries into an assault on a Watford supporter in Wolverhampton last Saturday.

He was arrested on suspicion of wounding at a house in the Wednesfield area of Wolverhampton at about 4am on Wednesday.

Detectives have said the arrest is 'only the start' of their investigation into the unprovoked attack on 44-year-old Nick Cruwys.

Mr Cruwys, a father of two young children, was put in an induced coma in hospital after being tripped and kicked in the head following Watford's 2-2 draw with Wolves.

An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has raised more than £25,000.
