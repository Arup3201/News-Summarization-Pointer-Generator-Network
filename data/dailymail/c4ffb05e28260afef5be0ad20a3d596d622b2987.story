A £25 million penthouse flat overlooking Buckingham Palace has become the most expensive London home per square foot – before it has even been built.

Property developer British Land said the top-floor apartment had sold for ‘materially above’ the previous record of £5,000 per square foot.

It measures 5,000 square foot in total, suggesting it has sold for over £25million.

The previous record holder was also in Mayfair in central London.

British Land confirmed it has also exchanged contracts on 18 of the 34 flats at the site for an average price of £4,750 per sq ft.

The site is close to Bond Street and overlooks Buckingham Palace, The Ritz hotel and Green Park.

The 10-storey building includes a cinema, spa and 25-metre swimming pool.

Tim Roberts, of British Land, told City AM that at least half the building’s new residents are ‘British-based’ and half are foreign, predominantly Indian.

The developers said the sale of the apartments was ‘targeted at an exclusive list of known potential buyers’.

The huge prices paid for the flats will raise fears of a housing bubble in prime London, with some wealthy foreign investors willing to pay above market value for property in prestigious locations.

Prospective buyers were approached by estate agents Knight Frank and Wetherell.

Peter Wetherell, founder of the Mayfair estate agent, said: ‘It will be what One Hyde Park is to Knightsbridge.

‘It will be a legacy building made with Portland stone and overlooking Buckingham Palace. It will be very special.’

British Land bought the mews development on Clarges Street, off Piccadilly, for £130million in 2012. It was the former home of the Kennel Club and rehoming the organisation for dog owners was a condition of its planning permission.
