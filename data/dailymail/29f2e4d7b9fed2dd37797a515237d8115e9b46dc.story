WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today refused to comply with a Scotland Yard request to surrender himself to officers.

He says he will remain inside the Embassy of Ecuador while his application for political asylum is processed.

Assange has been inside the embassy, in London, for nine days since seeking political asylum as part of his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning about alleged sex offences.

It is understood that officers from 
the Metropolitan Police’s extradition unit delivered a note to the 
embassy yesterday morning saying Mr Assange has to present himself to 
Belgravia police station at 11.30am today.

But in a statement read out on his behalf, Mr Assange said he had been advised that he should decline to comply with the police request, adding: 'This should not be considered any sign of disrespect. Under both international and domestic UK law asylum assessments take priority over extradition claims.'

Police said they had formally 'served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing'.

It added: 'He remains in breach of his bail conditions, failing to surrender would be a further breach of conditions and he is liable to arrest.'

The statement, in line with UK police policy, did not name him but local media quoted sources identifying him as Mr Assange.

The BBC yesterday reported the extradition unit delivered a note to both Mr Assange and the Ecuador embassy. The embassy declined to comment.

Mr Assange has called for diplomatic 
guarantees he will not be pursued by the US for publishing secret 
documents if he goes to Sweden to face allegations of sex assault.

The Australian, 40, said he is 
prepared to go to Sweden to face questioning over the claims, but fears 
Stockholm will turn him over to the U.S. where he could face espionage 
and conspiracy charges over revelations by WikiLeaks.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he suddenly arrived seeking a last-ditch bid for political asylum last Tuesday, he said: 'Ultimately it may be a matter of what guarantees the United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden are willing to provide'.

Mr Assange believes Washington will pursue him after WikiLeaks published a cache of sensitive documents, including about the Afghan and Iraq wars, and thousands of diplomatic cables which have embarrassed governments worldwide.

He said: 'For example, if the US were to guarantee (it would) drop the grand jury investigation and any further investigation of WikiLeaks publishing activity, that would be an important guarantee... diplomatic commitments do have some weight.'

Mr Assange has been holed up in the Ecuador embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden following the failure of a bid to re-open an appeal against his removal from the country.

Mr Assange is friendly with the South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa and embassies are regarded as 'safe havens' which British police cannot enter.

Veteran journalist John Pilger last week said the Ecuadorians were being very hospitable and had provided Mr Assange with a 'fairly big room with a computer' although he would not confirm whether he had been given a bed for his stay.

Ecuador says he is under its 
protection while it considers the asylum application. He faces arrest 
for breaching the terms of his bail if he leaves the Knightsbridge 
building.

On Monday, a letter signed by high 
profile campaigner Michael Moore and film director Oliver Stone calling 
for Julian Assange to be granted asylum was handed into the embassy.

Robert
 Naiman, director of Just Foreign Policy - an American organisation 
dedicated to reforming U.S foreign policy - gave the Ecuadorian Consul 
Fidel Narvaez on the steps of the Hans St embassy just after 4.30pm.

Mr
 Naiman said those who had signed the letter, including radical academic
 Noam Chomsky and actor Danny Glover, were concerned about Mr Assange’s 
fate if his application is rejected.

'Our
 concern is that if Julian is sent to Sweden that the government of 
Sweden maybe send him to the United States where he may be prosecuted 
under the Espionage Act' Mr Naiman said.

'Many
 people in the United States are very concerned about this, are very 
concerned about Julian and the US campaign and hopefully president 
Correa can give him a positive decision in this case'.

Discussion: The Ecuador ambassador Ana Alban, left, has now gone back to Ecuador to discuss Mr 
Assange's claim for political asylum. He has criticised Australian PM Julia Gillard, right, over the handling of his case

Accepting the documents, Mr Narvaez said 'Mr Assange is under the protection of the Ecuadorian state, as you know.

'(The letter) will be sent to president Correa...we will make sure he get’s it.'

Over the weekend, the Ecuadorian 
Ambassador left London to return to her home country for talks on the 
bid. Anna Alban is to meet President Correa in the capital Quito, where 
she will 
personally brief him on the situation.

Speaking after visiting Assange today, Mr Naiman said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' despite living in 'modest' surroundings.

'My
 sense is that Julian is used to simple living,' said Mr Naiman. 'I'd 
say he is living now as I did when I was an undergraduate in college - 
in what looked to me like a study that's been converted into a makeshift
 bedroom that's still functioning as a study and workspace.'

Asked whether Assange was sleeping on an inflatable mattress, Mr Naiman said: 'I won't deny that it's an inflatable bed.'

WikiLeaks
 spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, who also visited Mr Assange today, said 
'little had changed' regarding the asylum application.

Mr
 Hrafnsson said: 'The Ecuadorian government has requested material both 
from Julian and from authorities in Sweden, the UK and US before they 
make a formal decision.'

Mr
 Hrafnsson said reports that the Swedish Government had ruled out 
guaranteeing Mr Assange won't be extradited to the United States were of
 'grave concern'.

Assange's bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache

'I 
don't have understanding whether this is the official position of the 
Swedish government, but it's of grave concern,' he added.

However,
 he said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' and keeping busy, adding: 
'He's working, doing what we are supposed to be doing, Wikileaks.'

Meanwhile, Mr Assange, who wants to 
start a new life in the South American country, has again criticised 
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard over Canberra's handling of his 
case.

The
 former computer hacker said his situation was 'a serious political 
matter... (that) the Australian government should treat with the 
seriousness it requires'.

He said: 'I have been attacked by the
 U.S., from the vice president down, as a high-tech terrorist, and by 
the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister -- surely that requires 
some direct response from the Gillard government.'

Mr Assange
 has said he chose Ecuador's embassy instead of his home country's 
because he felt Canberra had done nothing to protect him, a charge the 
government has denied.

Canberra has said it has limited capacity to help him because he is not in Australia and has not broken any Australian laws.

Australia has also dismissed the idea
 that Washington is keen to get Mr Assange, with Foreign Minister Bob 
Carr saying Sunday there was 'no hint' of a plan to extradite him to the
 U.S.

Last week, Ecuador's 
President said the South American nation would have to consider 'whether
 Assange's life is at stake', as it makes it decision on asylum.

President Correa told BBC Mundo the country 'defends the right to live'.

President Correa also said: 'We are analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete.'

Mr Assange requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech.

He is set to be extradited to 
Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually 
molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a 
visit to give a lecture.

Mr Assange says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated.

Meanwhile, his bid to avoid 
extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima 
Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache after they 
stumped up the cash to keep him out of jail.

Asked on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as surprised as anyone by this.'

Bianca Jagger, film-makers Michael Moore and Ken Loach, and journalists John Pilger and Tariq Ali were among those who offered to support Mr Assange's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to Sweden.

Those who did stand surety for Mr Assange – freed on bail in December 2010 after spending nine days in Wandsworth jail when held under a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedes – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the embassy, just yards from Harrods.
