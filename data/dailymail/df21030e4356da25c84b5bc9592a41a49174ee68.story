Lance Armstrong kicked back with Willie Nelson last night, clearly making the most of his time since admitting that he won numerous cycling titles with the help of doping and performance-enhancing drugs.

The disgraced athlete shared with his Twitter followers that he had met the country crooner and his wife Annie Nelson for dinner last night in Texas.

The cyclist is on an apparent PR blitz as he tries to rebuild his image following his notorious confession to Oprah Winfrey back in January.

Armstrong posted a photo from the friendly meeting, saying: 'Fun dinner with Annie and @willienelson. Lost my #mellow hat to Willie tho. Great man, great friend, great Texan.'

The 'mellow' hat worn by Nelson in the photo is emblazoned with the logo for Mellow Johnny's Bike Shop in Austin, Texas, which is owned by Armstrong.

Speculation has grown about whether Armstrong will face charges relating to his history of doping.

He is also waiting for a number of things to resolve themselves - one federal investigation did not result in charges - but there are two more that are forthcoming.

Armstrong has been sued by former teammate Floyd Landis and he is reportedly being investigated by the FBI for witness tampering, obstruction of justice and intimidation.

Dallas-based production company SCA Promotions is suing for $12million in bonuses and the Sunday Times of London wants $1.5m back it paid him in a libel settlement.

Nelson is also no stranger in legal issues relating to drugs, as he's been arrested numerous times for marijuana possession. He openly lobbies for legalization of cannabis.

A week ago, Armstrong looked eager to get back into the public eye at Mastro's restaurant in Beverly Hills, days after it was reported that two films about his life are currently in development.

The restaurant is a known celebrity hangout that's always teaming with paparazzo.

Perhaps that was Armstrong's goal, as he happily agreed to take photos with young fans who stopped him outside.

TMZ has reported that Armstrong was asked about the two biopics - one by J.J. Abrams for Paramount and another by Jay Roach for Warner Bros. - but he would not comment.

Earlier this month, Armstrong stirred controversy when he claimed in a magazine interview that the public will forgive him for being one of the most notorious drug cheats in the history of sports - just like they did Bill Clinton for his affair while in office.

Armstrong said that he saw the former president's rehabilitation as a model for his own, and he'll be back on top in a decade.

Speaking to Texas Monthly, he said: 'Ultimately, people forgive and forget and remember the good stuff you did.

'Is it hard to do? Yeah. But Clinton did it - he loves to work, he loves people, he loves to hustle.

â€˜He's
a hero of mine. He's a tough guy, he's smart, surrounded himself with 
good people. And ten years later, he's president of the world. It can be
done.'
