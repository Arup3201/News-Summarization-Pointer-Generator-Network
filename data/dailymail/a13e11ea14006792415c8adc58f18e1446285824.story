Newcastle defender Steven Taylor suffered due to his bravery after heavily colliding with the post during the second-half of the Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park.

The 28-year-old managed to prevent Steven Fletcher scoring for fierce rivals Sunderland with the score locked at 0-0 but clattered into the post and managed to cut his eye lid and cheekbone in the process after the brutal collision.

Taylor was quickly attended to by the Newcastle medical staff before spending seven minutes on the touchline receiving treatment and returned to the pitch to a heroes welcome from the home crowd but couldn't prevent a defeat for the home side.

Newcastle defender Steven Taylor had a nasty collision with the post during the second-half

The incident occurred early in the second-half as the feisty derby game became more stretched.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham managed to clip in a lofted cross from the right in front of the Newcastle goal, evading the reach of Jak Alnwick in goal, leaving Taylor the last man.

Taylor managed to force Fletcher's aim past the post but heavily landed and immediately fell to the ground. Mike Williamson was called to start warming up in order to replace Taylor but the local lad was determined to play on but Sunderland ran out 1-0 winners with Adam Johnson's last minute winner.
