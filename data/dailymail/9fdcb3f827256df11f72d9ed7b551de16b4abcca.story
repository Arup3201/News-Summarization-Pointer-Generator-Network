The Manly based man had a love for all things extreme

Duncan had been involved in extreme sports since he was a teenager, and had completed over 500 jumps in his five years of BASE jumping.

He explained his love for the sport in a YouTube video posted only a fortnight ago, saying 'You have to be brave.' 

Duncan is quoted on Turbolenza's page as saying 'A jump lasts 60 seconds. But the time spent with the people we love is forever', and described himself on his personal Facebook page as a 'professional Skydiver and BASE jumper with a passion for adventure and flying'. 

In his most recent video post on August 30 he revealed his passion for the sport. 'One of the coolest jumps I've done this season. Flying high over the clouds with Tancrede the Flying Frenchy'. 

'You need to have a good balance where you don't let fear overcome you.'
