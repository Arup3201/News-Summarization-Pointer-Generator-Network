The FBI has launched an investigation to determine if an animal rights group behind Bill de Blasio’s controversial pledge to ban carriage horses in Central Park had tried to extort his opponent Christine Quinn.

Sources familiar with the federal probe told the New York Daily News that agents have been questioning people about the pledge made in March 2013.

The ongoing investigation also reportedly revolves around a $175,000 donation made by a union linked to Mayor de Blasio's cousin John Wilhelm to the animal rights group NYCLASS, which has  championed the ban on carriage horses.

The organization was allegedly behind the 'Anybody But Quinn' publicity campaign attacking the one-time Democratic frontrunner Quinn.

According to the Daily News, federal officials are also looking into allegations that political consultant Scott Levenson affiliated with NYCLASS had threatened to derail Quinn's mayoral campaign if she didn't get on board with the carriage ban.

When Ms Quinn refused to support the initiative, NYCLASS contributed a total of $400,000 to the political action committee New York is Not for Sale, which was behind Scott Levenson's Anybody But Quinn media blitz consisting of attack ads and robocalls smearing the former City Council speaker.

According to records obtained by the Daily News, in June 2013, two of de Blasio's biggest donors, including his cousin John Wilhelm, contributed a total of $225,000 to NYCLASS.

Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city

On Friday, Mayor de Blasio said that 
he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the campaign pledge and 
said that no one in his circle had been questioned.

‘Literally, I’ve told you all I know. I’m not familiar with the allegations so I can’t comment,’ de Blasio told reporters.

While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'.

That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious smear campaign against Quinn - his main Democrat rival.

Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed.

'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times.

Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'.

Gathering: Protesters waited outside Neeson's Manhattan home on Saturday after the actor said he did not back the proposed ban

While four
 horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said 
that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic.

Human
 rights activists protested outside of Neeson's apartment on the Upper 
West Side of Manhattan recently, many holding signs reading 'Liam 
Neeson: Stop Supporting Cruelty!' and 'Worked to Death!'

Mayor De Blasio plans to replace the carriages with electric vintage-style cars.
