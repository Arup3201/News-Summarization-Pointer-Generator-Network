A mother has been caught on camera as she stole a charity collection box in full view of her five-year-old son.

Paula Barker, who appeared to be drunk, first struck at a mobility aid store as she posed as a customer enquiring about help for her father.

When a staff member left her desk to get something from the back of the shop, 31-year-old Barker picked up a British Heart Foundation box and shook it to see how much it contained.

CCTV cameras then caught her putting the box into her handbag before walking out of The Eden Mobility store in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on May 15.

Fifteen minutes later she repeated the 
offence at nearby optician Dollond and Aitchison, taking an Action for 
Blind People charity box while her son was still with her.

Wakefield Magistrates Court heard that staff confronted her outside the store and asked to look in her white handbag.

Her son asked her: ‘Do you have to give it back?’

Barker told her child: ‘Yes, because I don’t want to get arrested again.’

Sentenced: Paula Barker at Wakefield Magistrates Court where she admitted taking charity boxes, stealing lager from a local supermarket on two occasions and shoplifting £75 worth of items from a chemist

Barker, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, admitted taking the charity boxes and stealing lager from a local supermarket on two occasions and shoplifting £75 worth of items from a chemist.

Mitigating, Rob Fones told Wakefield Magistrates: said: ‘She has had a problem with drugs.

'Alcohol has been an issue as well.

'She has something of a chaotic lifestyle.’

Barker was sentenced to a 12-month community order with a 12-month drug treatment programme.

John Heaton, senior manager at Eden Mobility, said: ‘In my opinion stealing money that has been collected for charity is worse than stealing stock from the shop.

Left unattended: CCTV caught Barker taking the British Heart Foundation charity box and putting it in her handbag

Stolen charity: Barker, who appeared drunk at the time, walked out of the mobility shop before repeating the same offence in another store 15 minutes later

‘It’s a very callous thing to do.’

The British Heart Foundation said the theft of their collection box was ‘very sad’.

At the time, Inspector Richard Close, of the Central neighbourhood police team, said: ‘This offence shows either extreme desperation or someone with no conscience.

‘Thefts always end up having a victim, in this case there are numerous victims who would have benefited from other people’s generosity.’

'Do you have to give it back?' After she was confronted by staff at Dollond and Aitchison, Barker's son asked his mother about the charity boxes he watched her steal. She replied, 'Yes because I don't want to get arrested again'
