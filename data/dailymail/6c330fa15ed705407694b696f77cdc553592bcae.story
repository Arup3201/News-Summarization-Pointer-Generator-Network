A mother was so scared of falling over and squashing her baby that she lost ten dress sizes over the course of 18 months.

Tanya Oliver-Grieves dropped more than nine stone by abandoning comfort eating and taking up regular exercise, after realising that her weight problem could endanger her nine-month-old son Daniel.

She said: ‘Daniel loved crawling everywhere and trying to clamber up onto our sofa - I remember watching him as he kept falling onto his bottom, in the way that babies do.

‘I was so overweight that I wasn’t very mobile or steady on my feet. As he kept falling down, I had a terrible vision in my head. I imagined how terrible it would be if I fell over and squashed Daniel by accident.

‘I realised that I’d barely be able to lift myself off the floor, let alone help him. I decided to do something about my weight problem once and for all.’

By the time of her revelation Ms Oliver-Grieves, 33, had been struggling with anxiety caused by poor self-esteem for years.

She began piling on the pounds 12 years ago, shortly after meeting the father of her two sons Daniel, now eight, and Tyler, six.

She said: ‘Life was comfortable. I stopped going out and preferred to stay in with takeaways. I didn’t look after myself at all.

After her son Tyler (pictured) was born, she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and, as her health slowly improved, she found it easier to venture outside

Tanya's new-found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist

‘After Daniel was born I fell into a cycle where I wasn’t happy about the way I looked, so I ate more to distract myself from how I was feeling.

‘Ready meals were my weakness. The only problem I had with them was that if anything they took too long to cook. I was always looking for quick, instant lifts for my mood.’

At her heaviest Ms Oliver-Grieves weighed 19st 11lb and wore size 26 clothes.

‘I became very anxious and paranoid. I remember going to my local shop, buying a sandwich and eating it on the street without waiting to get home. I imagined passers-by were thinking, ‘look at that fat person, no wonder she’s so fat if she eats like that’.

‘As I became more afraid of other people, I couldn’t face leaving the house. I became a prisoner in my own home.’

As well as exercise Tanya began dieting, swapping ready-meals and takeaways for reduced-calorie options and fruit juice

It was then that Daniel’s innocent play inspired his mother to turn her life around.

Ms Oliver-Grieves, of Houghton Le Spring, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I thought, ‘even if I don’t fall on him, if he falls and bumps himself, would I be able to get over to him in time to look after him?’

Tanya has now reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is a healthy size 12

‘I couldn’t even get up from the sofa without rolling onto my side and heaving myself up.’

She began dieting, swapping ready-meals and takeaways for reduced-calorie options and fruit juice.

After her son Tyler was born, she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and as her health slowly improved, she found it easier to venture outside.

She said: ‘I began by going into the garden, and then into the street outside, and eventually I could manage to go all the way into town without having a panic attack.’

But as the weight fell off, Ms Oliver-Grieves found she had become psychologically dependent on dieting and exercise.

In 2009, 18 months after her weight-loss programme began, she could fit into size six clothing.

She said: ‘I know I went too far the other way and became obsessive about losing weight. My friends and family were worried I was getting too skinny. I felt as if I was constantly battling against myself.

‘It was only after I organised my exercise properly and figured out a diet tailored just for me that I was able to find the right balance. Eventually I was able to sustain a sensible weight.’

Last year Ms Oliver-Grieves had reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is now a healthy size 12.

Her new-found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist.

She said: ‘I get a huge kick out of making people’s lives healthier and happier.

‘People find themselves in unhealthy situations they feel they can’t get out of - I know I did. If I can do anything to help them feel less trapped, then I think that’s wonderful.’
