Child killer Ronald Salazar, who has served a decade of a life sentence for the horrific murder of his sister, has returned to court to be re-sentenced

A child killer who has served a decade of a life sentence for the horrific murder of his sister has returned to court to be re-sentenced, with the possibility he could serve less jail time.

Ronald Salazar was just 14 when he raped and strangled his 11-year-old sister before slitting her throat in their South Miami Heights home in 2005, a court heard.

Salazar's return to court follows a decision by the US Supreme Court in 2012 banning mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile killers.

Salazar told Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Ellen Sue Venzer at the re-sentencing  that his entire life had been 'messed up' after his parents abandoned him in El Salvador while they made their way into the United States in 1991.

He claimed he had been left with 'abusive' relatives until age 10 when his family finally called for him to make the three journey across the Arizona desert and join them in Miami- where they then treated him as an outcast. His parents, Samuel and Nuvia Salazar, didn't attend the proceedings.

'I just wanted them to see everything I had gone through,' said Salazar, according to the Miami Herald. 'I thought they were going to embrace my pain, that they were going to say, 'I'm sorry, we left you there that whole time by yourself. 'It was nothing like that. They said they had a rougher life, that I didn't have the right to complain. I felt rejected.' 

He began to lash out and was committed to a hospital for a psychological evaluation after threatening to kill himself and his family.

Salazar murdered his little sister Marina 'Estefani' Salazar in July 2005 soon after his release from hospital by cutting her throat from ear-to-ear. 

He then tried to cover his tracks by wiping the knife clean and making up a story about men storming the house and killer her, the court heard.

It took a jury just two hours at his trial in 2009 to convict him after prosecutors produced DNA evidence and a videotaped confession. Salazar had claimed he was insane and suffered a mental breakdown.

The court in the trial heard he had hated his parents and killed his sister Estefani as revenge for them leaving him in El Salvador.

This week's hearing heard that Salazar had been mentally scarred by his parents' decision to abandon him in El Salvador, where he was sexually abused aged 7 and ran with street gangs, and was not made to feel welcome when he finally joined them.

Salazar also claimed  his parents told him they had a witch doctor remove a 'voodoo' spell from his father only to cast it upon him as a baby.

In tears, he admitted he felt he didn't deserve a second chance but wanted to prove 'I'm not that animal.'

However, prosecutor Reid Rubin, pointed out the killer had  boasted of the murder in prison and claimed he could still use his gang connections to have his parents killed  from behind bars. 

Salazar raped his sister because he knew he'd never be with another woman once jailed, the court heard. 

Salazar said he had no answer to why he raped the 11-year-old. 'I really do wish I had an answer to that question,' he said. 'There is no reason. She was sweet. She never did anything to me.'

The Supreme Court barred mandatory life prison terms for juveniles after research showed that young people's brains are more susceptible to impulses and the influence of others. 

The law allows for judicial 'review' after 25 years for juveniles serving life for murder but does not apply to cases from before July 1, 2014. 

The 24-year-old's hearing comes after a decision by the US Supreme Court in 2012 which banned mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile killers
