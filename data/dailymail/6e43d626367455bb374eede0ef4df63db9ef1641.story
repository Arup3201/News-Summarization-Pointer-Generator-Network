Newcastle have expressed an interest in signing Ipswich Town defender Tyrone Mings.

The 21-year-old has also attracted interest from Arsenal, but Newcastle have joined the race to sign the defender.

But Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy will be determined not to let Mings leave in this transfer window despite the Premier League interest.

Mings has put a string of excellent performances over the last 12 months and his form hasn't just caught the eye of the big clubs, but also attracted interest from the international scene.

The FA have sent scouts specifically to watch the former Southampton man after he has had rave reviews for the Championship side.

Mings is yet to play for England at any level.
