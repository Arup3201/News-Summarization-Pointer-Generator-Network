A group of reckless drivers who turned a public road into a 'life-threatening' racetrack have been banned from driving after footage was posted online and spotted by police.

The clip shows the men pulling up in front of crowds of spectators in Tyneside before speeding down the road in their modified vehicles to complete a lap of the area.

The men were competing in an organised drag-race around Newcastle's Newburn Premier business park - using traffic lights on Kingfisher Boulevard as makeshift starting signals.

Reckless: Race took place at Newcastle's Newburn Premier business park in front of watching crowds

Organised: It is believed the race, in which traffic lights were used at starting signals, was pre-planned

A number of spectators used mobile phones to film the cars, which included a Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Nova, tearing around the business park. 

Video clips of the race, which took place around 7.45pm on July 7 2013, were soon posted online - leading officers from Northumbria Police directly back to the offending drivers.

Seven of the men, aged between 19 and 26, have now been convicted of motoring offences, including racing on a public highway, with six being banned from the roads.

One of Northumbria Police's leading traffic officers has branded the drivers 'reckless' saying their racing stunt could have cost lives.

Banned: Six out of seven of the drivers that were arrested over the incident have been banned from driving

Illegal: Police are warning drivers that modifications made to cars need to be declared to insurance companies

Temporary Chief Inspector John Heckels, who is leading the force's road safety campaign, Operation Dragoon, said: 'The footage showed a number of reckless drivers treating the public roads like a racing track. 

'It showed people speeding and racing while other drivers go about their normal journeys and pedestrians are crossing the road.

'Their actions are extremely dangerous, they are putting pedestrians and innocent road users' lives at risk and this behaviour will not be tolerated.'

Life Threatening: Chief Inspector John Heckels, of Northumbria Police, has claimed races such as this put people's lives at risk 

Police officers came across footage of the race in September 2013 while looking at similar clips as part of an investigation into a fatal collision. 

After watching footage of the organised race an investigation was launched to trace the drivers.

All seven drivers have been convicted of motoring offences. 

Michael Gibb, 24: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and disqualified from driving for 12 months, fined £350 and ordered to pay court costs of £85.

Meiran Al Nawrasy, 25: Charged with making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty and was fined £215.

Michael Lister, 22: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and banned from driving for 16 months and fined £100.

Kurt Miller, 20: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and disqualified from driving for 12 months and fined £380.

Daniel Leonard, 23: Charged with racing on a public highway and making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty to both offences and got 12-month driving ban, with a £200 fine for racing and £400 fine for the insurance charge. Also ordered to pay £85 in costs.

Craig Thompson, 26: Charged with dangerous driving. Pleaded guilty and was given an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months with 40 hours unpaid work and an order for £85 costs. Also disqualified for 15 months and will have to do an extended test to get his licence back.

Andrew Barnes, 19: Charged with dangerous driving and making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty to both offences and was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for six months, banned from driving for 18 months, and ordered to pay court costs of £100. Must take an extended re-test before driving again

Chief Inspector Heckels said these convictions should serve as a warning that police will catch up with dangerous drivers. 

He also claimed drivers should be wary of making dangerous and illegal modifications to their cars.

He added: 'Operation Dragoon was launched to identify and take action against dangerous drivers. Once we were made aware of the videos we took action. Now, as a result, six dangerous drivers are no longer on the roads. 

'We are finding more and more that people are not informing their insurance companies about modifications made to their vehicles. 

'In this instance three of the seven drivers had failed to disclose modifications to their insurance companies. One of the men had told his insurance company his Vauxhall Nova had a 1.2 litre engine when in fact it had a 2-litre engine.

'This is extremely dangerous, it is a criminal offence and it also voids insurance policies, meaning that any claims made could be rejected and that you would receive no money for your car should you try and claim on its insurance.'
