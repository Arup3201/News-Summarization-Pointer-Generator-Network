People around the United States have rallied behind a 19-year-old Air Foce cadet who is in critical condition after having a massive heart attack while at a gym in her hometown. 

Since Hailey Lane suffered a heart attack at ACAC gym in Midlothian, Virginia, during her spring break on March 23, people posted pictures and messages on social media with the hashtag, #WeAreHaileystrong.

Hailey was without a pulse for 20 minutes while a nurse employed by ACAC and an anesthesiologist who happened to be at the gym tried to revive her.

Unexpected: Hailey Lane, 19, suffered a massive heart attack on March 23 while working out at ACAC gym in Midlothian, Virginia, during her spring break. She is still on life support but recovering and beginning to open her eyes

Doctors eventually restarted her heard at Chippenham Hospital, but her kidneys failed several times, according to WTVR. 

Hailey and her twin sister, Savannah Lane will be celebrating their 20th birthday on Friday.

The second-year Air Force Academy cadet, who is an Academic All-Americans honored swimmer, was stabilized and transferred to Virginia Commonwealth University's Health Center last week. 

She remains connected to an EMCO machine, which helps her breath and pumps her heart, which was originally at five per cent and had improved to 35 per cent. 

Doctors hope to take Hailey off of life support on Tuesday as her body continues to recover. 

Though she hasn't gained full consciousness, Savannah Lane said that she has opened her eyes and responds to familiar voices.

Recovery: Hailey, who is in her second year at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, has received support from across the nation during her recovery. Al Roker blew her a kiss during the Today Show after hearing her story

But doctors warn that Hailey, who is on dialysis, could lose part of her leg because of blood-pressure issues and that it is too soon to determine the extent of damage to her heart and body. 

Hailey's family said her sudden collapse was a total shock because she has always been athletic and driven. Doctors will soon run tests to see if an unknown condition is in the family.

The Lane family - consisting of Hailey, her twin Savannah, a set of older twins, a ten-year-old brother and parents Brigid and Dennis Lane, have been overwhelmed by the nation's support.
