Jann Mardenborough will this season compete in the full series of the World Endurance Championship just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project.

The 23-year-old from Cardiff will drive Nissan's GT-R LM Nismo in the WEC's top category, LM P1, which includes the Le Mans 24 Hours in June.

It marks an incredible rise for Mardenborough who in 2011 won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers.

Over the past few years Mardenborough, son of former professional footballer Steve, has competed in sportscars and single-seaters.

Being given a seat for the WEC represents his greatest challenge yet as he said: 'I want to show there is a different route to the top of motorsport, than just years and years of expensive go-karting, by winning at Le Mans.

'It's an honour for me to be chosen to compete in LM P1 for Nissan, and in a car that looks set to be an historic one.

'I have raced at Le Mans twice in LM P2 (finishing third in the category in 2013) so I have seen the current LM P1 cars at very close quarters out on the track.

'To think I will be racing one this year is very exciting.'
