Benefit cheat: Patrick Wildman who was filmed walking despite his claims that he needed a wheelchair

A 'Little Britain' fraudster who pocketed £27,000 in benefits after claiming he couldn't walk was caught out working as a delivery driver.

In scenes similar to that of comedy character Andy from Little Britain, Patrick Wildman who uses a wheelchair was secretly filmed walking around a city.

The former bus driver has now been convicted of benefit fraud after pocketing benefits money for over seven years.

The 47-year-old had told the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) that he was 'in constant pain' and could not walk without a stick or support from someone else.

But Plymouth Crown Court heard that he was working as a delivery driver and a bus driver while claiming disability benefits.

After
a three day trial Wildman, from Plymouth, was convicted of failing to 
notify a change of circumstances that would affect his benefit claim.

The jury was shown covert video footage of Wildman walking freely around Plymouth city centre in November 2009.

The
footage was similar to the scenes in the TV comedy Little Britain where
wheelchair bound Andy would get out of his chair and do stunts behind 
the back of his carer Lou.

Wildman, who sat in the dock in his 
wheelchair, did not react when the jury reached their guilty verdict 
after just an hour of deliberating.

Prosecutor
Edward Bailey had told the jury that Wildman had received disability 
living allowance from 1994 as he was 'virtually unable to walk'.

He said in 2000 Wildman repeated in a claim form that he could only walk with a stick or with the support of his partner.

He claimed he was in 'constant pain' in is back and legs because of spinal disease.

Mr
Bailey said in 2009 filled in another form saying he could only walk 
with a stick, often needed to stop and was in severe pain.

In that year he did tell officials he was a local bus driver.

But investigators found that from 2002 he had worked for a local window company loading unloading heavy uPVC windows.

The prosecutor said Wildman also worked for a firm delivering papers, often in bulk, between 2004-2006.

Mr
Bailey said he failed to declare any health problems to his employers 
and did not tell the DWP about his work until 2009 because he was being 
dishonest.

He said: 'He claimed he was virtually unable to walk and yet he was able to perform these jobs.'

He said he was paid £27,626.85p to which he was not entitled.

Wildman said he was in constant pain 
even when he was seen walking through the city centre carrying a 
rucksack and wearing a yellow flourescent jacket.

He claimed his now estranged wife would travel with him and help unload the windows, doors and newspapers.

Wildman claimed he had never seen the annual letter reminding him to tell the DWP of any changes in his condition. He will be sentenced later.

A DWP spokesman said: 'Benefit thieves are costing the taxpayer £1.2 billion per year. This money is intended to help those most in need, not line the pockets of criminals.'
