China's official news service has launched a shocking volley of abuse at the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Beijing - labeling him a 'rotten banana' and 'a guide dog to the blind'.

The article - which also called Gary Locke a plague - reflected Chinese nationalists' acute loathing toward the first Chinese-American to have been Washington's top envoy to Beijing.

The editorial 'Farewell, Gary Locke' 
took direct aim at Locke's identity as a third-generation 
Chinese-American, calling him a 'banana' - a racial term for Asians 
identifying with Western values despite their skin color.

'But
 when a banana sits out for long, its yellow peels will always rot, not 
only revealing its white core but also turning into the stomach-churning
 color of black,' read the editorial carried by China News Service.

Locke provoked the anger of the state mouthpiece with comments in his final press conference on Thursday.

In it, the former commerce secretary and two-term governor of Washington state, 63, urged Beijing to respect the rights of peaceful political activists.

He said that China should value not just the economic welfare of its people, but also their freedom of speech, assembly and religion.

Insult: The startling editorial compared ambassador Garry Locke with a rotten banana - an offensive racial slur

'We believe that freedom of expression is a universal right and we very much are concerned about the arrest and detentions of people who are engaged in peaceful advocacy,' Locke, accompanied by his wife Mona, told journalists at the U.S. Embassy in eastern Beijing.

Locke also stressed the importance of making it easier for Chinese tourists to get visas to visit the U.S.

He said: 'Part of the reason for doing that is... to enable more Chinese people to experience America, to see first hand our freedoms, our democracy, our diversity... I hope that perhaps from their experiences in the U.S. they'll want some of those same things in China or understand what is possible in China.'

But the comments seem to have struck a nerve with Chinese officials.

The editorial, under the byline Wang Ping - likely a pseudonym - carried this morning, mocked Locke's portrayal as an
 official judicious with public funds.

It criticized him for being 
hypocritical as he retreated into his multimillion-dollar official 
residence and special-made, bullet-proof luxury vehicle.

Farewell: Gary Locke's used his final press conference to call for more Chinese people to visit America and experience its 'democracy' and 'diversity'

Wang
 belittled Locke's inability to speak his ancestral language and accused
 him of failing to understand China's law but fanning 'evil winds' in 
the ethnically sensitive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang.

'Not
 only did he run around by himself, he even served as a guide dog for 
the blind when he took in the so-called blind rights lawyer Chen 
Guangcheng and led him running,' the editorial said. Chen later was 
allowed to leave China and now lives in the United States.

The
 editorial made a malicious Chinese curse at Locke, suggesting Locke's 
Chinese ancestors would expel him from the family clan should they know 
his behaviors.

Wang also 
made the innuendo that Locke should be blamed for the smog. 'When he 
arrived, so did Beijing's smog,' Wang wrote. 'With his departure, 
Beijing's sky suddenly turned blue.'

'Let's
 bid goodbye to the smog, and let's bid goodbye to the plague. Farewell,
 Gary Locke,' ended the article, which was clearly inspired by Mao 
Zedong's 1949 piece, 'Farewell, Leighton Stuart,' that scoffed at the 
last American ambassador under the collapsing Nationalist government in 
Nanjing.

Tensions: Relations between America and China reached a low following President Barack Obama's meeting with Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the White House in 2010

The piece shocked members of the Chinese public, who denounced the editorial as distasteful and offensive.

But whether it would draw diplomatic protests was unclear; attempts to contact officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing got no response Friday.

Locke's ethnic background particularly interested the Chinese government and people.

Locke won public applause when he was seen carrying his own bag and flying economy class but he drew criticism from Beijing as his demeanor was an unwelcome contrast to Chinese officials' privileges and entitlements.

In his three years in Beijing, Locke oversaw the defusing of a number of delicate diplomatic episodes.

Locke has been a critical player in 
soothing tensions between America and China which reached as low after 
President Barack Obama met Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama at 
the White House.

He also led diplomatic efforts to seek a resolution when a powerful police chief fled to a U.S. consulate and later when a persecuted blind activist sought shelter in the embassy.

The Chinese public also credit him with making them realize the harm of the tiny pollutant PM2.5 and severity of China's foul air by posting the embassy's hourly readings of air quality.

Meanwhile, the editorials in Chinese state media turned from initial reservation to unfriendliness to the insolence of the final piece.

'I think it shows the unfriendliness and impoliteness by the Chinese government toward Gary Locke, and it is without the manners and dignity of a major power,' legal scholar Hao Jinsong said.

'It is unfitting of China's status as a diplomatic power. As a Chinese, I am very angry and feel ashamed of it.'

'This article by China News Service is the most shameless I have ever seen - not one of them but the most shameless,' the popular online commentator Yao Bo said.

'Without him, we probably still would not have known what PM2.5 is, and how did he bring the smog? You have played the snake in the Farmer and the Viper.'

Another commentator Fastop Liu, known for his sharp tongue, said the piece is ungraceful. 'When you call him a plague, you become a national shame as you lack diplomatic etiquette, damage the manner of a great power, and lose the face of all Chinese,' Liu wrote.

Locke's replacement, former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, was sworn in last week and is expected to arrive within weeks.
