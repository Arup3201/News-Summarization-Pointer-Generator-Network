This is the moment two burglars ran off empty-handed after attacking a brave mother-of-two who defended her home in her dressing gown.

Jacqui Horden, 56, was repeatedly punched in the face after two thugs broke into her house and snatched two pairs of car keys.

Police have now released dramatic CCTV pictures of Mrs Horden, who suffers from severe arthritis, rushing to confront the men on March 14 as they try to track down the criminals.

Jacqui Horden tackled the two burglars outside her home in Kettering, Northamptonshire

Sickening images show one of the burglars punching Mrs Horden as she tries to defend her home

The 15-second clip shows the raiders trying to break into the garage by the side of her home in Kettering, Northamptonshire, shortly after 5.20pm.

As Mrs Horden races out of her front door wearing just her dressing gown, one of the crooks punches her in the face.

Mrs Horden managed to parry the savage blow before the other intruder hits her in the head and body repeatedly. She suffered a cracked jaw in the attack and severe bruising to her face and head.

Despite her injuries she chased after the men who then hurled the stolen car keys in the garden and fled empty-handed.

But one of the raiders attacked the mother-of-two, punching her to the face and body

The sickening attack left her with a cracked jaw and bruising to her face and head

After she bravely defended her home, the burglars ran off empty handed

Yesterday she said: 'I was in bed at the time because I have to rest each day because of my arthritis. My daughter Becky was in the shower and my husband Stephen was out.

'Stephen is a dental technician and we have a dental lab out in our garden. As a result we don't lock the gate as customers use it and we often had the back door open.

'On the day of the attack I heard the doorbell go but I thought it was just a customer who would go away if I ignored them.

'But then I heard the gate and someone opening the back door and I shouted to Becky. I went downstairs and saw the car keys had gone. I opened the door and the two men were there trying to open the gate for the cars using a crowbar.

'I was so furious at the cheek of it that I just ran at them shouting 'stop, stop, stop'. I wasn't really thinking but then one of them hit me. I managed to put my arm up and tried to give him something back.

'Then the other one started attacking me and just kept punching me in the face. As that was happening the other got through the gate and the one punching me followed.'

Mrs Horden, who suffers from severe arthritis, was resting when she heard the break-in

She said she never expected the men to hit her and been left afraid to be in the house on her own

Mrs Horden lives at the house with her husband Stephen, 57, and their daughter Becky, 20.

She added: 'I chased the men down the drive and they chucked the car keys behind them as they went.

'I then just collapsed on the drive in pain and shock. I think I managed to do it through sheer adrenaline.

'I didn't break anything but my jaw was cracked so I can't eat anything solid and the bruising is still around my eyes. It was really bad straight afterwards.

'It is only really hitting me now, I think I have been in shock since it happened. It has changed my life forever because I can't be in the house on my own, I have to have everything locked and I have had a panic attack in the town.

Police have launched a hunt for the men, who were white, slim and in their early 20s. One was just under 6ft and the other was slightly shorter with short dark hair

Police want to speak to anyone who recognises either man

'Having seen the CCTV they obviously knew exactly what they wanted. After one had tried the doorbell then went away both of them came back with crow bars.

'We have two Great Danes and they were obviously ready to use the crowbars on them but luckily the dogs didn't go to the door. I hate to think what would have happened if they had.

'I just keep thinking it is going to happen again, I can't get it out of my head.'

Both of the raiders were white, slim and in their early 20s. One was just under 6ft and the other was slightly shorter with short dark hair.

Detective Constable Greg Hemmington, from Northamptonshire Police, said: 'This was a horrific attack on a woman in her own home, who was only trying to protect her property.

'I would like to speak to anyone who may recognise the two men pictured in the CCTV footage or who may have seen them running away into Hallwood Road.'

Anyone information about the attack should contact police or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
