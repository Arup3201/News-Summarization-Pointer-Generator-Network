Miss Saunders was known to use drugs but not thought to be involved in criminal activity. The choice of her was 'random', according to police.

Massey was already being held in the 
Oklahoma County jail on drug charges and he remains held without bond.
 Court documents do not list an attorney for him, Police Chief Phil Cole said.

Gruesome: Bethany police chief Phil Cole speaks about the murder of Carina Saunders

The police chief said: 'Evidence in our investigation has led us to believe that she had been expected to provide certain things to this trafficking group and that she had not been performing to their satisfaction.

'We believe there were other people there and they're now the focus of our investigation.'

Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Scott Rowland said a decision on charges would be made in January. 

Rowland declined to discuss whether the drug charges that Massey was being held on were related to the killing.

'We're at a delicate point in the case and I want to be really careful about what I say,' he told a news conference.

Chief Cole said there was no evidence that Miss Saunders was involved in criminal activity.

He said: 'Our information right now leads us to believe she was a random choice, as sad as that is. 

'She had relationships within these loosely associated people, and I think that she was a victim of opportunity.'

He said investigators met with the young woman's family at the weekend.

He added: 'They are encouraged by this. They're hoping this is just one of many more that will be held to answer for their daughter's murder.'
