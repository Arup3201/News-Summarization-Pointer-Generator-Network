An elderly man in Sparks, Nevada was arrested Tuesday, three months after he shot dead an unarmed squatter in his home.

Wayne Burgarello was charged with murder and attempted murder for killing father-of-two Cody Devine, 34, and seriously injuring 29-year-old Janai Wilson.

The 73-year-old claims he only shot the two squatters in self-defense, according to a police affidavit obtained by the Reno Gazette-Journal.

The victim's father Richard Devine told MailOnline that he plans to attend Burgarello's trial and believes 'justice will be served'.

Arrested: Wayne Burgarello, 73 (left), was arrested Tuesday on charges of murder and attempted murder after shooting dead 34-year-old Cody Devine (right) at his vacant property this past February. Devine's friend Janai Wilson, 29, had been squatting on the property for the past three years, and was also injured in the attack

According to Wilson, she and Devine took methamphetamine the morning of February 13 before Devine drove her to Burgarello's home - an abandoned property that Wilson had been illegally squatting at off an don for the past three years.

Both entered the home and fell asleep before a neighbor reported their break in.

Alvin Lilla, a renter at an adjoining property, called Burgarello and said he believed squatters were inside the home since a Toyota 4Runner was parked outside.  

Burgarello arrived at the home armed with three handguns, and entered the building with two pistols drawn in each hand.

Vacant: Burgarello showed up armed with three handguns after a neighbor notified him that squatters had broke in

Abandoned: The property is surrounded in overgrown shrubbery in this satellite view from 2011

Lilla followed 12 feet behind and says he was warned to stay quiet.

'Shh, don't make any noise,' Burgarello ordered him, according to the affidavit.

'If anybody's in here I'm the owner, you better not be in here, this is a private property, and nobody better be in here!' Burgarello then said.

Burgarello came across Devine and Wilson sleeping in a dark bedroom where the window was covered with a blanket.

The two woke up and Wilson says Devine yelled 'We are just sleeping' before they were shot.

Aftermath: Police are seen responding to the scene back in February

Burgarello says he fired because he saw Devine's arm rise and believed he was holidng his own gun.

Both Wilson and Devine were unarmed.

'I think I said, "Who are you? What are you doing here?"' Burgarello told police. 'I don't know if I said anything or not. The arm came up like a gun, and I reacted.'

Lilla told police he heard 'numerous gunshots, a pause, and then a final gunshot.'

Devine was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit with five shots, including a blow to his head.

Wilson was shot in the arm, stomach and leg but was able to flee the property, jumping a fence and run for a block and a half. She survived the incident after she was rushed to the hospital.

Though Burgarello admitted to shooting the two squatters, he wasn't arrested until Tuesday because it 'took a while' for authorities to compile evidence.

Long time coming: It took police three months to arrest Burgarello because it 'took a while' to compile the evidence. Sparks Police Department Sgt Aaron Leary announced the arrest in a Tuesday press conference

He was arrested during a traffic stop, and is being held without bail at the Washoe County Jail.

The victim's father Richard Devine spoke with MailOnline and revealed what his son's life was like before his untimely death.

Mr Devine says his son was living with him at the time and helping re-tile his home and install a new roof.

Cody had plans to leave the day after he was murdered to visit his two young children in Phoenix, Arizona.

Mr Devine believes one of his grandkids is in grade school, and that Cody was divorced from the mother. The two were on good terms, he says.

As for Burgarello, Mr Devine believes 'justice will be served' when he goes to trial, and he plans to attend the hearings.

He believes Burgarello should have called police, instead of coming into the home armed, but he doesn't have a strong opinion on gun control laws.

'Bad guys are gonna get guns' he said.
