A new set of stamps featuring characters from Alice in Wonderland is set to go on sale today to mark the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll's classic children's book.

The set features 10 scenes including the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and Alice herself.

Award-winning illustrator Grahame Baker-Smith was commissioned to design the stamps and to coincide with the launch, Royal Mail has collaborated with children's publisher Walker Books to create a book based on the stamp artwork.

Royal Mail has commissioned a new set of stamps featuring characters from Alice in Wonderland to mark the 150th anniversary of the Lewis Carroll book

The story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, tells the story of a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world 

Andrew Hammond, director of stamps and collectibles at Royal Mail, said: 'The story of Alice in Wonderland remains a perennial favourite of children, and indeed adults, around the world.

'It is fitting that in its 150th anniversary year it is celebrated with a wonderful set of stamps featuring striking images that do justice to such an iconic tale.'

The story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which was originally entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, tells the story of a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world.

It is thought that the character of Alice may have been based on Alice Liddell, who struck up a friendship with Lewis Carroll when he was a don at Oxford

The character White Rabbit is described as being always late in the books, so it is apt that he is the face of the new second class stamp

The story of Alice and the Cheshire Cat, pictured, was written down as a Christmas gift by Carroll to Alice in 1864

The story came about as a result of a friendship between Carroll, while he was a young don at Christ Church in Oxford, and the children of the dean of the college, one of whom was Alice Liddell.

Originally a story made up to entertain the children on a boat trip, Alice asked for it to be written down, which Carroll eventually did as a Christmas gift in 1864, complete with his own illustrations.

Last year it was revealed that the original handwritten, illustrated manuscript will travel to the U.S. as part of the story's 150th anniversary.

As well as the new set of stamps, the original manuscripts of the book will travel to the U.S. as part of the story's 150th anniversary later this year 

Royal Mail has also collaborated with children's publisher Walker Books to create a book based on the stamp artwork

The British Library confirmed that it will loan the book to libraries in New York and Philadelphia as well as displaying the original manuscripts in late 2015 

The British Library confirmed that it will loan the book to New York's Morgan Library and Museum as well as the Rosenbach Museum of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

The British Library also will display the book in late 2015 as part of an exhibition marking the anniversary since its 1865 publication.

The library also plans a major exhibition next year marking the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.
