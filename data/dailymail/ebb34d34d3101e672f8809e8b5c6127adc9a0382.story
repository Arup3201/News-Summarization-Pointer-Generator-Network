Baroness Thatcher was this afternoon cremated at Mortlake Crematorium in South-West London.

After a reception for the guests at her ceremonial funeral, the body of the former Prime Minister was driven from St Paul's Cathedral to the suburban district.

Her ashes are due to be interred next to those of her beloved husband Denis, who died in 2003, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Crowd: Well-wishers lined the route and applauded the arrival of the convoy in Mortlake

Following the spectacular 
funeral at St Paul's, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh joined the 
stateswoman's family to watch her coffin loaded into a hearse and taken to the Chelsea hospital in 
preparation for her final journey.

Relatives then moved on to a reception at the Guildhall to thank the funeral guests for their attendance.

After
the reception ended, Lady Thatcher's coffin left Central London - 
roughly four hours after the conclusion of the funeral service.

The vehicle was accompanied by police motorcyclists en route to Mortlake.

The convoy drove west through Central London, and crossed Putney Bridge on its way to the suburb in the Borough of Richmond.

Dozens of onlookers lined the street and applauded as the coffin entered through the crematorium gates, which were guarded by two police officers.

Another two police officers saluted as the hearse went into the grounds, followed by two Jaguar cars and a Range Rover.

Two coaches carrying guests had arrived at the crematorium half an hour earlier, for a private service before the cremation.

Lady Thatcher's ashes will eventually be buried with those of Sir Denis, under a marble slab in the grounds of the famous hospital.

Other well-known figures to have been cremated at Mortlake Crematorium include comedian Tommy Cooper, actor Michael Redgrave and political journalist Robin Day.

Earlier, Lady Thatcher received an affectionate farewell from the British people during a funeral with full military honours at the nation's best-known cathedral.

The service, which was planned by the former Tory leader herself before her death, featured well-known hymns as well as readings by her granddaughter Amanda and David Cameron.

Her coffin was driven from the Palace of Westminster to the church of St Clement Danes, then transferred to a gun carriage for the journey to St Paul's.

Lady Thatcher died last Monday at the age of 87 following a series of strokes.
