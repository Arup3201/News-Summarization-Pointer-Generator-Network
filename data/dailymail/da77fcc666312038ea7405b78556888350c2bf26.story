A girl born with a curved spine spent years defying expectations to become a model - before finally giving it up after realising focusing on looks is superficial.

Ayesha Jones, 24, suffers from scoliosis and was told by her doctor she would be a 'pretty girl with an ugly back' without invasive surgery.

But Ms Jones, from Birmingham, decided to prove the doctor wrong by working hard to become a successful model without undergoing the risky operation to correct her spine.

Ms Jones was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 13. She was advised to have an invasive operation to put a metal rod into her back, but opted for more holistic treatments such as back exercises

Though she was working as a model, one designer turned away Ms Jones even though she had travelled miles down to London, because he said her back was unsightly

However, when a designer brutally made her leave a photo shoot because he thought her back was unsightly, Ms Jones quit modelling to become a visual artist.

She realised that focusing on superficial looks is not healthy, and through her art and photography, wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it's OK to have a curved back.

Ms Jones said: 'Looking back, modelling was a way to prove that I was beautiful. I didn't want the doctor's remarks to come true.

'I worked my socks off to become a model and put all my efforts into proving that, in spite of my back, I was just as hot as everyone else.

'But I came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy, I'm good.

'I want to inspire other young women to do something meaningful rather than just want to look attractive for a living.'

When Ms Jones was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 13, when on holiday in Saint Kitts in the West Indies, her mother noticed her right shoulder blade was poking out more than the left from the back.

When she finally had the spinal fusion operation at age 21 it was because her back had become painful, not for cosmetic reasons

Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape.

Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not handing properly and back pain.

Pain usually only affects adults with the condition.

In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.

In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000.

It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis.

It is more common in women than in men.

Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows.

However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing.

Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine.

In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain.

After the diagnosis was confirmed back in the UK, doctors told her she would need a 'spinal fusion' - a major operation to put a metal rod in her back.

She said: 'When I was diagnosed with scoliosis, the doctor was quite forceful and patronising and wanted me to have the 'spinal fusion' surgery.

'But it didn't feel right putting my body through such an invasive procedure. I was still growing and it just didn't feel like the right time to be having spinal fusion.

'Also, the pain had not set in yet and my scoliosis was only a cosmetic issue for me.

'But the doctor told me that if I didn't have the surgery I would be "a pretty girl with an ugly back". I was hurt but replied: "No, it's not going to be ugly, it's just going to be different".

'From that point on, I was determined not to give up. After the mean comment my doctor had made, I wanted to go and prove that I could make it as a model.

'And I wanted to try as many holistic things as I could, like exercise and therapy, to manage my condition.'

In 2003, Ms Jones went to the annual Clothes Show in Birmingham and was scouted by a top modelling agency.

She said: 'I went to the call back at the modelling agency's London offices and naively told them about my curved back.

'I heard them talking about me and expressing concern about my poking shoulder and I never heard back from them.

Ms Jones went back to university to study photography. In one of her projects she examined her struggle with her physical appearance

Through her art and photography, she wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it's OK to have a curved back

After giving up modelling, Ms Jones is now working as a visual artist and is now working with Scoliosis Association UK to inspire other sufferers that it's OK to have a curved spine

'After that, I would keep getting scouted by top modelling agencies and then rejected by agencies because of my back.'

Desperate to be considered beautiful, she began practising poses which hid her curved spine.

She said: 'I still wanted to prove the doctor wrong and I didn't want to become the 'pretty girl with the ugly back'.

'I became good at hiding my scoliosis. I learnt to pose in such a way that would make the most of my asymmetrical body. Looking back at those pictures, I was actually a magician!

'I began networking and started getting paid work all without a modelling agency. I was modelling in music videos with some big UK music artists and was modelling swimwear, too.

'It felt like I was finally sticking two fingers up to everyone who doubted me.'

But at age 19, Ms Jones travelled miles for a modelling shoot but was turned because a photographer considered her back unsightly.

She said: 'I had travelled all the way from Birmingham to London on my own for a shoot and the photographer sent me home without paying me, all because he didn't like the look of my back.

'I came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy, I'm good' she said

'They liked the look of my photographs when you couldn't see my shoulder poking out, but when they saw me in person, they were unwilling to give me a chance. It broke my heart.'

She realised her focus on looks and determination to be considered attractive was unhealthy.

She said: 'I realised that I had placed way too much importance on my looks and finally, I could see what really mattered in life.

'There was no point in modelling for me. What was the point in having nice pictures of myself in which I looked nothing like how I do in reality?

'I decided that I wanted to inspire people and do something meaningful with my time on this planet. Modelling didn't give me that.'

Ms Jones went on to study photography at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, and become a full-time freelance visual artist.

She has worked with the charity Scoliosis Association (UK) to create images for publication and is putting on an exhibition for international Scoliosis awareness month next June.

She has also published a book of her self-portraits entitled 'Imperfection', which examines her struggle with her physical appearance and identity as a woman.

When Ms Jones eventually decided to have the 'spinal fusion' surgery at age 21, it was because her back had become painful, rather than solely for cosmetic reasons.

She explained: 'I want whatever photography work I do to show that we are all beautiful exactly the way we are. Don't believe the adverts when they tell you that you need to change to be accepted.

'Scoliosis made me take the focus off my body and into myself. Once I accepted that I couldn't alter my body, I felt a lot happier in who I was. I hope I can help other scoliosis sufferers in some way.'
