Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela said Friday they were willing to grant asylum to National Security Agency intelligence leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden has asked for asylum in several countries, including Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Whereas Ortega cautiously stated his offer, Maduro spoke out against the United States and championed Snowden for telling the truth about the government's global spying programs.

'As head of state, the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden so that he can live (without) ... persecution from the empire,' Maduro said, referring to the United States.

He made the offer during a speech marking the anniversary of Venezuela's independence. It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to Venezuela's offer.

'In the name of America's dignity ... I have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to Edward Snowden,' Maduro proclaimed during a military parade marking the country's Independence Day, Reuters reported.

Venezuela and Nicaragua are the first two countries to approve NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden's application for asylum out of the 20 countries he applied to

'He is a young man who has told the truth, in the spirit of rebellion, about the United States spying on the whole world,' Maduro said.

In Nicaragua, Ortega said he was willing to make the same offer 'if circumstances allow it.' Ortega didn't say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua.

He said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden's application for asylum and that it is studying the request.

'We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world, and especially its European allies,' Ortega said.

Snowden is currently believed to be holed up in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, according to the news agency.

Russian officials have neither confirmed nor denied his presence there, though they have announced that the transit area is neutral territory. Snowden will only have crossed over on to Russian soil if he passes through the airports customs.

Even if Snowden was to accept the Latin or South American government's offers it remains unclear how he will get into the countries.

As Reuters noted, the are no direct commercial flights between Moscow and Venezuela. The most common route involves transferring in Havana and there is no word yet if the Cuban government will let Snowden pass.

Snowden's journey could prove challenging as the United States has made it clear they are monitoring the skies for his presence.

Snowden is quickly running out of options for asylum as Iceland recently denied his request and Russian authorities have made it clear he cannot stay in the country much longer

Yesterday, Bolivan President Evo Morales's plane was grounded in Austria after it was suspected that Snowden was abroad.

Though Snowden has yet to choose a country for asylum his window to do so may be closing rapidly.

According to Reuters, the Moscow authorities have made clear they are eager to expel him from their country.

The deputy foreign minister said that Snowden will not be allowed to stay in Russia much longer as they have not granted him asylum, the news agency reports.

The 30 year-old whistle blower was also recently denied asylm in Iceland.

WikiLeaks now reports that Snowden has asked an additional six countries to take him in, though they will not reveal which countries due to 'attempted US interference,' Reuters reports.

This new report brings the total number to 20 countries where Snowden has applied for asylum.
