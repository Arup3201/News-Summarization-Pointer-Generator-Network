Ever wondered what happens when the mega-rich and famous footballers of the world that we love to watch get together for a party?

Well, judging by Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski's Instagram post, we're  missing some rather interesting sights behind closed doors when it comes to the German giants' Christmas party.

Lewandowski gave us a glimpse through the eyes of a Champions League footballer and, unless a man dressed in a giant orange balloon suit while dancing on a stage is your sort of thing, you may not be as jealous once you've seen the clip.

The Bayern Munich team were attending their annual Christmas party on Sunday evening

Bayern Munich do have every reason to celebrate, however, as they sit top of the Bundesliga approaching the winter break.

Pep Guardiola's side have already extended a seven-point gap over their nearest rivals Wolfsburg, and were treated to a lavish celebration at their annual party on Sunday.

The players turned out with friends and families at star chef Alfons Schuhbeck's theatre show, boasting cabaret, comedy and acrobatics, as well as a meal. 

Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge addressed the players and their guests in a 10-minute speech, celebrating a 'very, very good' 2014 for both club and country.

'It's normally almost a given that we have problems after major tournaments,' Rummenigge said. 

'Lots of people expected it again this season. But fortunately it's turned out differently. Our performances and the work put in by the coaches is unbelievable.'

'The last three or four years have been an unbelievable experience.'
