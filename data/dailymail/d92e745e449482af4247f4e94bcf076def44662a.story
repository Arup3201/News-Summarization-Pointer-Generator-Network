A photograph forgotten for almost 80 years could hold the key to solving the mysterious disappearance of Amelia Earhart.

The picture, taken immediately before the legendary aviator launched her ill-fated attempt to circumnavigate the globe from Miami in June 1937, shows a distinctive patch of aluminum bolted to the side of her Lockheed Model 10 Electra.

Not seen in any other photographs of the plane, the metal plate appears to match a piece of aluminum recovered from a remote Pacific Island in 1991 - raising the possibility that she perished as a starving castaway having survived a terrifying crash-landing.

Revelation: This picture shows a metal plate has covered the specially designed navigational window about two thirds of the way down the fuselage

Prominent Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie believes that the photograph proves the metal plate he found 23-years ago on Gardner Island was from Earhart's plane after it was bolted onto the side as a repair for a smashed window.

Indeed, the picture which was recovered from the vaults of The Miami Herald, is the only one in existence to show the apparent aluminum covering, which Gillespie believes was installed after Earhart suffered a rough landing.

Convinced, Gillespie's forensic analysis of the plate he found in 1991 revealed it was made from the same type of aluminum commonly used in the manufacture of planes made in America in the 1930s.

However, Gillespie's theory was dismissed when it was shown that the rivet patterns on the plate did not match those used on Earhart's plane.

Tragic: Amelia Earhart leans on the propeller on the right wing engine on her airplane. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan disappeared on a flight over the Pacific Ocean in July, 1937, and neither their plane nor their bodies were ever recovered

Comparison: Amelia Earhart poses on her 'flying laboratory,' a specially fitted Lockheed Electra plane, as it nears completion in 1936. This was the plane she used for the around-the-world flight the following year that ended with her disappearance - visible on the right hand side is the special navigation window that was covered up as revealed in Miami Herald photograph

But now Gillespie says that he has been vidicated because the new picture suggests that his plate was not part of the plane, rather it was bolted into place before her departure from Miami.

If indeed, that is the case, then it challenges the accepted wisdom that Earhart crashed into the Pacific Ocean along with her navigator, Fred Noonan and died.

'The replacement of that window had to be done in Miami, at a Pan Am facility that was helping Earhart,' Gillespie told the Miami Herald.

'If we can match a rivet pattern from the repair in the photograph to a rivet pattern on the wreckage, I think it would be beyond dispute that Noonan and Earhart weren’t lost at sea, but made it to the island,' said Gillespie, the executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR).

It would conclude what has become one of the most mythical and mysterious aviation disappearances in history.

The aluminum plate brings the world closer to the resolution of this mystery, but would write a tragic final chapter.

It would mean that instead of dying instantly in a plane crash, she and her navigator suffered from exposure, thirst and disease on Gardner Island, which is otherwise known as Nikumaroro.

The specific repairs on Earhart's plane was to cover over the window specially installed in the rear of the plane.

Remote: According to Ric Gillespie Amelia Earhart lived out her days on Gardner Island - a coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles from Hawaii

It was used by Noonan to take sightings of the sun and stars for navigation in the days before GPS and satellites.

It is visible in all pictures of her plane taken in California before she started her attempt to fly around the world in May of 1937 from California.

However, in the June 1, 1937 picture held by The Miami Herald, the window is gone, replaced with the aluminum plate.

'I think the window must have been broken or compromised by the hard landing in Miami,' Gillespie.

'It wasn’t standard equipment and they found out it would take a while to replace it, so they just took it out and patched the fuselage instead.'

From Miami, Earhart carried on eastwards to Puerto Rico and onwards through South America, Africa and Asia.

He plane suffered various problems with her radio that sometimes left her unable to communicate.

Then on July 2, 1937, Earhart set off from Lae, New Guinea, headed for Howland Island, 2,600 miles away.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery claims that the skin and other items including a woman's shoe prove conclusively that Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan perished on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro while on the final leg of a round-the-world flight in 1937

Her radio antenna was damaged on take-off which was probably the reasons why she couldn't hear the Coast Guard there trying to make contact with her 19 hours later.

Instead all they heard was her increasingly distressing updates which finished with radio silence.

'We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you,' she radioed.

'We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south.'

The search for Earhart was launched almost immediately, but was hampered by the huge distances involved.

Howland is in the middle of the giant Pacific Ocean and 1,700 miles from Hawaii.

However, during the search, planes passed over a small patch of coral called Gardner Island, 400 miles from Howland and saw recent signs of habitation.

However, they put that down to the tribes of Pacific Islanders who lived there and moved on, never finding anything.

Conspiracy theories immediately sprang up about Earhart.

For years the most popular was that she had been captured by the Japanese and tortured to death as a spy.

Search: Ric Gillespie has been searching for Amelia Earhart for nearly 25-years

However, Gillespie became fixated with the idea that Earhart did not crash into the water and died, but rather she found herself on an uninhabited island.

'The key to it is her final message, where she says ‘line of position 157 dash 337,’ Gillespie said to The Miami Herald.

'That’s a line that Noonan calculated from the sunrise, running 337 degrees to the northwest and 157 degrees to the southeast. And if you follow it far enough, there are two deserted islands on it, McKeon Island and Gardner Island.'

It was then that Gillespie discovered the story of 68-year-old ex-Marine, Floyd Kilts who in 1960 gave an interview to a San Diego newspaper about his experience there in 1946 to remove a navigational device from World War II.

Kilts said a Micronesian tribesman living on the tiny island of Gardner told him that when he and others first arrived there in 1938 he found a partial human skeleton and a woman's shoes.

There was a fire pit nearby that contained the bones of small birds and fish.

The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro, or Gardner Island in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease.

Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumor claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.

More so, that meant that the search party who saw signs of habitation in 1937 and assumed they were Pacific Islanders were wrong.

Someone else had left that evidence.

Gillespie made sure to visit Gardner and in 1991 discovered the scrap of aluminum 19 inches wide and 23 inches long.

It is made from a substance called Alcoa Aluminum, better known as 24st Alclad - which was used in very nearly all American planes built in the 1930, including the Lockheed Electra.

Gillespie's excitement got the better of him when he proclaimed the scrap to be evidence of Earhart's plane.

This was quickly ruled out when it was demonstrated to Gillespie that the rivet patterns on the piece of metal do not match her plane.

However, Gillespie persisted and when he read that the plane's navigational window was replaced before they took off from Miami he set about trying to find pictoral evidence.

His problem was that most photographers took pictures of Earhart with the plane from the left hand side because that was where she preferred to fly and the window was known to be on the right hand side.

It was then that he finally found the picture in the records of The Miami Herald this week.
