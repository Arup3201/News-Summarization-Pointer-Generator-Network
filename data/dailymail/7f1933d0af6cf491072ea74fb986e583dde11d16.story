Ian Wright has returned to Brazil following the burglary at his London home during which his wife and daughters were held at knife-point.

The former Arsenal striker rushed back to the UK last week following his family’s ordeal.

But Wright made a return to ITV punditry duty during Brazil’s final group match with Cameroon on Monday night.

Ordeal: Wright had flown home last week following the burglary at his family home

Wright has spoken of the 'terrifying' moment the armed gang held a Stanley knife to his wife's throat and threatened to cut off her fingers before they fled with family possessions including the former England star's MBE.

The 50-year-old had to cut short his work for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil to look after wife Nancy, 39, and their daughters, aged four and two, following the raid on Wednesday night.

Wright went straight to a waiting car which whisked him back to his family after his 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro landed at London's Heathrow airport on Thursday lunchtime.

After rushing into his home in Queen's Park, north-west London, he later emerged to confirm that everyone was safe and his wife was 'feeling good that I'm back'.

Speaking to The Sun, he said the men who were wearing masks barged in after Nancy opened the door at 9.15pm.

'They threatened to cut her fingers off and even threatened to do the same to the children, who were both upstairs in their bedrooms.

'Nancy was praying the children wouldn't wake up.

'It would have been devastating for them to see what was happening.'

According to Wright, the men were hysterically shouting at Nancy to show them where the family safe was and marched her from room to room.

When the safe was found, Nancy pleaded with the men to stop and said she would open it if they stopped pushing her around.

Wright confirmed the MBE he was given by the Queen in 2000 for services to football was taken alongside rare watches.

One of the watches was given to him by former Arsenal team-mate Dennis Bergkamp while the other was an Arsenal watch with an inscription from the club.

However, Wright said the main thing was that his family was safe.
