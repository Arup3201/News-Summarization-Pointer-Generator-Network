This incredible image shows man-made clouds released into the sky by Nasa rocket as part of an experiment to study the behaviour of wind in the ionosphere, 60 miles above the Earth.

The white 'tracer cloud', comprised of trimethyl aluminum, and the red cloud, comprised of lithium vapour, were dropped over the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean by a Nasa Terrier-Oriole sounding rocket and a Terrier-Improved Malemute sounding rocket on Tuesday at 3.39am local time.

The mission, called EVEX, for the Equatorial Vortex Experiment, allowed scientists on the ground from various locations in the Marshall Islands to observe the neutral winds in the ionosphere.

The ionosphere is a crucial layer of 
charged particles surrounding our planet.

This layer serves as the 
medium through which high frequency radio waves – such as those sent 
down to the ground by global positioning system (GPS) satellites or, 
indeed, any satellite communicating with Earth – travel.

The ionosphere 
begins about 60 miles above the ground and is filled with electrons and 
ions.

It will help scientists better understand and predict the electrical storms in Earth's upper atmosphere.

These storms can interfere with satellite communication and global positioning signals.

Preliminary reports from Nasa state that both rockets released their payloads, which were observed from various locations in the area, and all science instruments on the rockets worked as planned.

Such information could ultimately lead to the ability to accurately forecast this important aspect of space weather.

The ionosphere is a layer of charged particles surrounding our planet.

It serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves, including those sent down to the ground by global positioning system satellites, travel.

The ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is governed by Earth’s magnetic field, high-altitude winds, and incoming material and energy from the sun.

It can be calm in certain places or times of day, and quite turbulent at others.

When high frequency radio waves, such as those used for the Global Positioning System (GPS) travel through a disturbed layer of Earth's electrically charged atmosphere, the ionosphere, they can be disrupted.

'This area of the ionosphere is known for
 calm days and tempestuous nights, times when the ionosphere becomes 
rippled like a funhouse mirror, disturbing radio signals, and 
introducing GPS errors of a half mile or more,' said Nasa.

The two rockets will measure events in two separate regions of the ionosphere to see how they work together to drive the ionosphere from placid and smooth to violently disturbed.

Such information could ultimately lead to the ability to accurately forecast this important aspect of space weather.

'We’re looking at the two highest 
regions of the equatorial ionosphere, called the E- and F- regions,' 
said Erhan Kudeki, the principal investigator for the mission at the 
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

'Violent
 ionospheric storms can occur in the equatorial F-region a few hours 
after sunset and if we can better understand what causes these storms, 
we’ll be able to better mitigate their effects on communication and 
navigation systems.'
