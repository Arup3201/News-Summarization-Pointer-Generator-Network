Iraqi helicopter gunships struck suspected insurgent positions today in a Government offensive to retake the city of Tikrit from Sunni militants led by ISIS, officials said.

The Iraqi military opened its campaign yesterday to wrest back Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s hometown, with a multi-pronged assault spearheaded by ground troops backed by tanks and helicopters.

The predominantly Sunni city, a hotbed of antipathy toward Iraq's Shiite-led Government, is one of two major urban centres that fell to insurgents during their lightning offensive earlier this month.

The insurgents appeared to have 
repelled the military's initial push for Tikrit, and still controlled 
the city today, but clashes were said to be taking place in the northern
 neighbourhood of Qadissiyah.

Local
 resident Muhanad Saif al-Din said he could see smoke rising from 
Qadissiyah, which borders the University of Tikrit, where troops brought
 by helicopter established a bridgehead two days ago.

He
 added, by telephone, that many of the militants in Tikrit had deployed 
to the city's outskirts, apparently to blunt the military attack.

Military
 spokesman Qassim al-Moussawi told reporters today that the military was
 in full control of the university and had raised the Iraqi flag over 
the campus.

A provincial 
official reached by telephone confirmed that the insurgents retained 
control of most of Tikrit, and that the fighting was concentrated in 
Qadissiyah.

He also reported clashes northwest of
 the city around an air base that previously served as a US military 
facility known as Camp Speicher. The official spoke on condition of 
anonymity.

The
 Government is eager to make progress in Tikrit after weeks of 
demoralising defeats at the hands of the Islamic State and its Sunni 
allies.

The militants' surge across the vast Sunni-dominated areas that stretch from Baghdad north and west to the Syrian and Jordanian borders has thrown Iraq into its deepest crisis since US troops withdrew in December 2011.

More ominously, the insurgent blitz, which prompted Kurdish forces to assert long-held claims over disputed territory, has raised the prospect of Iraq being cleaved in three along sectarian and ethnic lines.

For embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, success in Tikrit could help restore a degree of faith his ability to stem the militant tide.

Mr al-Maliki, a Shiite who has been 
widely accused of monopolising power and alienating Iraq's Sunni and 
Kurdish minorities, is under growing pressure to step aside.

But he appears set on a third consecutive term as prime minister after his bloc won the most seats in April elections.

The
 government received a boost in its battle with the militants with the 
arrival in Baghdad last night of five Sukhoi 25 warplanes purchased 
second-hand from Russia.

The aircraft is designed to provide close air support to ground forces and to destroy mobile targets.

Iraqi air force commander Lt Gen Anwar Hama Amin said the military is ‘in urgent need of this type of aircraft during this difficult time’.

Hundreds of soldiers have been killed since the insurgent offensive began, according to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s security spokesman.

The United Nations puts the overall death toll at over 1,000, mostly civilians, since the campaign was launched on June 9.

International organisations have urged the establishment of humanitarian corridors to provide aid amid the fighting, with 1.2million people having been displaced by unrest this year in Iraq.

World leaders have insisted on a political settlement among Iraq's various communities.

And Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, revered among the country's Shiite majority, has urged political leaders to quickly form a government after parliament convenes on Tuesday.

Mr al-Maliki has acknowledged that political measures are necessary, but politicians have nevertheless cautioned that naming a new cabinet could still take a month or more.

‘These jets will enter service within a few days - the coming three or four days - in order to support the units and to fight the terrorist ISIL organisation,’ he said, referring to Al Qaeda breakaway group ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), which has spearheaded the Sunni militant offensive.

The planes could be deployed in the fight for Tikrit, a predominantly Sunni city of more than 200,000 some 80 miles north of Baghdad, where anger toward Iraq's Shiite-led government runs deep.

The Islamic State, which already controls vast swaths in northern and eastern Syria amid the chaos of that nation's civil war, aims to erase the borders of the modern Middle East and impose its strict brand of Sharia law.

In Iraq, the group has formed an alliance of sorts with fellow Islamic militants as well as former members of former dictator Saddam's Baath party, with all of them hoping to overthrow al-Maliki's Shiite-led government.

The militants have tapped into deep-seated discontent among Iraq's Sunnis, who largely dominated the country until the US-led overthrow of Saddam brought the Shiite majority to power.

Since then, Sunnis have complained of discrimination and said they are unfairly targeted by the country's security forces.
