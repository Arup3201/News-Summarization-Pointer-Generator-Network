On Wednesday the preening figure of Cristiano Ronaldo will arrive at Anfield wearing the colours of European champions Real Madrid.

If Liverpool are to emerge unscathed from a clash against Carlo Ancelotti’s team, they will need to buck up their ideas.

Here at Loftus Road Brendan Rodgers was brutal in his assessment after Liverpool recorded one of the flukiest victories in the history of the Barclays Premier League.

Four goals were scored in the final seven minutes as the game swung back and forth. Here's how the drama unfolded: 

86 mins - Liverpool lead 1-0 after an earlier Richard Dunne own goal 

87 - Eduardo Vargas scores to make 1-1

90 - Philippe Coutinho makes it 2-1 Liverpool 

92 - Vargas heads in to make it 2-2

95 - Steven Caulker own goal makes it 3-2 

QPR are entitled to feel rotten.

‘It was fortunate, we were nowhere near our capacity and it has been like that for much of the season,’ he admitted.

This was a day when Liverpool got lucky, winning when they should probably have been beaten by Harry Redknapp’s hardworking Rangers team.

For good measure Steven Gerrard, the captain of this Liverpool team, clobbered his team-mates. 

‘Everything needs improving,’ he added and it is impossible to disagree.

It certainly takes some explaining how four goals were scored in the final seven minutes of this extraordinary fixture.

Liverpool relied on two own goals, some calamitous defending and the ultra-generous timekeeping of referee Phil Dowd to string together their second successive victory.

‘The win moves us up to fifth,’ added Rodgers, but the way Liverpool have been playing of late, it needed checking just to be sure.

Rangers hit the woodwork twice in the first half through Leroy Fer and Liverpool were there for the taking. They really were.

RATINGS BY SAMI MOKBEL

They have lost their pizzazz and the aura has gone after Luis Suarez hot-footed it to Barcelona for £75million in the summer.

Instead they have Mario Balotelli, one of the most disengaged footballers that English football has ever had the misfortune to be associated with. He does Liverpool no favours.

It can only be a matter of time before one of his team-mates really gets tucked into him if he continues to play as half-baked as this.

Missing a couple of sitters from close range is just about acceptable for one of the world’s leading forwards if you’re putting in a shift. Balotelli doesn’t seem bothered.

Back to the goals, because hours of fun will be had with the Liverpool players in the video analysis room before Real Madrid arrive for their Champions League clash.

They went ahead when Richard Dunne extended his record of own goals in the Premier League to 10 after awkwardly hooking Glen Johnson’s right-wing cross beyond Alex McCarthy.

Just over 10 minutes later England’s head coach Roy Hodgson, who failed to make any attempt to communicate with Rodgers over Raheem Sterling, had seen enough.

By the time he arrived back at his new home in fashionable Chelsea and put the kettle on, four more goals had been scored. Quite bewildering.

Redknapp had sent for Eduardo Vargas, who scored twice for Chile in a friendly against Peru last week, to come off the substitutes’ bench.

His first goal for Rangers was scored in the 90th minute when he read Charlie Austin’s knockdown and rippled the back of Simon Mignolet’s net with a tidy finish.

That made it one-apiece and if Dowd had whistled there and then, everybody associated with both  teams would have gone home happy. It didn't work out that way.

Instead Liverpool raced up the other end and Philippe Coutinho, another substitute, sent a low, angled drive beyond Rangers keeper McCarthy. It was a beaut.

At times like this, for a team with the ambitions of Liverpool and plenty of experience, they should be home and hosed. Instead, they were pegged back again.

Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren, stationed in the heart of Liverpool’s defence, couldn’t live with the darting runs of Vargas.

He scored again with 92 minutes on the clock, prompting QPR chairman Tony Fernandes to celebrate in the gangways of their director’s box. Everybody was getting a hug.

Then the sickener as Sterling, decent without being at his spell-binding best, struck gold when his cross was met by the foot of Steven Caulker.

An entire stadium collectively screamed ‘no’, but his leg was already extending and he guided the ball beyond the Rangers keeper to give Liverpool this improbable victory. They nicked this.

Redknapp knew it, arriving for his post-match duties with a face like thunder after Rangers bizarrely sent the troops into Mignolet’s penalty area for Fer’s free-kick when the score was 2-2.

‘What were they doing?’ asked Redknapp and it wasn’t the moment to break the silence. ‘They thought we could win it,’ he added in exasperation.

QPR are doing their best to go straight back down, to undo all the good work after they were promoted from the Championship on that barmy day at Wembley when Bobby Zamora got their winner against Derby. 

Harry is hanging on. He had coffee with Fernandes on Friday night, paying the bill after their 20 minute chat left him in no doubt that Rangers must start to improve. Quickly.

‘Looking at the list of names mentioned for the job there’s no-one better than me to manage this team,’ declared Redknapp.

He is a wounded man, upset that his managerial integrity has been questioned after a sticky run in the opening weeks of the Premier League season.

After his, he will wonder whether his luck really has run out.
