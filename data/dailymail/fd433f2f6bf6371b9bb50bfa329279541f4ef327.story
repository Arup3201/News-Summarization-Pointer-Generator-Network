Here's an artist who's completely dotty about her work - spending months at a time constructing portraits of celebrities using paper dots made by a hole punch.

Nikki Douthwaite painstakingly arranges hundreds of thousands of tiny coloured dots to make up the incredible portraits, which can sell for five figure sums.

Ms Douthwaite, from Timperley, Cheshire, punches holes in the paper before using tweezers and glue to stick them on in a precise order - making up a host of famous faces when viewed from afar.

Marilyn Monroe, Mohammed Ali, Jimi Hendrix, Cheryl Cole and John Lennon have all been given the dot treatment - and Simon Cowell admitted he had ordered a dot portrait of himself as a gift for a friend.

Dedicated Nikki has even suffered repetitive strain injuries in her arm, hand and shoulder after spending hundreds of hours repetitively sticking dots to a canvas.

Nikki, who holds a Guinness World Record for the highest number of dots ever used in a picture, said: 'My goal is to create two experiences for the viewer.

'The first is a close up experience of either thousands of tiny, mixed up coloured dots, which in detail intrigue in themselves, but may seem chaotic and to have no order to the viewer at this distance.

'The second experience is the far away view, the viewers’ eyes and brain mix the dots and colours together, revealing the relationships of the details and the image as a whole.

'My choice of portraits comes from an interest in faces, in the biological form; bone and muscle construction, sociological, expression and individuality.

'I need complete peace and quiet to create my work, so I try to do most of my work at night, when there are fewer distractions.

'I can be sitting for hours at a time arranging the pieces, which has caused me huge problems with my shoulder.

'But the feeling I get as I see a piece develop, and when it is finally finished is enough to make sure I keep going through the pain.

'It can take several days, working up to eight hours a day, to even punch all the holes I need to begin a piece. It’s not the most exciting thing to do.

'I mix the coloured dots into tones - although the portraits look black and white from a distance, I actually use hundreds of colours, which you can see when you look at a piece close up.

'I work for up to 12 hours at a time, and I’m a meticulous perfectionist - I won’t say a piece is finished until every last dot is in the perfect place.'

Pointillism: Nikki recreated this portrait of guitar legend Jimi Hendrix using a technique inspired by post-impressionist painter Georges Seurat

Nikki’s artworks contain up to 600,000 little dots - with her biggest portrait so far measuring a staggering two metres high and three metres wide.

She created her first dot art piece more than four years ago, while studying for an undergraduate degree in art.

Nikki took inspiration from Seurat’s famous painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte, which was famously created by Seurat making tiny dots with paint on the canvas, rather than long brush strokes.

After visiting the same spot in Paris where he painted the portrait, Nikki decided to create a modern day version - using the tiny dots from a hole punch.

It took almost five months for Nikki to create the piece - which used up 587,000 dots.

She added: 'My plan was to find the spot in Paris from where Seurat painted this picture and paint whatever I found there at this time. What had changed? What would Seurat see if he were to paint this picture now, 125 years later?

'I went to Paris and found the spot by matching pictures of the original with the current landscape, and recorded my findings as planned.

'On return I found out the hole punch was invented the year he completed his painting in 1886, and he painted in dots, I found that too juicy to ignore.

'I had to work up to 17 hours a day to get it finished in time for my degree show, but it sparked a passion for this type of art which I’m still continuing to explore.'

Nikki has been working on her first 'dot art' collection for the past year which will be revealed with F1 supremos McLaren in January at the McLaren technology centre.
