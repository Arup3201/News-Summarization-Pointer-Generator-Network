A young dance troupe were stranded on a hot plane on the tarmac for hours and eventually forced to sleep in a storeroom by hotel staff after their Qantas flight from Los Angeles to Sydney was delayed.

Dance teacher Marianne Howard and the 19 performers she is chaperoning, aged 12-21, were subjected to a long ordeal which saw them stuck on a plane at LAX airport with no food, water or air con before being told their flight was cancelled, she has claimed.

The dance troupe from Village Performing Arts Centre in Sydney had been on a three-week trip to New York with Miss Universe runner up Briden Starr, 22, who was not on the flight back to Australia on Monday.

Their nightmare journey began when their first connecting plane - from NY to LA - was delayed over a fuel issue.

'We got on the plane in New York and had problems - the plane was so ridiculously old,’ Ms Howard told MailOnline.

'It took ages for them to refuel,' she added.

When they eventually arrived at LA airport at 10pm they couldn't board their next flight back home to Sydney until 3am.

'They kept saying to us we're having problems we’re trying to fix it,' Ms Howard said.

'These things happen and I'm a really reasonable person but the treatment of us has just been disgusting, absolutely disgusting,' the angry teacher added.

Once they finally boarded the plane at LA they had to wait for another three hours on the tarmac with 'no food and water' before being told the flight was cancelled.

'We sat on the plane down the back with no air con, we were absolutely cooking… my 12 year old daughter was in tears we were so hot,' Ms Howard explained.

Then their journey from hell got even worse.

'When they finally announced close to 6am that the flight was cancelled we lined up for ages to get booked on another flight…. We then all got put into hotels,' she said.

The 19 dancers were taken to a hotel in Santa Monica but when they arrived at 6.30am Qantas allegedly hadn't booked or paid for their rooms.

'We get to our hotel by this stage we are all really hungry. We hadn't had dinner and it's after 6am in the morning.

'The hotel there said "we’re really sorry we haven’t received an email from Qantas making payments".

'By this stage I had kids in tears - they were so tired and hungry,’ she explained.

'I asked “Who can we call?” and they said “I don’t know we don’t have a number”.’

Ms Howard complained: ‘They just shuttled us dropped off in the hotel, I didn’t even know who to call we were just shuttled here. ‘

The dancers didn’t have a room at first but the hotel staff said they weren’t allowed to sleep in the lobby.

'In the foyer the kids all started falling asleep. Then a man came over and said “Sorry guys but you’re messing up my foyer you’re not allowed to sleep here. If anyone falls asleep I’ll order a shuttle back to the airport”,’ she said.

The group were taken to a storeroom to sleep by the hotel staff member.

'It was like where they store tables and chairs for functions – there was no light. We were in that room for three hours,’ she added.

'We said “Please we are hungry can we get cups of tea”. They said “no you can purchase water if you like”,’ she claimed.

Ms Howard explained how the dancers were all students and didn’t have any money.

It was about 9am when Qantas finally paid and they were given rooms.

Tired and hungry, they were given $16 breakfast vouchers for the buffet which actually cost $19.50 – in the end they decided to just eat anyway.

On Monday evening, they were taken from the hotel to the airport by a shuttle at about 7pm and at last boarded their plane back to Sydney at about 10.30pm LA time.

'It’s just been fight after fight after fight. I did not speak to anyone from Qantas the entire time. I left messages. I said I needed to speak to someone urgently. The hotel said someone would call me back and to wait in the room,’ Ms Howard said.

A Qantas spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Our staff on the ground work hard to minimise the impact of significant delays. This means organising food, transport and accommodation for hundreds of passengers at the last minute.

'In this instance the delay happened at 3am, so that made alternative arrangements challenging.

'We understand as a result that some passengers had a less than satisfactory experience getting from the airport to their accommodation.

'We regret the discomfort and inconvenience caused and have apologised directly to the group affected.'

It is understood a small number of passengers reached their hotels ahead of their booking requests and experienced a delay in getting rooms allocated.

MailOnline has attempted to contact the hotel for comment but they were unable to speak at the time and said they were not aware of any incident.
