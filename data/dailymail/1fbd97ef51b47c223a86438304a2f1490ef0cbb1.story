Supporters of the three biggest clubs in Spain were not surprised to see the images of Sergio Aguero destroying Bayern Munich on Wednesday morning. Barcelona and Real Madrid fans still wish their clubs had moved for him in 2011 and Atletico Madrid supporters will never forget the way his goals got them back into the Champions League and made them believe they could mix it with the top two.

Fate has kept Aguero out of the clutches of Real Madrid and Barcelona just as injuries have kept him off the Ballon d’Or podium but no-one in Spain or in his native Argentina believes the Manchester City striker is, on his day, any less of a player than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

This season he has scored 17 of City's 38 goals - that's a greater percentage of his team's goals than both Ronaldo and Messi.

That inability to play game after game, season after season has been the only thing that has kept him a notch below La Liga’s greatest. How different things might have been in the World Cup final if Aguero had been fit to partner his old friend Messi against Germany.

Aguero and Messi’s friendship goes back to 2005 when they played at the World Youth Cup in Holland together. They were room-mates, friends and strike partners as Argentina won Olympic Gold in 2008.

The pair also became fathers around the same time and Messi’s son Thiago plays with Aguero’s boy Benjamin whenever the two get together.

Messi wanted Aguero to join him at Barcelona three years ago but Barcelona had just won the European Cup with David Villa and Pedro scoring in the final – the timing was wrong.

Aguero has a fantastic scoring record for club and country but has always been hampered by injuries

Barcelona paper Sport ran a story that summer stating Real Madrid would have signed Aguero had he switched agents and joined Jose Mourinho’s representative Jorge Mendes. Mourinho was never entirely convinced by Gonzalo Higuain, had reservations at the time about Karim Benzema and wanted the then 23-year-old Aguero.

Bernabeu president Florentino Perez was ready to break a pact with city rivals Atletico to not sign their players, such was his desire to land Aguero who believed Real were set to move for him.

The player boldly announced he was leaving Atletico but the move never transpired and Aguero ended up at Manchester City.

Perez still wants the player so many in Spain liken to Romario – bull-like strength; so difficult to knock off the ball; the most complete of finishers.

Despite his final-hour dalliance with Real Madrid, Atletico supporters will never lose their respect for Aguero. In the 2007-08 season he was La Liga’s outstanding player, taking Atletico to the Champions League for the first time in 11 years. They won the Europa League with him in 2010 a year before he left.

‘Always fight to the end,’ was Aguero’s post-match message in a tweet after he had single-handedly kept Manchester City in the Champions League.

He is best understood in his homeland as a battleship of a player who never gives in and has the character to match his talent.

This is a player who never had the luxury Messi enjoyed of turning up in Barcelona aged 12 and being allowed to gradually adapt as he moved up through the youth ranks. Aguero was thrown in at the deep end at boyhood club Independiente, making his debut as a 15-year-old.

They still love him there – the goal he scored from the halfway line in a 4-0 win over local rivals Racing Club de Avellaneda in 2005 remains many fans’ all-time favourite. They would welcome him back, as would the supporters of Atletico Madrid.

The Real Madrid faithful have not given up hope that Perez can land him next summer and there are Barcelona fans who feel, as good as Neymar is, that Aguero would have been a cheaper option back in 2011.

As Martin Samuel wrote in his match report after City's win over Bayern on Tuesday night: 'Aguero is every bit as important to them as Luis Suarez was to Liverpool last year or Gareth Bale to Tottenham Hotspur the year before.'

If he were to move on like those two, he could command a fee more than the world-record £86m Bale cost Madrid and well over the £75m Barcelona paid for Suarez. Because both those deals have been done it may be that once again neither club makes a move for ‘el Kun’.

And if destiny goes on keeping him out of the grasp of Spain’s big two, the biggest winner will continue to be Manchester City.
