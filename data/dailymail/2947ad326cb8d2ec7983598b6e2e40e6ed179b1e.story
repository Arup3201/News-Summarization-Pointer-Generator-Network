Everton have been offered Brazil striker Alexandre Pato as a possible replacement for Samuel Eto'o who has joined Sampdoria.

The 25-year-old Pato was pushed to QPR last week while Hull City have also shown an interest.

Eto'o left for Serie A, signing a two-and-a-half-year-deal with Sampdoria, having fallen out of Roberto Martinez's plans as he struggled for form and made his last appearance as a substitute in the 1-1 FA Cup draw with West Ham on January 6.

Now back in his homeland at Corinthians, Pato is on loan at Sao Paulo, having struggled with form and fitness in recent years.

Pato made his name at the San Siro during five fine years for AC Milan and was tipped as Brazil's next superstar.

His form seems to be rejuvenated this season, scoring twelve times so far for Sao Paulo, with a move to the Premier League seemingly on the cards.
