A church in upstate New York is giving away a free AR-15 assault during a raffle event later this month, as part of a bid to attract more people to its pews.

The Grace Baptist Church in Troy has been distributing fliers saying 'Win a FREE AR-15' beside a quote from the New Testament of the Bible that reads: '... my peace I give unto you ... John 14:27.'

Pastor John Koletas has defended the gun giveaway, saying it is an event honoring hunters and gun owners in the area, CBS Connecticut reported.

'The Bible is replete with defending yourself and arming yourself, and being capable of defending yourself,' Pastor John Koletas told WRGB.

Controversial: The Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, will give away a free rifle later this month. The church is a two hour drive from the town of Sandy Hook

'We’re honoring gun owners and hunters.

'And we’re being a blessing and a help to people who have been attacked, viciously attacked, by socialists and anti-Christian people — the politicians and the media.

The promotional flier says:'Does the Bible defend my right to keep and bear arms? Qualified attendee will receive a NY legally-modified AR-15 ... All giveaways are absolutely free to enter.

'Our country was built with the King James Bible and the gun.'

The Smith & Wesson M&P semiautomatic rifle, the gun manufacturer’s version of the AR-15, is being donated by a local gun shop and meets gun control restrictions found in the legislation known as the SAFE Act.

The event will take place on March 23.

Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, who represents the district and will be speaking at the service, said he thinks the raffle is completely normal.

'It’s a legal product. Churches raffle off items all the time,' he told told WNYT.

'My church has a $10,000 raffle every single year. I mean, I don’t know how it’s a controversy, quite honestly, that law-abiding, church-going citizens of New York that are legal gun owners are taking part in a raffle to raise funds for a church. I don’t know why that’s controversial.'

Free: An AR-15 assault rifle retails for between $200-$600

Strangely, the church is only about a two hour drive from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, where 20 first-graders and six staff were gunned down in December 2012.

After the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot himself.

While the rifle raffle may be new to the area, it is a common church occurrence elsewhere in the country, such as Kentucky.

According to The Los Angeles Times, Paducah's Lone Oak First Baptist Church got about 1,300 people into their church hall by giving away 25 rifles at one time.

A gun enthusiast, Chick McAlister, also gave a talk about guns and sin and Jesus.

'There's no government on the face of this Earth that has the right to take this gun from me,' McAlister told the congregation
