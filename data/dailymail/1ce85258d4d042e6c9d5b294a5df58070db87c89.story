An Arizona mother who let her three-year-old son pick out her outfits for five days as part of a fun bonding activity may have brought out her son's hidden talent for style.

Summer Bellessa, a mother of two, fashion blogger, and actress  decided to let her three-year-old son Rockwell dress her last week and posted pictures of his daring choices on her blog The Girls with Glasses.

When it became clear that Rockwell may have inherited his mother's touch for fashion,  Bellessa let her son choose one final outfit and posted a video to YouTube today of the styling session that almost has over 1,000 views.

He's done it again!: Three-year-old Rockwell chose this funky gold and polka dot outfit for his mother to wear as she runs her errands 

The short video began in mommy's closet crammed with colorful shoes and outfits to choose from.

Rockwell was immediately drawn to a pair of matching gold flats in Bellessa's closet.

Those that read Bellessa's first blog post on Babble.com might remember that Rockwell sometimes likes to pick out two different types of shoes but now he's moved on to choosing two types of skirts.

'Polka dots!' exclaims Rockwell as he tugs with his little arm on a dress in his mother's closet.

Even though Rockwell can pick out his outfits he still needs mommy's help reaching the clothing sometimes.

Rockwell's next decision is a long sequin skirt for his mother to wear under the dress. Yes, under the dress. 

Rockwell is no fashion minimalist as proved by the fact that he chooses a flower ring along with three necklace's for his mother to wear.

Bellessa explains that one of the necklaces belonged to Rockwell's great grandmother, another testament to the fact that style runs in their family.

As promised, Bellessa takes to the streets to run errands in Rockwell's choice of outfit.

Looking quirky, confident, and playful it's no surprise that Bellessa turned heads everywhere she walked. 

'I have picked out my son’s outfits almost every day of his three years on this planet. I thought it would be fun to turn the tables and let him pick my outfits out for a few days,' said Bellessa in a blog post she wrote forBabble.com posted recently.

On day one of the experiment that created a true stylist, Rockwell chose a laid back rock n' roll chic look for his mom.

'The first few items were great: my Bob Dylan tee, with a gray skirt, and tights. I think I’ll put this in my rotation. Fabulous choices, Rock,' wrote Bellessa of the conversation with her son.

When Rockwell told his mother to wear nude shoes along with black tights she was a little hesitant but took his advice anyway.

When showing the outfit to her husband later that day she expected him to laugh but he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

'I walked down the stairs to show off my outfit to my husband. I waited for a laugh, but he didn’t notice anything different,' she wrote.

On day two Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit so far which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes which she says she wouldn't have thought to wear.

Rock n' roll chic: Summer Bellessa enjoyed most of her son Rockwell's rocker outfit but was less enthused about the nude heels she normally wouldn't pair with black tights 

'These polka dotted Lula Roe leggings look great with my Mickey T-shirt. And although I wouldn’t have worn it with these shoes, it does have a fun feel to it. It’s almost like homage to Minnie,' she wrote.

Day three was a flower filled outfit that sent her son Rockwell through the roof with excitement.

'I like flowers' said Rockwell as he pointed to flowery socks and a petal patterned sundress.

'They both have flowers,' he said.

He then enthusiastically paired the outfit with pink striped shoes and a green jacket.

While Bellessa said she felt a little self-conscious walking around in her outfit that day one woman actually complimented her.

'Side note: I was a little self-conscious running my errands that day; but again, to my surprise I didn’t get one double-take or stare of curiosity. Instead, I got a woman who stopped me to tell me she liked my socks!' she wrote.

Mommy's favorite: Summer Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit on day two which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes

Day four proved to be a bit of a challenge for mother and son when Rockwell chose three shirts but no bottoms to go along with it.

'Mommy can’t go outside without any pants on,' said Bellessa.

'How about we switch one of these shirts for a pair of pants?,' she added.

Rockwell understood and chose the closest pair of pants along with two different types of leopard print shoes.

On day five, Rockwell chose his mother another pair of mismatching shoes, this time two boots: one blue and one brown.

Rockwell chose a shirt with arrows on it for his mother and desperately searched for pants with arrows on it as well but later settled for a pair of jeans.

'I guess you have to look for some pants that have arrows on them,' he told his mother with a stern face.

Tired and exhausted from choosing his mother's clothes, Rockwell was pleased it was the last day of outfit picking.

'His busy toddler schedule is packed with a lot of fun things and picking out my outfit every day was starting to take too much out of his day. When it came down to it, he’d rather be painting or riding his bike,' wrote Bellesma.

Bellessa said that the experience taught her that role reversal with children can be therapeutic.

She also said it taught her to take more risks with her wardrobe, though she may not start wearing no pants and mismatched shoes anytime in the near future.
