Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress Wednesday that officials of Qatar negotiating the release of captured Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl told the U.S. that 'time was not on our side' and a leak about the exchange would sabotage the deal.

'War is a dirty business, and we don’t like to deal with those realities, but realities they are,' he said.

He revealed that the Defense Department had been evaluating different ways to retrieve Bergdahl for years, and at one point they were considering releasing six Taliban detainees but that fell through when one of the terrorists died.

'Since the time he went missing we've been looking for ways to get him back,' Hagel said this morning during a hearing on Capitol Hill.

'This was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him.'

Saying his part: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel testified in front of the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday over questions about the prisoner swap that lead to the release of Bowe Bergdahl

Hagel testified at a House Armed 
Services Committee hearing that the decision to transfer five Guantanamo
 Bay, Cuba, detainees in exchange for Bergdahl was a tough call for 
President Barack Obama.

He 
called the five men 'enemy belligerents' who had not been implicated in 
any attacks against the U.S. and said that it was an 'extraordinary' 
situation.

'It was a very unique set of dynamics we were dealing with,' Hagel said.

One of the most tense exchange came when Republican Congressman Jeff Miller from Florida asked why Sgt Bergdahl has not been returned to the U.S. and remains in Germany for his medical treatment.

'You’re trying to tell me that’s he’s being held in Landstuhl, Germany, because of his medical condition?' Miller said.

'Congressman, I hope you’re not implying anything other than that,' Hagel responded. 

Hagel also said that Qatar has 
committed to adequate security measures that led him to decide the risks
 of the transfer were substantially mitigated.

Chairman
 Buck McKeon set the tone for the tense exchange by accusing the White 
House of breaking the law by failing to notify Congress 30 days before 
the exchange took place.

Hagel
 tersely disagreed, saying that the Justice Department had given 
reassurances that their actions- negotiating with the Taliban via Qatari
 leaders for the prisoner exchange that led to the release of Bergdahl- 
did not break the law.

'I
 know that trust has been broken. I know you have questions... I’ll tell
 you something else, I have always been straightforward, completely 
transparent with this committee. I will continue to do that,' Hagel said
 in his opening statements.

'That’s what I always demanded of any administration when I was a member of the U.S. Senate. I’ve been on your side.

Tense: Hagel said that it was important for all of the military service members serving across the globe to see that the U.S. will make every effort to rescue them if anything were to happen

'The circumstances were imperfect, but you have to make a choice, you have to make a decision.'

One such decision was agreeing to release Taliban leaders, who Hagel said 'are bad guys, there's no question that they're bad guys, of course they are'.

 know that trust has been broken'

Other questions centered on whether Bergdahl deserted and whether the U.S. gave up too much for his freedom. Administration officials have told Congress that four of the five Taliban officials will likely rejoin the fight.

'This prisoner exchange was done legally,' Hagel told lawmakers.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in advance of the hearing that Hagel was set to explain why the decision to make the trade was 'the right one.'

Kirby said the administration had a 'very small, fleeting opportunity' to secure Bergdahl's release and seized the opportunity, he said.

Kirby's description of a small window for the agreement meshed with comments by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, who told reporters Tuesday that the administration finalized the exchange only a day before it took place on May 31.

Durbin, the Senate's No. 2-ranked Democrat, also said American officials didn't learn the pickup location for Bergdahl until an hour ahead of time, making the question of advance notification irrelevant.

Critics in Congress weren't convinced: in a bipartisan 33-13 vote, the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday added a provision to a $570billion defense spending bill that barred money for the transfer of future detainees from Guantanamo.

It also withholds other funds from the Defense Department until Hagel assures lawmakers that notification rules will be respected.

'We don't negotiate with terrorists,' House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday.

'We've made America less safe, here and around the world. And we're going to pay for this.'

Although Boehner and other lawmakers voiced concerns when told more than two years ago about the possibility of the trade, the Republican told reporters he 'was never briefed on any specific negotiation.'

Obama is 'not going to get away with this one,' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican, said after a closed-doors hearing of the House on Monday.

He described the president's attitude as an 'arrogant thumbing of his nose' at Congress.

Bergdahl had been held captive since 2009 and the Taliban officials who were traded for his release had been at Guantanamo for more than a decade. Under the deal, they have to remain in Qatar for a year.
