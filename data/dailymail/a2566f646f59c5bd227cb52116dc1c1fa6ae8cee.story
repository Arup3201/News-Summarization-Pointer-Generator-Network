Ever wanted to own a Transformer? Thanks to a Japanese company, that dream is not far away.

Called 'J-deite quarter', a project to create a working quarter-scale machine that can change from a car into a robot has been completed.

Now the team have released images and video of the transformation process in full flow - with even larger versions set to follow in future.

The prototype robot was created by a collaboration involving Brave Robotics, Asratec and Takara Tommy.

Scheduled to be completed by 2020, the current robot is 4.3ft (1.3 metres) tall - but it will eventually be 16.4ft (five metres) high.

Back in August a real-life Transformer was created by scientists at the Harvard's Wyss Institute, inspired by the Japanese paper-folding art of origami.

In tests, the small shape-changing robot (pictured) folded itself into a functional machine that could walk and turn without human help.

But unlike the popular Transformers toys - robots that disguise themselves as cars and trucks - the device is not aimed at children but rather for other applications like search and rescue operations. 

Their next goal will be to create a half-scale model, 8.2ft (2.5 metres) tall, due by 2016.

The robot, which weighs 77lbs (35kg), was unveiled at the annual Digital Content Expo in Tokyo on 23 October 2014. 

It can walk on two legs at a speed of 0.62mph (1km/h), but when it changes to ‘car mode’ however, it can reach speeds of 6.2mph (10 km/h).

In the video it is seen moving its head, lifting its arms and of course changing into car mode - all in a matter of seconds.

However, when in robot mode it seems to prefer an awkward waddle, rather than walking in full stride like a real Transformer.

It is powered by something called ‘V-Sido OS’, software designed by creator Wataru Yoshizaki to allow anyone to control humanoid robots.

The team doesn’t have plans to release the robot to the public, instead only building it as a prototype.

But fans of Transformers will surely be looking forward to the finished model.
