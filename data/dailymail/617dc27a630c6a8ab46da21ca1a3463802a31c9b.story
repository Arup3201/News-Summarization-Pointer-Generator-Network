An artist has been banned by Facebook from posting images of her scientific-based work  as they were deemed 'overly sexual'.

Rebecca Harris had created a hand-stitched piece of art depicting the human body with its microbes for an exhibition titled Invisible You: The Human Microbiome for the Eden Project.

But she was stunned to be told she could not show pictures of her work on her Facebook page as the social network did not allow 'overly sexual images' that 'suggest nudity' and 'show a lot of skin or cleavage.'

Professional artist Rebecca Harris was shocked after she tried to post images of her artwork on Facebook, only to be told they breached the social network's guidelines for being 'overly sexual'

Rebecca, 37, from Launceston, Cornwall had been commissioned for the project in August last year and started work a month later.

The mother-of-three attempted to set up an advert on Facebook to promote her work but this was rejected for breaching its guidelines.

A message from 'Jane' of the Facebook ads team read: 'Your ad was rejected because the image doesn't follow our ad guidelines. Ads may not use overly sexual images, suggest nudity, show a lot of skin or cleavage, or focus unnecessarily on specific body parts. This is also applicable to the images present on your pages.

'Please make the necessary edits and recreate your posts. If it's an ad created from the create flow, you can edit it in your ads manager.'

Rebecca, who is a professional artist and has three children Nicole, 17, Zoe, 15, and Brae, 6, said she was staggered by the response.

She said: 'Needless to say I was shocked by Facebook's comments and sat looking confused at the screen for some time.

'Then I decided I must make this public, so I shared the offending image via Twitter and it soon got many, many re-tweets as others obviously agreed at how absurd this was.

'So what started as a day where Facebook would not give me any exposure to up my 'likes' to a round figure of 500 turned out to be the best exposure the work has received so far and I haven't given them a penny.

'It was merely meant to be a post to promote the page in general. I initially got a generic computer response describing it as a sexual, which I thought was quite funny at first. It was so ridiculous so I appealed and thought as soon as a human being saw the advert they would allow it go ahead.

'That was when I got the e-mail from Jane from Facebook ads, who described it as overly sexual.

'I just find the whole thing bizarre that you see some horrific things on facebook yet something like this can be censored.

'We have had the last laugh though and my work has now got more publicity than I could ever have imagined.'

The artwork 'stitching science' will play a major part in the Invisible You: The Human Microbiome exhibition at The Eden Project in May.

A spokesman for the project said: 'Invisible You: The Human Microbiome... showcases the fascinating world of the beneficial microbes that live in and on our bodies. The work is an embroidered textile hanging that represents the microbial communities of the skin and illustrates that the womb does not contain a microbial community.

'We are pleased that Rebecca's striking, thought-provoking work is due to be part of Invisible You exhibition and we're glad that it is sparking debate already.'

Facebook have yet to comment.
