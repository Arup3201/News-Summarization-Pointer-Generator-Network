The San Diego Zoo says an infant gorilla that was successfully treated for pneumonia after a cesarean section delivery is in her mother's arms for the first time.

Zoo officials say the 12-day-old female was physically introduced to her mother, Imani, for the first time Monday morning. Since then the 18-year-old Imani has been constantly cradling and carrying her baby.

The new mom began nursing 3 hours after meeting the baby. Zoo staff will monitor the baby to make sure that the newborn gorilla receives enough nutrition.

Bottle fed: The baby, shown here Wednesday, March 19, was delivered by a rare emergency cesarean section and has been receiving round-the-clock care

Nadine Lamberski, associate director of veterinary services at the park, said last week the unnamed gorilla is developing quickly and normally after undergoing surgery for a collapsed lung.

The gorilla was delivered March 12 at the zoo's Safari Park via emergency C-section.

After about 10 weeks of around-the-clock care, keepers at San Diego Safari Park introduced the adorable newborn to her gorilla family on Friday though a cage. Their first hug was Monday.

Video shows a keeper holding the unnamed girl, wrapped in a fluffy white blanket, up to Imani, who sat behind a protective barrier.

It was the first time the baby had 
visual interaction with other gorillas or even left the veterinary 
hospital since undergoing major surgery
 for a collapsed lung.

The little gorilla weighed just 4lbs 6oz when she was born with breathing problems on March 12.

Her mother had been in labor for 12 hours  - a normal stretch for human moms-to-be, but rare for gorillas.

'With gorillas, that’s very unusual,' zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons told ABCNews.com. 'Four hours is long for them.'

As her mother recovered from the prolonged labor, the infant was moved to a neonatal intensive care unit, where oxygen and fluids kept her strong through treatment for a collapsed lung and pneumonia.

Now, after being cared for and monitored in a special bedroom-like area, keepers have started the process of integrating the little gorilla with her troop.

Friday's special meeting was the first time the baby - who is now breathing on her own and slurping down milk formula - had seen other gorillas.

Keepers wanted the gorilla troop to familiarize 
themselves with the zoo's new addition through a protective barrier int eh first instance.

'Veterinary
 staff felt confident in the baby's health to release her from the 
hospital,' senior keeper Matt Gelvin told Peoplepets.com. 'Everyone is very excited to 
see the baby – very curious.'

The baby is the 17th gorilla born at the Safari Park, but Imani's first.

In good hands: Veterinarians said the C-section, although rare, was the right decision for the baby's health

Looked after: The operation was performed by the San Diego Zoo Global team, a veterinary surgeon and a neonatal specialist from UC San Diego Medical Center
