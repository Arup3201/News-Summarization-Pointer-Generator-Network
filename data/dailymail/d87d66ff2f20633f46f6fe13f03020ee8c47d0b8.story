Father of three Dan Toombs always guaranteed his children a hot reception when they got home - because he fed his family curry every day for a YEAR.

Dan, 47, began making his own Indian dishes after becoming fed up paying out for takeaways.

The family even had turkey with spices and Bombay potatoes on Christmas Day and now they love their Madras and korma treats.

The festive recipe was one of the 365 
the merchandising boss had challenged himself to cook. He even launched a
blog of his progress and now has 30,000 followers on Twitter.

Dan, who lives with his wife Caroline, 
40, and their three children Katy, 15, Joe, 13, and Jennifer, nine, claims his recipes are much healthier than takeaway versions and none of his family has put on any weight in the last year.

He was 
born in California but moved to Britain 18 years ago and developed a taste for curry while visiting takeaways and Indian restaurants near his home

Dan
said: 'It started out as a hobby but then I got to a point where I 
wanted to learn more and become better at cooking Indian food.

'My children took a while to get used to having Indian food every day but then they grew to love it.

'It's
a massive misconception that Indian food is unhealthy. When it is 
cooked in a restaurant with lots of oil and butter it is. But when 
cooked at home it is very good for you.'

Tuesday - Goan Coley Fish with green chilli chutney served with green salad.

Wednesday - Yellow squash vegetarian curry with stir-fried cabbage.

Thursday - Indian duck Curry with a Tamarind Sauce served with boiled rice or homemade naan.

Friday - Kidney bean curry served with coriander - with a starter of homemade bhajis.

Saturday - Chicken jalfrezi served with boiled rice or homemade naan.

Sunday - Masoor Dhal - a red lentil dish served with coriander.

Dan began to try and recreate the meals at home using curry cook books but was disappointed with the results.

He soon realised the British takeaway food he loved was actually far removed from the traditional recipes he was following in cook books.

Dan, who uses ingredients bought from local independent shops, launched his blog called 'The Curry Guy' and started cooking.

Throughout his challenge he learned 500 recipes, based on meals he had eaten in takeaways and not on their traditional counterparts.

He wrote them down and has now self-published 'How to make British Indian restaurant style meals'.

Dan added: 'When I first came to Britain I tasted Indian food and loved it. You can't get it in California so I had been missing out.

'I tried cooking at home but I had no idea there was a difference between traditional Indian recipes and the takeaway version.

'I
have learned a lot doing it. That was the whole idea. I have never been
to India, I just love the food, but I would love to go one day.

'Through
my blog I have been given recipes from people all over the world and 
been invited to cook with chefs at a few restaurants, so I am very 
grateful.

'My favourite 
dishes are rogan josh and the jalfrezi. They are very simple to make and
very tasty. It's been a great experience for us and my kids have even 
begun to cook too.

'They come home from school and we cook as a family, it has been great for us to spend time together.

'We
make a big batch of one particular sauce which can make several 
different curries and then during the week when we are busy dinner takes
no time at all and I have saved lots of money not going to restaurants.

'Even
though I completed my challenge we still eat Indian food three or four 
times a week. It's become a way of life and I would recommend it to 
anyone.'
