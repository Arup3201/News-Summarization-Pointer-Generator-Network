Forget the Shard, the latest plans for a skyscraper in London would not only give fantastic views of the city but these views could change every hour and a half because the building rotates.

An Italian architect has revealed the ambitious plans to create Dynamic Towers in cities around the world with separate floors that spin 360 degrees around a concrete centre every 90 minutes.

The first two are planned to be built in Dubai and Moscow with other 
cities including London, Milan, Paris, Rome, New York and Miami  on 
the cards too.

An Italian architect has designed a series of rotating skyscrapers for cities including London, Paris, Dubai and Moscow. Each floor is made of apartments that spin around a concrete centre once every 90 minutes

The brainchild behind the plans is Dr David Fisher from Florence who owns the Rotating Tower Technology Company.

He said he was inspired to create the perpetual motion skyscrapers after soaking in the view from a friend's apartment in Manhattan.

On his website he claims it is a new era for architecture: 'For the first time ever, buildings will be able to become part of life.

'Buildings will have four dimensions, adding the dimension of 'time''.  

Each of the Dynamic Towers are also designed to be self-sustaining and can generate electricity from wind and solar power.

Up to 79 wind turbines will be fitted to each floor to generate enough energy to fuel the building's electricity.

Fisher also claims that the buildings will be able to identify changes in climate and temperature and regulate energy through the building's surface.

Towers are planned for Moscow, pictured, as well as London, Dubai, Paris, Milan and New York. The 'intelligent' buildings will also be able to manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, for example

The 'intelligent' building can manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, for example.

By controlling this automatically Fisher claims it can ensure 'indoor comfort while reducing energy consumption.'

Plans for the Dynamic Towers were first unveiled in 2008 with a start date of 2010. Delays in planning permission and structural design tweaks are said to have pushed this back

'Over the next two decades our energy infrastructure will undergo changes
 similar to those which rippled through the media and telecommunication 
industries over the past twenty years. 

'Just like the cell phone 
revolution of the early 1990s, when the first generation wireless 
telecommunications quickly saturated the analog network, so too will 
digitalization pervade the purchase, generation, transportation and 
usage of all sorts of energy.'

Dr. Fisher's Rotating Tower project is innovative in design and architecture, but also recognizes environmental care and industrial production process as key points in the city of the future.

The plans were released in 2008 and Fisher planned to have the first building in Dubai completed by 2010.

However, delays in planning permission as well as structural design tweaks and problems with how the plumbing would work, for example, is said to have pushed this date back.

Although, Dr Fisher believes each floor will only take six days to assemble around the core once permission is granted and the concrete structures are in place.

Each of the towers have been designed with swimming pools, gardens and even lifts for cars meaning people can park outside their flats.

The 80-storey Dubai tower is expected to cost around £355million while the 70-storey Moscow tower will be developed by the Mirax Group with final costs unknown.

Details of the other towers have not been released and specific details about planning permission for all of the towers as well as expected start and completion dates have not yet been announced.

Fisher previously said that he did not want to unveil too much information because he wanted it to be kept a 'surprise.'
