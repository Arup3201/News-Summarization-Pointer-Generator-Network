Here's a solid piece of real estate, a Spanish holiday home that's been created inside a enormous chunk of rock.

The unusual property, known as The Truffle, is located in Costa de Morte and boasts stunning views of the nearby Atlantic Ocean.

The Truffle, which is meant 
to strike a blend between both a natural and man-made appearance, was 
designed by Ensamble Estudio in collaboration with designers Ricardo 
Sanz and Javier Cuesta.

The unique property was creating using the most peculiar building technique in which tonnes of concrete were poured into a hole in the ground to create a man-made chunk of rock

Its unorthodox building technique involved digging a large hole and blocking out a space inside using bales of hay. Concrete and topsoil were poured 
around bales and left to dry.

The builders repeated these steps to create an enormous rustic-looking rock beneath the soil.

After the rock was hoisted out and put into place it was split open before a cow named 
Paulina was brought in to eat through the hay bale and create an interior space - a process which took a year.

Using this method left a rustic-look effect imprinted inside the 
coastal home. The building,
 which measures 25 square meters, features minimalist decor including a 
raised platform bed, modest-sized bath, and a built-in fireplace.

The property is even equipped with a shower unit. It was created by stacking bales of hay which were covered in concrete and top soil. A calf named Paulina was brought in to eat out the hay creating the interior space
