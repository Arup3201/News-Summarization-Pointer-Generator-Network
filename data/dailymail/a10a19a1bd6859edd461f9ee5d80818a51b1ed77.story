On its website, the hotel states that the suite, which could be costing the newlyweds upwards of £40,000: 'This single magnificent suite has stunning views of the 12th century castle and ornate gardens to the back of the hotel.

'It features all the lovely touches of luxury found in the Staterooms and Grand Suites.

'The Presidential suite is ideal for entertaining with a separate sitting room, an anteroom generous enough to host a cocktail reception and a dining room all serviced by a dedicated elevator so that meals may be delivered directly from the kitchen below.'

It also has 103 bedrooms and suites, many of which have sweeping views of the 18th-century parkland and lakes.

The hotel website adds: 'The 18th century classic manor house lies adjacent to the ruins of an 800 year old castle originally built by The Knights Templar under Richard Earl de Clare, known as Strongbow.

'The Resort is nestled in 220 acres of mature landscape, with meandering streams, parklands and a tranquil lake that is abundant with wildlife and gardens that include a reconstruction of the historical, classical parterre beds.'

Nearby attractions include the Fota Wildlife Park, Old Jameson Distillery and numerous picturesque fishing villages overlooking the Atlantic sea.

However, 
the weather forecast is typically rainy for the next week so the couple 
may find they are limited in the attractions they chose to visit.

Mr
 and Mrs West are also rumoured to be bringing their wedded bliss to the
 capital Dublin for at least one of their days on the Emerald Isle.

Kim and Kanye, along with their personal assistants and bodyguards, are then said to be jetting back to the States on Friday.

Tourism chiefs in Ireland are aiming to cash in on reports of one of the world's most famous couples honeymooning in the country.

Marketing director Mark Henry said: 'We're working hard to produce a guide for their fans about where they are, or rather where they might be.

'We'd love to be able to give their millions of followers the information so maybe they can follow in their footsteps. It's a global story.'

When news first emerged of the superstar arrival, Mr Henry posted on his Twitter account: 'A big welcome to Ireland @KimKardashian and @kanyewest from all of us at @TourismIreland - we're working to improve the weather right now...'

Tourism Ireland is hoping to run a potentially massive and lucrative marketing blitz by using a guide of places to visit to connect with just a fraction of the couple's millions of followers.
