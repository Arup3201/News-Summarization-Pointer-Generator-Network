It was the childhood home of Henry VIII but has become just as famous for its more recent colourful residents, who turned Eltham Palace into an Art Deco haven.

The wealthy Courtauld family held luxury cocktail parties for royals and politicians in the 1930s, with millionaires Virginia and Sir Stephen planning their travels using maps on the walls, decorating the rooms with lavish accessories and even transforming the house's air raid bunker in the basement.

The palace is set to reopen to the public in April, following a £1.7million renovation, which is part of a larger conservation programme.

From April 3, visitors will be transformed back to the swinging 1930s at the Eltham Palace, formerly owned by the Courtauld family

The £1.7million renovation is set to uncover many of the secrets held at Eltham Palace, including the peeling back wallpaper to reveal the wealthy Courtauld's travel plans

The residence was once home to Henry VIII and has played host to many royals, politicians and artists since. Gold mosaic tiles and a marble tub (right) formed what was once used as a temporary but luxurious bathroom

Five rooms in the Art Deco palace will be unveiled, including a luxury wartime bunker and 1930's dark room, and a billiards room

The Courtaulds were from a wealthy textile background, and amongst the first to embrace aviation as a means of travelling the world.

Visitors will be able to experience the magnificent entrance hall, as well as the luxury air raid shelter that the couple installed in the basement, and see the splendid Medieval Great Hall.

Children can also enjoy the launch with a fully interactive tour exploring the animals who resided at the palace – including Mah Jongg the family's pet lemur who had his own heated bedroom.

Laura Houliston, English Heritage curator at Eltham Palace, said: 'Eltham Palace is one of the finest examples of art deco architecture and design surviving in Britain today.

'It was also a decadent, fun place to visit.

'This April we'll open up new rooms, the ropes will come down and we'll be inviting people to step back in time and experience one of the Courtauld's lavish parties as they try on vintage inspired designs, play in the billiards room and watch cinefilm of the family.'

Historians agree that the Eltham Palace had many state-of-the-art modern conveniences for its time, including under-floor heating

From April 3, guests will be whisked back into the time of the swinging 1930s and will be able to also enjoy the brand new visitor's centre and greenhouse café next to the children's play area.

The renovations are one of the first of the £52 million conservation projects to be undertaken by the English Heritage Trust, a charity which will oversee more than 400 sites, including Stonehenge and Hadrian's Wall.

The charity has been given a £80 million fund by the government, but aims to be self-funding by 2023. 

There will also be a unique 1930's map room full of plans to exotic locations, which was formerly hidden under decades of wallpaper

Digital handsets will be provided along with visual guides to each room as well as cinefilm and original photography of the family

A new children's guide will also be available, telling the story of the Palace's exotic animals, such as Mah Jongg the lemur

During the renovation, the Palace will remain open to the public on Sundays as normal during winter. The new rooms open on April 3

The renovations are one of the first by the English Heritage Trust, a charity which will oversee more than 400 sites, including Stonehenge

As part of the £1.7 million renovation at Eltham Palace, the Rock Garden will be replanted and the Quadrant Rose Garden will be redone

Also being revealed in March will be adjoining bedrooms occupied by Virginia's nephews, complete with one of the first residential showers

Also open in April for guests of all ages to enjoy are the new visitor centre and greenhouse café next to the children's play area

Historical artefacts, from a very early vacuum cleaner (left) to some publications from the time (right) will also be on display
