When he was coming through the ranks at Manchester United, staff at their Carrington training base talked in hushed tones about having found the next Paul Scholes.

With electrifying feet, surging pace and an eye for the outrageous, Ravel Morrison had it all.

These were staff who had seen them all. Ryan Giggs, Scholes, Eric Cantona and the like - but still the Wythenshawe-born starlet raised eyebrows. 

Ravel Morrison looks set to leave West Ham after failing to break into Sam Allardyce's first-team plans

The 21-year-old has been loaned out to QPR, Birmingham and Cardiff during his time at the Hammers

Harry Redknapp said he was considering bringing Morrison back to QPR as he was 'his last chance'

Age: 21

Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester

Position: Midfielder

Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014)

Career appearances: 81

Career goals: 14 

From early on his behaviour away from the pitch, however, was rumoured to be as colourful as his performances on it.

Throughout secondary school, teachers at St Anthony's Catholic College, a 10-minute drive from Old Trafford where Tyler Blackett also studied, had already grown exasperated with him.

Concerns were raised that the gifted teenager was hanging with the wrong crowd, older boys who were no strangers to Greater Manchester Police.

Those fears were confirmed when, at 16 (and after Sir Alex Ferguson had described him as 'the best talent I've ever seen'), he was in a car stopped in a drugs and guns bust in nearby Whalley Range.

By that time he had also picked up a caution for assaulting his mother.

Still, stirred by his ability, United tried to make it work. Coaches spent hours trying to put him on the straight and narrow – at one point there were even suggestions he had moved in with a senior first-team player.

Morrison was part of the Manchester United side which won the FA Youth Cup in 2011

They thought his talent made it worth it. But with every tricky sidestep forward came two back. In May 2011, shortly after Morrison scored twice in an electrifying performance as United's youngsters won the FA Youth Cup, he was fined £600 for throwing a girlfriend's phone out of a window during an argument.

That episode came after he narrowly avoided jail for witness intimidation and, amid rumours his agent had asked for a bumper new contract, Sir Alex had finally reached the end of his tether.

The Scot, however, would also not give up on him. With some sympathy for a less than ideal upbringing he thought that if he could get Morrison away from Manchester he might have a chance. A call was made to old friend Sam Allardyce.

'Fergie told me about his talent and that was it,' Allardyce explained after paying £650,000. 'That’s enough for me. He said: "If you can sort this lad out, Sam, you’ll have one of the best players you’ve ever had". I don’t need anything more than that do I?' 

Big Sam, who immediately admired Morrison's raw talent, believed he needed regular first-team football and sent him to Championship outfit Birmingham City.

But problems followed him back up the M6. Shocked at his attitude to training, manager Lee Clark considered cutting the loan spell short but decided not to and was rewarded with a string of stunning displays.

Enthused by his revival in the Midlands, Allardyce believed the troubled youngster was at last maturing. When he waltzed through the Spurs defence to seal a 3-0 win at White Hart Lane the world sat up and noticed.

Allardyce called it 'genius'. Not long after, Roy Hodgson spoke of his admiration. There was even talk of a seat on the plane to Brazil, further fuelled when a clip of THAT goal in an England Under 21s training session went viral.

Fulham, whose then manager Rene Meulensteen knew him from his United days, offered £4m and were told in no uncertain terms where to go.

But again things soured. Form dipped, and with a relegation battle on his hands Allardyce sent Morrison across London and down a division to promotion-chasing QPR.

QPR went up, but it spoke volumes that in the play-off final Harry Redknapp left him on the bench.

The Englishman scored a terrific solo goal in West Ham's 3-0 win against Tottenham in October 2013

That summer, as footballers partied in bars, Morrison was behind them at Strangeways Prison after being charged with two counts of common assault on an ex-girlfriend and her mother.  

Bailed and back at West Ham, Allardyce was not happy. 

'It's not that he has to impress me as a footballer, we know about his talent,' he said. His success, he added, was a question of him leading a 'disciplined life'.

Cardiff City was the next loan stop. In November, Morrison was cleared of any wrongdoing for an alleged harassment of his ex over four years but will face trial for the alleged summer assaults in January. In South Wales, after seven appearances with no goals, Russell Slade joined the list of frustrated managers. 

For Allardyce, now eyeing Europe, enough was enough. It has now got to the stage where the Hammers are willing to cut their losses and let a 21-year-old, who has an £18m release clause in his contract, go for free.

He is currently in dispute with the club over wages after a fine for misconduct and any chance of a reconciliation appears to have passed.

‘It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent wasted,' said Allardyce. 'In Ravel’s position, the talent is there, he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.'

As revealed by Sportsmail, talks have opened with Lazio.

A move to Italy would have to wait until the summer though as Morrison has played in two countries - England and Wales - this season and FIFA don't allow a third. 

A renaissance in Rome? Not many in Manchester, London, Birmingham or Cardiff would bet on it.
