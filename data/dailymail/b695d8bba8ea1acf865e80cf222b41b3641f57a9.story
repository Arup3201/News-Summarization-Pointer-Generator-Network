The wife of an ex-Lehman Brothers hotshot who is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife inside their lavish Manhattan co-op, has testified against her husband in his assault trial.

David Milberg, 50, who was vice president at the failed bank and now runs a private investment firm, is on trial for attempted assault after the alleged incident in April of this year.

The violent fight between finance exec David Milberg, 50, 
and his wife of 16 years, Melinda, occurred while their 14-year-old 
daughter was home, Melinda said.

‘He let out an almost animalistic 
grunt and sunk his teeth into my flesh,’ Melinda Milberg testified at  Manhattan Supreme Court. 
‘He started to grind his teeth into my flesh and then he released his 
bite.’

Armed: Melinda Milberg, 50, said when cops arrived she told them her husband David had bruised her arm and forehead, tore a nail and bit her arm. David confessed to cops. 'I fell into a trap, this is what she wanted'

During testimony in Manhattan Supreme Court, Mrs Milberg said the confrontation 
continued in their spacious apartment on West End Avenue on Manhattan’s 
Upper West Side as she desperately tried to escape her enraged husband’s
grasp.

Their teenage daughter Beverly then came into the room and yelled at her father to stop.

‘She
was screaming at him. She was yelling, ‘Dad, stop it! Dad, what the 
hell are you doing? Dad, what’s wrong with you? Dad, are you crazy?’’ 
Melinda testified.

Melinda then ‘ran into the master bedroom’ where 
David pursued her and grabbed hold of her again, yanked her hair and 
threatened her, she testified.

She said, 'he used both of his hands to forcefully push 
me onto a chair... causing bruising and substantial pain.'

Melinda
Milberg, 50, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me 
by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... 
causing my hair to come out of my head.'

‘He gritted his teeth and uttered: ‘I
am going to kill you! I am going to kill you!' And gestured at me with 
his hands and got right in my face,’ Milberg said

The court was then played the 911 call of Mrs Milberg calling the police

‘Get away! Get away! Get away!’ she shrieked. ‘Are the police on their way? My husband’s killing me!

Prosecutors then replayed the scene to the courtroom.

‘She
sat pinned in the chair as the defendant grabbed her arm and sunk his 
teeth into her arm,’ Assistant District Attorney Timothy Duda said in 
opening arguments on Thursday morning.

In his defense, David 
Milberg’s lawyers say she provoked him and that his biting on her arm 
was simply an instant reaction after she lunged at him.

His lawyer, Celia Gordon, made it clear where Mr Milberg's position lay.

Bitter battle: Melinda Milberg, 50, said on the witness stand Thursday at Manhattan Supreme Court that her estranged husband, finance exec David Milberg, bit her in a violent confrontation at their upper West Side home in April

‘She is a vindictive liar, and it is our great pleasure to see to it that she is finally exposed,’

The banker 
allegedly admitted to police as he was arrested that he 'bit her arm' 
but insisted 'I fell into a trap. This is what she wanted.

The
couple had split in January and Mrs Milberg officially filed for 
divorce in March but were taking turns living in the Upper West Side pad
with the children until April. When not with the kids, the other spouse
would live in a hotel, Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline.

He said that on April 1, Mr Milberg had returned to his home and told his wife he was fed up with the housing arrangement.

Vindictive liar? IN this video that was shown to the court, Mrs Milberg (in green) is seen in the same gym as her husband. She told prosecutors that they were 'face-to-face' but it appears that the couple barely noticed one another

Overreaction? Soon after her husband walked by, Mrs Milberg called the cops and alerted JCC gym security. They determined that her husband was fine to be there also

During 
cross-examination, Melinda Milberg was questioned the couple’s divorce 
and her rejection of a settlement that would have given her full 
ownership of their high-priced pad, a new Mercedes, $5 million in cash, 
private school and camp tuitions for their three kids through college, 
over $100,000 in child support annually.

The court was also shown a 
video during which David Milberg walks by his wife Melinda outside the 
gym as she sorts things out on a bench.

Mrs Milberg told authorities
that her husband was ‘face-to-face’ with her at the the Jewish 
Community Center gym, but the video shows that he doesn't appear to look
in her direction.

He had been ordered by a court to stay away.

She called the police and and alerted JCC staff but her estranged husband was not arrested and was allowed to be there.

But Mr Milberg's lawyer insists his wife trumped up the accusations to win leverage in the couple's nasty, multimillion divorce case.

Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline: 'David is absolutely innocent of those absurd charges. This case is simply about a woman who has manipulated the police the District Attorney and is now trying to manipulate the courts for the sole purpose of getting money in the matrimonial case.'

He said the divorce proceedings started before Mr Milberg's arrest.

'These charges were just part of her strategy to gain leverage in her quest for money,' Mr Gottlieb said earlier this week.

Fight: In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, pictured, of which they are members

Mr Gottlieb would not say exactly how much Mrs Milberg was going for in the divorce but said it was a 'significant' sum, adding 'she has refused to settle it while the criminal case was pending.'

In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, of which they are members.

'Mrs Milberg's shenanigans and her abuse of the system has resulted in David having very little contact with the children,' Mr Gottlieb said. The kids are aged 14, 10 and eight.

David Aronson, Mr Milberg's divorce lawyer, told the New York Daily News the estranged couple could both be 'at the country club at the same time as long as Mr Milberg understands he has to stay away from his wife and not approach her and not speak to her.'

But Mrs Milberg's attorney told the newspaper that was inconceivable as the possibility of seeing their father at the posh club was 'really a frightening thought' to the couple's children.
