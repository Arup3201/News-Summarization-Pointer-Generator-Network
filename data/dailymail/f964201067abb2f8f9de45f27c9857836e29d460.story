Officials at a Reno museum say a minor explosion at the facility Wednesday afternoon was caused by a live 'tornado storm' experiment that malfunctioned, burning over a dozen people with chemicals and starting a fire.

At least 13 people- seven of them children - were affected by the demonstration mishap at the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum about 4.10pm.

Terrifying video purportedly showing the moment the chemicals - methyl alcohol and boric acid - ignited has since emerged, with numerous children sitting in front of the experiment fleeing in fear, according to KRNV News 4.

Nine of those affected were taken to hospital while the four others were treated at the scene.

The explosion is believed to have been caused by the incorrectly mixed chemicals.

The live exhibition was supposed to produce a whirling tornado effect, according to NBC.

However it instead caused what authorities described as a 'chemical flash'.

The video shows one lone female instructor conducting the experiment.

The footage was uploaded to Facebook by KRNV News 4 after a woman named Diane Thomas - who said she was in the room at the museum at the time - sent it into the station.

Police have not said what degree of burns were suffered by those injured.

Reno Police officer Tim Broadway said the burns seemed to be isolated to the arms, hands and faces of the victims.

The museum was evacuated and Hazmat officers arrived at the scene to ensure the chemicals had not contaminated the air.

A statement released by the museum Wednesday night did not elaborate on what caused the explosion.

'The Discovery would like to thank our staff for their quick response during today's incident at the museum,' the statement said, according to ABC News.

'Their actions allowed first responders to attend to museum visitors in a timely manner.
