They are notorious for targeting politicians, government agencies and multinationals.

But an off-shoot of hacking group Anonymous has turned its attention to new prey - celebrities.

Hollywood Leaks has already posted a slew of phone numbers including those of Miley Cyrus and Ashley Green and the script of new Tom Cruise musical Rock Of Ages.

The group has also posted 100 of pictures of Dancing With The Stars's Julianne Hough apparently taken from her personal account.

Its biggest exposure to date is topless photos of Gucci Gucci rapper Kreayshawn, stolen from her phone and posted on her Twitter account as she attended the MTV awards.

She is now 21 but claimed the images - sent to 300,000 of her followers - were 'private photos' taken when she was underage.

The hackers who targeted her say the pictures were actually taken when she was 20 and sent to rapper Lil B.

Hollywood Leaks emerged in the last few weeks and has been posting information on a number of sites.

The Rock Of Ages script, taken from the 
account of an up-and-coming actor, was put on Pirate Bay while phone 
numbers went on Pastebin.com, a document sharing site.

The hackers use the same tag line as Anonymous - 'We never forgive, we never forget.'

They claim to be affiliated to the group, a collective with a core of five or six people, and keep people updated about their latest scoops on a Twitter account.

On August 19, the group tweeted: 'Follow @HWLeaks for all the latest Hollywood carnage.'

'We're simply here to facilitate the free flow of information from a place which was previously overlooked,' a representative told website Gawker.

Hollywood Leaks claims to have a trove of phone numbers as well as a number of film scripts.

One hacker - identified as IAMDGKZ1 - told Gawker they had information on a well-known film director.Â 

He went on to outline how most accounts had been easy to hack as the group had been able to guess the answers to bad security questions.

Cris Judd, Jennifer Lopez's ex-husband also had his mobile phone number posted online.

'It's frustrating. It's like identity theft. But how do you stand up to people like this?' he told the New York Daily News.

'To get into someone's personal information and blast it online for pure humiliation and enjoyment, it's not right.'
