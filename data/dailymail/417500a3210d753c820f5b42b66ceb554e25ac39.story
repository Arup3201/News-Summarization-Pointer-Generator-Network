America is known as having one of the strongest economies in the world but that doesn't necessarily mean that quality of life of its citizens is also superior.

A study recently published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) measures well-being in the U.S. based on nine different factors.

Based on the OECD’s study, how’s Life in Your Region? Measuring Regional and Local Well-being for Policy Making,' 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the worst quality of life and Mississippi and Alabama were among them.

The nine factors used to determine quality of life are income, jobs, health, and access to services, environment, education, safety, civic engagement and housing.

The data isn't based on residents' opinion of well-being or being safe rather it's based on numbers.

Yahoo reports that in order to calculate health, the OECD measured mortality rates as opposed to asking them if they felt well.

Safety was measured on homicide rates as opposed to asking people whether or not they felt safe.

Additional data on state GDP comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as measured in 2013.

The state with the worst quality of life according to the data is Mississippi.

Arkansas: Per capita household disposable income was less than $25,000 last year, nearly the lowest in the nation in the state of Arkansas 

West Virginia: The mortality rate was 10.5 deaths per 1,000 people, a higher rate than in all but two other states

Despite having a large state voting rate Mississippi ranks poorly in the defining factors for quality of life.

Yahoo reports that less than 82 per cent of workers from Mississippi completed high school in 2013.

Mississippi also has some of the highest unemployment rates in the country due to the lack of education.

Unemployment leads to poverty and 24 per cent of people from Mississippi suffered from poverty in 2013 which is the highest nationwide.

Crime is also a problem in the state with 7.3 murders per 100,000 residents giving them the second highest homicide rate in the county.

Alabama is the second state rated as having the worst quality of life.

Tennessee: Just 85% of Tennessee workers had completed at least high school as of last year, worse than in many states and residents also had poor access to high speed internet 

According to the study's data only 56 per cent of their population had access to services like broadband internet last year.

Alabama residents also suffered from one of the highest poverty rates with 19 per cent of their population living in poverty in 2013.

Arkansas is the third state on the list, and like the others has extraordinarily high poverty rates.

The household income per capita was just $25,000 per year making it one of the lowest in the nation.

West Virginia is ranked number four among the states with the worst quality of life.

The health rate is very poor with a mortality rate of 10.5 deaths per 1,000 people

Also 19 per cent of their population lived in poverty last year above the national average of 15.8 per cent.

Oklahoma: Less than 53% of eligible Oklahomans voted last year, worse than in all but two other states

Tennessee ranks number five for states with the worst quality of life.

They had one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nation with just 55.7 per cent.

They also had low access to services like broadband internet and only 85 per cent of Tennessee workers completed high school.

Oklahoma is number six on the list of American states with the worst quality of life.

Only 60 per cent of the state has access to high speed internet and less than 53 per cent of residents voted last year making them one of the states with the lowest level of single engagement.

South Carolina is the seventh worst state on the list for poor quality of life.

They are one of the poorest states with households just making $25,000 per year.

South Carolina: Households had $25,055 in disposable income per capita last year, among the lowest income levels nationwide

Louisiana: There were nearly 11 murders per 100,000 people in the state in 2013, the highest homicide rate nationwide and in the worst 10% of all OECD regions

There are also high unemployment rates with an unemployment rate greater than 9 per cent.

Louisiana is the eight worst state to live in according to Wall St. 24/7.

A resident in Louisiana is not expected to live past 76-years-old.

Louisiana also has some dangerous communities. There were 11 murders per 100,000 people in 2013 making it the highest homicide rate nationwide.

New Mexico has the ninth worst quality of life compared to the other U.S. states.

The population is a low 2 million people because much of the land is uninhabitable.

The residents also have low access to services. Only 54 per cent of households had broadband internet last year.

Nearly 21 per cent of the state lives in poverty with households making just $25,000 per year.

Georgia was ranked the tenth worst state for quality of life.

More than 9 per cent of adults were unemployed last year due to their poor educational attainment rates.

Less than 85 per cent of their work force had a high school diploma in 2013.

Also 19 per cent of the state's population lives below the poverty line.

New Mexico: Nearly 21% of the population lived in poverty that year, second only to Mississippi

Georgia: Less than 85% of Georgia's workforce had at least a high school diploma in 2013, among the lowest rates in the country
