Almost 11 million of Britons who buy a frozen turkey for their Christmas dinner leave it in an unsafe place - including the garage - to defrost.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) revealed 69 per cent have been thawing their bird in unsuitable places such as the bath and the garden shed.

It has declared today National Defrost Your Turkey Day, reminding cooks that a typical large turkey weighing 11kg will take two days to thaw.

A study by the Food Standards Agency revealed 69% of Britons are thawing their frozen turkey incorrectly

Start defrosting today: A typical large turkey weighing 11kg will take two days to thaw 

Just one in four of those who bought a frozen turkey safely defrosted it in the fridge, leaving the rest putting themselves and their families at risk of food poisoning. 

The agency warned that incorrect thawing provided a platform for bacteria such as campylobacter to spread, leaving a turkey dinner that 'looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can't be seen, tasted or smelled'.

FSA head of foodborne disease Kevin Hargin said: 'We all love our turkey dinner at Christmas and this year should be no exception.

'It's the little things you do that can make a real difference. So if you make sure that your turkey is defrosted safely and in good time, you can enjoy your meal happily and safely.'

 

If your turkey is partially frozen it may not cook evenly. Harmful bacteria such as campylobacter could survive the cooking process. 

Defrosting should be done in the fridge and separated from touching other foods, with a container large enough to catch the defrosted juices. 

Work out defrosting time in advance, so you know how much time to allow – it can take at least a couple of days for a large turkey to thaw.

When you start defrosting, take the turkey out of its packaging, put it on a large dish and cover. The dish will hold the liquid that comes out of the thawing turkey.

Remove the giblets and the neck as soon as possible to speed up the thawing process. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw turkey, giblets or any other raw meat.

Before cooking, make sure there aren't any ice crystals in the cavity. Test the thicker parts of the turkey with a fork to tell whether the meat feels frozen.

Turkey (and any other poultry) is best defrosted in a covered dish at the bottom of the fridge so that it can't drip onto other foods.

Pour away the liquid that comes out of the defrosting turkey regularly to stop it overflowing and spreading bacteria. Be careful not to splash the liquid onto worktops, dishes, cloths or other food.

Bear in mind what else is you have stored in the fridge. Cooked meats need to be covered and stored higher up.

Campylobacter is the group of bacteria commonly associated with causing food poisoning. They are usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry. 

More than 3,000 cases of campylobacter were confirmed in England and Wales between late December 2013 and the start of January, according to FSA figures. 

The FSA advises that those preparing a turkey from frozen should follow the retailer's recommended defrosting time and defrost the bird in the fridge if possible or somewhere cool to slow the growth of germs.

The turkey should be covered while defrosting, either within the original packaging or in a container to hold any thawing juices at the bottom of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination.

It warns that turkey should be defrosted thoroughly as otherwise it may not cook evenly and harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process.
