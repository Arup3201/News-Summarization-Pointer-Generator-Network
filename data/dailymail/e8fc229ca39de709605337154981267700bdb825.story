This seasons longest-running transfer saga finally has a signature. Arturo Vidal was spotted putting pen to a Manchester United shirt while on pre-season tour with Juventus, as his future at the Serie A side remains uncertain.

Vidal, who is in Australia for the tour, has been linked to a move to Old Trafford all summer after the Chilean's impressive performances last term.

Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba said last week he hopes Vidal will stay at the club, despite interest from United.

Pogba insisted everyone at the club wanted the 27-year-old to stay, despite constant rumours of him being unsettled.

'We want him to stay at Juventus. For the moment he is here so we won't speak about him leaving.'
