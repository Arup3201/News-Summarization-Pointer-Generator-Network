Eva Schloss was 23 years old when her mother Fritzi married Otto Frank, making her the posthumous stepsister to Anne Frank, who had died eight years earlier in a concentration camp.

Like the Frank family, Eva and her family were discovered hiding in Amsterdam, arrested by Nazi soldiers and sent to a concentration camp when Eva was just 15.

Eva and her mother survived the notorious Auschwitz camp in Poland, her father and brother didn't.

On their return to Amsterdam Fritzi fell in love with Otto Frank, the only member of the Frank family to survive the Holocaust, and they married in 1953.

Eva Schloss, stepsister of Anne Frank, appeared on This Morning to discuss her biography, After Auschwitz

Anne and her sister Margot both died of Typhus while prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.

And once the diary was discovered in the Amsterdam house that the family spent two years hiding in, Anne became one of the most discussed victims of the Holocaust.

While the rest of the world paid tribute to the teenage storyteller years and even decades later, Eva found living in her dead stepsister's shadow incredibly difficult.

This week Eva released her second biography, After Auschwitz, which describes the good and bad influence Anne's legacy has had on her own life.

Today the 83-year-old, who now lives in London, appeared on This Morning to talk about a life spent living with a ghost.

Eva said: 'I used to know her when we
were 11 years old. She was quite different from me. I was a tomboy and 
she was already quite a sophisticated little girl.

'She liked to tell stories and she liked to be the centre of attention and have people around her.

'At
school she was called "Mrs Quack Quack" because she talked so much, 
she even got given lines to write: "I must not talk in class."'

'There were a few families that went into hiding and fortunately quite a few survived.

'Both
of our families were betrayed. In our case we knew who betrayed us. It was a Dutch nurse. it will never be known who betrayed the Franks.'

Because of coverage on 
the war by the BBC teenager Eva had heard about the 'work camps' and 
what they represented before she and her family were arrested.

But
she told This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that
she wasn't actually very scared when she was captured.

She
said: 'When we were arrested we still had hope that we might be sent to
a real work camp, because the Germans still needed workers. We were 
scared but we didn't know yet ... but once we arrived in Auschwitz, we 
knew.'

'In Auschwitz there was starvation, 
filth, illness, hard work and selection. We knew selection was happening
all of the time. When the camp doctor appeared we knew it was bad news.

'Life was so frightening, you had to be alert all the time, try to go unnoticed ... you always knew that the chance was there.'

Eva
showed Holly and Phil the tattooed number on her forearm that she was 
branded with in the camp, saying: 'This means I will always remember.'

Although
Eva believed that her mother had been murdered after she saw her 
escorted naked to the showers one day Fritzi had in fact survived and 
the two were reunited once they were freed and taken back to Amsterdam.

Talking
about how her mother came to marry Otto Frank and how she came to be 
known simply as 'Anne Frank's stepsister' Eva said: 'They were both 
alone. My mother took Otto to lectures, cooked him meals, they started 
to depend on each other.

'After
my mother married Otto I started to be introduced as Anne Frank's 
stepsister. I thought: I am still a person, I have a name and I lived 
through the same things she did. It was a difficult time... to see my 
mother so happy too when I had adored my father.

'I eventually accepted it, I thought I have a life, I have a family, I have children and Anne has nothing.'

As well as her appearance on This Morning Eva was interviewed on Radio 4's Woman's Hour show, where she told host Jenni Murray: 'The experience has faded in a way, because I have talked about it a lot. It is always with me but it's not so painful anymore.

'But the struggle to become the person that I was again after the war has been hard.

'So it is really important to tell the story that now I am really a very happy person and I know I was very lucky to survive, to get out and to have a family.'

Eva also hit the headlines last week when she defended troubled pop star Justin Bieber for leaving a written comment after a visit to the Anne Frank museum that he hoped Anne 'would have been a Belieber.'

In response to the criticism the singer received, Eva said: 'It's so childish. She probably would have been a fan. Why not?

'He’s a young man and she was a young girl, and she liked film stars and music. They make a lot of fuss about everything that is connected with Anne Frank.'
