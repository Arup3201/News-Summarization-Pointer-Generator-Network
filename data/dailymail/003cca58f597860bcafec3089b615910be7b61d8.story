A self-described pastor has been arrested and charged with child rape after his former step daughter came forward with information about prior assaults.

Randy Giulliani has been charged with aggravated sexual battery and the rape of a child after his former step daughter accused him of performing sexual acts on her eight to ten years ago.

The victim has not been identified due to the nature of the crimes and she is now 14-years-old. She said that the alleged assaults took place when she was five and six years old.

Charged: Randy Giulliani, 54, was arrested on charges of raping a child under the age of 13 and aggravated sexual assault

'The suspect was interviewed several 
times during the investigation and sufficient information was learned to
 make the arrest on Friday,' the Gallatin police department press 
release states.

Giulliani, whose current wife is not the mother of the alleged victim, was arrested on Friday in Sumner County, Tennessee.

In Tennessee, the legal definition of child rape mandates that the victim is between the age of 3- and 13-years-old. It is considered a Class A felony and must include sexual penetration of the victim.

According to WKRN-TV, the 54-year-old told the officers from the Gallatin Police Department that he was a worship leader at an unidentified church in Rutherford County.

Giulliani said that the had been a pastor for many years but has not been associated with the church for the past two years.

'He calls himself a worship leader. I don't know if hes a pastor or preacher or if he just leads people in song or anything like that,' a Gallatin Police Department spokesman told MailOnline.

He is being held at Sumner County Jail on a $200,000 bond.

His court date is scheduled for May 7.
