A man suspected of being behind a pro-Isis Twitter account has been arrested by Indian police just days after the company executive was exposed by Channel Four.

Mehdi Masroor Biswas, 24, was arrested by police this morning at his home in Belgaluru after they discovered the man's true identity.

Police are questioning him in connection with waging a war against the state over his online identity.

Biswas is accused of being behind the now-suspended pro-jihadi Shami Witness Twitter account 

Police Commissioner M N Reddi said: 'He was particularly close to the English-speaking terrorists of ISIS and became a source of incitement and information for the new recruits trying to join ISIS/ISIL.'

However, the man's father said: 'My son is not linked to any jihadi group.'

India has the world's third-largest Muslim population, yet police believe that only four Indians have flown to the Middle East for jihad, one of whom was arrested upon his return to India.

Officials say it is hard to track the number of sympathisers of the Islamic State's ideology as there is no central figure or recruiting authority.

Mehdi told Channel 4 in an interview this week that he would have liked to join the Islamic State but for his family who were dependent on him.

He regularly shared jokes, funny images and talked about superhero movies on his Facebook page, posting pictures of pizza dinners with friends and Hawaiian parties at work, the British channel said.

Biswas' Twitter account had 17,000 followers and was viewed by more than two million people a month. 

A Channel Four investigation described the account as a 'leading conduit of information between jihadis, supporters, and recruits'.
