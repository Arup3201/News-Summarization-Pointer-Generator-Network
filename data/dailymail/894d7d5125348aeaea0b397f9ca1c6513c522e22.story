These colourful sketches offer an often literal interpretation of song titles from the decade that fashion forgot.

Seven-year-old Sam, from Portland, Oregon, began drawing them after being exposed to his mother Lori Ferraro's love of Eighties music at an early age.

The nostalgic mother says that with her passion for the decade it easily infiltrated her son's lifestyle and the result is a photo series called Drawn to the '80s.

She said: 'I am obsessed with the Eighties - maybe a little too much. Movies, fashion, television, giant hair... pretty much everything makes me nostalgic for that decade.

'Sam's first favourite song ever at age two or three was Whip It by Devo, which, of course, made me crazy happy.'

Lori says that her son first began drawing songs after hearing an upbeat track on the radio. 

His sketches manage to be both literal and clever. For instance with John Waite's Missing You, he writes the entire alphabet but instead of including the letter 'U', Sam puts a question mark.

The Police's Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic is illustrated by a female magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

And Prince's Purple Rain becomes a shower of bright purple raindrops.

Lori says that her son has become almost as much as an expert as she is on the the 1980s

'We mostly listen to Eighties music at home and in the car and one day after hearing Hold Me Now by the Thompson Twins on our way to school, Sam came home and drew this for me.

'He said it was us. He went on and on how much he liked the song and wasn't it so pretty? I agreed.'

Sam's mother says that helping her son draw has become a great way for the pair to bond.  

'We started paying attention to the music that's always on in the background and Sam started drawing what he heard. 

'This was our time together. I love sitting with him and sharing something I love so much with someone I love so much.

'We put on some music and sit at the kitchen table. He always asks me the song title and when I tell him he'll usually giggle and shake his head, then he gets down to business.'

Lori (pictured) says that the drawing sessions help her and her son to spend quality time together

She added that it may be a thoughtful process but it is not a particularly lengthy one.  

'A typical song takes Sam less than five minutes to draw. 

'We sit at the kitchen table and put a something on, usually by the time the song is over he is done with the drawing. 

'But sometimes he wants to make it really detailed and he'll spend longer on it.'

When it comes to picking a favourite Lori says the more literal Sam has interpreted the song, the better.  

'There are so many that I love, especially the first few that he did when they were super-literal. 

'Like Hot For Teacher or Footloose where the foot has broken off. 

'I also think his She Blinded Me With Science is just great, people have requested that one on a T-shirt or a coffee mug.'

Having been drawing along to music for two years Sam has become quite the expert on the music from that decade.

Lori says the more literal interpretations are her favourite. Pictured: Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top

Sam's interpretation of the The Smiths Please Please Please Let Me Get What I want probably mirrors many of those desires of children his age as it includes sweets and ice cream

'His knowledge of Eighties music continues to surprise me. Yesterday we got in the car and turned on the radio and before I even heard what song was on he blurted out "Video Killed the Radio Star Mommy!"

'But my all time favourite would have to be the first one he did which was Hold Me Now by Thompson Twins.

'I will never hear that song the same way again, and I'll never not think of him in the back of the car in that little five-year-old voice asking questions about the music and talking about how pretty it was.'
