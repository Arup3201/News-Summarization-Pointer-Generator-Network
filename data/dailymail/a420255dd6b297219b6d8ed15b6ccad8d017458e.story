A series of escalating office pranks resulted in an engineer returning from a three-week holiday to find an entire lawn growing on his desk.

Charlie Harris, 32, was greeted with a swathe of lush ryegrass, planted on a bed of earth, sprouting between his computer, coffee cups and stationery.

The elaborate prank was planned by Daniel Hurlbert, 33, who carried it out with the help of colleagues at the DIY marketing company in Austin, Texas, where the pair work.

Charlie Harris, 32, of Austin, Texas, returned from a three-week holiday to find his desk turned into a lawn of lush ryegrass - a practical joke masterminded by colleague Daniel Hurlbert, 33

Bit of a surprise: The finished grass desk as it awaited Charlie on his return from holiday

How it started: The desk before Daniel and his co-conspirators laid the grass seed

Mr Hurlbert said: 'After many years of honing our pranking skills this was perhaps the best one yet.

'The idea came fairly organically - I asked the engineering team for an epic prank for Charlie, as he was going on holiday for so long.

'We bounced ideas around until eventually I said, 'he's going to be gone so long, we should just grow a lawn on his desk.'

'We immediately knew it was the right idea.'

Using artificial lighting and fast-growing grass seeds Mr Hurlbert, a senior manager at the company, managed to grow thick green turf all over the desk of Mr Harris, a software engineer.

'The grass grew extremely well even though the conditions we provided were terrible for it. It took a week for the grass to start sprouting up decently. By the second week it was really thick.Â 

When Mr Harris went on holiday, the team set to work painstakingly designing the grassy desk and buying supplies

Taking root: The first green shoots start growing on Charlie Harris's desk

'Charlie was shocked when he saw the desk, but he laughed. He was impressed by how much work we had put in.

'He kept the grass on his desk and still hasn't removed it. He claims it's fairly comfortable.'

The prank was the culmination of a series of escalating office pranks between the engineering staff at Home Improvement Leads.

'When
I went on holiday earlier this year, my team put hundreds of pictures 
of Nicolas Cage all over my office,' said Mr Hurlbert.

'To this day, I still find pictures of Nic Cage hidden in books and drawers.

'When Charlie said he wanted to go on a long vacation to Prague and Germany, I knew we had to step up our game.'

The team set to work painstakingly designing the grassy desk and buying supplies.

Work colleagues replaced all of Charlie's possessions - but on top of a newly-grown patch of grass

Watering the indoor desktop lawn and bathing it in artificial light became a part of Mr Hurlburt's daily routine

Mr Hurlbert said: 'We did some research on what types of grass would grow the fastest and we discovered that ryegrass can sprout in less than one week and would be tough enough to survive artificial lights.

'Everyone in the team chipped in some cash to buy all of the required material. I think we spent around $75.'

Watering the indoor desktop lawn and bathing it in artificial light became a part of Mr Hurlburt's daily routine.

He said: 'For two weeks, we would water the grass twice a day using a sprayer. We ran growing lights for half the day every day.'

Mr Harris said he was impressed but vowed revenge.

He said: 'I'm thinking about what kind of retaliation would be best, although working with me is probably punishment enough.

'The grass is great, actually. Everyone asks if there are ants, but there haven't been any bugs so far.

'Until recently, the grass was performing as a very comfortable wrist pad for my keyboard. It will have to go soon. Unfortunately, all grass must die.'
