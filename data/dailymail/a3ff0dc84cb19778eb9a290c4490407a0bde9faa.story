A woman in an arranged marriage was kept caged in her own home and raped and assaulted by her husband, a court heard.

During one attack the victim awoke bleeding with the accused cutting the inside for her arm and saying, 'you deserve it'.

But when she tried to escape he stepped on her foot so hard he pulled off her toenail, Cambridge Crown Court heard.

The jury at Cambridge Crown Court (pictured) heard how the defendant used to allegedly slam the victim's head against the wall so violently the neighbours could hear a thud

The victim recorded the alleged horrific domestic abuse on her smartphone in a bid to prove what her husband had done to her.

In the shocking footage the defendant is seen standing over the victim with his arms folded.

The screen then goes black when the suspected victim hides the phone and she can be heard crying out after she sustains a blow.

The defendant then allegedly says: 'Get up, get up'.

The jury was told the victim made 17 recordings in all, lasting from seconds to a minute or more.

The defendant used to slam her head against the wall so violently the neighbours could hear a thud, the court was told.

On one occasion it is also alleged he headbutted her forehead.

The defendant denies 11 charges including three of rape, four of assault and three of causing actual bodily harm (file picture posed by model)

James Barry, prosecuting, said: 'He bullied and threatened her verbally and physically. He punched and kicked her and he forced himself on her against her will.'

The woman, who can not be named for legal reasons, was married to her husband in an Asian country and met him for the first time on their wedding day.

He returned to the UK and the victim followed and they set up home in Cambridge.

and physically. He punched and kicked her and he forced himself on her 
against her will'

The defendant, who can not be named for legal reasons, was arrested after a family member raised concerns.

Cambridgeshire Constabulary found him with what they described as an old fashioned razor in his hand.

In an interview with police played to the jury, the woman said she could not work or be independent and was barred from leaving her home.

She said: 'I knew that one day he would hit me but I just didn’t know when. He finally assaulted me after an argument at our home address.

'I was scared for my personal safety and wanted to get away from him.

'His parents kept calling me fat and he wouldn’t let me go out for a walk, so I asked if I could go out to the gym. His father said: “What difference will it make? She’ll still be fat".'

The defendant denies 11 charges including three of rape, four of assault and three of causing actual bodily harm.

At an earlier hearing he admitted two further charges including putting his wife under fear of violence.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
