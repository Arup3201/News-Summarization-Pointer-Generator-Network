It's not the sort of fuss you would expect from the well-heeled residents of a sleepy market town – or a former Blue Peter presenter for that matter.

But when it comes to the might of Tesco, the people of Sherborne in Dorset aren’t taking any chances.

Out of a population of 9,350, some 8,500 people – including former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton – have joined a campaign to stop the supermarket giant building a superstore near the town.

Battle: The people of posh market town Sherborne have united in a David versus Goliath battle against a plan to build a Tesco store in their community

Polite: A protest group called 'No Thanks Tesco' has been launched. One of those backing the campaign is former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton. She is pictured with Canon Eric Woods

And even though Tesco is yet to submit
a planning application to the council, the politely named No Thanks 
Tesco group, backed by retail guru Mary Portas, has already held a 
protest march.

Hundreds took part, including Miss Singleton who carried a placard.

She said: ‘It’s incredible how many 
people have come along. I looked over my shoulder and I couldn’t believe
how many people were there.’

Tesco plans to buy a large hotel to 
the north of Sherborne and turn it into a 28,000sq ft store, employing 
200 people, with more than 200 parking spaces.

Currently the nearest Tesco outlets are six miles away in Yeovil which has a Tesco Extra and Tesco Express.

Local people argue they do not need 
another supermarket because there is a small Sainsbury’s and Co-op near 
the town centre, while shopkeepers fear they will be forced out of 
business if locals are tempted to bypass the high street in favour of 
driving to a big supermarket.

As part of the protest, several 
businesses shut on Tuesday afternoon and boarded up their windows to 
illustrate the impact a Tesco will have on trade.

Local businessman Andrew Maddock, 53, 
who owns a stationers, said: ‘If people go to Tesco for all of their 
shopping they won’t be coming to the high street.

‘It’s the same as what is happening 
all across the country, where Tesco opens a huge store on the edge of a 
town and takes away the footfall from independent butchers, bakers and 
candlestick makers.’

He added: ‘It feels like a David and Goliath situation, but we have to make a stand.

‘I don’t think Tesco has come up against this amount of opposition before they have even submitted a planning application.’

Peter Baker, co-owner of Parson’s 
Butchers in Cheap Street, said: ‘We have been here since 1840 when my 
great-great grandfather opened the shop.

‘There were four butcher shops here 30 years ago but now we are the only one left.

‘The problem is that because Tesco 
will be about half-a-mile away, people will go there, and think “I can’t
be bothered to drive to Parson’s, let’s get the meat from here today”.

‘There will be fewer people on the high street so there will be fewer customers coming in and we will end up losing business.

‘Sherborne is a very quirky and unique town and a Tesco will make it just like any other.’

Steve Oxford, 32, of Oxfords Bakers, 
said: ‘A Tesco store will pinch the high street and reduce footfall. It 
would be absolute suicide for the council to accept this.

‘Tesco aren’t really in direct competition with us but if people stop coming into town it will affect us.’

Sherborne resident Lisa Smith, 48, a 
married mother of four, said: ‘Anything that changes the fabric of the 
town and makes it less attractive to live or do business in will affect 
the quality of life here.

‘Historically, towns haven’t won in 
these battles against Tesco but I think we should remain positive and 
keep on working together. Everyone involved thinks we will win.'

Fears for independent stores: Shopkeepers boarded up their windows in protest at the plans

Peter Neal, 74, chairman of the 
Sherborne branch for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, fears the 
Tesco store would jeopardise Sherborne achieving heritage town status, 
which is vital for future tourism.

He said: ‘The gateway into the town 
would be a mighty Tesco store. We have 350 listed buildings, Sherborne 
is an incredibly historic town and that’s what people come to see. But 
the problem is the mighty Tesco tends to trample over small towns like 
ours.’

On the No Thanks Tesco website and 
under the sub-heading ‘A Little Dorset town v. Tesco PLC’ it is claimed a
recent poll showed 663 people were against the store while 43 were in 
favour.

A statement adds: ‘We cannot 
underestimate the impact Tesco would have on the very fabric of the town
centre and our way of life.’

Yesterday a Tesco spokesman said: ‘We 
are consulting with local people on our proposals and have not submitted
an application. We know many residents shop in Yeovil and would like to
offer them greater choice in Sherborne.’
