A desperate mother has been told by a top judge that her teenage son cannot live with her because she is an advocate of home schooling.

The mother-of-four, in her 50s, says her son is being 'deprived of his liberty' by being forced to attend a conventional school.

She told London's Appeal Court she had home-schooled the disabled teenager for 10 years, along with two of her other children.

A judge at the Appeal Court sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured) has told a mother her teenage son cannot live with her because she wants to home school him

But, after he was admitted to hospital as an in-patient in 2011, she was informed by Northamptonshire County Council that the boy would not be allowed to return to the family home - because her alternative stance on education was 'not in his best interests'.

She bitterly resisted the move, saying her son - referred to as 'T' in court - is desperate to come home.

But a family judge ruled earlier this year that the now 18-year-old 'lacked mental capacity to make decisions relating to his welfare'.

As a result, he was placed in residential care and enrolled as a pupil at a school 100 miles away from his family home.

Due to the judge's decision that the boy was unable to make important decisions for himself, he was entitled to no personal say on where he lived and how he was educated - despite being clever enough to study Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, his mother says.

Challenging the decision at the Appeal Court, the mother insisted her son wanted to come home and that his views should be respected.

Representing herself before top family judge, Lady Justice Black, she said her son, who has cerebral palsy, was suffering emotionally due to separation from his family as well as physically from not being cared for in the residential placement as well as he would be at home.

'I say that my son can make decisions. He can decide where he wants to live, who he wants to see and his care needs. He has a clear memory and he is an adult, not a child. At 18, he is past compulsory schooling age,' she told the judge

She added outside court that her son's intellectual gifts far outweigh his physical abilities, to the extent that he was 'studying Shakespeare last year.'

Lady Justice Black said: 'There is a question over whether the mother would enable T to obtain education.

'The mother doesn't fully support schooling and the judge had no confidence that she would ensure that T had his last year at school.

'The mother says the judge misinterpreted the Mental Capacity Act and placed too much emphasis on her son going to school.

'She argues it is wrong to force T to attend school now, after he has passed compulsory schooling age, and says that her son is being deprived of his liberty by being required to attend school, and that it is not in his best interests to do so.'

But, dismissing the mother's challenge, she added: 'The judge concluded that the education was good for him, was in his best interests and that he was happy at school. T's time at school is extremely important, educationally and socially.

'The benefits of the schooling outweigh the difficulties of the placement in his current home. To attend his current school he has to live nearby, which meant staying in his current placement, even if there were shortcomings'.

Dashing the mother's hopes of her son coming home to live with her, Lady Justice Black concluded: 'The judge was entitled to come to the conclusions that he did and I cannot identify any reasonable prospect of success on appeal.'

Outside court, the mother said she would fight on, adding: 'Home schooling is a better method to meet individual needs.

'We have home schooled him for 10 years. My son is a unique individual and his cognitive ability far outweighs his physical abilities.

'He was learning Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet last year - how does that fit in with him not having capacity to make his own decisions?'
