A sensitive debate over gay sex in India was thrown into farce today after a government lawyer urged the Supreme Court to ban it - only for the Home Ministry to quickly issue a contradictory statement hours later.

Television channels reported that the lawyer may have gotten confused and read out the wrong statement in front of the Supreme Court which reflected an old government opinion.

Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra told the court that 'gay sex is highly immoral and against social order and there is high chance of spreading of diseases through such acts,' the Press Trust of India reported.

Conflicting views: Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra initially told the Indian Supreme Court (above) that gay sex was 'highly immoral' but was quickly contradicted by the government

But the Home Ministry was forced to 
issue a clarification saying it accepts a ruling by the Delhi High Court
 in 2009 which struck down a colonial-era law making sex between people 
of the same gender punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

The
 statement said that the Cabinet had decided not to challenge the ruling
 and that the ministry 'has not taken any position on homosexuality'.

Conservative
 groups have asked the top court to overturn the lower court's order, 
and Supreme Court judges are currently hearing opinions from a range of 
people - including conservative groups and gay rights activists.

Gay
 rights activists celebrated the 2009 ruling, hoping it would be 
followed by courts across the nation and end widespread police 
harassment and lead to gradual acceptance for homosexuals in this deeply
 conservative country.

Chaos: Homosexual rights supporters take part in the Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi in 2010. Many will be left confused by today's events in which the government appeared to announce differing views on laws allowing gay sex

The high court had said that treating consensual gay sex between adults as a crime was a violation of fundamental rights protected by India's constitution.

Sex between people of the same gender had been illegal in India since the 1860s when a British colonial law classified it as 'against the order of nature'.

While actual criminal prosecutions were few, the law frequently was used to harass people.

Over the last decade, homosexuals have slowly gained a degree of acceptance in some parts of India, especially its big cities.

Many bars have gay nights, and some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. The last two years have also seen large gay pride parades in New Delhi and other big cities, including Mumbai and Kolkata.

Still, being gay remains deeply taboo in most of the country, and many homosexuals hide their sexual orientation from friends and relatives.
