Lionel Messi is hoping that his indifferent form for Barcelona this season can be turned around while playing for Argentina at the 2014 World Cup.

The world's highest paid player has been criticised for not taking his club form onto the international stage in the past but predicts a reversal in fortunes this time, according to ESPN.

The 26-year-old admitted to reporters at the Ezeiza airport that this has not been his best season - Barcelona lost their La Liga title to Atletico Madrid on the final day of the campaign and generally look a shadow of the side that was once rated the greatest in history.

No camp: Lionel Messi admits he's struggled this season as Barcelona lost their La Liga title to Atletico Madrid

'I have arrived with the national team 
and I am flipping the switch. Many times it was the opposite, I would go
 to Barcelona and play well, this time we hope the reverse is true,' he 
said

'When I get together on the pitch with my friends (on the national team) it is going to be a different story.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted the Catalan team struggled as a whole during a difficult season that also saw them eliminated from the Champions League by rivals Atletico.

'It wasn't one of my best years,' he 
said. 'I would have liked to have seen a different finish, but it was a 
little bit of a struggle for the entire team.'
