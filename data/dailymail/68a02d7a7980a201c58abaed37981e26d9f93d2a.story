Jailed: Craig O'Neill, 26, was caught at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, with his victim after her parents tracked him down through Facebook

A paedophile who groomed a 14-year-old schoolgirl with money and presents has been jailed for four years.

Craig O'Neill, 26, was caught at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, with his victim after her parents  tracked him down through Facebook.

Police also discovered a vile collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography on his home computer.

O'Neill was jailed for four years after he pleaded guilty to a series of charges including child abduction at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, yesterday. 

There was no evidence that there was any sexual contact between the pair, but Judge Potter said that O'Neill was 'very close to getting what he desired... sexual gratification'.

He said: 'I have no doubt that what you were doing that night were acts that were designed by you to encourage her.' 

O'Neill, a former chimney sweep, first connected with the girl on Facebook and the pair met twice in June 2013.

He gave her £400 in cash on the first occasion then bought her clothing, pyjamas and £100 Ugg boots in Manchester.

The girl, who cannot be named, had told her mother that she was meeting a friend at McDonald's but went to O'Neill's house that night where they drank vodka and he smoked cannabis.

Andy Smith, prosecuting, said her mother became anxious after she said she wanted to stay out and then turned her phone off.

Her mother alerted her friends and a message she had sent to one of them on Facebook revealed her location to be on O'Neill's street.

Police officers attended with her mother, but they didn't know his exact address.

The girl's parents returned shortly after 6am the next morning and knocked on doors until a neighbour pointed them in the right direction.    

Found: The schoolgirl's parents used Facebook to track her to O'Neill's home on this Manchester street

Mr Smith said O'Neill answered the door in shorts and a T-shirt and that the girl's parents recognised him from their daughter's Facebook account.

He said: 'O'Neill said he had not touched her. Her dad ran upstairs and pushed the bedroom door open. She was there. She was wearing the pyjamas he had bought her.' 

The police were alerted and O'Neill was arrested. The court heard that in interviews, he accepted that he knew she was 14.

Analysis of his computer revealed a collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography had been downloaded. 

Following the conviction yesterday, the girl's mother spoke of her terror and issued a chilling warning to parents over the dangers of Facebook.

She said: 'She knows now how dangerous the situation was. You never know who people really are on Facebook. Parents should never take their eyes off their children's computer use.

'My daughter is quiet and sensible but not very streetwise. I just cannot understand how this happened under my nose. I cannot forgive myself really.

'I now have control over my daughter's Facebook password.

'I can honestly say I had some sort of guardian angel because I had never seen the guy and I didn't know where he lived but we managed to find him.

'She is a good girl and feels a bit silly by what has happened. She has learned her lesson. She now knows how dangerous it can be to meet people through Facebook. 

'She is now going to college and to work in healthcare. The one thing I would say to any parent is to install the GPS software on your children's phone and to make sure they know about the dangers.' 

Lewis Bretts, defending O'Neill, said: 'He has shown his remorse. He understands how serious these offences are.'

O'Neill was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life and subjected to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order to monitor his activity on release.
