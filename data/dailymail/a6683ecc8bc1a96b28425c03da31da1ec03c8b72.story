A family were forced to flee their home and have it fumigated after finding hundreds of potentially deadly spiders - in a bunch of bananas.

Shocked father Jamie Roberts, 31, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, spotted white patches covering pieces of the fruit from a local shop after he put them in a bowl - but assumed this was mould.

However, upon closer inspection, he realised the fruit was infested with a spider nest - and immediately rang pest controllers who advised his family to leave their home immediately.

Scare: Jamie and Crystal Roberts with their daughter Georgiana, seven and son Joshua, eight, at their home in Hednesford, Staffordshire. The family found a nest of spiders on bananas they bought from a OneStop Store

Mr Roberts - a civil servant, who 
suffers from arachnophobia - and his wife Crystal, 30, along with their 
two children Georgina, seven, and five-year-old son Joshua, left their 
home on February 24.

Pest 
controllers spent 24 hours fumigating their home but the family were 
only allowed back three days later after the toxic vapours used to kill 
the spiders had cleared.

The
 spiders have not been officially identified but the family believe they
 could have been the world’s most poisonous Brazilian Wandering Spider.

Mr
 Roberts said: ‘It was terrifying - especially for me because I have a 
phobia of spiders. We bought the bananas from the local shop and there 
were in a fruit bowl on the window sill in the kitchen.

‘One day I picked one up because it looked mouldy because it had patches of white on it.

‘I
 knew something was wrong because then I noticed the white patches were 
all over the window sill and the curtains and I could see tiny legs and 
realised they were spiders.

‘At that point, I wasn’t too concerned
 because I thought they looked dead. I was freaked out but I started to 
sweep the patches into the bin but then they all started moving.

 because suddenly the window sill was moving with hundreds of these 
spiders'

‘It was like something out of a horror film because suddenly the window sill was moving with hundreds of these spiders.

‘My
 wife and I rang the shop where we bought them and they asked us to drop
 them round to them.  When we did they called pest control and they told
 us to get out of the house.

‘They
 said they couldn’t be sure what kind of species of spider they were 
because you can only do that when they are fully grown but they looked 
identical to the deadly Brazilian Wandering Spider.

‘We took the kids to stay with my wife’s mother while the house was fumigated.’

Mrs Roberts, who works for HM Revenue & Customs, bought the pack of bananas from the OneStop Store near their home.

She said: ‘I unpacked the bananas from the cellophane wrapper and put it in the bin so it’s possible the “queen spider” may have been in there.

‘I looked up different types of spiders 
online and found they looked identical to Brazilian Wandering Spiders - 
which are the most venomous spiders in the world.’

The family are now waiting for pest controllers to confirm whether the spiders were the deadly species.

Guinness World Records lists it as the most toxic spider on earth and its venom is said to be 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake.

Humans bitten by one can suffer an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, vomiting and eventual death. Their scientific name is ‘phoneutria nigriventer’ - the first word being Greek for ‘murderess’.

A OneStop Stores spokesman told MailOnline: ‘As soon as our
customer contacted us about this issue we took all necessary precautions,
including organising pest control to visit the house and arranging for our
customer and his family to stay in a hotel while the fumigation took place.

‘We’d like to reassure all our customers that such instances
are extremely rare and we are carrying out a thorough investigation into how
this happened.’

He added that the company wanted to make it clear that the
type of spider had not yet been identified - and a sample of the insect had
been sent to Natural History Museum experts for tests.
