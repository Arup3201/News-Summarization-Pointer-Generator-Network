This is the moment an inquisitive gorilla stunned visitors at a safari lodge by emerging from the jungle to climb onto the balcony and wander inside.

Instead of having to trek through Uganda's 'impenetrable' forest of Bwindi to glimpse the elusive and endangered primates, this young gorilla paid the tourists a visit.

Shocked Sherry McKelvie was on the veranda of the lodge when the curious creature jumped onto the wooden railing.

It sat there long enough for Sherry to grab her camera and photograph it jump down, walk across the balcony and sit down in front of the patio door where it looked at its own reflection.

The juvenile even stepped through the open door to have a peek inside before rejoining its family group in the rainforest.

The lodge is owned by Sherry's friend, Toria Evans, and she was only there to take interior pictures for a website.

Sherry, 58, said: 'These gorillas can normally only be seen if you trek through the jungle with a special permit.

'But to our absolute joy and amazement, the gorillas decided to visit us instead.

'This one juvenile wandered over from the forest as there are some tasty bushes in the grounds of the lodge that they like.

'There was a large group which included the silverback, the blackback, females and juveniles.

Rare sight: Sherry, 58, said these gorillas 'can normally only be seen if you trek through the jungle with a special permit'

'One of the young ones came up on to our veranda, admiring itself in the plate glass doors and even snuck inside for a quick inspection of the facilities.

'We had a wonderful time watching it before it returned to the bushes.

'Strangely, neither Toria or I were scared. It was the most incredible experience and we were utterly awestruck.

'It is hard to describe the feeling of being so close to these wonderful animals, they look quite scary, but they give off this amazing aura of gentleness and calm.

'The Uganda Wildlife Authority are extremely strict about people not getting too close to them but luckily this gorilla didn't know the rules.'

Sherry from Uganda, said people are expected to keep a distance of 30ft from the gorillas in the jungle.

She added: 'When they come close, one must keep completely still and never look them in the eye, especially the male as it can be seen as a challenge.

'Sometimes the little ones will get curious and come closer to feel and touch, but this is not common.'

Mountain Gorillas are incredibly endangered and it is thought there are less than 800 of them worldwide.
