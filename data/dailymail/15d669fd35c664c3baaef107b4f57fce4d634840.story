A Briton who murdered his two young children in France by slitting their throats has hanged himself in prison, authorities said yesterday.

Julian Stevenson was awaiting trial for killing Mathew, ten, and five-year-old Carla in an apparent fit of rage over a custody battle with his French ex-wife.

The 48-year-old’s body was found in a sports hall at Corbas prison near Lyon on Monday and assistant prosecutor Pascal Guinot said there was ‘no doubt’ he had taken his own life.

Now he's taken his own life: British father Julian Stevenson seen on CCTV with his two children - Mathew, 10, and Carla, 5 - in a bakery hours before he slit their throats with a kitchen knife in the French town of Lyon 

Was facing murder trial: Stevenson left the scene of his crime, near the eastern French city of Lyon, on a pair of roller skates but was later found covered in blood

Stevenson had been on remand in 
solitary confinement after admitting knifing his children in an 
alcohol-fuelled rage at his apartment in Lyon in May.

Their
 French mother, Stephanie Morlet, had arrived to see her ex-husband 
covered in blood and fleeing the scene of his gruesome crime on roller 
skates.

Inside, she discovered her children with their throats cut and collapsed in horror.

Hours
 before the tragedy, the unemployed father, who is originally from 
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was seen on CCTV buying his children sweets
 in a bakery as they clutched pink balloons.

Stevenson
 – described as a wife beater and heavy drinker – had not been allowed 
to see his children without a chaperone after attacking Miss Morlet, who
 works as an accountant, in 2010.

The
 day of the murder was the first time in three years he had brought the 
children home to his apartment without another adult being present.

Mathew
 and Carla were two of the most popular pupils at their primary school 
in rural France and renowned for being extremely close.

Tearful: Stephanie Morlet and her family took part in an emotional march in memory of the children days after their deaths

A
 picture of them hugging and smiling – giving the impression of a  
brother and sister who could not have been prouder of one another – was 
displayed at a memorial event in their village of Charantonnay, south of
 Lyon, a few days after the siblings died.

Classmates
 were in floods of tears as Miss Morlet, who is in her early 40s, walked
 at the head of a procession of 300 people carrying white roses and 
white balloons.

Neighbour
 Ahmed Benguedda said the couple had divorced ‘two or three years ago’ 
and claimed Stevenson had drinking problems and was a wife- beater.

After
 their split, Miss Morlet moved out of the apartment they had jointly 
bought and went to live in the Isere region of eastern France.

Yesterday
 the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British 
national in detention in France on December 30 2013 and we are providing
 consular assistance to the family.’

Heartbroken: Many of the 300-strong march were in floods of tears as they carried white roses and white balloons in support of the family last May

The
 children’s British grandparents, Michael and Diane Stevenson – 
Stevenson’s parents – were not at home yesterday at their address in 
Motcombe, near Shaftesbury, Dorset.

But
 in May, Mr Stevenson said: ‘We are heartbroken. We are all totally 
devastated by what’s happened. They were cracking kids. Just lovely. 
They were the best.’

The 
couple, who are in their seventies, said they were ‘crushed’ by their 
son’s crime. Mr Stevenson added: ‘We are very upset for Stephanie and 
her family, who don’t deserve this at all.

‘She has her own apartment near her family and she and the kids stayed there for quite a long while.

‘We want a message to go to them. We send them our deepest sympathies.

‘We would send a card, but we know they would just tear it up.’

Stevenson’s trial was due to begin at the end of 2014 or early 2015.

The
 French authorities are also facing questions about why a man with a 
history of violence and alcoholism was given unfettered access to the 
children.
