The Chancellor George Osborne has seen his approval ratings soar as the economy recovers. But experts have warned that a new crash could be round the corner

The world economy is as vulnerable to a financial crash as it was before the recession hit in 2007, the global bank watchdog has warned.

Soaring levels of government debt in Europe and America and easy loans in the developing world have left the global economy in the danger zone, according to the respected Bank for International Settlements.

A fresh crash could be devastating for Britain -with debt now more than double what it was in 2007, leaving the Government powerless to intervene.

In 2007, Government debt was just 36 per cent of GDP, but has since topped 75 per cent.

And despite recent falls in unemployment, the number out of work in Britain is still higher than before the recession struck.

The jobless rate has dropped to 6.6 per cent - but this remains more than half a million more than in early 2008.

Unemployment jumped from 1.6million - or 5.2 per cent - in early 2008 to a peak of 8.4 per cent or nearly 2.7million in late 2011.

But it has fallen rapidly in recent months to just under 2.2million or 6.6 per cent – its lowest level since late 2008 and well below the 7.9 per cent jobless rate the Coalition inherited from Labour.

The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements said booming economies outside Europe and America were also much more important to the global economy now - so any crash in these countries would have a bigger impact in Britain and elsewhere. 

China, Brazil, Turkey and other booming economies have seen personal debt levels soar.

Their government debt has also increased to an eye-watering 175 per cent of GDP.

But at the same time, average borrowing rates are just one per cent - encouraging people to take on even more debt.

The bank's chief Jaime Caruana told the Telegraph that easy credit in developing countries could hit their economies hard when it comes to an end.

He said: 'Markets seem to be considering only a very narrow spectrum of potential outcomes.

'They have become convinced that monetary conditions will remain easy for a very long time, and may be taking more assurance than central banks wish to give.'

He added: 'If we were concerned by excessive leverage in 2007, we cannot be more relaxed today.'

The financial sector was hit hard in the 2007 crash. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements has warned that low interest rates in developing countries pose a future risk to the global economy

A fresh global crash would hit Britain hard. Families are already mired in debt - as the above table of the top 10 most indebted British towns shows. Government debt has also soared since 2007

The bank said the 'ramifications would be particularly serious if China, home to an outsize financial boom, were to falter'.

It said: 'Time and again, in both advanced and emerging market economies, seemingly strong bank balance sheets have turned out to mask unsuspected vulnerabilities that surface only after the financial boom has given way to bust.'

Government debt in the West is even higher than in poorer, developing countries - hitting 275 per cent of GDP, up 20 per cent since 2007.
