Victim: Raja Fayad, a graduate director and expert in colon cancer, was gunned down at the University of South Carolina's Public Health Research Center

A Lebanese cancer researcher was shot and killed by his ex-wife during a murder-suicide on the University of South Carolina's campus months after he reportedly moved out of the couple's home so he could be with another woman. 

Sunghee Kwon gunned down graduate director and colon cancer specialist Raja Fayad several on Thursday afternoon in a fourth-floor office at the university's Public Health building.

Kwan then committed suicide with a gunshot to her stomach, the coroner said. A 9 mm pistol with an empty magazine was found near the bodies, State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry said. 

Kwon, 46, and Fayad, 45, were divorced a few years ago, but continued to live together until they split up for good a few months ago, Watts said. 

Kwon was still living in the couple's home near Lake Murray in Lexington County, while Fayad had moved to a long-term hotel with a family member, according to the coroner. 

Neighbors said Fayad, who completed his MD in Syria before moving to the United States, recently ended a 'stormy relationship' with a woman he was living with, described as his girlfriend.

Fathi Elsahli told The State the situation had deteriorated when he moved out to be with another woman.

Fayad and his ex are believed to have moved from Chicago, where Fayad had been teaching. She settled in August after getting a job, but then lost it, the paper reported.

Helena Sanford, who lives next door, said the Faya's ex girlfriend told her that Internet service and electricity had been cut off at the home.

She told the paper: 'It's devastating. It's a terrible waste of life.'

Fayad came to USC in 2008 from the University of Illinois-Chicago as an associate professor in the Arnold School of Public Health, according to his online biographical information. He earned his MD at Aleppo University School of Medicine in Syria in 1995.

Many students rated Fayad highly before his death, suggesting he made Exercise Science 223, a anatomy and physiology course, bearable. 

On the anonymous review site Rate My Professor Fayad earned a 4.7 on a 5.0 scale. Some of the comments included were: 'Dr. Fayad is the man. He is super laid back and loves the material he teaches. ... One of the best professors I’ve had. 

Lockdown: Heavily armed and armored police from Columbia, South Carolina swarmed the campus on Thursday afternoon after a gunman opened fire

Precautions: There was no longer any active danger almost immediately following what many reports have called a murder-suicide

Another read: 'Take this professor. He is awesome! He knows what he is teaching and seems interested in his research.' 

Much of the campus remained on a complete lockdown in the aftermath of the shooting even though police said danger from the 'very isolated' incident was over.

A perimeter was set up around the public health building, where police carrying AR-15s and wearing SWAT gear ushered students out and across the street. 

At 2:15pm, the school's Carolina Alert system sent a second message out telling students and staff there was no longer a threat.

'There was no active shooter other than the two deceased,' said State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry.

According to The State reporter Amanda Coyne, some professors even taught through the lockdown. 

The shooting happened a couple of blocks from the Statehouse and two blocks from the university's basketball arena. The street is one of the city's busiest. 

Sirens could be heard as more police officers arrived at the public health building. 

Shots fired: The University of South Carolina campus in Columbia was put on lock down and students told to shelter in place following a 1:20pm shooting Thursday

An alert was also issued to employees at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, where personnel performed security sweeps as a precautionary measure.

South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also cut short a news conference over security concerns.

Student Hayden Dunn, a senior from Myrtle Beach, said he was in the building about 1 p.m., getting in an elevator to change classes, when a police officer also got inside. 

Dunn said the officer asked whether anyone had heard gunshots, but they hadn't. Dunn said he went to class, then an alarm sounded five minutes later, and people rushed outside. Another office told him shots had been fired, he said.

'Otherwise, you wouldn't have known anything happened,' Dunn said.

The shooting occurred in or near the relatively new Arnold School of Public Health as police in SWAT gear with AR-15 secured its perimeter and ushered away students
