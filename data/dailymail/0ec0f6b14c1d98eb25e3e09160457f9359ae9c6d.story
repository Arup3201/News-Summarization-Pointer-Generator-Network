A cystic fibrosis sufferer has been struck off the books of his local surgery after posting an ‘offensive tweet’ about the staff.

Mathew Cochrane, 26, expressed his frustration on Twitter after he tried to make an appointment and was apparently told the next available slot with his specialist consultant was three weeks away.

However, he was left astonished when Stanwell Surgery, in Penarth, South Wales, responded to his ‘offensive tweet’ by striking him off its list of patients.

His case sparked an outcry on Twitter after Mr Cochrane posted a letter from the GP practice telling him to find another doctor.

The row broke out after Mr Cochrane received a letter stating that he needed to see a doctor.

The patient, who usually dealt with a specialist consultant, rang the surgery concerned something was seriously wrong.

However, a receptionist said it would be three weeks before he could have an appointment, he said.

He claims he was informed that if he wished to make a complaint, he should make it in writing.

The driving instructor, from Penarth, took to Twitter to hit out at the ‘attitude from staff’ at the practice.

In a further posting he referred to the staff as ‘t***s’.

The comments prompted a letter from the head of practice, Dr Jonathon Evans, telling Mr Cochrane that his name would be removed from the surgery's list of patients and advising him to find another GP.

Mr Cochrane posted the correspondence on site, where he wrote: ‘What happened to freedom of speech? This is truly shocking if you ask me.’
