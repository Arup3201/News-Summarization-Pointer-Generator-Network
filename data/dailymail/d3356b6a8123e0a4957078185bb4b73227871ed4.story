The parents of Justina Pelletier - the teenager 'imprisoned' by Boston Children’s Hospital for the last year have today made a desperate plea for her return exactly a year after she was 'snatched' from them.

When 15-year-old Justina was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January her family hoped she would soon be on her way home.

Instead, they say she is now desperately ill, in constant pain and barely able to move. They claim she is getting even less care than she was before.

Desperate: Justina Pelletier, 15, has now spent a year in a psychiatric ward after she was taken from her parents against their will on doctor's orders

Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was taken. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie

Justina’s Kafkaesque nightmare began exactly one year ago when she was admitted to the world-renowned hospital suffering from flu.  

Doctors from nearby Tufts Medical Center diagnosed Justina with Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle wasting illness, three years earlier. Her sister, Jessica, also suffers from it. She was put on medication with a treatment plan.

But experts at Boston's Children’s Hospital said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental illness where people 'imagine they are ill'.

When Justina’s parents Lou and Linda tried to protest, hospital staff called welfare workers, who won custody claiming they were at risk of doing her harm by giving her the treatment prescribed by Tufts doctors.

A report, written in April this year by one of the hospital's staff states how doctors took Justina off many of the medications she was taking at the time she was admitted.

'Due to concerns regarding Justina’s regressive behavior changes around her family, the multiple medical procedures and care episodes she has been through … and both parents’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans for Justina … a child protection team was convened,' it read.

Justina was locked in a psychiatric ward, taken off the medication she had been taking and only allowed to see her family once a week.

Since then, her parents have been battling the hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter.

'Today is the anniversary of when she arrived at the prison,' Lou, a financial planner, told MailOnline.

'She is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly. Last month we were hopeful she could soon be on her way home but even that hope is fading.

'Justina is hanging on but she is desperately ill and getting worse.

Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly'

We miss you: Sitting on Justina's bed at her Connecticut home are her sisters: From left, Julia, Jennifer and Jessica. Jessica, far right, has been diagnosed as having the same Mitochondrial Disease that Justina was being treated for before she was 'kidnapped' after a visit to Boston Children's Hospital with a bout of the flu. Doctors there diagnosed her with a mental condition called Somatoform Disorder instead

'Her legs are paralyzed, she has no upper body strength and she is in constant pain because they have removed most of her medications.

'She suffered a stroke when she was seven and it affected her short-term memory. She is considered learning disabled, yet she has had no education in the last year. 

'Justina did manage to sneak a few notes out of the hospital but she can’t do that anymore. She has forgotten how to write and spell.

'From what we can gather, she spends 24 hours a day lying in a room. It is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems.

'Justina doesn’t have psychiatric problems, she is ill and she needs proper medical care. Once a week she is taken on a three-hour round trip to see doctors but that is it.  

'We are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a Department of Children and Families office. Health aside, she is a mess.

'She’s in a wheelchair yet she is 
getting no help with showering or grooming. When we saw her last it was 
20 degrees outside and her hair was wet.'   

Boston Children's Hospital have rarely commented on the case, but in a statement to MailOnline they said they were 'proud' of their work and the 'positive impact on the patient'.

The hospital did not address the family's specific allegations. A gag order has been entered in a court case brought by the family.

Justina
 was diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease three years ago. Her eldest 
sister Jessica, 25, also suffers from it and both girls were being 
treated by Dr Mark Korson at Tufts Medical Center.

Ice-skating
 fanatic Justina responded well to treatment after having two surgeries 
to clear a blockage in her intestines and fit a port, so that her colon 
could be flushed out daily with a saline solution. She was also put on a
 cocktail of drugs.

Proud: The hospital thanked its staff for a 'tremendous effort' and the 'positive impact on the patient'

Fight: Justina was taken into the hospital's care against the wishes of her parents on February 14 last year. 'I am trying to save my daughter’s life,' Lou tells MailOnline. 'I don’t want her to be forgotten, lost in the system

Last February she went down with flu. Dr Korson was away and suggested she go to one of his colleagues at Boston Children’s.

She was taken by ambulance from her home in West Hartford, Connecticut, to the hospital a two-hour drive away on February 10 last year. 

The next day her parents say they were confronted by a neurologist and psychiatrist who told them Mitochondrial Disease did not exist.

'They said she had Somatoform Disorder – effectively a mental problem. They were saying it was all in her head,' says Lou, 45.  

When Linda tried to take her back to 
Tufts for a pre-arranged appointment on February 14, security guards 
were called and child welfare workers stepped in.

Since
 then Justina’s parents have been in and out of court battling to get 
her back. The next hearing is on Thursday but is closed to the 
public.

Dr Korson was 
at their side during last month’s hearing and spoke to the court but he 
is unable to comment publicly because the judge has placed a gag order 
on all of the parties.

'I am trying to save my daughter’s life,' Lou tells MailOnline. 'I don’t want her to be forgotten, lost in the system.

Suffering: Lous claimed that Justina is going through 'torture' - 'the sort of thing Kim Jong-un would be proud of in North Korea'

'She is desperately ill and we believe she isn't getting any help. Then there’s the stuff they are doing to her head, her mind.

 Justina was diagnosed with 
mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that 
affects muscle coordination and mobility.

The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy.

There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death.

Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances.

Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease.

After
 being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however 
doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a
 psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although 
there is no physical cause for it.

Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain.

Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants.Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms.

Experts
 estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. 
per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition.

'Justina is getting no treatment at all. She just lies in a room unable to move.

'Last January she was in an ice skating competition. Now she is in a wheelchair. Her lower body is pretty much paralyzed and her upper body is very weak. She is in constant pain.

'The hospital
 accused us of over medicating her yet everything we did was under her 
regular doctor’s orders. Now she has been taken off the medications that
 helped stabilize her and stop pain.

'What she is going through is torture – the sort of thing Kim Jong-Un would be proud of in North Korea. 

'If I don’t fight for Justina she will disappear into the system. We’re hanging on and fighting for her but we are running out of gas. I am battling the very powerful medical world and the child welfare system.'

Justina’s 11 months at Boston Children’s Hospital was spent in a single room on the locked psychiatric ward.

She was rarely allowed to go outside for fresh air and her phone and computer were removed.

Four friends were permitted to phone via the hospital occasionally but all of her calls were monitored. Lou says nothing has changed since she moved to the residential psychiatric unit.

'We get one 20-minute call a week,' he says. 'She can talk but the call is on speaker phone and is screened by staff. There is little we can even talk about.'

One of the most heartbreaking aspects of Justina’s plight – first revealed by MailOnline in November – came when she confided to her sister Jennifer that Children’s Hospital staff had told her she was never going home.

'We try to stay strong for Justina but 
it is getting harder and harder. And to see her health deteriorate so 
quickly and to be helpless makes it worse,' says Lou.

Fight: Lou and Linda say they try to stay strong for Justina 'but it is getting harder and harder. And to see her health deteriorate so quickly and to be helpless makes it worse'

Boston Children’s Hospital said in a statement: 'Boston Children’s would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our staff in caring for this patient. We are proud of their work and positive impact on the patient.  

'Boston Children’s and our clinicians are particularly distressed that the inaccuracies surrounding this case have caused undo concern for the many children and their families with Mitochondrial Disorders in our care.'

The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families and the Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Justina is now being held did not respond to calls for comment.
