Professor Gordon Carlson said: 'Patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them'

A quarter of patients who develop a digestive complication after surgery needlessly suffer ‘a harrowing death’ due to an NHS postcode lottery, a leading surgeon has claimed.

Approximately 600 people suffer acute intestinal failure in NHS hospitals every year, leading to 150 deaths, according to NHS surveys.

The condition usually occurs as a result of an operation on  the abdomen, such as removal of a cancer or even after appendicitis, leading to parts of the gut unexpectedly failing.

This triggers a cascade of complications, resulting in the need for intensive care. Later, patients may be discharged home but require drip-feeding and full-time personal care.

Yet everyone who had  surgery for the condition at the National Intestinal Failure Centre in Salford, Greater Manchester, has survived in the past three years, indicating that deaths are avoidable.

‘Whether or not you die of this complication is a postcode lottery,’ says Professor Gordon Carlson, consultant surgeon at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.

‘Often patients will succumb quite quickly, but others have months of harrowing illness, and one patient was in hospital for two years. It’s a horrible situation.

‘Patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them. At the moment there is a one in four chance of  a slow, painful and undignified death if you develop this problem. Our success rates show this need not be the case.’

The Salford team claim their success rate is due to a large, dedicated staff, with one consultant surgeon and two nurses to every five patients.

Rates of intestinal failure are rising steadily, due to the ageing population having more complex surgical procedures. More patients survive life-threatening illnesses but are then left debilitated.

While exact figures do not exist, acute intestinal failure is estimated to affect about ten people per million. Some 600 people are in hospital with the condition at any one time.

The National Intestinal Failure Centre treats around 220 patients at home, fed via drips, and between 20 and 25 in hospital at any one time, or about 75 a year.

The staff also includes dieticians, physiotherapists, pharmacists and psychologists.

Its treatment advances have attracted international recognition and were presented at the annual President’s Meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

There is one other intestinal failure centre in the UK, at  St Mark’s Hospital in Harrow, West London.

Treating people in such centres could also reduce costs as most patients have been in hospital for many months.

‘Although patients are often in hospital with us, that represents the end of the treatment process, and they’d otherwise be in hospital longer somewhere else and they require a significant cost and huge effort to treat,’ says Prof Carlson.

‘One patient had been in hospital for two years and the average is usually some months – plus it’s not unusual for them to have had a large number of operations before they come to us which have failed to address the problem.’

A 2008 review of treating intestinal failure recommended a network of intestinal failure centres be set up. But that has not happened.

Prof Carlson adds: ‘If you live near an intestinal failure unit you are more likely to get referred to one.’

One reason for the Salford’s centre’s low death rate is the low level of infection.

‘The ability to look after a central feeding line put into a patient’s heart over a prolonged period without it getting infected is crucial – nationally ten per cent used will lead to an infection, but  in our unit  there has not been a single infection in 15 years in any of our patients.

‘The condition is very serious but the size of team needed to get the patient through that is just not available everywhere.

‘It’s not that different to doing transplant surgery: you  wouldn’t go to your local hospital for a heart transplant, you’d go to a specialist centre.’

He says: ‘The ideal would be patients able to access that level of support and expertise within 100 miles of their own home rather than travelling from all over the UK to our centre.’

One patient saved by the Salford unit is retired salesman Paul Pringle, 65. A routine removal of a cancerous polyp in 2006 left him in hospital for nine months with intestinal failure. He developed pelvic abscesses and peritonitis, then an open wound in his stomach.

The married father-of-two from Lancashire was eventually transferred to the Salford centre and saved by a complex, 16-hour operation that removed the damaged bowel and filled in the stomach holes by taking tissue from his legs.

A spokesman for NHS  England said: ‘Commissioners are currently working with clinical experts to ensure that services across the country reflect the national standard and deliver the best possible services for all patients with these conditions.’
