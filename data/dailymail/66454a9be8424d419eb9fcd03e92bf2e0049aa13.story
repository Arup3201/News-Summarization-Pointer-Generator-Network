The number of homes where no-one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years, new figures showed yesterday.

There were fewer children living in families where nobody works even than at the height of the boom a decade ago, they said.

The rapid drop in the ranks of benefit-dependent families comes against a background of rising employment, and of welfare reforms designed to make it less lucrative to choose to live on the state rather than to work.

Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new figures that showed the number of homes where no-one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new figures as success for attempts to make work pay.

'The number of workless households has fallen by 450,000 since 2010, which means 290,000 fewer children are living in households where no one has a job,' he said.

'By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are always better off in work than on benefits, and through our employment schemes we are helping people to turn their lives around so they can secure a better future for themselves and their families.'

The Coalition's welfare reforms have come under ceaseless fire from Labour and the political left, which say changes like the 'bedroom tax' and the restriction of annual increases in benefits to below inflation have plunged large numbers of people into deep poverty.

Their arguments have been backed by the bishops of the Church of England, who point to the popularity of food banks as evidence that hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry because of benefit cuts.

But the figures showing levels of worklessness in the last three months of last year, published by the Office for National Statistics, indicate that large numbers of people are finding reason to take jobs.

There were 3,843,000 homes where no-one worked in the autumn of 2010, they said, and the numbers rose the following year, to 3,857,000 in the last three months of 2011.

However over the following 12 months numbers dropped by more than 300,000 and the new total, for the last three months of 2013, is 3,392,000, some 465,000 down on the autumn 2011 workless homes count.

In the last months of 2011 there were 284,000 families where no-one had ever had a job. That total was down to 226,000 at the end of last year, a drop of more than a fifth.

Since the autumn of 2010, the number of children living in families where no-one has a job has dropped from 1,858,000 to 1,568,000, a fall of 290,000 or more than 15 per cent.

The improvement in worklessness figures comes as the private sector of the economy continues to demonstrate its ability to create jobs at a rapid rate. The latest unemployment rate level is 7.2 per cent, down from eight per cent when the Coalition came into office in 2010.

But there is growing evidence that welfare reforms which discourage benefit dependency are having an effect.

Last year the country's most respected economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the Duncan Smith reforms, which include tax credit restrictions, a squeeze on annual benefit increases, and the 'bedroom tax' reduction in

Housing Benefit for those in bigger homes, 'will strengthen peoples' incentives to work.'

However Mr Duncan Smith's biggest test, the Universal Credit reform which will replace a range of state handouts with a new benefit designed to discourage dependency, has yet to be introduced across the country.
