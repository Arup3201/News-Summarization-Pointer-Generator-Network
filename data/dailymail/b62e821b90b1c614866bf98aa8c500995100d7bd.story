Trinny Woodall has vowed to give her 11-year-old daughter the perfect Christmas after the tragic death of her ex-husband who fell from the roof of a shopping centre.

The fashion expert's former husband Johnny Elichaoff, 55, died last month after he apparently fell from Whiteley’s shopping centre in Bayswater.

Ms Woodall, 50, who is dating art mogul Charles Saatchi, and Mr Elichaoff were married for ten years and had a daughter, Lyla, before they divorced in 2009.

The What Not To Wear presenter had remained friends with financial advisor and antiques dealer Mr Elichaoff, and was described as being 'grief-stricken' following his death.

Describing the festive season as 'poignant', she said today that she would be making sure the holiday period was as normal as possible for their young daughter. 

'My daughter’s father and I were separated, or divorced, for a few years. We were friends,' she told Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands on London Live today. 

'So it’s about making it a really great Christmas for my daughter, making it feel kind of it’s everything she wanted to look forward to.'

In her first interview since Mr Elichaoff's death, Ms Woodall said she would be spending Christmas in London with her sister. 

'A friend of mine says we’re a tiny cog in a very large wheel, so you have something that’s quite a direct personal tragedy but we’re a part of this big picture as well,' she said. 'So it’s about picking up the reins again and moving forward.' 

Although police said they were not treating Mr Elichaoff's death as suspicious, he has been linked to four other businessmen who died in unusual circumstances.

These include tycoon Scot Young, who died last week after falling four storeys from a window at his £3million Marylebone penthouse.

Mr Elichaoff, who became friends with Mr Young through work, was known to have business problems and is believed to have been talked down from the roof of the shopping centre just weeks before his death.

Among floral arrangements and photographs of the musician was a small white card believed to have been left by his estranged wife, reading: 'Miss you always, T'.

It was accompanied by a picture of the 55-year-old with Lyla.

Another photograph of Mr Elichaoff and his son from a previous marriage was also left among tributes.

Scotland Yard has confirmed the 55-year-old's death was not being treated as suspicious.  

Mr Elichaoff regularly featured on the Channel 4 programme Four Rooms, in which members of the public pitch weird and wonderful objects to professional dealers.

He and Ms Woodall had married in Knightsbridge in 1999 at St Columba's church where she was christened, her parents had married and her grandfather was buried.

Ms Woodall's wedding dress was made by designer Elspeth Gibson, but she created the designs for her bridesmaids' dresses, while their shoes were made by Christian Louboutin and differed according to the shape of the bridesmaids' ankles.

Back in 1982, it had been Mr Elichaoff who first found fame, as a madcap rock drummer who toured the world supporting U2 and Siouxsie Sioux.

Nicknamed Johnny Too Bad, he played in a Seventies band called Stark Naked And The Car Thieves before defecting to the equally bizarrely named Baby And The Black Spots and then playing in guitarist Robert Fripp's League Of Gentlemen.

His musical career was interrupted by a two-year spell in the Army in 1984, and he went on to help manage rock bands Tears For Fears and Fairground Attraction before becoming a financial adviser.

However, he developed an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2006 when he had 20 operations after breaking his leg in a motorbike accident.

He was then treated in a Californian rehab clinic in October that year. 

Following their split in 2009, the couple remained on good terms and would regularly dine out together with Lyla.

Friends said the marriage had broken down partly because of Ms Woodall's busy work schedule but his dependence on painkillers proved a strain.

Mr Elichaoff suffered from an addiction to prescription painkillers. Ms Woodall also had her own battle with substance and alcohol abuse. The couple had both spoken openly about their issues. 

He said of his wife before their divorce: 'Trinny comes across as cold and aloof, but in fact she is the kindest woman I have ever met. She has a heart of gold. The steeliness people see in her is really a cover for her chronic shyness, believe me.' 

Ms Woodall began a relationship with Saatchi, 71, in the summer of 2012, eight weeks after he split from his former wife, Nigella Lawson.

The couple's 10-year marriage ended after Mr Saatchi was photographed clutching the celebrity chef's neck outside Mayfair restaurant, Scott's – one of the art dealer's favourite haunts.

This summer, less than 12 months after the incident, Ms Woodall was pictured with Mr Saatchi sobbing at a table outside the same restaurant.
