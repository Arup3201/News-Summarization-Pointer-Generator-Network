The family of a man who died after he was refused an ambulance claimed yesterday he lost his life because an NHS ‘computer said no’.

Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin dialled 999 at 5am as he was finding it hard to breathe.

But after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance. 

Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin, who was told that he didn't need an ambulance despite saying he found it hard to breathe and living just a mile away from his local ambulance station 

The 55-year-old, a former merchant seaman, had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication.

It has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘trigger’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his GP instead.

Pat Woodcock, 75, Mr McLaughlin’s partner of ten years, said: ‘I don’t drive and by this point his stomach was so swollen he couldn’t get behind the steering wheel.

‘In the end his doctor came out to see us just before 1pm and said he needed to go to hospital. They took him in a paramedic car, got him to the [intensive care] ward … He never regained consciousness.’ 

Mr McLaughlin died four days later, on September 1. A post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure.

His family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place, from a station just three minutes from his home in Bridport, Dorset.

They were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary. The ‘computer says no’ catchphrase was coined by comedian David Walliams in the BBC’s Little Britain, in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they cannot be helped.

Last night Mr McLaughlin’s son Ross, 28, said: ‘I think Dad was let down by the NHS even before the ambulance. No one seemed to be doing anything about the fluid building up in his body.

‘It was then decided by a computer programme run by non-medically trained personnel who listen out for keywords, enter them … and the computer said no. I thought it was like Little Britain … but my dad died and that’s not acceptable.’

He added that an ambulance ‘would have given him an extra ten to 12 hours of treatment … that could have saved his life, but there’s no way to know for sure now’.

The family is considering legal action to get the computer assessment system changed. A South Western Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘Every time a call is made … a comprehensive triage process is undertaken.

‘An ambulance will be dispatched to those deemed to be in a life-threatening condition.’
