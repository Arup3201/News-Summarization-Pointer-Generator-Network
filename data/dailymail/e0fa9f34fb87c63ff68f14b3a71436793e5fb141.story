A campaigner whose son became the youngest person to die in police custody has been charged with drugs offences.

Carol Pounder, 45, who lost her son Adam Rickwood when he was just 14, is accused of conspiracy to supply heroin in February this year along with his sister Laura, 21, and Luke Gorton, 28.

They appeared at Burnley Magistrates' Court and were released on bail for a plea and case management hearing at a crown court.

Adam was found hanged at Hassockfield
detention centre near Consett, County Durham, after being subjected to a
controversial nose distraction technique that has since been banned.

His mother led a long-running 
campaign for justice following his death and lobbied for a second 
inquest which ruled that 'unlawful' force by guards had contributed to his death.

The teenager, who had previously written letters threatening self-harm, was left alone with a bloody nose in a cell 
after being carried there by four detention officers. 

One administered a short, sharp blow to his nose to quieten him down en-route to his secure quarters.

Adam
was remanded to Hassockfield at the same magistrates’ court in the 
summer of 2004 after allegedly breaching his bail on a wounding charge.

He was also facing a burglary allegation of the staff office at Stoops and Hargher Clough community centre at the time.

His mother has also staged protests outside the courthouse, while campaigning to obtain justice for the teenager. 

The family had to wait more than three-and-a-half years for an inquest into the teenager's death.

Even then an inquest jury returned a suicide verdict and placed no blame on Hassockfield staff.

The nose-hold technique used to restrain Adam was banned in January 2008 and the following year a High Court judge ordered a fresh inquest into his death.

It was not until January 2011, when a second inquest took place under a different coroner, that a jury ruled 'unlawful force' had contributed to his death by hanging. 

His case has also since been cited by the Children's Rights Alliance for England after they lobbied on behalf of teenagers who may have been assaulted in detention centres across the UK. 

Pounder, Rickwood and Gorton will appear for a plea and case management hearing at Burnley Crown Court later this year.
