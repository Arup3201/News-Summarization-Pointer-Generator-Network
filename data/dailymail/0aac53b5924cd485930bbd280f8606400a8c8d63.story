More than a third of patients infected with a new strain of bird flu died after being admitted to the hospital earlier this year, Chinese researchers report in a new study.

Since the new H7N9 bird flu first broke out in China in late March, the strain has infected more than 130 people and killed 37.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described H7N9 as 'one of the most lethal influenza viruses' it has ever seen and said it appeared to spread faster than the last bird flu strain, H5N1, that threatened to unleash a pandemic.

After making some adjustments for missing data, the Chinese scientists estimated the overall death rate to be 36 per cent.

The outbreak was stopped after China 
closed many of its live animal markets - scientists had assumed the 
virus was infecting people through exposure to live birds.

That makes the new strain less deadly than H5N1, which kills about 70 per cent of the people it infects.

Still, H7N9 is more lethal than the 
swine flu that caused a 2009 global epidemic. That had a death rate of 
less than one per cent.

The results were released in two papers on the H7N9 strain, published online Monday in the journal Lancet.

One article compared the new H7N9 
strain with the H5N1 strain, using data from confirmed cases of H7N9 
(130 patients) and H5N1 (43 patients) that were reported until May 24, 
this year.

It found that both viruses were 
related to exposure to poultry - 75 per cent of patients infected with 
H7N9 and 71% of those with H5N1.

Though there was little evidence, save for a small cluster, to show that H7N9 transmitted from human to human.

The new flu strain appears to infect 
older people more. Researchers found the average age of infected 
patients was 62 years, compared with 26 for H5N1.

Men in urban areas appear to be more prone to infection than women.

'The good news is that numbers of 
(H7N9) cases have stalled,' Cecile Viboud and Lone Simonsen of the U.S. 
National Institutes of Health wrote in a commentary accompanying the 
article.

However, they warned that the threat 
of the virus still 'persists' and predicted that the strain might return
 in the winter, when flu viruses are typically most active.

That assessment echoes the WHO, which earlier this month also warned of the virus adapting and becoming resistant to therapy.

Shanghai doctors treating 14 
sufferers of the H7N9 virus recently found that it had become resistant 
to Tamiflu in three of the patients.

Researchers at the Shanghai Public 
Health Clinical Centre said that while the drug reduced levels of the 
virus in 11 of the patients, genetic testing of bird flu in the three 
who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively 
mutate to resist Tamiflu.
