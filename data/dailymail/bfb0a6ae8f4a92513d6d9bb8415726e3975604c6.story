Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann has heaped praise on in-form winger Yannick Bolasie, claiming that there is 'no-one who can stop him when he's on form'.

Bolasie has only scored one goal this season, away at Everton in September, but despite his lack of potency in front of goal, his scintillating performances on the Eagles' wing have seen him receive widespread acclaim.Â 

The 25-year-old is quick to admit his desire to score more goals, and teammate Dann believes that if he can add that to his game, the DR Congo international is on to a winner.

'If he can start doing that [scoring goals], we have got a great player on our hands,' Dann told the Croydon Advertiser. 'When he is in that type of form [against Spurs] he is unstoppable. I do not care who he plays against, there is no-one who can stop him in that kind of form.'

Bolasie's pace and trickery on the wing has earned him a regular starting berth in the Palace team and, despite signing a new three-year deal in the summer, he has been promised a further improvement to his contract if he continues playing well.

Palace earned a credible 0-0 draw away at Tottenham on Saturday, with Bolasie the main threat in the Eagles' attack. In fact, Neil Warnock's side were unlucky not to leave White Hart Lane with all three points, as they pushed for a winner in the latter stages of the game.

In January, Palace will be dealt a blow when Bolasie - as well as captain Mile Jedinak - leave on international duty for their respective countries. Bolasie is in DR Congo's squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, while Jedinak will lead Australia out on home soil in the Asia Cup.

Dann admits that losing Bolasie will be a blow for the team as they strive for safety in the Premier League.

'The way he is playing, he would be a loss to any team. He is obviously a big loss but we have got people there who will fill in.

'He is improving every week and his end product is getting better as well.'

Palace host Stoke City at Selhurst Park on Saturday, where they will look to extend the gap between themselves and the bottom three of the Premier League.

Warnock's side have struggled to find consistency in their league campaign this season, beating Liverpool at Selhurst Park, before losing to Aston Villa in their next home game a fortnight after.
