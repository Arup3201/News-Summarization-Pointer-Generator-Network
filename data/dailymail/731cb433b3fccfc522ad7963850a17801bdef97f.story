James Holmes reached out to multiple women on a sex website in the days before launching a massacre which killed 12 people and injured 58 during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, it has emerged.

However, at least three of the women he contacted through AdultFriendFinder rejected his advances - even though he was apparently just hoping to 'chat' with 'nothing sexual' on the cards.

The news follows rumours that Holmes may have broken up with a girlfriend shortly before the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, and that he was due to be evicted from his apartment after dropping out of grad school.

The 24-year-old gunman's profile on AdultFriendFinder first came to light the day after he attacked a midnight screening of the Hollywood blockbuster.

It shows pictures of Holmes with dyed red hair posing with a poster of British model Keeley Hazell, and features the chilling tagline, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

The PhD dropout wrote on the site that he was looking for 'a fling or casual sex' - and described himself as 'a nice guy'.

But one of the women who was in contact with Holmes told TMZ she thought he was 'just looking to maybe chat... nothing sexual'.

He asked to meet up with her but she turned down the request, as did two other women who talked to TMZ about their communication with him.

Holmes had dropped out of the University of Colorado weeks before the attack and was nearing the end of his grace period for staying at the institution's accommodation.

Aurora police chief Daniel Oates also hinted that Holmes had recently gone through a break up and that authorities were investigating the claim.

A former classmate from the University of Colorado suggested another cause for the killings, describing Holmes as someone who had lost touch with reality after becoming 'obsessed' with video games.

The classmate told the Daily Mail: 'James was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role-playing games.

'I
 can’t remember which one but it was something like World of Warcraft, 
one of those where you compete against people on the internet.

'He
 did not have much of a life apart from that and doing his work. James 
seemed like he wanted to be in the game and be one of the characters.

'It
 seemed that being online was more important to him than real life. He 
must have lost his sense of reality, how else can you shoot dozens of 
people you don’t know?'

It
 is also believed that Holmes was due to be evicted from his flat. The 
24-year-old, who is now in police custody, pulled out of the university 
weeks before the deadly attack.

Neighbours told TMZ anyone living in the block had to be enrolled at the university otherwise you had 30 days to evacuate.

It is not known exactly when Holmes 
stopped going to classes but it is thought he was nearing the end of the
 30-day grace period.

Earlier Aurora police chief Daniel Oates addressed the hunt for a motive for Holmes's murderous actions, telling CBS' Face the Nation: 'I’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true.

'That’s
 why we have all our investigators working on this. That’s why we 
brought in the FBI behavioral analysts. They’re going to figure all that
 stuff out.

'There will be 
no easy or quick answers. And maybe there will never be any answers. 
This requires a lot of work. And we’re just not in a position to give 
any indications of that now.

'And again, whatever we do develop, the 
proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to 
reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution.'

This
 clue came out on the same day as it was revealed that in addition to his 
profile on AdultFriendFinder, Holmes also had a profile active on the 
dating website, Match.com.

During
 the same interview, Mr Oates said that they had spoken with someone 
who was an acquaintance of the 24-year-old shooting suspect, leading 
many to initially fear that the investigation had not come to an end. 

'This was a person 
who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance,' Mr Oates told CBS News. 'We found him 
yesterday, we interviewed him.'

During the talk with Face The Nation's Bob Schieffer, Mr Oates was quick to downplay the questioning.

'The relationship was really inconsequential and we're happy that we spoke to him. That's all that was,' he said.

A witness at the scene initially said that he thought he saw a second man helping Holmes during the attack. 

The male witness who saw Holmes 
launch his deadly attack says he thought he also saw someone open the 
doors of the movie theatre to let the shooter in.

The witness, who has not been named, 
told KCNC it appeared that a cinemagoer who left the screening after 
receiving a telephone call deliberately left the emergency exit open.

Holmes used the emergency exit to access the screening of the Hollywood blockbuster in Aurora, Colorado.

The
 witness said: 'As I was sitting down to get my seat, I noticed that a 
person came up to the front row, the front right, sat down, and as 
credits were going, it seemed like he got a phone call.

'So
 he went out toward the emergency exit doorway, which I thought was 
unusual to take a phone call. And it seemed like he probably pried it 
open, or probably did not let it latch all the way.

'As
 soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, 
armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then
 there were gunshots that took place.'

Mr Oates was clear to mention that 
while they were still trying to determine the circumstances leading up 
to the fatal attack - and what, if any, motive the young man had - he said
 that police are confident in saying that he acted alone.

'All
 the evidence we have, every single indicator, is that this was all Mr 
Holmes' activity. He wasn't particularly aided by anyone else,' Mr Oates
 said during the interview.

Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting

The
 first time that police began to think that there may have been an 
accomplice was when a local officer received a threatening electronic 
message Saturday evening, demanding that Holmes be released from custody
 or else the sender would become violent.

The sender and the format of the 
message have not been released publicly, but police investigated the 
threat and appear confident that there was no accomplice.

They spent hours on Friday and Saturday in Holmes' apartment, dismantling the many booby traps and explosives that the madman had set up to kill whomever entered his apartment.

Unconfirmed reports state that Holmes had a Batman poster adorning one of the walls. Police chief Oates would not comment on the poster, but photographers did capture a portion of a different poster while investigators were examining the shooter's apartment.

A poster for a video game called Soldiers of Misfortune is visible- and fitting considering both Holmes' interest in video games and his maniacal course of destruction that has torn Aurora apart.

Ritchie Duong told the Los Angeles 
Times that he has known Holmes for more than a decade and they also both
 attended undergraduate school at the University of California, 
Riverside, where they saw each other once a week to watch the television
 series Lost.

They last met in December for dinner and a movie. Mr Duong says at the time, Holmes seemed fine.

He also says academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and at the UC Riverside.

Mr Duong says he remembers that in one college class they had together, Holmes didn't take notes but would just sit through class and always got an A.

Police have surmised that the grad school dropout had seemingly spent months planning the murderous assault, as he had amassed a stockpile of arms and explosives over long period of time.
