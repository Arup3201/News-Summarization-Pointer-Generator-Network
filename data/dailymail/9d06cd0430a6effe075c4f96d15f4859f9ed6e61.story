Four men were today charged with helping the terrorist responsible for the murders of four Jews and a policewoman in Paris, as the French Prime Minister revealed there are 3,000 people with ties to France being monitored by anti-terror officers.

Three face prison for supplying weapons and other equipment to self-styled IS ‘warrior’ Amedy Coulibaly, who was himself also gunned down earlier this month.

It apparently confirms that the 32-year-old Parisian was part of a large cell committed to bringing death and destruction to the capital in the name of radical Islam.

Those charged have not been named, but are believed to be from the Paris suburbs, and aged 22, 25, 26 and 28.

Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins did not give the suspects' full identities, naming them only as Willy P, Christophe R, Tonino G and Mickael A.

Molins said ‘three of the individuals were placed in provisional detention overnight’ while legal argument over the fourth’s status continues.

All are accused of aiding and abetting terrorism. The first three men were arrested during police raids last Friday, exactly a week after Coulibaly died.

The DNA of Mickael A. was found on a revolver in Coulibaly's apartment and on a glove the gunman wore in the supermarket. Molins also said Mickael A had 18 phone contacts with Coulibaly on January 6.

Molins said three of the men are believed to have procured weapons and tactical material for Coulibaly, but are not charged with complicity in the attacks.

The lawyer for one of those charged said his client was unaware of any terrorist plot and was afraid of Coulibaly. Lawyer Fabrice Delinde told BFM television said the gunman "terrorized my client" and intimidated him into helping. He would not identify his client, for his own security.

Molins said authorities in France are working with other countries to search for other possible accomplices. They are especially trying to uncover who was responsible for the posthumous video of Coulibaly, which was edited and released days after he and brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi died in standoffs with police.

In the video, Coulibaly pledges allegiance to the Islamic State group and details how the attacks were coordinated by the three men.

Manuel Valls said the government will spend 425million euros (£325million) on counter-terrorism over three years in response to the attacks, which will include hiring an extra 2,600 counter-terrorism officers.

France will also bolster its intelligence apparatus, introducing a measure to make it easier to tap phones, he said. In addition, 3,000 people with ties to France - some at home, others abroad, will be monitored by anti-terror surveillance agents. 

The number linked to jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq and increased by 130 per cent in one year, he said. 

Since three police were among those killed by the Paris terrorists, Valls said improving officers' weapons and protective gear was among the top priorities. 

Coulibaly had been working with the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, who carried out a massacre around the offices of the anti-Islamic Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 dead.

They were also shot dead by police commandos following a siege similar to the one Coulibaly died in, at a Kosher store in eastern Paris.

Three women arrested in the latest raids were freed on Saturday, while five other suspects were allowed home yesterday.

All of the terrorists had automatic rifles and other weaponry including a rocket launcher – prompting detailed investigations as to where they had come from.

It came as Paris police confirmed they had questioned Coulibaly just 10 days before the worst terrorist attacks in France this century.

He was driving a rental car on December 30, with his partner Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, in the passenger seat, when traffic officers pulled him over.

Coulibaly, who just had a provisional driving license at the time, was listed on the police computer database as a ‘dangerous criminal’ with connections to radical Islam.

The officers were advised to question the man without arousing his suspicion, according to the Canard Enchaine investigative weekly. 

He was not arrested, and nothing more came of the incident.

The car was rented in the name of Boumeddiene, who is currently the most wanted female terrorist suspect in the world.

She fled to Syria from Paris days before the attacks, and is currently thought to be with IS terrorist forces.
