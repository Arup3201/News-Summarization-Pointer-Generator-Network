Hi-tech: The £199.99 Tea Maker from Heston Blumenthal claims to create the perfect brew

For most of us it is a relatively simple process: boil the kettle, put a teabag in a mug, pour on the water, add milk and sugar to taste.

But that straightforward approach to making a cuppa is not good enough for chef Heston Blumenthal, famed for his risk-taking gastronomy.

He has developed a tea maker that brings his hi-tech culinary approach into the home, casting aside the teapot and teabag.

His £199.99 stainless steel Sage Tea Maker claims to deliver the perfect brew from what is effectively a combined kettle and teapot. It can even be used instead of a teasmade as it has a delay setting, allowing users to wake up to a perfect cup of tea.

The device, one of a range of appliances he has created, has five temperature and time settings based on whether you are using normal black tea leaves or green, white, herbal or oolong varieties.

‘The right time and temperature  are critical for a great cuppa,’ said Blumenthal.

‘Different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures, and we all have a favourite strength.

‘You fill the stainless steel basket with leaves, tell it the type of tea, select the strength and it will heat the water, slowly lower the basket, then raise the basket from the water when it’s done.’

The Tea Maker keeps the beverage warm for up to 60 minutes and can also be used as a conventional kettle or to brew coffee. It is part of the new Sage by Heston Blumenthal range that includes an ice cream maker and a juicer. Most expensive in the range is  a £549.99 Barista Express coffee machine to make espressos and cappuccinos.

A four-slice motorised toaster, costing £169.99, toasts bread depending on its ingredients and thickness. It has defrost and crumpet settings.

Luxury: The new Heston Blumenthal range also includes a precision toaster for £169.99

The
 Heston toaster includes a quick look button which triggers the machine 
to lift the bread out to show whether it is done or not.

If it not quite golden, pressing the ‘A Bit More’ button lowers it back in for another 30 seconds.

There
 are independent controls to allow two different toasting settings, a 
one-touch automatic lowering system, an LED light progress display, a 
toast ready sound alert, together with defrost and crumpet settings.

Convention: The Heston Blumenthal £99.99 kettle has five different settings for different types of tea

Each of the innovative machines come with recipes, hints and tips drawn up by the award-winning chef and TV food guru.

Most expensive of the appliances in the range is a £549.99 Barista coffee machine – the sort of thing found in an independent coffee shop.

It contains a 250g bean hopper, which is enough for 25 shots of espresso. It then grinds the beans and dispenses the doses of fresh coffee into the cups on a six place warming tray.

For cappuccino lovers there is a high powered milk frothing arm and stainless steel frothing jug.

The Sage range is a brand of the Australian Breville group, while they will be sold in the UK through the likes of Lakeland, John Lewis, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Debenhams and Harrods.

The manufacturer’s general manager for marketing, Scott Brady, said the chef had been involved in presenting the products to UK retailers.

‘As an intrinsic brand partner, Heston has helped to explain the benefits of our flagship products…to a highly receptive audience,’ he said.

A spokesman added: ‘Heston Blumenthal, the ultimate food thinker and experimental chef, was involved in testing and production.

‘These powerful, heavy-duty machines have an array of automatic, pre-set programmes that replicate commercial appliances and do all the thinking for you.

‘Thanks to Heston and Sage, prepping, boiling, whisking, whipping, cooking and baking has never been so easy.’
