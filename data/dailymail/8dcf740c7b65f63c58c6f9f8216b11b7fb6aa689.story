Twenty-four hours after Luis Suarez hit the headlines for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s 1-0 win over Italy, another Liverpool player was drawing attention to themselves for the wrong reasons.

Mamadou Sakho, who has started each of France’s three games at the World Cup so far, should have been dismissed in the eighth minute for elbowing Ecuador’s Oswaldo Minda in the face while jostling for a corner.

The centre-back could face retrospective action from Fifa for his stray elbow, with the referee not spotting the incident during the game.

Strapped: Sakho's leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark but he was lucky to not leave earlier

Sakho’s heavily-strapped left leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark, with Real Madrid’s Raphael Varane the player that replaced him at the back for Les Bleus.

It was a disjointed performance from Didier Deschamps’ side, which was somewhat expected when you consider the 1998 World Cup winner made seven changes to the side that sealed a place in the last 16 by trouncing Switzerland 5-2 in their previous group match.

Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, a late replacement in the squad for injured Clement Grenier, was living in dreamland as he joined Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba in central midfield.

From planning his holidays to making his international debut in a World Cup game at the Maracana - all in the space of a month.  

He looked comfortable on the ball, especially in the second half when France enjoyed a numerical advantage following Antonio Valencia’s dismissal for an over-the-top challenge on Lucas Digne.

Elsewhere Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna provided some brilliant deliveries from the right-hand side, particularly when Premier League target Antoinne Griezmann forced Alexander Rodriguez into a smart stop at his near post and when Pogba nodded wide late on.

His old Arsenal team-mate Laurent Koscielny started in place of Varane, but was shaky on the rare occasions that the impressive Enner Valencia was able to run at goal for Ecuador.

France went into the game having not lost in their last six World Cup games against South American opposition, and that record was not put under threat in Rio as Ecuador struggled to create many chances of note.

Their place in the knockout rounds was sealed with a win against Switzerland last time out, but that does not excuse what was an impotent performance at the Maracana. A particularly wild effort from Pogba, under no pressure 40 yards from goal, epitomised their bluntness going forward.

Unlucky: Karim Benzema couldn't add to his World Cup tally after two impressive opening games

Karim Benzema, so clinical in the opening two games, failed to add to his tally of three tournament goals, as Rodriguez made a string of impressive saves in the second half. The Real Madrid man was perhaps fortunate not to be replaced, particularly as Deschamps clearly had one eye on their last 16 clash with Nigeria.

Despite going a man down on the hour-mark Ecuador occasionally looked dangerous on the break. Fortunately for France, Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was on hand to spare their blushes in the final minutes, making a decent save from Juan Carlos Paredes’ curling shot. 

France’s match was bookended by incidents involving Premier League elbows, as Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud clashed with an Ecuador defender late on.
