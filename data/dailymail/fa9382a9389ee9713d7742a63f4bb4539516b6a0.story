A Conservative MP insisted today that he had been misunderstood after sparking a major backlash by dismissing the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural c***'.

Aidan Burley, who was forced to quit as a ministerial aide after attending a Nazi-themed stag do last year, delivered the barbs on Twitter during the event last night.

But despite the politician's gripes with Danny Boyle's extravaganza, it proved a huge hit with the public, with 26.9million UK viewers tuning in to watch - the biggest British TV audience for 14 years.

One of Mr Burley's posts read: 'The most
 leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen - more than Beijing, the 
capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?'

Shortly afterwards he added: 'Thank God the athletes have arrived! Now we can move on from leftie multicultural c***. Bring back red arrows, Shakespeare and the Stones!'

Last night's event featured a flamboyant tribute to the NHS, in which staff and patients from the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) were given a special cheer as the hospital's name was spelt out by the beds.

The Royal Navy, Army and Air Force raised the Union Flag, as the National Anthem rang out from Kaos, a singing choir for deaf and hard of hearing children.

Mr Burley's tweets caused an avalanche of criticism on the social networking site, including from fellow Conservative Gavin Barwell.

'With respect, us Londoners are rather proud of the diversity of our city #nothingleftwingaboutit,' the Croydon MP tweeted to Mr Burley.

Downing Street moved quickly to distance Prime Minister David Cameron from the comments, with a senior source saying simply: 'We do not agree with him.'

The MP for Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, could also be facing a fight to keep hold of his seat after former footballer Stan Collymore, who hails from the area, angrily replied: 'I'll happily stand against you at the next election. You have no clue about our town or its people.'

Mr Burley was touted as a rising Tory star when he won Cannock Chase in 2010 with a huge swing from Labour.

However, he lost his job as a 
parliamentary private secretary when details emerged of a stag do he 
attended in the skiing resort of Val Thorens last December.

One guest was alleged to have dressed in an SS uniform while others were said to have chanted Nazi slogans.

Mr Burley has repeatedly apologised for being present at the event, which is being investigated by French police, but denied behaving badly himself or breaking the law.

In the early hours of this morning, the MP sought to placate anger over his Olympics remarks, posting the message: 'Seems my tweet has been misunderstood. I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson added his voice to a barrage of criticism levelled at Mr Burley, dismissing the comments as 'nonsense'.

Visiting the Olympic Park on the first day of the Games, the capital's Conservative leader said: 'It was actually the truth about this country in the last two or three hundred years told in a big, dynamic way.

'People say it was all leftie stuff. That is nonsense. I'm a Conservative and I had hot tears of patriotic pride from the beginning. I was blubbing like Andy Murray.'

He added: 'The thing I loved was the 
heavy political stuff. I loved the emergence of the urban proletariat 
and the rise of the chimneys and the forging of the ring.'

Labour MP David Winnick said: 'I 
would have thought that the general reaction in Government and amongst 
senior ministers is that a period of silence on Mr Burley's part would 
be much appreciated.

'The
 fact of the matter is that his comments were totally inane, 
anti-British and at variance with the feeling of millions of people up 
and down the country over the success of last night's opening.

'A great number of people in Cannock, including many who voted for him, will be wishing they had a different MP.'

Aidan Burley might have bemoaned the ceremony's supposedly socialist tone, but for the VIPs and dignitaries in attendance, the food on offer at a Buckingham Palace reception was positively bourgeois.

Guests included David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Michelle Obama. But it was France's PM Jean-Marc Ayrault who must have felt most at home, as almost everything on the menu came with an elaborate French name.

Among the cold dishes were Oeufs de Caille et Sel de Celeri and Cornet de Canard Fume Melon de Charentais. Hot dishes included Gateau d’Aigrefin Fume et Poireaux and Langoustines a l’Outhier, while for dessert the guests were served Financier au Chocolat et Cerises - a real mouthful.

Labour
 frontbencher Michael Dugher said: 'David Cameron should show some 
leadership and demand a full apology from Aidan Burley immediately.

'Burley has got form. His comments were stupid, ignorant and offensive.

'David
 Cameron has said that the Conservative  Party has changed but it is 
clear from the words of his own MP that not a lot has changed.'

The opening ceremony, in which the Queen had a starring role, featured a diverse cast including James Bond star Daniel Craig and writer JK Rowling - merging music, dance and special effects into a spectacular opening.

The worldwide audience was treated to a greatest hits medley of British pop over the decades with bursts of the Beatles, the Jam, Sex Pistols and Dizzee Rascal.

There were also excerpts from the Kinks, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Mud's Tiger Feet before Emeli Sande sang the cup final classic Abide With Me.

The average audience for the show - which ran from 9pm until 12.50am - was 22.4million.

It is the highest rating since 1998's England-Argentina World Cup clash screened by ITV, which drew 23.78million.

The most watched British broadcast in the past 20 years was Princess Diana's funeral in September 1997, with 32.1million viewers split across BBC1 and ITV.

Danny Boyle's masterpiece was the biggest BBC1 show since an edition of Only Fools And Horses in 1996.

BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: 'BBC1 is all about bringing the nation together for its biggest moments, and I'm thrilled by the huge audiences who tuned in to watch last night's historic events.

'Danny Boyle's opening ceremony was an absolute triumph. I am very proud of the two BBC Drama films that formed part of the ceremony - the audience response to the film featuring Her Majesty the Queen and James Bond was one of my highlights.'

Peak viewing figures of 23.2 million were recorded for England's Euro 2012 quarter-final against Italy last month, while 17.1 million watched the Wimbledon final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer.
