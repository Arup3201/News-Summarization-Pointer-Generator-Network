Jermain Defoe wants to lift the FA Cup in his club’s colours one day – as opposed to a designer suit.

The 32-year-old was cup-tied when Portsmouth beat Cardiff in the final in 2008 but still made his way up the Wembley steps to get his hands on the trophy.

On Saturday, Defoe makes his home debut for new club Sunderland when they entertain Fulham in the fourth round of the competition.

Defoe is desperate for FA Cup success after missing out on Portsmouth's triumph in 2008

And he is already setting his sights on a return to Wembley.

‘I was gutted when I was cup-tied, it was really hard to be honest,’ he said.

‘I was in my suit and I still went up and lifted the trophy though. That kind of thing makes you more hungry to do well and get back there.

‘I was happy for the boys, happy for the team and I was a part of it, even though I didn’t play. The whole day was special but you want many more of those days. I look forward to this game now against Fulham and hopefully we can win and progress.

‘From there you never know, Sunderland got to Wembley last year and were unlucky to lose. If we can do that again it would be great.’

Defoe is perhaps a dying breed of player who still holds the cup in the highest regard. Indeed, rather than being rested, the striker has told manager Gus Poyet that he is desperate to step out at the Stadium of Light for the first time as a Sunderland player.

And he added: ‘The FA Cup has always excited me. It’s a special competition - one of the best in the world.

‘I’ve always loved coming in and seeing the other results, but it’s been a long time for me since I’ve played in the FA Cup, so I’m looking forward to it. A big game, at home, it’s important that we approach it like every other game and try to win.’

Defoe, meanwhile, cannot wait to sample the Wearside atmosphere as one of their own.

‘Even before I signed I knew that it was a special club with special fans,’ he said.

’You speak to other players that have played for this club and they have always said that it’s a special place, and although I only played for 70 minutes the other day (at Spurs) the fans were fantastic.

‘I spoke to my mum after the game and she couldn’t believe it, she said she couldn’t stop looking at the supporters and talking about how they didn’t stop singing throughout the whole game.

‘I have always known that it’s a special club with special people and now I’m really looking forward to making my home debut.’
