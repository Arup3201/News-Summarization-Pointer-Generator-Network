Sacked: Paul Kellerman lost his job as a delivery driver after being wrongly recorded doing 103 mph when he was only driving at 34 mph

A delivery driver who was wrongly recorded speeding at 103 mph has been sacked despite the police apologising for the blunder and his van being unable to go above 70 mph.

Paul Kellerman, 43, was dismissed after his firm received a prosecution notice stating he was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone, when he had actually been travelling at just 34 mph

The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job.

He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans.

Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph.

'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.'

His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake.

A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.'

The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled.

The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice.

Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for Â£320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough.

He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.'

Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent.

He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work. It's not him I'm mad at it is the police.

'I know everyone makes mistakes but not on that scale. If I'd not got a letter of apology nobody would believe me.

'I would have had to go to court and would have got an automatic ban. Other people have got to complain.'

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A notice of prosecution was issued in this instance in error.

'As soon as it was brought to our attention we retracted the notice and apologised to Mr Kellerman.

'We have written to him to confirm non further action will be taken in respect of the notice and have also offered to write to the company but Mr Kellerman declined this offer.

'We have also spoken to the employer to explain the situation. The subject of his employment is a matter for him and the company.'
