Key man: Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric is Croatia's main creative force

One to watch: Mario Mandzukic

Suspended for Croatia’s opening match against Brazil, the Bayern Munich striker will be looking to make up for lost time on his World Cup debut. Brilliant at holding up the ball and bringing others into play, Mandzukic is also a huge threat in the air, something his team’s full backs will look to exploit.

Key clash: Alex Song vs Luka Modric

A mini-Clasico will take place in central midfield between two players that left north London for La Liga two summers ago as Barcelona’s Song, formerly of Arsenal, lines up against ex-Spurs star Modric, now of Real Madrid. It will be fascinating to see how the two fare in Manaus coming off the back of very contrasting seasons. The latter enjoyed a fantastic campaign at club level, while the former endured a stop-start one at the Nou Camp.

History lesson
