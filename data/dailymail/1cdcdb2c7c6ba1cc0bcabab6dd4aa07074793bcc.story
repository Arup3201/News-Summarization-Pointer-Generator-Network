The long-awaited North American premier of Lars Von Trier’s unrated film Nymphomaniac came unexpectedly on Tuesday night in a secret Sundance Film Festival.

Nearly 300 attendees packed into the Egyptian Theater in Park City, Utah despite having no clue they were about to watch the much hyped and sex-filled movie, which features actor Shia LaBeouf and has been likened to soft core pornography.

While the film had viewers entranced for much of its two-hour run time, it also elicited at least one bout of unintended laughter.

NSFW surprise! Lars Von Trier's much hyped Nymphomaniac had its North American debut in a surprise screening at the Sundance Film Festival on Tuesday

Good and bad: The controversial Danish cinema stalwart was not in attendance because he won't fly in planes and has never been to the U.S. Had he been there, he would have seen an audience entranced, but one that also laughed at moments that weren't necessarily supposed to be funny

Von Trier has a history of pushing the shock factor envelope and Nymphomaniac is no exception.

Whether or not they’d heard the rumors that Tuesday’s secret screening would feature the NSFW film, viewers sat through two hours of what reviewers elsewhere in the world have described as constant nudity and explicit acts that somehow amount to an 'utterly fascinating', 'intellectual' and 'philosophically rigorous' film.

Intellectual except, perhaps, for a poorly timed or overly dramatic line uttered by Stellan Skarsgard that compared the LaBeouf character’s first sexual encounter with the Joe, the film’s heroine, to the Fibonacci sequence.

‘This is what made people laugh,’ writes Steven Zeitchik of the LA Times. But the film ‘has an unexpectedly straightforward and surprisingly (if not always intentionally) comedic undertone.’

Otherwise, most in attendance agree that shock and awe are two words that aptly describe the accidental audience.

Those attendees, however, did not include director Von Trier or any of the other cast members.

Von Trier’s excuse is that he has a lifelong and widely reported fear of flying and has never been to the United States.

Audiences were coaxed into Park City's Egyptian Theatre with no knowledge of what movie they'd been shown

As for Charlotte Gainsbourg, Uma 
Thurman, Christian Slater and the rest, it remains unclear why they 
shied away from the premier.

The film follows the story of Joe, who retells the story of her life to an older bachelor after she is found beaten in an alleyway.

LaBeouf plays Jerome, a slightly creepy womaniser, who has his eye on Stacy Martin, who plays the younger Joe.

The first half of the film, which opens in the U.S. on March 21, is apparently much less explicit than the second.

Surprisingly unsexy: Shia LaBeouf plays one of the hundreds of sexual partners of sex addict Joe, played by newcomer Stacy Martin

‘LaBeouf actually keeps his clothes on most of the time (the teaser to ‘Vol. 2’ suggests otherwise) and is somewhat curiously seen by Joe as some kind of romantic ideal,’ Zeitchik writes.

Nymphomanic Part 1 opened in France, Spain, Brazil and Eastern European back in December.

The second half—for which LaBeouf evidently had to send photos of his male anatomy prior to being cast—opens April 18.

Explicit: The film revolves around heroine Joe, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin at different ages, and largery focuses on her sexual emploits
