Abandoned: A baby girl was found crying in the sand at Sandy Beach in Hawaii soon after she was born

A mother who left her newborn baby on a beach in Hawaii shortly after it was born is being hunted by police.

The full-term, eight-pound newborn, was found crying in the sand at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu soon after she was born on Sunday.

State Department of Human Services Director Patricia McManaman said police were investigating the case as endangering the welfare of a minor and child abandonment.

A woman parked at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu sometime between 11p.m on Sunday and midnight heard several people screaming, police spokesman Michelle Yu said.

A few minutes later the screaming stopped and the woman heard a baby crying. She walked toward the ocean and saw an infant on the sand.

The woman took the baby, which was naked, to the nearby Queen's Medical Center.

Ms McManaman said the baby was "recovering well" in hospital.

She said. 'We're just very grateful this child is alive and doing well.'

If no one comes forward to claim the child, the Department of Human Services will file a petition this week with family court, asking for custody.

If no family is identified, the state will ask the court for permission to release a photo of the infant.

In 2007, Hawaii became the 48th state with a baby safe haven law which provides mothers with  immunity from prosecution for leaving an unharmed newborn within 72 hours of birth at a fire department, police station or hospital or with emergency services.

No one has taken advantage of the law since it was enacted, Ms McManaman said.

The baby safe haven hotline is 800-494-3991.
