Xabi Alonso is set to complete his £7.5 million move from Real Madrid to Bayern Munich on Friday.

The 32-year-old arrived in Munich, Germany for a medical with the Bundesliga champion's team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt on Thursday.

The ex-Liverpool midfielder had been linked with a move to Manchester United after five years at the Bernabeu, but opted to join Pep Guardiola's side

The deal sees the German champions act after injuries to midfielders Thiago Alcantara, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Javi Martinez.

Xabi Alonso is the latest Spanish player to join Bayern's ranks since Pep Guardiola took over as manager.

Javi Martinez was already at the club before Guardiola took over, but he has since brought in Thiago Alcantara, Juan Bernat, Pepe Reina and now Alonso.

Guardiola has also surrounded himself with Spanish staff, such as aide Manel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and match analyst Carles Planchart.

Sporting director Matthias Sammer believes Alonso will give Bayern new options, saying: 'If that will work, I would have a very good feeling for the club and the coach.

'After the injuries of Thiago and Schweinsteiger we have been looking for someone, who could help us immediately. And Xabi Alonso could play on top level for two years.'

And chairman Jan-Christian Dressen revealed his side are now finalising the details with fellow European giants Real. 

'We have an agreement with Xabi Alonso. And we hope to find an agreement with Real Madrid in the next one or two days,' he said.

'We are not talking about a loan this would be a permanent signing.'
