Justin Bieber has caused outrage after leaving a 'tasteless' comment in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.

The 19-year-old singer - who is currently on tour in Europe - visited the famous home where Jewish wartime diarist Frank and her family hid from Nazi persecution for two years during the Holocaust.

After spending an hour touring the home on Saturday, which opened as a museum in 1960, Bieber wrote a message in the guestbook, which read: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here.

'Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.'

Belieber battle: Hundreds of people left comments on the Anne Frank House's update about Justin that expressed disgust

From Justin to Anne: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.'

Hundreds of people took to Twitter to express outrage, branding the singer a 'moron' and 'douche,' leaving several to question whether he actually wrote such a shocking message.

Buzzfeed reports that BBC reporter Anna Holligan received confirmation from the Anne Frank House press office.

The press office commented: 'He was very interested in Anne Frank.'

Handling the situation with grace, 
they said of his odd note: 'He's 19, it's a strange life he's living, it
 wasn't very sensible but he didn't mean bad.' 

People on Twitter seems to disagree, some even saying it's time to take Bieber to rehab.

One person even tweeted: 'When life gets done with Justin Bieber, I have a feeling it isn't going to be pretty.'

Another wrote in regards to Justin's note in the guestbook: 'I weep for humanity.'

Further driving the point home, an additional shocked Twitter commenter said: 'He has no right to say this.'

Anne Frank wrote her now-famous diary while residing in the house, with the teenager describing it as luxurious compared to other hiding places she had heard about.

The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from German in 1933 - the same year the Nazis gained control over Germany.

By 1940 the Nazi had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped in Amsterdam.

 happy: People took to Twitter to express their dismay over the pop 
star's disrespectful comment in the Anne Frank House guestbook

In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building, as persecution of the Jewish population increased under the Nazi regime.

But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945.

Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame.
