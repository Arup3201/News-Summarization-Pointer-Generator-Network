A former nurse told her daughter her life had become a 'nightmare' after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, an inquest heard today.

Virginia Humphrey, 67, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) in Brighton, East Sussex, on May 9 after losing 10 stone in six months, the inquest at Brighton County Court was told.

An email sent by divorcee Mrs Humphrey to her daughter, Deborah Mitchell, who lived in the U.S., was read out to the inquest.

In the email, sent on January 18, she described how she was unable to keep any food down and had chronic indigestion, leaving her feeling like a 'prune'.

She wrote: 'Life since coming out of hospital has been a nightmare.

'Friday was an awful day ending with me being so sick I thought I turned my body inside out.'

Her son, Kevin Humphrey, said that in her last few months she became wheelchair-bound as she did not enough energy to walk, and he would have to carry her up the stairs to the house they shared in the city.

He told the inquest: 'I had rails fitted but she wasn’t strong enough to use the rails.

'She could walk no further than 10 steps, then she’d feel faint.'

The inquest heard yesterday how Mrs Humphrey, who also had another son, suffered from malnutrition as she was unable to absorb nutrients.

It was also heard that the surgeons who carried out the operation at University College London Hospital (UCLH) may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure as it was possible a channel leading to the colon was cut too short.

operation: Virginia Humphrey died in hospital in Brighton after she 
lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation

Mrs Humphrey, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, had undergone the procedure to help her lose weight on August 31 last year and seemed to be doing well and making the progress expected in the following months.

However by December she was beginning to have problems keeping food down and was admitted to the A&E department at the RSCH twice that month.

The inquest heard that although she went to the hospital because of her constant vomiting, medics also found she had chest problems and so did not inform staff at UCLH of her bariatric trouble.

Mrs Humphrey, who worked as an Army nurse before becoming an auxiliary nurse, went to A&E again on February 9 suffering from severe vomiting, diarrhoea, lower abdomen pain and indigestion.

Medics found she was dehydrated and also had difficulty swallowing.

The inquest heard staff at the RSCH decided Mrs Humphrey should be transferred to UCLH so she could have specialist bariatric care.

They did not have space for her immediately but she was admitted on February 22 with symptoms of vomiting and difficulty swallowing.

James Hewes, a trainee surgeon who had carried out the gastric bypass alongside consultant bariatric surgeon Marco Adamo, told the inquest these were relatively common complaints from patients following gastric surgery, and would normally last for around a year afterwards.

He said on seeing her again at the hospital, her kidney function appeared to be completely normal and she appeared dehydrated, but not severely.

Her albumin levels, which indicate the amount of protein in the blood and could have pointed to malnutrition at the time, fluctuated but were also said to be normal.

The inquest heard that 'morbidly obese' Mrs Humphrey, who had weighed 18st 10lb (119kg) ahead of her operation on July 23, weighed 75.4kg on February 22, which was described as more than would have been expected, but not of great concern.

It was heard that Mrs Humphrey, who was previously described as a 'very cheerful' person by her GP, Dr Caroline Roberts, was also a 'stoic' character who may not have let on to hospital staff just how ill she felt before she was discharged on February 28.

Mr Adamo said: 'Patients are very happy because of the weight loss so sometimes they tend to minimise their symptoms.

'Patients are more inclined to say 'it's fine'.'

The inquest heard Mrs Humphrey, known as Ginny, later contracted a blood stream infection, which may have contributed to her death of multiple organ failure.
