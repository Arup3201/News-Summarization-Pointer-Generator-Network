British tennis was celebrating a double success on Saturday morning as Heather Watson won her second career title on the WTA Tour and Kyle Edmund qualified for the Australian Open just a week after turning 20.

Watson became the first British woman since Anne Hobbs in 1985 to bag two WTA titles when she overcame a strong wind and America’s Madison Brengle to win the Hobart International 6-3 6-4 in a rain-interrupted match that lasted an hour-and-a-half.

The victory will put her at a career-high ranking of 38 and she was wasting no time before flying to Melbourne, where she will face Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova in the opening round.

Edmund’s reward for a gutsy 6-7 6-4 9-7 win over Australian Dane Propoggia is a first round against America’s world No 39 Steve Johnson. For the Yorkshire player it will be the first time he has qualified for a Grand Slam by right rather than a wildcard.

There was disappointment for Stockport’s Liam Broady, who came close to breaking wily American veteran Michael Russell, 36, before losing 7-5 6-3 in the final qualifying round taking place on the adjacent court.

Andy Murray’s first round opponent was revealed as Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri, the world No 314.
