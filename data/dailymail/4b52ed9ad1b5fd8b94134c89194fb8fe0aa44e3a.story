Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Barcelona have won their three Champions League meetings with Manchester City by an aggregate of 6-2.

Manchester City have had a player sent-off in each of their three meetings with Barcelona (Demichelis and Zabaleta last season, Clichy in the first leg this season).

In the last seven Champions League knockout encounters with English clubs, Barcelona have prevailed six times, the only exception being the semi-final against Chelsea in 2011/12 when they lost 3-2 on aggregate.

Barcelona have made it to the knockout stages of the Champions League for the 11th consecutive campaign. They have always made it at least to the quarter finals in the last seven seasons.

Barcelona have won their last five Champions League games, only Real Madrid are currently on a longer run (10 wins).

Barcelona have won seven of their last eight home games in the Champions League games (D1). Their last defeat was against Bayern Munich in May 2013 (0-3). That game against Bayern is actually their only loss in their last 30 Champions League outings at the Camp Nou and the last time they conceded more than one goal on home soil in the competition.

The only English club to beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the Champions League since 1992/93 are Liverpool. It was in February 2007 (2-1).
