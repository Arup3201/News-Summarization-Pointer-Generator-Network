Manchester United earned £60.8m and were featured live 25 times

Liverpool and Arsenal were on 22 times each

Chelsea were chosen for just 16 matches

QPR's share of the pot was almost £40m despite being on TV just 11 times

The figures will rocket next season when BT Sport joins the party

The mega bucks keep rolling in for Manchester United as they earned £60m in Premier League TV money last season and also topped the live match table with 25 games.

Liverpool and Arsenal were in second place with 22 matches in front of the cameras, while Manchester City and Spurs had 21 live broadcasts.

More surprisingly, Chelsea were only chosen for 16 live matches despite finishing third in the table.

We're in the money: Premier League champions Manchester United earned £60.8m from television

Second best: City were the closest challengers to United in the race for the title and in the TV pay scale

But the arrival of box office new 
manager Jose Mourinho is sure to make them a more popular pick for Sky 
and newcomers BT Sport during the 2013-14 campaign.

The start of the new TV deal in August will bring in yet more extraordinary amounts of money. 

Even clubs such as Norwich, 
Southampton, Stoke City, West Brom and Fulham, who only appeared in the 
minimum 10 games stipulated for live match allocations, can expect to 
pocket around the £60.8m - the highest broadcast payment any winner has 
received - that Manchester United earned last season.

Next
 term's champions will be receiving around £100m from TV appearances, 
merit payments that depend on where each club finishes in the league and
 facility fees each time a club’s matches are on TV in the UK.

All international broadcast revenue is split equally amongst the 20 clubs.

Money worries: Relegated QPR were paid the smallest share of the money from television
