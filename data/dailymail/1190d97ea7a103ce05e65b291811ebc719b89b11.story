And Rodgers believes the 20-year-old will be a hit in the Premier League when he settles into life in England. 

Speaking to BT Sport, Rodgers said: 'Markovic is a young player and he's just settling into the culture of English football.

'I was disappointed [with the penalty shout]. It looked clear. It looked like Lazar's heel was clipped.

'We had control of the game, the only disappointment was that we didn't get more goals. The players were outstanding when we had to defend the one-nil lead.'

Rodgers said he expects Liverpool to have a 'quiet' January transfer window but is looking forward to welcoming players back from injury.

He added: 'It will be quiet for us [in the transfer window] as we done a lot of business in the summer. We have got a lot of exciting young talent here who are slowly working into our philosophy.

'We are a team that gets better as the season goes on and we still have [Daniel] Sturridge, [Raheem] Sterling and [Adam] Lallana to come back into the side.'
