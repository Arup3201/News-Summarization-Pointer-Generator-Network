This is the moment when a Spanish bullfighter attempted a move more akin to that of an American wrestler, when he elbowed a bull between the eyes during a fight in Medellin, Colombia.

Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza, considered the best rejoneador - bullfighter on horseback - in the world,  was seen making the unusual move as he took on a large bovine during a bullfighting festival at La Macarena bullring in Colombia's second largest city.

Rejoneo is a form of bullfighting originally practiced in Portugal and Spain where the bull is fought entirely on horseback.

Just like classic bullfighting, reonejo has three stages, known as tercios. In classic bullfighting the three stages often involves picadors (horsemen) and banderilleros (lancemen) as well as the matador, but in rejoneo, the rejoneador performs all stages of the fight himself.

A rejoneador will often use four different horses during one bullfight, one for the three stages and one parade horse for the initial ceremony. 

Although many argue that bullfighting is a brutal bloodsport, bordering on animal cruelty and torture, its fans call it an artform, claiming the bulls used for fighting lead better lives than other cattle.

The practice is a traditional spectacle in Spain and Portugal, and spread to Hispanic American countries, including Colombia, through colonisation.

These images emerge just weeks after a mob killed a bull with machetes, rocks, knives and sticks during a bullchasing festival in a northern Colombia.
