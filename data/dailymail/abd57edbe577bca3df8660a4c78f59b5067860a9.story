The defence team for Oscar Pistorius has closed its case in the murder trial of the Olympic athlete.

Lawyer Barry Roux today said he had finished calling witnesses to testify in the trial before the court adjourned for a month to allow the legal teams to prepare and submit their closing arguments.

'We close the case for the defense,' said Roux.

He said some witnesses did not want to testify for the defence because of publicity surrounding the case, adding that he chose not to ask Judge Thokozile Masipa to compel them to appear.

'There's nothing that we can do about it,' he said in the Pretoria courtroom where the trial of the double-amputee runner has been held since March.

Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year.

He could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces separate gun-related charges.

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defense will do so on August 4.

He and Roux also agreed to return to court on August 7 to make final arguments before Judge Thokozile Masipa.

The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him.

The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year.

Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old.

Yesterday saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability.

Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner.

The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house.

Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.
