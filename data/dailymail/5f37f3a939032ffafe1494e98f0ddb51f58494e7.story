As the new Bundesliga season begins, German football has probably never been in such rude health.

When Bayern Munich start the defence of their title against Wolfsburg on Friday night, 40 days will have elapsed since Philipp Lahm lifted the World Cup trophy in the Maracana and their time in the international wilderness is most certainly over.

Blessed with a 'golden generation' of wonderfully-gifted players all blossoming at the same time, Germany swept all beside them to win the tournament for a fourth time and few would argue they were undeserved winners.

All-time high: German football has never been stronger following the national team's World Cup triumph

The ones to beat: Bayern Munich will once again be the strong favourites for the Bundesliga title, lifted here by their captain Philipp Lahm at the end of last season. They also won the DFB-Pokal to complete the double

Even stronger: Bayern have boosted their firepower further by signing Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski

Their triumph could also signal the start of a period of dominance similar to that of Spain over the last few years, with young talents coming through all the time and coach Joachim Low adept at helping them along.

Domestically, the Germans also seem to have got everything spot on as well. The Bundesliga continues to draw the biggest average attendances and has by popular consensus the best experience for the fans with cheap tickets and safe standing.

It can also claim to be the most entertaining - with an average of 3.16 goals per game over the last 12 years, compared to 2.77 in the Premier League - and the best run, making a profit year-on-year and successfully restricting ruinous debt and short-term profit hunting with the '50+1' rule.

These figures will only continue to improve as the fans flock to see Germany's World Cup stars who, on the whole, will be playing in the league next season.

It's all very positive but one question remains - who can stop Bayern Munich?

Unique experience: German grounds, such as Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, are noted for their atmosphere

Unstoppable: Thomas Muller scored 26 goals last season and five more for Germany at the World Cup

Happy man: Pep Guardiola guided Bayern to the domestic double in his first season at the Allianz Arena

The Bavarians sent records tumbling as they retained their title last season, wrapping things up with seven matches remaining on March 25 and going on to finish 19 points clear of distant challengers Borussia Dortmund.

They set league records for the most wins in a row (19), the best goal difference away from home (+38) and the longest undefeated streak (53 games going back into the season before).

And after all that, they then acquired Robert Lewandowski, the league's top goalscorer and arguably the best player of their closest challengers.

Toni Kroos may have been sold to Real Madrid, but Bayern still boast World Cup heroes Manuel Neuer, Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze and Jerome Boateng.

With the likes of Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and Javi Martinez also in there, all the signs point to another Bayern procession.

It's an issue I raised with the league's chief executive Christian Seifert prior to the Super Cup final in Dortmund last week.

He said Bayern's dominance would only concern him if it lasted for five years or more, admitting that a situation akin to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership would 'not be so good for us.'

But he believed the situation will change given time and the right system is in place to ensure other teams can challenge for the Bundesliga title.

Dortmund are best equipped and they struck an early blow when they beat a misfiring Bayern side 2-0 in the Super Cup curtain-raiser.

First strike: Borussia Dortmund lifted the German Super Cup last week, beating Bayern Munich 

Playing catch up: Can Dortmund's popular manager Jurgen Klopp lead a sustained challenge for the title? 

But then again, Jurgen Klopp's side won the same fixture 12 months ago and went on to trail by some distance, so take it with a pinch of salt.

Starting with Saturday's match with Bayer Leverkusen, they must hit the ground running. Any slip will prove costly but Bayern will be without some of their World Cup stars for the first few weeks, perhaps allowing the opportunity to build a handy little lead.

'At the moment I have only eight or nine players who are fully fit,' said Pep Guardiola last week, with Martinez and Schweinsteiger among the long-term absentees. Franck Ribery and Thiago Alcantara will also miss the start.

Lewandowski's departure hardly came as a surprise and Dortmund hope new buys Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos will be sufficient to make up the 28 goals scored by the Pole last season.

Missing the start: Bastian Schweinsteiger will be out for a while yet with a knee injury 

New signing: Dortmund have brought in Ciro Immobile from Torino to fill the gap left by Lewandowski

Positive start: Adrian Ramos (right) celebrates scoring with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 4-1 DFB-Pokal win over Stuttgart Kickers at the weekend 

Immobile was certainly impressive last season as his 22 goals in Serie A helped Torino into the Europa League, while Colombian Ramos scored 16 in 34 games for Hertha Berlin.

Klopp will also be encouraged that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are already hitting form, having both scored in the Super Cup and the DFB-Pokal victory at Stuttgart Kickers last weekend.

He also has Marco Reus, who missed the World Cup with an ankle injury, Neven Subotic, who missed the bulk of last season with ligament damage, and Ilkay Gundogan, who has missed a whole year with a back injury, to return.

But even when back to full strength, Dortmund will have to be outstanding to keep up with their title rivals.

In form: Armenian striker Henrikh Mkhitaryan has scored in the Super Cup and the opening DFB-Pokal tie

Look who's back: Marco Reus has returned from the ankle injury that kept him out of the World Cup 

It's hard to see beyond those two for the title, leaving the likes of Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach to challenge for the Champions League places.

Young manager Jens Keller is starting to make his mark at Schalke and the acquisition of Germany international Sidney Sam from Leverkusen, sealed back in January, represents a coup.

Cameroon winger Eric Choupo-Moting, who scored 10 goals last season, has joined from Mainz on a free transfer and, with the likes of Julian Draxler, Kevin Prince Boateng and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the team, they should be able to mount a challenge, especially if they avoid a slow start like last year.

New boy: Schalke have signed Germany international Sidney Sam from Bayer Leverkusen

Main man: Schalke will depend heavily on the goals of Dutchman Klass-Jan Huntelaar 

Leverkusen, who are desperate to end a 21-year trophy drought and finally shake off the 'Neverkusen' tag, have again raided Hamburg for their summer shopping.

A year after South Korean star Son Heung-Min made the switch, Bayer have signed talented Turk Hakan Calhanoglu for £12m. He's the guy who scored that outrageous 50-yard free-kick against Dortmund last season, one of 11 he got last season.

Another new recruit is £6m Swiss striker Josip Drmic from relegated Nuremberg and new coach Roger Schmidt will hope he can combine well with Stefan Kiessling.

The job represents a step-up for Schmidt, who led Red Bull Salzburg to the Austrian league and cup double last season.

Exciting: Bayer Leverkusen splashed out £12m to sign Hamburg's Hakan Calhanoglu this summer

Wolfsburg missed out on Champions League qualification by a single point last season and moved to sign Werder Bremen's playmaker Aaron Hunt as well as Arsenal's much-maligned striker Nicklas Bendtner.

The Volkswagen-owned club also have former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne and Brazilian Luiz Gustavo in their ranks, plus they've borrowed highly-regarded Frenchman Joshua Guilavogui from Atletico Madrid.

Fresh start: Nicklas Bendtner has joined Champions League challengers Wolfsburg from Arsenal

There is every chance they will push for the Champions League places, as will Monchengladbach, for whom striker Max Kruse will be key.

They lost Marc-Andre ter Stegen to Barcelona but spent £7m on Basle's Yann Sommer to fill the gloves. Chelsea youngster Thorgan Hazard, younger brother of Eden, will spent the season on loan at Borussia-Park.

Things surely have to go better for Hamburg, who survived a relegation play-off to preserve their Bundesliga ever-present status back in May.

Striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, the man who scored the vital goal against Greuther Furth that kept them up, has been signed on a permanent basis from Hertha and will hopefully offer the goals to propel them a little further up the table.

Coming into the top flight are 'yo-yo club' Cologne and Paderborn, who are at this level for the first time.
