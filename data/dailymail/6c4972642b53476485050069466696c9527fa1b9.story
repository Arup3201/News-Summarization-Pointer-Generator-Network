Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher may need surgery on a toe he broke in the last game of last season and is in danger of missing the start of pre-season under new manager Louis van Gaal.

The Scotland captain will see a specialist this week and if he requires an operation to correct the injury he is likely to be out for at least a month.

Any absence would be another blow for the 30-year-old who only returned to first team action at the turn of the year after a lengthy lay-off due to a bowel problem.

Under the knife? Darren Fletcher could miss United's pre-season if he needs surgery for a broken toe

He is desperate to get a full close season of preparation under his belt after making a full recovery from ulcerative colitis which had threatened to end his career and troubled him for more than two years.

Fletcher made 12 appearances after his return in December, including the 1-1 final day draw at Southampton. He started and finished the game and was only made aware of the broken toe after the game.

Manchester United medical staff and doctors decided the injury did not need surgery initially but the toe has been slow to heal properly and the club and player want a fresh opinion to decide if an operation is now necessary.
