A group of kayakers on the River Severn in Worcestershire got a surprise when they were joined by a lost seal who found himself nearly 100 miles from home.

The misplaced mammal is remarkably thought to have negotiated at least three locks at Gloucester, Upper Lode and Diglis, and around three weirs to get so far upstream from the Bristol Channel.

But the seal didn't seem too worried about where he was and playfully swam alongside the kayakers for half an hour.

Tasty treat: The lost seal found himself nearly 100 miles from his normal home having swam up the River Severn at the weekend. He didn't seem too worried though and tucked in to this salmon near Worcester

Chomp! Totally oblivious that he was 75 miles upstream from the mouth of the River Severn, the mammal created quite a stir among kayakers and passers-by in Worcester

Epic journey: The harbour seal had negotiated a number of locks and weirs to get so far up the river

The harbour seal - more naturally at home in the Irish Sea - had followed boats in its journey to the Midlands after it got lost while hunting for fish.

It was snapped in the river catching and eating a salmon by Mike Finn, 62, on Saturday afternoon.

He said: 'I managed to squeeze between the trees and get a few pictures, when I dashed down to the river's edge it was gently bobbing along with the fish and struggling to consume it.

'It was quite an incredible sight and not something you're ever likely to see in landlocked Worcester.'

Long way from home: The seal negotiated a route full of locks and weir (including at Maisemore and Tewkesbury) on the River Severn from Gloucester up to Worcester

Where am I? It is believed that the seal followed a boat while hunting for fish and ended up 75 miles inland

Hiding away: The seal takes a break from all the adulation. He had earlier swam playfully alongside a group of kayakers near Worcester

Caroline Attwood-Reusser, 53, was among the friends from Wychavon Kayak and Canoe Club who had a close encounter with the seal.

She said: 'He was diving under our boats, playing under the waves, doing tumble turns and showing us his spotty belly. He looked very healthy.

'It’s just so exciting, to see something so unusual, especially with the kids, it just blew them away.'

The seal was also spotted the next day tucking into fish nearby by dog-walker Carol Treagus.

Carol added: 'It had a big fish in its mouth.

'There were a lot of people stood watching and taking pictures - as it’s not something you usually see.'

Bobbing and biting: The harbour seal was able to find a tasty salmon to feast upon so far up river

Battle: It did look as though the seal was struggling to subdue his catch

Dan Jarvis, an animal care assistant at the National Seal Sanctuary, said it was very rare to see seals so far inland.

He said: 'It is likely that the seal has come from Irish or Welsh seas.

'Although it is not unusual for seals to swim upriver - it is highly unusual for them to come this far inland.

'Chances are he has followed fish up the river and with quite strong spring tides this year he has probably come up further than usual.

'Either that or he is a young juvenile who is just inexperienced - either way as long as he has a good feed he shouldn’t be in any danger.

'It also pretty rare for them to get this close and personal with people as they can notoriously be antisocial animals.'

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Seals don’t tend to stay long and will eventually make their own way out.

'There is usually no reason for us to intervene unless the animal is injured, sick or distressed.

'People should just enjoy observing him as he won’t be there long.'
