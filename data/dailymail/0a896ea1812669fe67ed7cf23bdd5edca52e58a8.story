A top Olympic official has slammed preparations for the 2016 Games in Rio saying they are the 'worst that I've experienced'.

John Coates, vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), made the damning public attack after an unprecedented task force was set up to deliver the Games on time.

IOC staff will be parachuted into Brazil's second-largest city to speed up construction delays which have been described as worse than the Athens Games in 2004.

A long way to go: The fabric of Rio's Olympic Stadium is largely completed, but despite this the IOC has said the situation is worse than in Athens in 2004, with work held up by strikes and bureaucracy

Mr Coates told delegates today at an Olympic forum that preparations were still in chaos, with strikes delaying construction and one crucial department employing just two people.

Dwellers of the city's famous favelas (slums) have taken to the streets in increasingly violent protests as tensions rise over the multi-billion dollar works, which will destroy many of their homes.

Thousands of troops were deployed to Rio's slums in February to wrest 
them back from the control of drug gangs and criminals.

FIFA has also warned Brazil over its drastically late preparations for the football World Cup, whose group stages start in just six weeks.

Dire: John Coates warned there is no plan B

But Mr Coates warned there was no 'plan B' to find another host for the Olympics, and they would have to be held in Rio regardless.

The Australian, 63, told delegates in Sydney construction delays were worse than in the 2004 Athens Games, where the Olympic stadium was finished just two months before the opening ceremony.

He added infrastructure was significantly behind schedule and water quality was a major concern.

'In Athens, we were dealing with one government and some city responsibilities,' he said. 'Here, there's three.

'There is bureaucracy, there is little
 coordination between the federal, the state government and the city - 
which is responsible for a lot of the construction.

'The flow of funds 
from the federal government is not happening quickly enough. We think we
 need to help facilitate tha.

'And
 this is against a city that's got social issues that also have to be 
addressed; a country that's also trying to deal with the FIFA World Cup 
coming up in a few months.

'It's the worst that I've experienced.'

The
 first Games in South America have been plagued by delays, rising costs 
and poor communication between the Brazilian government and organisers, 
prompting criticism from sports federations.

Redevelopment: Last week the Perimetral overpass was demolished as part of Rio's Porto Maravilha (Marvelous Port) urbanisation project ahead of the Olympics. Mr Coates said infrastructure was not on track

Workers: Builders on strike outside the Olympic Park earlier this month. Employees have clashed with guards

Earlier this month the IOC set up its task force, just one of a series of measures to kick-start the lagging preparations.

They also include employing extra monitors and sending project managers and teams of experts.

'The
 IOC has adopted a more hands-on role,' Mr Coates said. 'it is 
unprecedented for the IOC but there is no plan B. We are going to Rio.

'We
 have become very concerned - they are not ready in many, many ways. We 
have to make it happen and that is the IOC approach, you can't walk away
 from this.'

Mr Coates has made six visits to Rio as a member of the IOC's coordination commission.

Rio has the same number of staff as London did two years before the Games, but Mr Coates said they lack experience.

He pointed to only two staff working in the Games' tests department, even though test events are due to start this year.

Unrest: Tensions have risen between the authorities and those living in favelas (slums). This photo shows residents of Pavao-Pavaozinho protesting last week over the shooting of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira

Work has not yet begun at Deodoro, a 
complex for eight Olympics sports venues, and the course that will host 
golf's return to the Olympic program for the first time in more than a 
century does not yet have any grass.

Water pollution, meanwhile, could cause upset at events like sailing.

'The IOC has adopted a more hands-on 
role. It is unprecedented for the IOC but there is no 
plan B. We are going to Rio'

- IOC vice president John Coates

Â 

Concern over the delays hit crisis point earlier this months at a SportAccord meeting in 
Belek, Turkey, where 18 
sports federations publicly aired concerns over Rio's preparations.

Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes fired back at the complaints, saying the federations were demanding facilities which the city's residents would not use after the Games.

The IOC will send executive director Gilbert Felli to Brazil as part 
of a series of emergency measures to tackle the delays threatening the 
games.

Mr Coates said other experienced, high-level staff will soon be 
appointed.

As Australian 
Olympic Committee president, he also said the country's sports leaders 
and team managers were 'not getting answers' to any of their questions 
on visits.

'Can they use the carparks in the village for recovery centres?' he said. 'What will be the time to take from this venue to this venue?

'All of those things, they're being fobbed off.

'But again, we just have to make it happen - and that's the IOC's approach. You can't walk away from this.

'If it comes off - the first Games on the South American continent, in a magical city in so many ways - it'll be a wonderful experience for the athletes.'
