The intrepid adventurers: Mr Scott and Miss Norris have been travelling around Latin America for five-and-a-half years

Their motorhome had plunged into a ravine in the Amazon jungle, hundreds of miles from civilisation, and they had not seen another motorist for 48 hours.

But intrepid Lesley Norris and Bruce Scott did not panic. Instead, they instigated an extraordinary trans-Atlantic rescue mission by ringing Miss Norris’s brother-in-law 5,125 miles away in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on their satellite phone.

He took down their GPS co-ordinates so they could be traced, then alerted Dover Coastguard who in turn contacted their colleagues in Falmouth, the co-ordinating station for international alerts, who duly raised the alarm with rescue services in Brazil.

A helicopter was scrambled to pick up the pair, who have been travelling in Central and South America for five and a half years in their Mercedes Unimog – an off-road adventure vehicle adapted to include a double bed and porcelain flushing loo.

Badly shaken, the couple had to spend a night under the stars in the sweltering rainforest, which is home to vampire bats, poison dart frogs and black caiman crocodiles, before the helicopter arrived.

Neither of the pair, who are both originally from London and gave up their jobs for a life on the open road in 2006, was injured during the drama.

No more: Miss Norris said she was 'amazed' the couple managed to jump out of the vehicle unharmed

Miss Norris, 64, used to live in the 
suburb of Teddington and was a British Airways stewardess for 20 years. 
Mr Scott, 62, who sold his studio flat in West Kensington to invest in 
the Unimog, was a professional photographer who has also trained as a 
bus driver.

On a website about their trip, on 
which Mr Scott is pictured looking debonair in a pith helmet and white 
tuxedo with his arm around a uniformed Miss Norris, they described how 
they have visited Mexico and were attempting to drive the length of 
South America.

On her last blog entry before the 
accident, Miss Norris said life was getting tough in Brazil, with 
‘unseasonably hot’ temperatures of up to 40c making it unpleasant to 
sleep in the truck.

‘And then Bruce got a cold,’ she 
added, so they went to visit a ‘butterfly lovers’ paradise’ called 
Pousada Ecologica Rio Grande Rancho to relax.

But their journey came to a grinding 
halt on Tuesday when a bridge collapsed and the motorhome hurtled 30ft 
down the gully before turning on its side in a remote spot 200 miles 
south west of the nearest city, Manaus.

Last night Miss Norris’s sister, 
Jenny, 62, whose husband Ken answered their call, said the couple 
managed to haul themselves out of the vehicle and ‘feel lucky to be 
alive’.

‘Bruce helped Lesley to climb out and 
then went back down and got a couple of chairs for them both so they 
could sit on the roadside,’ she said.

‘He went back down and got some tarpaulin and they slept on the road, hoping to be rescued.’

She added: ‘When Ken got the call he just rang the Coastguard straight away.

‘The first thing I heard about it was 
when I got home two hours later as he did not want to worry me. I am so 
glad he picked up the phone because I would not have known what to do.’

Miss Norris and Mr Bruce were picked 
up by a Brazilian army helicopter yesterday and flown to Manaus, a 
popular tourist destination because of its proximity to the jungle. Last
night they were recovering in a hotel after being treated for exposure 
and cuts and bruises.

UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman Fred Caygill said: ‘It’s not the first time we’ve assisted people across the world.

‘This is a bit unusual for us as it’s 
not of a maritime nature, but there are no boundaries in search and 
rescue.’ The Foreign Office was informed of the couple’s plight and 
offered consular assistance, while the Brazilian army last night said it
will recover the couple’s vehicle.

Second-hand Unimogs cost at least £10,000 without being modified into motorhomes, while new ones cost up to £70,000.
