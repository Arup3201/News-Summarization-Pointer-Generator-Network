A woman is taking legal action after diet pills caused her to have a psychotic breakdown which landed her in a mental hospital.

Army reservist Sainah Theodore from Queens told the New York Daily News she is suing the Natural Health Food Center in Brooklyn for unspecified damages after diet pills she bought there gave her six days of insomnia, which in turn led to erratic and violent behavior.

At the peak of her delirium, the 26-year-old says she heard voices, stopped her car in the middle of a busy intersection and stabbed pillows and pictures in her own home before medics had to be called.

She then spent five days in a mental hospital and her deployment to Afghanistan had to be delayed.

'Once I came out of the sedation, it was clear to me it was the pill that caused it,' she said.

The trouble began when the health store sold Miss Theodore a product called Natural Lipo X which, unbeknownst to her, contained illegal stimulants that weren't labeled on the packaging.

According to the Daily News, lab tests later confirmed that the pills contained high levels of caffeine and a laxative called Phenolphthalein which is illegal to sell over-the-counter.

Another ingredient was weight-loss 
stimlant Sibutramine, which was banned by the FDA in 2010 'due to a long
 list of side effects that includes sleeplessness'.

'Once I came out of the sedation, it was clear to me it was the pill that caused it'

It was these stimulants, the suit claims, that led to Miss Theodore's bizarre and destructive behavior - which included sending her mother aggressive texts and 'causing total destruction of her home,' said her lawyer Brian Pascale.

'I couldn't believe all of this 
happened to me. It was a blur,' said Miss Theodore, who studies sociology. 'I had no recollection of my behavior.'

Defense: Employees at the store (pictured) say that her reaction was the result of the insurance company claiming that she was fasting while taking the pills

She and her lawyers are suing the health food center, where employees claim that her reaction was the result of the insurance company saying that she was fasting while taking the pills.

'We can't leave the store to see the customer eats well,' said store manager Kennedy Angeliz. 'The insurance is handling this. That's all I will say.'

'Individuals who adulterate
 products with illegal ingredients are not complying with
 current regulations'

Miss Theodore's lawyers have denied this claim, asserting that she ate normally while on the diet pills.

Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Product Association, said these spiked pills are part of an even bigger problem in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.

'Individuals who intentionally adulterate products with illegal and undeclared ingredients are not complying with current laws and regulations,' he explained.

'The federal government and the regulated supplement industry work together to raise awareness about these tainted products.'
