European laws on food labelling mean the details on the packaging of probiotic drinks are always rather vague

It started with those little bottles of sickly-sweet-tasting yogurt shots, and today probiotics can be found in everything from fortified milks and supplements to face creams – and all claim the ‘friendly bacteria’ they contain can do us a world of good.

But tough European laws on food labelling mean the details on the packaging are always rather vague when it comes to explaining just what the benefits are, mainly because many studies have proved inconclusive. So are the positive effects little more than wishful thinking, or can probiotics really have the magical impact on our wellbeing that is claimed? Here we round up the best evidence for…

EASING IBS

THE PROBLEM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition typically causing bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation. The exact causes are unknown, but most experts agree that IBS is a result of increased sensitivity in the gut.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Last year, consultant gastroenterologist Professor Ingvar Bjarnason led a placebo-controlled study at King’s College Hospital to investigate the effect of a live probiotic liquid on patients with IBS.

He says: ‘We designed the trial using a probiotic drink called Symprove which contains four strains of bacteria, where many probiotics contain just one.’

During the trial, 186 patients with moderate to severe IBS took a daily dose of Symprove or a matching placebo liquid, for 12 weeks. ‘By week 12 there was a significant improvement in stomach pain in the Symprove group,’ says Prof Bjarnason.

TRY: Symprove – but it costs £20 for a 500ml bottle which contains between eight to ten doses, and it must be taken daily to keep symptoms at bay.

IMPROVING MOOD

THE PROBLEM: During the winter, up to 12 per cent of the population suffer from the low mood or depression known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), thought to be caused by lack of daylight and Vitamin D. Most of the Vitamin D we absorb is obtained from the sun and helps to boost our mood.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: A recent study found that taking a daily probiotic supplement could give SAD sufferers that little dose of sunshine they desperately need, boosting levels of Vitamin D by more than 25 per cent. The study’s lead author, Dr Mitchell Jones, commented: ‘Although it has long been known that the gastrointestinal tract plays an active role in the absorption of Vitamin D, these findings showing increased levels of Vitamin D after taking a probiotic orally are a first, and will inform the development of new products that may be beneficial for people with low Vitamin D levels.’

TRY: Bio-Kult (Vitamin D booster), which costs £14.95 for a box of 60 capsules. Take two a day.

SOOTHING ECZEMA

THE PROBLEM: About 20 per cent of babies and young children suffer from eczema – the dry, itchy skin condition typically treated with emollient lotions or low-dose steroid cream. Three-quarters of them will be clear of the condition by their teens, but taking a probiotic could help alleviate it in the meantime.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Dr Mayur Joshi is a medical adviser for Probiotics International Ltd and explains: ‘In a recent trial, infants were given traditional topical skin care for their eczema and then given either the probiotic mixture or placebo, which they added to milk, water or yogurt. The probiotic group showed a greater improvement in the severity of their symptoms than the placebo group, indicating that probiotics could be an effective therapy alongside standard treatment for eczema.’

TRY: Bio-Kult Infantis – it costs £11.95 for a box of 16 1g sachets of probiotic powder. Take half to one sachet per day, mixed with milk or other drink.

BOOSTING IMMUNITY

THE PROBLEM: Part of our immune system – cells and organisms that protect us from bacterial and viral infections – is found in our gut. Scientists have looked to athletes who train hard to the point that their immune systems are under stress, in their quest for evidence that probiotics could play a role in boosting our general wellbeing.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Clinical pharmacist Mike Wakeman says: ‘A paper published in the International Journal Of Sports Science And Sports Medicine in 2012 concluded that athletes who took probiotic supplements suffered fewer symptoms of illness and recovered sooner than those who did not.’

TRY: Bio-Acidophilus Forte – £30.35 from revital.co.uk. One bottle contains 30 capsules; take one a day. Each capsule contains a staggering 30 billion viable cells of the unique LAB4 complex of probiotic cells which have been proven to help boost immunity.

BEATING TRAVELLER’S TUM

THE PROBLEM: Traveller’s tum is caused by consuming food or water contaminated by germs, including bacteria, viruses and parasites. Alongside gastric symptoms, there can be high temperature, vomiting and abdominal pain.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Mike Wakeman says taking a probiotic during your holiday and for a week either side could help protect you. ‘A 2006 analysis of 34 trials comparing probiotics with placebo concluded that taking a probiotic before you travel can help to prevent diarrhoea while you’re overseas, with the probiotic strain L. acidophilus faring best,’ he says. A recent independent study found that there was a significant reduction in digestive problems in travellers who took the probiotic capsule Bimuno before and during an overseas trip.

TRY: Bimuno TRAVELAID – £9.99 for 30 soft chewy pastilles. Benefits build over time; take three a day for seven days before your travels and every day while you are away.

A Canadian study has found that popping a daily probiotic pill could aid weight loss. Those who took a probiotic lost an average of 10lb during the 12-week trial

AIDING WEIGHT LOSS

THE PROBLEM: You’re on a weight-loss plan and being strict about sticking to the ‘rules’, yet you’re not shedding pounds very quickly. Previous studies have shown that the intestinal flora of obese people differs from thin people – most likely due to a diet high in fat and low in fibre. So losing more weight could be as simple as resetting the balance of the gut with ‘good bacteria’.

HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: A Canadian study has found that popping a daily probiotic pill could aid weight loss. Those who took a probiotic containing the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain lost an average of 10lb during the 12-week trial – that’s 4lb more than those who were on a placebo.

TRY: Quest’s Mega8Biotix contains lactobacillus rhamnosus – the probiotic strain featured in the Canadian study, as well as seven other strains of lactobacilli bacteria. A month’s supply of capsules costs £18.99 and is available from all good independent pharmacies.
