The world’s first roller-skating artist has says she wants to reinvigorate traditional Chinese art for the next generation - by painting with wheels instead of a pen.

Tian Haisu’s latest painting, ‘Blood-Lane-Line’ has gone on exhibition in the California College of Arts, The People's Daily Online has reported.

The artist has ditched the calligraphy pen, which has been used for more than a thousand years in traditional Chinese painting, for a pair of skates, after being inspired by her favourite sport, ice skating.

Chinese artist Tian Haisu paints her huge art using roller skates instead of the traditional calligraphy pen

The artist has adapted the skates so that they can hold a pot of paint, which releases as she weaves around the canvas

Tian, who started painting aged just three years old, adapted her skates especially so that a pot of black paint could be attached to them - a technique which she says makes her feel ‘at one with her art’.

Through the new medium, she says she wants to give the traditional Chinese landscape painting a whole new lease of life.

She said: ‘My whole body is involved and I produce all kids of ink landscapes.

‘Such creation is full of power, speed and rhythm.

Tian has called her unique technique 'landskating', and say it makes her feel at one with her art

‘I am so passionate about ink landscaping because it shows very rich emotions by means of simple forms.

‘I call it landskating.’

Born in Sichuan in 1988, Tian is a graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute and is currently studing at the California College of Arts.

She first exhibited her work aged just 18 and her painting ‘Waiting’ was snapped up by the Beijing Olympic Committee in the year the Olympics were held in the China. 

Since then she has exhibited across China and the US - from Chengdu to Beijing and New York to San Francisco.

The finished artwork is entitled 'Blood-Land-Line' and is deliberately hung so that the top half is on the wall, as a way of symbolising the link between heaven, earth and art

Tian is a critically-acclaimed artist currently studying at the California College of Arts

As well as winning numerous awards for her paintings, she has now been appointed a goodwill ambassador for the Beijing Huaya Education Fund.

Her latest painting, measuring 13 metres (43 feet) tall by six metres (20 feet) wide was deliberately hung so that the top half was on the wall and the bottom half flowed onto the floor. 

Tian's intention, she explained was to gives the impression that heaven and earth are filled with the artistry of her creation in a way never seen before in other exhibitions.
