She may have had a career as a successful lawyer and has her sights firmly set on being the next leader of Queensland but Annastacia Palaszczuk expresses deep regret about never becoming a mother.

The influential 45-year-old Labor leader has opened up about the heartbreak of losing her baby at 11 weeks and the unsuccessful four-year journey of trying to conceive through IVF.

‘I wish with all my heart I had children and I think I would’ve been a good mum,’ she told The Courier Mail.

Ms Palaszczuk, who suffers from endometriosis, revealed how a doctor told her that the baby she lost when she was 34 years-old may have been her only chance to have a child.

Following her traumatic experience, the Inala MP believes there should be compulsory counselling throughout the IVF process as couples need to prepare themselves for the possibility that they may not become parents.

‘It’s a real roller-coaster of emotions, and one of the hardest parts is knowing when to get off the roller-coaster, when to stop believing it’s just going to happen,’ she said.

She also spoke of the pain of her broken marriages to journalist George Megalogenis and Senator Joe Ludwig’s former chief of staff, Simon Every.

Meanwhile, Ms Palaszczuk said she was more than ready to take on the state’s top job at the next election in 2015.

Palaszczuk, who was born into a family of Polish descent and raised in the Brisbane suburb of Durack, is the daughter of veteran state Labor MP Henry Palaszczuk.

She worked as a policy adviser to a number of Labor ministers before deciding to have a career in law and was studying for admission as a solicitor when her father announced his intention to retire at the 2006 election.

Palaszczuk contested and won Labor preselection for her father's seat of Inala in south-eastern Brisbane.
