A police officer broke down at the murder trial of Robert Xie, pictured, on Wednesday reliving the day he discovered the slain bodies of the Lin Family

A police officer has fought back tears in court as he relived the moment he discovered the battered and bloodied bodies of two children and their parents and one of their aunts, at the Lin family home in Sydney.

Sergeant Lachlan Kirby had to take a break at the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday as he gave evidence at the trial of accused murderer Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie.

Xie is accused of creeping into his brother-in-law's home in North Epping in Sydney's northwest in the early hours of July 18, 2009.

Using a hammer-like weapon, he allegedly murdered his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, nine.

He is also alleged to have killed Lily's sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Lin, 39. Xie has pleaded not guilty.

Sgt Kirby was a senior constable when he was one of the first two police officers to enter the bloody scene.

As he went up the stairs of the family home, he was followed by Senior Constable Robert Levins. Once on the second floor the two separated and went to explore the bedrooms separately.

When Snr Const Levins nudged open the door to the master bedroom with his foot he saw blood on the walls and Lily's battered head hanging over the side of the bed.

'We've a dead one in there,' he called to Sgt Kirby.

'Same in here,' Sgt Kirby replied from Irene's room.

Sgt Kirby told Snr Const Levins to go downstairs and check on Xie's wife Kathy who was distressed while he continued looking in the bedrooms.

It was then he discovered the bodies of the two young boys.

'What you saw in that house ... remains in your memory as a very shocking sight?' Xie's barrister Graham Turnbull SC asked.

'It does, yes,' Sgt Kirby replied.

'Still to this day you are affected by what you saw in that house, including two dead children.'

'Yes,' Sgt Kirby replied, pausing and wiping his face.

The trial continues.
