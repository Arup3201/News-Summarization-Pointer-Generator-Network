Two Latvian men accused of exploiting migrant workers have been found guilty of taking part in an illegal gangmastering operation.

Ivars Mezals, 28, and Juris Valujevs, 36, allegedly used fear and debt to control workers who sometimes received less than £1 for a week for 'back-breaking' work picking vegetables in Cambridgeshire.

The migrant workers, who were mainly from Latvia and Lithuania, travelled to the UK voluntarily, but signed up for Mezals and Valujevs under the promise of well-paid work, decent accommodation and the 'hope of a better life', prosecutor Gregory Perrins told Blackfriars Crown Court.

But instead they were forced to live in cramped and dilapidated homes, paid fines for 'fanciful' reasons including smoking and were threatened if they complained, he added.

Work was distributed at the whim of those in control, and the workers fell into debt, the court heard.

Mezals and Valujevs were each found guilty yesterday of acting as a gangmaster without a licence between January 2009 and October 2013, though for legal reasons the verdict can only be reported today.

The jury cleared Mezals of a charge of conspiracy to breach UK immigration law by arranging sham marriages.

But it could not reach verdicts against Valujevs, Valujevs' wife Oksana Valujeva, 33, and their friend Lauma Vankova, 26, on that charge.

Mezals, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and Valujevs, Valujeva and Vankova, all from King's Lynn, Norfolk, were arrested in October last year in raids led by Cambridgeshire Police.

Jurors in the nine-week trial have been considering their verdicts since last Thursday.

Judge David Richardson ordered that Mezals and Valujevs should be found not guilty of a charge of fraud.

Describing the vegetable picking set-up, Mr Perrins said: 'Debt was used as a means of control, preventing [workers] from leaving or living elsewhere.

'When work was provided, it was hard and back-breaking. Even so, wages were withheld on the basis that it went to clear the purported debt.

'Workers were typically left with £20 a week, even after working all week in the fields. Sometimes people were given less than a pound for a week's work.

'Women's purported debt often appeared to be higher than their male co-workers. Such women were offered the opportunity to clear their debts if they entered into sham marriages.'

One woman was fined £100 a day when she was unable to work because her child was ill, the court heard.

Migrants who complained about their unfair debt were told if 'you don't pay, your life will be ended like Alisa [Dmitrijeva's]'.

Workers were allegedly told they would 'end up like Alisa Dmitrijeva' if they did not pay their debts. Alisa was found dead on arable land  near Sandringham in January 2012

It was a reference to the Latvian teenager found murdered on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, in 2012, the jury heard.

Since 2005, potential gangmasters must obtain a licence to supply workers to businesses, which are usually agricultural farms in need of casual and cheap labour at short notice, and must oblige by a code of ethics.

Mr Perrins said: 'However, this case is not simply about supplying workers without the requisite licence.

'At its heart, this case is about how these workers were treated. It is the Crown's case that they were deliberately and systemically exploited, manipulated and intimidated.

'They were treated without dignity, without respect and without compassion. The defendants saw them solely as a mean of making money. And large sums of money at that.'

During the opening of the trial, the jury heard that Valujevs denied any involvement with gangmasters or the exploitation of migrant workers, while Mezals claimed he put friends coming to the UK in touch with legitimate gangmasters. All denied the accusation about sham marriages.

Mr Perrins said the prosecution may apply for a retrial on the conspiracy charge. 

Detective Chief Inspector Donna Wass, who led the investigation, said: 'Valujevs and Mezals ran an illegal operation that left many people in abject poverty and debt and a feeling there was no way out of their situation.

'The defendants promised their victims a better life in the United Kingdom with well-paid work, but instead placed them in overcrowded accommodation and controlled their work and debt.

'They ruled through fear - playing on their reputations to ensure their workers stayed in line and did not seek outside help - and approached the exploitation of people as a business opportunity.

'I hope the outcome of this case shows how seriously we take these matters and will encourage other victims of exploitation to contact police.'
