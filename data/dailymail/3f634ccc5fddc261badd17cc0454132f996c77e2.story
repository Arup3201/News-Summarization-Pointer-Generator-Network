This Sydney luxury unit is a stunning city high-rise but also a chilling crime scene.

The Liverpool Street apartment where Simon Gittany threw his fiancée fifteen floors to her death is now up for sale.

Gittany was found guilty of murdering Lisa Cecilia Harnum in one of the most high-profile court cases in recent history.

On July 30 2011 the former ballerina was thrown to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiance, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life.

However, he was handed a 26 year prison sentence in November 2013.  

The property  where the chilling crime took place is now expected to fetch more than $2 million when it goes to auction on Tuesday.

The balcony is being used as one of the unit's key selling points.

The real estate agent Tolga Ozer reportedly mentioned Ms Harnum's death with one of the prospective buyers during an inspection on Saturday, according to SMH. 

'I have to inform you of an incident that occurred in this apartment... a girl fell or was thrown and hit the floor,' Tolga Ozer said according to SMH. 

Mr Ozer was contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia.

'Prestige at The Hyde - watch the world go by in style,' reads the advert. 

The two bedroom apartment in the heart of the city is lauded for its 'stunning outlook above the tree-tops of Hyde Park, St Marys Cathedral and beyond to dazzling Sydney harbour.' 

Three couples and a man have inspected the apartment this weekend.

Apartment 1503 is described as being 'highly coveted'. It towers over Hyde Park, on the corner of bustling Elizabeth and Liverpool streets in Sydney's city.

The unit was last sold for $1.6 million in June 2010. Gittany rented the property until he was taken into custody.

Images of the property's interior and the exterior have frequently been displayed by the media and in evidence tendered in court during the three week trial. 

Gittany tried to claim that Ms Harnum committed suicide and he had been unable to save her in her final moments. The judge rejected this

Mr Gittany claimed that when he pulled his fiancée back into the apartment she sat on the couch and he started to make tea in the kitchen (far right) to calm her down. He claimed Lisa then leapt up and ran to the balcony

Mr Gittany claimed that after the lift, he went to the kitchen to make tea for Lisa. He maintains that she jumped up and ran to the balcony. He claimed she jumped to her death before he could save her. The court rejected him claims

Former tenant, 40 year old Gittany, will spend at least 18 years in prison for Ms Harnum's death, making him eligible for parole in 2033.

It was ruled that Gittany became 'apoplectic with rage' when his fiancée tried to leave him. She had a one-way ticket booked to return to her family in Canada and escape their controlling relationship.

Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags and made enraged threats, according to Judge Lucy McCallum.

'I have no hesitation accepting evidence of…rage,' said Judge McCallum. 

69 seconds before Ms Harnum toppled to her death she ran to the lift, trying to flee.

CCTV footage in the lift captured the distressing moment Gittany dragged his fiancee out of the lift by her neck.

The horrific images show him pulling Ms Harnum back into the apartment with his hand clamped over her mouth to muffle her screams.

Residents in the building told the court that they heard Ms Harnum banging on on a neighbour's door, shouting: 'Please help me, help me, God help me.' 

The agent point out the luxury apartments 'well-appointed and stylish main bathroom, as well as internal laundry, ample storage and reverse cycle air con'

Morton & Morton point out that resident's have a 25 metre infinity pool, gymnasium, spa and sauna

The court accepted the prosecution's version of events, in which Gittany rendered Ms Harnum unconscious in the apartment after dragging her in from the lift. He then threw her off the balcony to her death

The court accepted the prosecution's version of events, in which Gittany rendered Ms Harnum unconscious in the apartment after dragging her in from the lift. He then threw her off the balcony to her death.

Gittany, pleaded not guilty to murdering Miss Harnum, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide. 

He had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. 

The judge did not believe Gittany's account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death, ruling that she 'found him unconvincing'.

She said Miss Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints.

She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death. 

The property will go to auction at 6pm on Tuesday evening.  

The real estate agents say: 'Defined by its prized location and uninterrupted panoramic views, this luxury residence at The Hyde offers a fantastic opportunity to invest in the elite Hyde Park precinct'
