China is phasing out its controversial practice of taking organs from executed prisoners for use in transplant operations.

China is the only country in the world that still systematically removes organs taken from dead death row prisoners, a practice that has drawn international criticism.

Many Chinese view the practice as a way for criminals to redeem themselves.

Organ shortage: Voluntary donations will make it possible for hospitals to no longer rely on death-row prisoners for transplants

However, officials have recently spoken out against the practice, saying it 'tarnishes the image of China' and that they will push for more ethical ways to harvest organs.

The health ministry will begin using only organs from voluntary donors after a meeting in November, former deputy health minister Huang Jiefu announced.

'I am confident that before long all accredited hospitals will forfeit the use of prisoner organs,' Huang said.

An Australian-trained liver transplant 
surgeon, Huang said the China Organ Transplant Committee will ensure 
that the 'source of the organs for transplantation must meet the 
commonly accepted ethical standards in the world'.

The first batch of all 165 Chinese hospitals licensed for transplants will promise to stop using organs harvested from death row inmates at the November meeting, he added.

Long waiting lists: It has been very difficult to get a transplant in China for decades as in Chinese culture people are buried with all their organs in tact

Supply falls far short of demand 
due in part to the traditional Chinese belief that bodies should be 
buried or cremated intact.

China has now launched pilot volunteer organ donor programmes in 25 provinces and municipalities with the aim of creating a nationwide voluntary scheme by the end of 2013.

By the end of 2012, about 64 percent of transplanted organs in China came from executed prisoners and the number has dipped to under 54 percent so far this year, according to figures provided by Huang.

At a meeting in August last year, Huang told officials that top leaders had decided to reduce dependency on prisoners' organs.

Rights groups say many organs are taken from prisoners without their consent or their family's knowledge, something the government denies.

So far, more than 1,000 organ donors have come through the new system, benefiting at least 3,000 patients, Huang said.

Widespread criticism: China is currently the only country in the world to systematically remove the organs of its executed prisoners

Voluntary organ donation in China has already risen from 63 cases in all of 2010 to a current average of 130 per month so far this year, Huang added.

However, not all donated organs are currently allocated through the new programme, leaving room for human interference, one of the main challenges the reform faces.

An estimated 300,000 patients are put on a waiting list every year for organ transplants and only about one in 30 ultimately will receive a transplant.

The shortage has driven a trade in illegal organ trafficking and in 2007 the government banned organ transplants from living donors, except spouses, blood relatives and step or adopted family members.
