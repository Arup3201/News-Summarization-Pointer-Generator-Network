The parents of a four-year-old girl who was pictured drinking from a beer bottle have been investigated by the police.

The girl was seen sipping from a Heineken bottle in the picture posted on Instagram on Sunday.

A caption with the picture read: 'German beer is gooudd! Haha already likes expensive bottles!'

Police launched an investigation after the parents of a girl, four, posted this picture of her drinking from a Heineken bottle

Police in Florida launched an investigation and tracked down the family after the photograph was sent to them.

However, the parents told officers their child was only drinking water and the picture was uploaded as a joke.

The caption read: 'German beer is gooudd!'

The photograph was posted on the website under the Davinci Tattoo and Piercing account.

It prompted warnings from fellow users, who said they could be in trouble for uploading the photograph.

One person wrote: 'Be careful with this one kiddo's. Unfortunately we're not in Europe.'

They then added: 'She DOES have excellent taste tho!'

The user then responded: 'Haha. appreciate that but... like she's getting drunk?? NOT :)'

Police from Brevard County said they did not have enough evidence to pursue underage drinking charges.

Lt Mike Scully toldÂ News 13: 'The parents said it was meant to be a joke but they know it was not funny.

'They also said their daughter was only drinking water.'

News 13 said the matter was passed on to the Florida Department of Children and Families but the agency is not investigating as it does not meet their criteria.
