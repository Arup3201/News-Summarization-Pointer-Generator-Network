The £40,000 receipt topped with '3 DP MATH' - three Methuselah-sized bottles of Dom Perignon

A city trader splashed out £40,000 on drinks at a swish London bar while trying to impress Hollywood star Benicio Del Toro.

The commodities dealer - who has not been named - was at a Halloween party at Raffles in Chelsea.

He arrived at around 9.30pm with nine fellow traders and kicked off the evening with a round of zombie-themed vodka cocktails, each costing £30, made from rum, absinthe and grapefruit.

But onlookers said the trader's spending spiralled after the Puerta Rican actor - who starred in Snatch and The Usual Suspects - came and sat nearby.

Del Toro's arrival at around 
11pm was said to have sent the party atmosphere 'into a frenzy', prompting the traders to order more drinks.

Within a couple of hours the businessman had splashed out £24,000 on three bottles of Dom Perignon champagne costing £8,000 each.

By the time he left in the early hours of last Thursday morning, he had racked up a receipt for £40,090.73 - including a £5,229.31 tip.

Onlookers believe he got carried away while trying to impress the Hollywood actor.

One said: 'The trader was clearly getting into the spirit of the Halloween, and he wasn't holding back.

'He'd obviously had a good day at the office and wanted to treat his friends.

'Benicio del Toro was at the club that night so perhaps he wanted to show off in front of a Hollywood A lister.'

The tab for the night included three Methuselah bottles of Dom Perignon at £8,000 each and seven Dom Perignon Oenotheque 1996, at a total of £3,500.

The group also drank 10 Halloween 
zombie-themed vodka cocktails totalling £300, two Belvedere jeroboam 
vodkas at £1,640, and seven glasses of Don Julio 1942 tequila for £224.

Two
Dom Perignon Rose 2000 magnums cost the generous trader £2,200, while 
the bill also included six bottles of Krug at £2,400, a bottle of Havana
15 rum at £350 and 16 cafe patron - a mix of coffee and tequila - for 
£160.

They then bought 25 bottles of Red Bull for £87.50, bringing the the drinks total to £34,861.50 with a service charge of £5,229.23.

The group finally left at around 2am with the trader, who is a 'regular' at the club, settling the entire bill by card.

A Raffles spokesman said: "This is one of our higher spends. They don't happen often but when they do, it's great.

'We're a members only club so obviously we attract a wealthy clientele and we're more than happy to serve them when they want to enjoy themselves.'

Raffles
owner Sachin Khanna said: 'Being a members club, we can't offer comment
on this specific table spend however we are confident that these type 
of spends are achieved because of our heritage and high levels of 
customer service."

Del Toro drank Raffles cocktails with shots of tequila before leaving 
shortly after the group of traders in the early hours of the morning.

The actor has collected a variety of gongs in his career - including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA award for his role as Javier Rodriguez in Traffic.

He is also known for his roles as Fred Fenster in The Usual Suspects, Dr. Gonzo in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Franky Four Fingers in Snatch, Jackie Boy in Sin City and Che Guevara in Che.
