Chelsea Manning, the US soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for a massive document leak, should be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court documents.

Judges made the ruling as Manning continues her transition into a woman.

Chelsea, 27, formerly known as Bradley Manning, is incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.

She had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley'.

The former intelligence analyst had also been allowed to wear women's underwear following a decision last year, and to undergo psychotherapy.

The latest move comes a month after the U.S. Army approved hormone therapy for Manning's gender reassignment - a first for the American military.

'All future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g. Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun' said a court order on Wednesday.

However 'in respect to historic fact,' the court will retain masculine wordage used in previous decisions, including Manning's conviction.

The news has been welcomed by Manning's defense team.

'The court rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea's womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as,' said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in Manning's defense.

Manning was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents to the WikiLeaks website while stationed in Iraq.
