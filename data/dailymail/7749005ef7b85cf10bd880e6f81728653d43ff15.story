A crash victim who lost part of his leg and was left unable to walk is set to become the first in the UK to have his limb rebuilt by surgeons - using donor bones.  

Stu Jotham was thrown from his motorbike in 2011.

He lost chunks of his thigh bone and his calf bone, as well as all his knee ligaments, when he skidded across the road.

Doctors feared the 29-year-old would lose the mangled right limb but after a series of 10-hour operations they managed to save it.

However, Mr Jotham - who was previously a landscape gardener and martial arts competitor - was left wheelchair bound and suffering extreme pain.

Four years on he still struggles to walk unaided and has been unable to work.

But he is now preparing himself for a life-changing reconstruction, which will see surgeons screw parts of a donor leg on to what remains of his limb.

Stu Jotham, 29 (pictured), is set to be the first man in the UK to have his leg rebuilt by surgeons using donor bones. Surgeons will screw parts of a donor leg on to the remains of his limb, to restore stability in his knee

This is the first time that a knee with attached femur (thigh bone), fibula (calf bone) and ligaments from a deceased donor will be transplanted in an operation. Doctors will bolt them on to Mr Jotham's remaining leg bones, and after two years it will integrate to his leg. He hopes it will allow him to run again

Mr Jotham, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said: 'As far as I'm aware this is the first time they are going to do it on this scale in this country so I'm a bit of a guinea pig.

'I don't mind because it will work for me and hopefully it will restore some sort of strength and stability in my knee, which is the ultimate goal.

'They want to take the femur, the ligaments and a bit of the fibula - all attached - and then bolt them on to my leg, and hopefully over two years it will integrate to my leg.

'That is obviously a huge, huge operation and I've been on a donor list for the last three years. It's a big thing to deal with.

'I'd love to find out who this donor is or his family and just sent them a letter to say thank you.

'They've literally given me bones and bits of body.

'The thought that some young bloke died somewhere and that I'm having a bit of his leg, it's a weird concept - but an amazing one.'

The consultant surgeon who will be carrying out the landmark operation on Mr Jotham said he did not think it had been performed before in the UK.

Surgeon James Murray said: 'We believe it is the first application of this technique in this setting.'

He said the operation - known as an allograft  knee replacement - requires the correct size donor knee, which has been sourced through the NHS Tissue Bank.

Mr. Murray said the complex operation will involve using parts of the donor's knee, tibia, femur and proximal fibula, along with associated ligaments and cartilage.

A team of plastic surgeons, trauma surgeons and knee surgeons will carry it out. 

The NHS uses bone donated by living and deceased donors to help patients needing grafts.

People undergoing hip replacements may be asked to donate bone removed during the procedure. But for patients such as Stu Jotham – who need a large amount for a reconstructive operation – the bone will have to come from an organ donor.

The bone will have been disinfected, tested for viruses and stored in a tissue bank. It can be stored for up to five years, and there are no age restrictions for anyone wanting to donate bone after death.

Surgeons use donor bone to form scaffolding, with pins, plates or screws holding the graft tissue in place on the damaged limb. 

Once accepted by the patient’s body, the grafted bone provides a framework where new, living bone can grow.

Mr Jotham was riding to Devon for a day out with his family when he was knocked off his motorbike in Gloucestershire in April 2011.

He was taken to Gloucester Royal Infirmary and then transferred to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital where surgeons warned there was a high chance he would lose his leg.

Doctors took skin, tissue and muscle from his side and back to patch up his leg, which was only just supplying blood to his foot by a single vein.

He recalled: 'It ripped all the skin off my leg and I went down the road on my knee which ground away a lot.

'They planted tissue from my back down into my leg and plumbed in all in amazingly.

'It was three surgeries and two of them were ten or 11 hours long.

'It was pretty intense. I think I had 10 to 11 units of blood replaced.'

Mr Jotham got the call from the NHS in November telling him a suitable leg donor had been found, and the operation will take place in February.

Doctors will implant one third of the anonymous donor's knee joint - made up of bits of thigh bone, calf bone and ligaments - together with artificial cartilage.

'When they told me they had a suitable donor I did get emotional,' Mr Jotham said.

'I felt disorientated. I felt all over the place. I didn't know what to think.

'I'm going to have to keep mentally strong - for my family and friends as well.

'I want to be able to run again.

'Going through it has been hard, of course, but there are people in worse places than me. I have to stay positive.' 

The NHS Blood and Transplant authority said it believed Stu Jotham's operation would be the first of its kind to take place in the UK.

A spokesman from NHSBT said: 'NHS Blood and Transplant's Tissue Services is the only tissue bank in the UK that operates from initial donor referral through to the hospitals who use the donated tissue to save and improve patients' lives.

'We provide life enhancing tissues to hospitals up and down the country. These include specially requested grafts, to meet the unique requirements of an individual patient.

'As far as we are aware this is the first time that a knee with attached femur, fibula and ligaments from a deceased donor has been supplied in the UK for this novel operation.

'We rely on the generosity of the families of people who donate their tissues after death. Thanks to them we are able to provide skin, tendons, bone and other tissues to repair or rebuild the bodies and lives of thousands of severely injured people every year.

'We wish Mr Jotham well with his operation and hope he makes a speedy recovery.'
