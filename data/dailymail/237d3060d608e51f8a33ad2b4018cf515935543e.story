Jamaican discus thrower Chad Wright dazzled spectators at Hampden Park with an impressive performance and some equally impressive socks.

The 23-year-old was sporting some rather sharp footwear in the qualifiers and his throw of 61.08m  saw him through to the final.

Diving is supposed to be a sport of great grace and composure, but Malaysian diver Ahmad Amsyar Azman ended up falling flat on his face in the preliminary round of the men’s 1m springboard.

His attempt to pull off a particularly tricky dive ended in disaster after he failed to complete his final forward rotation and he ended up hitting the water on the horizontal. He still managed to qualify, though.

Olympic champion Sally Pearson has been slammed by Australia’s head athletics coach hours before she begins the defence of her Commonwealth 100m hurdles title.

Pearson, 27, was fined by Athletics Australia for missing a pre-Games training camp but Eric Hollingsworth labelled her ‘a bad example to the entire national team’.

The pair have not spoken since falling out in March.

At loggerheads: Sally Pearson and Eric Hollingsworth

Hollingsworth, though, faces suspension or even the sack for his comments, with Athletics Australia deeply upset by his actions.

Meanwhile, a man detained by police over an altercation at the athletes’ village early yesterday morning is believed to be a member of the Australian team.

England’s James Ellington made the 200m semi-finals after getting some added motivation from his Jamaican opponent, Jason Livermore.

He said: ‘It was quite easy but I was nervous as I was up at 6.55am and I hate early mornings. That clown (Livermore) on the outside gave me the motivation because he was making noise in the call room.

‘You shouldn’t do that because that makes me run faster. As long as he does that in the semi-final then I’m going to get him.’

The semis are from 6.25pm.

Golden Gunde from Malawi, 21, didn’t quite live up to his sensational name in the men’s 200m heats. He had the slowest reaction time and finished last — or 007th — in 22.39secs. Maybe he should have entered the shooting instead...

Rio Ferdinand might have found himself a new sport. The defender seemed to enjoy England’s 2-1 win over Scotland in the women’s hockey, which sealed England’s place in the semi-finals.

‘I’m into this hockey,’ he tweeted. ‘I wish our refs communicated like these hockey refs!’ He also approved of England’s prowess in front of goal: ‘Alex Danson — what a goal! Silky.’

Scotland's James Heatly had quite a lot to live up to at the diving centre.

The 17-year-old’s grandfather  Sir Peter Heatly, who turned 90 last month, was a diver at the Commonwealth Games in 1950, 1954 and 1958, and he won gold medals in all three.

With the pressure on, Heatly the younger could only manage a 9th-place finish in the 1m springboard yesterday, but he does have another chance to emulate his grandfather and add to the family haul in the 3m springboard.
