In
 response to his complaints, Nando's official feed tweeted: 'Thanks for 
getting back to us Nesta, we'll pick this up with the team now.'

Another customer, Steffan Powell, wrote on Twitter: 'So I'm in @NandosUK in £Leicester...and there is no chicken... I repeat NO Chicken...'

'Many
 customers were rushing to use their final remaining chillies on their 
old paper loyalty rewards cards, and we also launched Online Takeaway.

'The
 restaurant unfortunately ran out of some chicken options, but only for a
 short period of time. We would like to apologise to those customers who
 couldn't get their preferred PERi-PERi meal.'
