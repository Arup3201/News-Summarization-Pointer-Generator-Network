A 103-year-old activist who featured in an iconic 1965 picture has recalled the moment she was beaten unconscious during a civil rights march saying she fears skin color will matter for another 100 years.

Amelia Boynton Robinson, was beaten by police during a march in Alabama almost 50 years ago, which became known as Bloody Sunday.

The image of her lying on the ground being helped by a passer-by shocked America and the world and the story is part of a brand new film about the civil rights movement called Selma.

Racial tensions have been brought to the fore once again across the U.S. after unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in August.

The shooting sparked protests across the state last month when a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer.

And in an interview with the New York Post, Mrs Boynton Robinson, spoke of how she had been disturbed by the recent events in Ferguson.

She told the newspaper: 'I still see a lot of discrimination. I don't think it will be until another 100 years that people will be truly colorblind.'

Mrs Boynton Robinson first came to worldwide attention in 1965 when she helped organise civil and voting rights marches from the town of Selma to Alabama's state capital of Montgomery.

The marches came after it was revealed 50 per cent of the population of Selma was black, but only one per cent were registered to vote.

But the first march descended into chaos when the 600-strong group crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and state police began to beat them.

Mrs Boynton Robinson was beaten unconscious before having tear gas sprayed into her eyes and mouth.

The story of the three Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 will form part of the story of a new film called Selma about Martin Luther King, which is released on Christmas Day

She recalled: 'They came from the right. They came from the left. One of the troopers shouted "Run!" I thought "Why should I be running?"

'Then an officer on horseback hit me across the back of the shoulders and, for a second time, on the back of the neck. I lost consciousness.'

Fortunately, a young man saw her and dragged her to the safety of an ambulance, with the image of her being helped becoming a well-known picture in the civil rights struggle.

And despite her injuries, she took part in a further two marches, just months before the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Racial tensions have come to fore once again in the U.S. recently after unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, pictured, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in August 

People took to the streets of Ferguson to protest after a grand jury chose not to press charges against the officer who shot the teenager dead 

Mrs Boynton Robinson said in the interview that she had been disturbed by the recent events in Ferguson following Michael Brown's shooting 

The new film Selma focuses on Martin Luther King and the three marches which Mrs Boynton Robinson took part in.

Orange Is The New Black actress Lorraine Toussaint, will play Mrs Boyton Robinson in the movie, which also stars Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Junior and Tom Wilkinson and is out on Christmas Day.

Meanwhile, Michael Brown's stepfather has said sorry for his controversial and incendiary chants aimed towards the unarmed teen's supporters the night of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Wilson.

The stepfather of Michael Brown, Louis Head, pictured with Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden. He has apologised for controversial comments following the decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson 

The apology comes one day after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that his department was actively pursuing an investigation into whether Louis Head incited the riots that left parts of the city a burning wreck.

Head, who is married to Brown's mother, apologized to those 'who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. It wasn't.'

He said that he feels he is being unfairly blamed for the chaos that followed his outburst, which was videoed by the New York Times on November 24, moments after the grand jury decision came in.
