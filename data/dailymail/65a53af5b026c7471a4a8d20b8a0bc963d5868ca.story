Arsenal legend Robert Pires' son is following in his father's footsteps after training with the club's academy.

Theo Pires, seven, completed his first training session at the club's Hale End youth complex in Walthamstow this week.

Pires spent six years at Arsenal, helping Arsene Wenger's side dominate English football winning two Premier League titles and three FA Cups during his stay in north London.

And now his son has taken his first steps towards, perhaps, representing the Gunners' first team after training with the academy.

Theo's skills were first highlighted by Robert's wife Jessica, who showed off a video tagged 'Theo The Great' on Instagram last year.

The youngster was shown skipping past his father and others.

He was also pictured at the Emirates Stadium in January, watching Arsenal beat Stoke City in the Premier League and posing for snaps with Alexis Sanchez after the game.
