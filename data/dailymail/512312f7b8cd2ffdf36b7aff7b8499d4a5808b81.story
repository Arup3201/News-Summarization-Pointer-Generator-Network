Rental robber: Kayla Michelle Finley, 27, ended up spending the night in jail after police busted her for failing to return a Jennifer Lopez movie she rented nine years ago

She rented the film Monster-In-Law, but this woman might be thinking the law is a monster, in this case.

Kayla Michelle Finley, 27, ended up spending a night in jail for failing to return a video rental she took out in 2005.

Cops in Pickens Country in South Carolina say Ms Finley was sent a warning letter nine years ago that asked her to return the movie.

When she ignored the demand, a warrant was issued for her arrest.

Ms Finley was put behind bars for the night after she went to the police station to report a crime.

She was charged with petit larceny and failing to return a rented video cassette.

It was when officers were taking her personal details, they noticed the outstanding warrant.

Adding to the bizarre set of circumstances Ms. Finley faced, the rental shop, Dalton's video, has long since closed down.

When Ms. Finley didn't return the movie nine years earlier, the business owner went to a Pickens County magistrate who issued an arrest warrant.

T'was 2005: It was nine years ago that Monster-in-Law came out and it was then Ms. Finley forgot to return the video she rented

Never forget: Despite the rental shop having closed long ago, the warrant for Ms Finley's arrest was still outstanding

The tape was taken out on a three-day rental and was supposed to be returned after 72 hours.

She was apparently sent several certified letters to turn herself in but ignored them all.

Ms Finley denied ever receiving the warnings, and said she would fight the charges delivering a scathing message towards the sheriff's department.

'It’s obvious that Pickens County has nothing better to do,' Finley told Fox News reported.

'I fully intend on fighting this, it’s ridiculous I had this happen to me,' she said.

Deputies say that whilst businesses may come and go, outstanding warrants never expire.

A judge issued a $2,000 personal recognizance bond Friday morning, and she was released.

Romantic comedy Monster-in-Law starred Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda.
