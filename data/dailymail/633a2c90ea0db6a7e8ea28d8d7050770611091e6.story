Louis van Gaal has one word for his achievements after three months in charge at Manchester United – great.

The Dutchman, who asked to be judged in mid-October when he took over at Old Trafford in July, was asked to assess his performance on Friday and the response was typically blunt.

‘I am always great,’ said Van Gaal. ‘That’s a very easy question. Thank you!

‘How do I respond to that? No, I’m not going in the right direction? No. I have confidence in myself and in my players and that is very important. But much more important is that the players have confidence in the manager and his staff.

‘When I respond I’m arrogant because normally I am always moving in the right direction – I have showed that already.’ 

Despite winning the last two games, United were holding on against Everton and West Ham and Van Gaal believes the players have still to fully embrace his philosophy.

He added: ‘I think they do understand the philosophy but they have to perform that philosophy. We have to see if it is going to a higher level. We need more balance in the team.

‘I said that after the match against Everton, and I am looking for balance in the team not only spectacular attacking football, but also when you lose the ball that you have a shape as a team and that you can defend more easily, and kill the game better.

‘That’s also part of the philosophy and also because I am always choosing creative attacking football players. So we are looking for the balance and we shall see if the time I have had was long enough.’

Van Gaal confirmed that there no fresh injuries from the international break but is not sure if any of his current casualties – Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans – would be fit to face West Brom on Monday. 

United were put through their paces on Friday as they prepared for the clash at The Hawthorns and looked to be in decent shape.

Ashley Young, who has been out since August because of groin and pelvis problems looked sharp in the session, as did Marouane Fellaini who came on against Everton in the Red Devils' last match after being sidelined through injury.

Van Gaal is hoping his side can continue their winning run against West Brom but admits the Baggies will be tough opposition and said: 'We start Monday against West Brom with a victory I hope.

'You can lose in this sport also, only Chelsea haven’t lost.

'Normally every club can lose. But I think West Brom are very difficult to beat especially at home.

'They are a dangerous opponent that is difficult to beat. But there is no club in the premier league that is easy to beat, and that’s the difference with other leagues.

'We have to start with a victory after the international break because we have won the last three games.'
