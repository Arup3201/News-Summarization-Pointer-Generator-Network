Stevan Jovetic appears to have refused to let his exclusion from Manchester City's Champions League squad and his recent lack of game-time wipe the smile off of his face. 

The Manchester City striker, who missed his side's 2-1 defeat by Barcelona after being replaced by Wilfried Bony in Manuel Pellegrini's reduced 21-man Champions League squad, was in high spirits on Wednesday as he posed for an Instagram snap.

Jovetic looked incredibly smart as he rocked a navy blue blazer and sunglasses during his time away from Manchester City's training ground.

The former Fiorentina forward has scored five Barclays Premier League goals in 15 appearances for City since the start of the season. 

His long-term future at the current Premier League champions appears to be in doubt following the arrival of Bony during the January transfer window. 

Jovetic has not featured in Manchester City's last two league wins over Stoke and Newcastle.  

The 25-year-old, pictured scoring against Liverpool back in August, has made nine league starts this season
