An investigation has been launched into whether moves to make diesel cleaner could be putting millions of drivers at risk of breakdowns in potentially dangerous situations.

Fuel suppliers have been implementing European Union regulations to mix conventional diesel with environmentally-friendly biofuels, made from crops including corn, sugarcane and rapeseed.

But there has been a surge in sudden breakdowns of diesel cars in cold weather since the greener fuel was introduced, and the concentration of biofuel in the mixture increased.

New cleaner diesel could be putting drivers at risk of breakdowns according to the RAC

The RAC revealed it attended 600 call-outs last month from motorists whose fuel filters have become clogged by a build-up of thick gel in the engine, compared with 280 incidents in November 2012.

The organisation said the problem disappeared last summer when weather was warmer.

Drivers only become aware of the issue when their car suffers a sudden loss of power – and mechanics found that on affected cars the fuel filter has been clogged by the fuel ‘waxing’ – a similar effect to when olive oil clouds in a bottle.

One affected motorist, Jon Harvey, from Oxfordshire, said the engine of his Citroen C3 VTR cut out suddenly while overtaking on a dual carriageway.

He said: ‘I put my foot on the accelerator and it suddenly cut out. It cost me £160 to fix.’

Britain has 9.4 million diesel vehicles which could be affected.

Fuel suppliers have to add biofuel to road fuels under the EU’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation.

The RAC has warned that drivers who use cleaner diesel could be in danger of winter breakdowns

The investigation into whether blended diesel is being carried out by industry bodies the UK Petroleum Industry Association, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and the Downstream Fuel Association, working with the British Standards Institution.

David Bizley, technical director of the RAC, said biofuel content in diesel was being probed because it was the newest element to be added to diesel – and that the problem had not occurred before.

He said: ‘It's clear that we still don't fully understand all aspects of the underlying cause.’ The Department for Transport said Transport Minister Baroness Kramer had asked the industry to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

According to RAC data, breakdowns due to clogged fuel filters on diesel vehicles have been more prevalent in eastern parts of England and Scotland, which bore the brunt of cold weather in recent weeks, but other parts of the country have also been affected.

The UK Petroleum Industry Association, which represents oil refining and marketing companies, said it was aware of the problems and that the investigation would work to reveal the cause.

Meanwhile, the Petrol Retailers’ Association is urging the Office of Fair Trading to reopen an investigation into ‘loss-leading’ supermarket fuel promotions which it believes are driving independent garages to the wall.

Supermarkets have been offering promotions such as 10 pence off a litre of fuel for motorists spending £50 or £60 on their groceries – bringing petrol and diesel below cost price.

Brian Madderson, head of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ‘Such practices are causing the continuing trend of independent forecourt closures.’ In Australia, two of the country’s biggest supermarkets have agreed to end heaving promotions in a deal brokered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
