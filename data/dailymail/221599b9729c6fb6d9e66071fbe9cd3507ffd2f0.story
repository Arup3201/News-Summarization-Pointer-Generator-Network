You may be sick of the sight of Look Back videos posted all over Facebook, but there is one that's sure to raise a smile.

A pair of comedians has created a spoof version of the nostalgic video featuring Facebook photos, posts and likes from Prince Harry.

The 59-second clip shows the prince joining the social network in 2007 before being depicted at various events including the royal wedding in 2011 and his recent trip to Antarctica.

The spoof Facebook Look Back video was created by comedians Jonny Lang and Jason Burke. Some of the pictures in the montage are real, while others have been doctored for comedy effect

Facebook launched its Look Back video tool earlier this week to celebrate its 10th birthday.

The feature selects moments from a user’s Facebook history and edits them into a one-minute show reel, set to music.

This
 video can then be shared on that person’s timeline, which has caused 
many people to complain that their news feeds are littered with them.

Facebook
 uses an algorithm to select what it thinks are your most important 
moments and statuses, yet some users have complained they didn’t like 
the choices the site made.

To remedy this, Facebook said it would be launching edit feature ‘soon’ to let people change the photos and statuses used. 

Prince Harry doesn’t have an official Facebook account, so writer and producer comedy duo Jonny Lang and Jason Burke have imagined what it may look like.

They used real photos, mixed with photos that have been doctored, including an image where a large pair of large ears has been superimposed onto a photo of Harry next to his brother Prince William.

Another shows his face placed on the body of someone wearing underwear over tracksuit bottoms.

Elsewhere, the 'Your most liked posts’ section features a picture of Pippa Middleton's behind, captured at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011, with 3246 likes.

There is also a spoof picture of the Queen posing with a bank note in front of her face.

Lang, from Eager Beaver Productions, said the material to fill the video was easier to find than he first thought.

This image of Prince Harry, left, and his brother William, right, has been doctored to add a pair of large ears. This a reference to the fact their father, Prince Charles, is renowned for having large ears and pulling a similar expression to the one pictured

'Obviously some of the pictures have to be doctored but it was surprising how many of them didn't need anything doing to them,' explained Lang.

‘As comedians we react to content and what's happening now and I loved the idea of doing a celebrity Facebook movie. Everyone is talking about their own at the moment.

'The thing about Prince Harry is that you can imagine how much trouble Buckingham Palace must have trying to reign him, this Facebook movie was a way of having a window into things we might not get to see.'

The pair have previously written and developed TV content for BBC, Channel 4 and Sky.
