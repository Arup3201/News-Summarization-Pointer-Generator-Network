It's a full-blown festive spread of turkey with all the trimmings, beef Wellington, Christmas pudding and lashings of cocktails, all served in the comfort of your own home.

Created by The Ivy’s executive chef Gary Lee, the luxury feast's menus include canapes, wine and after-dinner drinks.

Christmas with The Ivy is a £4,500 per head festive package which includes a three-course Christmas dinner

The cocktail-pairing menu features five bespoke cocktails created by top mixologist Kenji Jessi

The meal kicks off with a selection of canapes which include pumpkin tortellini, fish fingers, lobster tortilla, burrata cheese and grilled courgette, and Dorset crab on toast.

Guests will then be served a pre-dinner cocktail of vodka, freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice and  tonic water. 

The sumptuous spread begins with a choice of two starters: The Ivy's shellfish cocktail or seared scallops with cauliflower mousseline and maple bacon crisps. 

Both choices are paired with the gin-based Honey Flower cocktail.
