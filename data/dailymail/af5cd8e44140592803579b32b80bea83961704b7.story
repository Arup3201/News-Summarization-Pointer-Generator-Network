Four police boats rocketed up the Brisbane River and deployed divers to investigate some mysterious bubbles in the water this afternoon.

But it seems that they were just bubbles.

And police - on edge and out in force because of the G20 summit at the weekend - were just being very careful.

Three police officers on board the patrol boat Fury leapt into the water near the Kurilpa Bridge at Southbank around 12:30pm Queensland time.

One even donned a scuba diving breathing apparatus while another appeared to be wearing flippers.

But after around 45 minutes of investigation, the boat, which was crewed by seven men, sped off down the river.

A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the bubbles are not believed to be 'anything suspicious'.

Divers search the Brisbane River as security tightens further at the G20 summit

Thousands of police have swarmed the city as a part of an enormous G20 security operation.

Huge steel barricades have been erected throughout the city, black riot trucks have been spotted on the streets and even some Australian Army personnel were present near the entrance of the Brisbane Convention Centre, where the G20 meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday.

Two Chinese pro-democracy protesters were banned from the entire Brisbane CBD on Thursday evening after they unfurled a protest sign near the Chinese president's hotel.

The bubbles that appeared were not 'anything suspicious', a police spokeswoman said 

They told Daily Mail Australia they feared Australian democracy was at risk, after what they believed was a strict police punishment.

At the same time divers were scouring the Brisbane River today, around 300 people were storming up a nearby street as part of a march against Indigenous deaths in custody.

They set off from Roma Square across the river to Southbank, crying 'they say justice we see murder' and wielding protest signs.

The demonstrations concluded peacefully with a smoking ceremony in Musgrave Park.
