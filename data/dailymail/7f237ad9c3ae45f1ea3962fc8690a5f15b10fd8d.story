It's rare that your WiFi's actual speed lives up to the number on your router's box - but that could be about to change if Samsung has its way.

The South Korean company has developed a 60 GHz WiFi technology that it claims can send data five times faster than other electronics devices.

This will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes (MB) per second – enough to transfer a 1GB movie between devices in less than three seconds.

Samsung has developed a 60 GHz WiFi technology that it claims can send data five times faster than other electronics devices. This will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes (MB) per second – enough to transfer a 1GB movie between devices in less than three seconds

It also means that an uncompressed high-definition videos can be streamed from mobile devices to a television in real-time.

'Unlike the existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi technologies, Samsung's 802.11ad standard 60 GHz Wi-Fi technology maintains maximum speed by eliminating co-channel interference, regardless of the number of devices using the same network,' according to Samsung's announcement.

The group says previous attempts to use the 60GHz band for WiFi have failed because they used millimetre waves that travel by line-of-sight.

They have weak penetration properties, which means they often lose signal and data performance when they hit obstacles such as walls.

Using something known as a 'wide-coverage beam-forming antennae', Samsung says it has solved the speed issues that come with millimetre waves.

Samsung has revealed it has been working on a consumer virtual realtiy headset

Samsung is working with virtual reality firm, Oculus Rift,  to develop a consumer VR headset.

Called the Samsung Gear VR, users slip a Note 3 tablet into the headset to provide the screen. The firm says it will start selling the headset to 'innovators' this year.

'Powered by Oculus technology, the Samsung Gear VR delivers a completely new way to experience and consume mobile content,' Samsung said.

It is believed Samsung provided the hardware, while Oculus provided the software. It's consumer headset, called the rift, is not expected to go on sale to the public until next year.

The firm has also partnered with several game development firms to develop content for the gadget. 

The headset, in development under the name 'Project Morpheus', is designed toproject images that shift along with the movements of a gamer'shead. 

The group hopes to commercialise its 60 GHz WiFi technology as early as next year, in audio-visual systems, medical devices and mobile phones.

The technology is also likely to be key to the 'Samsung Smart Home' -  a vision of living in which home appliances are connected to the internet and controlled remotely.

Last week, Samsung said its quarterly operating profit had fallen 60 per cent because of poor smartphone sales.

It also announced a 15.6 trillion won ($14.5 billion or £9 billion) investment to build a plant in South Korea that would produce semiconductor chips.
