Mighty Wings will be returning to a McDonald's near you - though not necessarily due to popular demand.

McDonald's began stockpiling chicken wings earlier this year for its Mighty Wings promotion which debuted on September 9.

But the spicy wings didn't fly out of stores, and now the company has 10 million pounds of Mighty Wings in cold storage.

In a flap: McDonald's franchisees must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion after the first failed to offload the stockpile of chicken wings

McDonald's media relations executive Lisa McComb said in a statement: 'We're bringing back Mighty Wings - stay tuned.'

Before the wings were launched in September, the company released a statement explaining: 'With the introduction of Mighty Wings, McDonaldâ€™s is bringing the popularity and fun of chicken wings to customers seeking any time and any reason to enjoy them.'

Customers, however, did not take to the Mighty Wings, and the company still has 20 per cent of its original supply of chicken wings left.

According to the Wall Street Journal, McDonald's franchisees have been told they must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion or pay for the excess inventory.

Fowl play: Many customers felt the wings were priced too highly at $1 per wing

McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has acknowledged that one reason the wings didn't sell well was that the price was 'not the most competitive.'

The wings were priced at $2.99 for three - well above competitor KFC's pricing of five wings for $3.99.

Many customers baulked at paying a dollar per wing at the fast food chain, where they can purchase a whole burger for the same price.

The Wall Street Journal reports that franchisees commented on the problem in a survey in October while the promotion was running.

Winging it: The company will roll out the promotion around the country soon

'Mighty Wings are proving once again that we canâ€™t sell premium items in large numbers because we still have the Dollar Menu,' one franchisee said in the anonymous survey.

The higher prices came after McDonald's began buying up big in the chicken wing market, driving prices up and necessitating a higher price point for the company to make its margin.

Critics have also noted that the breaded and fried wings were too spicy to appeal to the McDonald's customer.

When Mighty Wings land at McDonald's outlets again soon, they will be priced more competitively.
