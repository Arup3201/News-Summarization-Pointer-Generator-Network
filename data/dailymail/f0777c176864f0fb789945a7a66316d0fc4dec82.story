Scientists have been able to get incredibly detailed views inside a living cell at a molecular level.

A team of German researchers have managed to find a method of looking inside cells in their natural state and have produced the world’s first X-ray of a single cancer cell.

Until now, scientists have had to dunk cells into preservative chemicals – killing it and subtly changing their internal structure – to get a closer view of it.

Thanks to analytical methods with ever-higher resolution than X-rays, scientists today can study biological cells at the level of individual molecules.

But cells are usually chemically fixed before they are studied with the help of optical, X-ray or electron microscopes.

The process of chemical fixation involves immersing the cells in a type of chemical preservative which fixes all of the cell's organelles and proteins in place.

'Minor changes to the internal structure of the cells are unavoidable in this process,' said professor Köster.

The new technique of X-raying living cells, show these changes in direct comparison with fixed, dead cells, for the first time.'

But researchers at the DESY Research Centre in Göttingen, Germany, used high-energy X-rays to study living biological cells.

Their new method shows the clear differences in the internal cellular structure between living and dead, chemically fixed cells.

‘The new method for the first time enables us to investigate the internal structures of living cells in their natural environment using hard X-rays,’ Professor Sarah Köster of the Institute for X-Ray Physics of the University of Göttingen, said.

The team described their new method for analysing live cancer cells from the adrenal cortex in the journal Physical Review Letters.

They grew the cells on a silicon nitrite plate, which is almost invisible to X-rays and fed them with nutrients while pumping away metabolic waste using channels just half a millimetre in diameter.

Study co-author Dr Britta Weinhausen said: ‘The biological cells are thus located in a sample environment which very closely resembles their natural environment.’

The scientists used an X-ray beam to scan the internal nanostructure of the cells, but only blasted them for 0.05 seconds at a time to avoid damaging the living cells too quickly.

Their method produced images so clear that nanometer-scale structures are visible.

The researchers studied living and chemically fixed cells using the ‘nanodiffraction technique’ and when they compared the images of the cells, the new X-rays prove that the chemical fixing process makes big changes to tiny 30 nanometer to 50 nanometer structures in the cell.

While the scientists have not speculated on what the new technique could mean for medical and scientific research, it will make it possible for experts to study living cells at high resolution and understand a living cell' inner mechanics better.
