Pop icon Madonna is the world's top-earning celebrity raking in a cool £80million ($125m) in the past year.

The Material Girl singer, 55, struck gold with her £196million ($305m)-grossing MDNA tour, and was also helped by sales of clothing, fragrance and various investments, according to the Forbes list.

Director Steven Spielberg, who had a big hit last year with 'Lincoln,' was a distant second with earnings of £64million ($100m) in the year ended June 2013.

Most of Spielberg's earnings came from his catalog of past hits such as 'E.T.' and 'Jurassic Park,' which continue to bring in big bucks.

The highest-earning Britons were music and television mogul Simon Cowell and 50 Shades of Grey author E L James 
who were in joint third place with earnings of £61million 
($95m).

'Madonna's success just goes to show the incredible power of a successful music career,' Forbes reporter Dorothy Pomerantz said, noting that 27-year-old pop singer Lady Gaga has often been said to be channeling Madonna's four-decade-long career.

'The young star is certainly 
emulating Madonna when it come to raking in money,' Forbes said, with 
her £51million ($80m) in earnings largely from the singer's 'Born This 
Way Ball' world tour, placing Gaga 10th on the list.

Forbes compiles its annual list of 
celebrity earnings using input from agents, managers, producers and 
others to calculate its estimates for each celebrity's 
entertainment-related earnings.

The figures do not reflect tax deductions, agent fees or 'the other expenses of being a celebrity.'

Madonna's top spot compares with her previous peak of £70million ($110m) in 2009, but falls short of the £106million ( $165m) taken in by Oprah Winfrey in the previous year, Forbes said.

Talk show queen and media mogul 
Winfrey took a big pay cut this year according to Forbes, falling to No.
13 on the list with earnings of £49million ($77m).

Radio shock jock Howard Stern joined Britons E.L. James, and Simon Cowell in joint third place.

Others in the top 10 earners included TV host Glenn Beck, director Michael Bay of the 'Transformers' franchise, and thriller novelist James Patterson, who Forbes said was now the best-selling author of all time.

Both Spielberg and Bay also made last year's top 10, though with significantly larger earnings.
