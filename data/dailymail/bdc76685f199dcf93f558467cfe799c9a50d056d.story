Pep Guardiola brought joy to Barcelona fans during a four-year spell as manager, but the Bayern Munich Boss disappointed one supporter of the Catalan club when he refused to sign his shirt.

Bayern have been preparing for the return of the Bundesliga later this month following the winter break with a warm-weather training camp in Doha, Qatar.

After a session Guardiola made his way over to a group of supporters that had gathered on the side of the pitch to sign autographs and have his picture taken.

But when a Barcelona shirt was thrust in his direction by one hopeful fan the 43-year-old refused to sign it and simply wagged a disapproving finger in their direction and moved on.

The Bayern head coach has recently been touted as a replacement for Luis Enrique at the Nou Camp after reports of fall-outs between the head coach and some of the senior players, including Lionel Messi.

But Guardiola rubbished speculation he could be set for a sensational return to the club and on this evidence the Bayern boss wants to avoid any affiliation with his former side whatsoever.

German champions Bayern went into the winter break top of the Bundesliga without losing a match in the opening half of the season.

The 2013 Champions League winners have only dropped six points and Guardiola will be keen for his side to continue their eight-game winning streak when the Bundesliga resumes at the end of the month.

Bayern face a tough trip to second-place Wolfsburg on January 30 in the opening league match of 2015 after the six-week hiatus.

Before that Bayern have the opportunity to rediscover their pre-winter rhythm when they play a friendly against second division Bochum on January 23.
