Expecting? Lisa Philips, pictured at her court case in October, is being questioned by police over claims she lied to a court about being pregnant

A thief who stole £15,000 from her own aunt to pay off her debts and buy a big television is facing questions from police after allegedly lying to a court about being pregnant.

Lisa Philips, 36, was given a suspended prison sentence at Teesside Crown Court in October after her lawyer told jurors for the case that she was expecting a child.

However, it has since emerged that Philips, who was expected to give birth in December, was apparently not pregnant at all. The allegations have led to her being questioned under caution by police.

Ultimately she could face charges of perverting the course of justice.

Philips, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, received a four-month suspended prison sentence after admitting theft.

She was also handed a 12-month supervision order and an additional one-month suspended jail term for obstructing police.

A spokesperson for the police said today: 'A 36-year-old has been helping with inquiries in relation to an allegation of perverting the course of justice.'

A file has now been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, where lawyers will make a decision on whether to charge her.

A source said: 'It seems she was never ever pregnant. She has tried to maintain she did a home test and thought she was.

'Family members didn’t think she was, so we waited until December when she said she was due, and that came and went.'

In October, Philips’ lawyer Rebecca Stephenson told Judge Peter Armstrong: 'She is deeply ashamed of her actions.

'She has lost a great deal on a personal level, with family members and the breakdown of her relationship with her partner who she is currently pregnant to.'

The court heard how Philips even created a fake bank statement in a desperate attempt to hide her dishonesty.

Philips had transferred the money into an account she had full control of to allegedly keep it safe from her aunt’s Turkish boyfriend.

Twice her aunt asked for money totalling £300, which she was given from the account, but no receipts were ever produced.

Her aunt became suspicious when repeated requests to see statements for the account were met with excuses by Philips.

It later emerged that Philips had stolen £14,700 to pay off debts and to buy an Xbox games console and a flat-screen television.

Judge Armstrong told Philips: 'Your initial concern about your aunt’s partner may well have been well-motivated, but you went on and did the thing that you were concerned about.

'The temptation for you was too great as you plundered the money to pay off your debts.'
