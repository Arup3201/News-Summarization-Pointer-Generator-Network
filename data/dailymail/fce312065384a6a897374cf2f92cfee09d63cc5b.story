A number of innocent bystanders were injured when the romantic rivalry between rappers Chris Brown and Drake turned violent at a Manhattan club early Thursday morning.

The second female victim, who was hit in the face and hand with a broken bottle, has stepped forward and shown her injuries in the wake of the ongoing drama.

A 21-year-old woman named Veronica spoke to TMZ and showed how she sustained a bruise on her forehead and cuts on her right hand that needed to be treated with stitches.

Treating the wound: She received stitches on her hand as a result of the injury from the nightclub brawl

Aftermath: The woman, whose injuries are shown above, now says she plans on suing the club, and isn't ruling out suing the rappers at the heart of the fight as well

Veronica, who was at SoHo nightclub W.i.P. at a table in between both Brown and Drake, said that at first she had no idea what was going on when the fight broke out around 4am on Thursday.

'I heard people screaming ... so I tried to get away from the action and hid behind a couch,' she told the site.

The move only worked to some extent, as she was hit in the hand with a broken bottle.

In addition to being in the way of the flying fluids, she also got trampled by another clubgoer who stepped on her head.

'I plan on suing the club over the incident,' she told TMZ, and is not ruling out a suit against the millionaire rappers at the heart of the incident.

'I'm trying to see my best legal options,' she said.

The aftermath: Broken glass can be seen strewn across the bar following the Chris and Drake fight

Veronica is not the only one taking her claims to court, as another one of the five victims has lawyered up.

Ingrid Gutierrez, a 21-year-old model who was at the club with Brown and his entourage, has spoken to several media outlets in keeping with the advice of her attorney.

'I was on the couch, covering my face, because I'd been hit on the head by a bottle and my head was bleeding. I thought I was going to die,' she told News Core.

Unsurprisingly considering she is a friend of the controversial Brown, notorious for his felony assault on former girlfriend Rihanna, Ms Gutierrez says that Drake was the one who turned the bickering into a violent showdown.

ended in bottle throwing with Chris sustaining a cut to the chin

The situation started when Brown sent a 
bottle of expensive champagne over to Drake's table, allegedly as an 
alcoholic peace offering to the rapper who has also been romantically 
linked to Rihianna.

Ms Gutierrez says that 'I then saw a 
waitress come back with a piece of paper and gave it to Chris,' which 
was supposedly a note that read 'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal
with it'.

'(Brown) looked upset and just threw it on the floor,' she said.

'(Drake and his entourage) were giving him the middle finger. They got into each other's faces and were shouting at each other.

'Chris told Drake to f*** off, and the next thing I could hear is the sound of smashed glass and mayhem started.'

The police investigation into the incident is ongoing, and as a result there are reports that there will be added security at Drake's Jones Beach concert tonight.

The New York Post reported this 
morning that police may arrest the rapper for reckless endangerment at 
the concert, but police sources tell MailOnline that those reports have 
neither been confirmed nor denied. The likelihood of an arrest seems 
very slim at this time.

Veronica is the second unconnected bystander to release photos of her injuries, as the first was arguably the most serious.

Hollie C, an Australian tourist, was 
rushed to Bellevue Hospital after she was smashed in the head with a 
flying bottle during the fight.

Knocked unconscious: Hollie told police that she saw the bottle flying towards her before it hit her, adding: 'I immediately started to bleed and proceeded to fall in and out of consciousness'

A gruesome photo shows a gash in her head and her face covered with blood. She needed 16 stitches to close the wound.

Hollie told TMZ.com she went to 
W.i.P. with friends on Wednesday night, unaware they were sitting in 
between two angry rappers and their entourages. Suddenly, all hell broke
loose.

'Within a few moments of noticing glass being thrown around, I saw a glass bottle headed towards me, consequently hitting me in the head.' she told TMZ. 'I immediately started to bleed and proceeded to fall in and out of consciousness.'

Parker (pictured left, speaking on Friday) claims he was in the club and
suffered damage to his eye. Right, Big Pat can be seen with a wound on 
his head

Basketball star Tony Parker, who was previously married to actress Eva Longoria, said that he has to sit out a week of training for the Olympics because his cornea was scratched during the fight.

'I was quietly with my friends when a fight broke out. Bottles started flying everywhere. I tried to protect my girlfriend and I got everything,' Parker told French website Direct Star.

'The cornea is affected. I cannot do anything for seven days. Wear a therapeutic contact lens and I get drops. I was lucky, that I almost had to get stitches.'

The most serious of the injuries came from Big Pat, Brown's large security guard. The rapper posted a picture of the bodyguard with a large bleeding cut across his forehead while he was lying down on a hospital gurney.

Chris Brown was also injured. He posted a picture of a gash on his chin, apparently sustained from the fight with Drake. His female companion was also hurt.
