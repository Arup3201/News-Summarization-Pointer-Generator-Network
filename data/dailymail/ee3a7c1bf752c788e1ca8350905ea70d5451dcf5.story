Angelina Jolie has become the latest celebrity to fall victim to the Sony Pictures hackers.

In what appear to be more leaked e-mails from the corporation - published by Gawker - Angelina is allegedly branded a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' by movie producer Scott Rudin.

The e-mail claims  Angelina was displeased to learn that David Fincher was going to be directing the upcoming Jobs biopic as opposed to a re-make of Cleopatra that she would play the lead in, and was pressuring Sony to get him to direct her film.

Harsh words: Angelina Jolie, pictured at the Unbroken premiere in London on November 25, was viciously slammed by producer Scott Rudin in alleged e-mails leaked in the recent Sony hacking scandal

Letting loose: In one email, Rudin (left) writes to Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal (right) that Jolie is a 'spoiled brat'

Arguing over: David Fincher, pictured in Rome in January 2012, was originally set to direct Jobs, which was the subject of Rudin and Pascal's e-mails

Angelina then reportedly becomes the hot topic of conversation in a fiery exchange from February this year between Jobs producer Rudin, 56, and Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal.

Rudin appears to refer to Angelina as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' before viciously slamming her in multiple e-mails allegedly leaked in the recent Sony hacking scandal.

'[Jolie] is upset about us giving david jobs she wants to talk,' Pascal, 56, reportedly tells Rudin in a leaked e-mail dated February 27.

But he apparently had no interest in discussing the matter with the Maleficent star, saying, 'She’ll survive it. I don’t want to waste my time on this.'

Later that day, he appears to have sent another e-mail to Pascal, which read, ‘YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.’

She appears to respond with, 'Do not f**king threaten me.'

Close friend: Jolie's husband Brad Pitt (above) has worked with Fincher numerous times before, on films such as Seven, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button

At odds: The emails seem to make it clear that Rudin (left) and Pascal (right) have a very toxic relationship

It is claimed that Rudin proceeds to criticize Angelina a number of cutting remarks, and the idea of the movie altogether.

The alleged email states: 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won’t tell her that you do not like the script — which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN’T EITHER — this will just spin even further out in Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don’t.'

Among other things, Pascal apparently says in her more civil response, 'You know Eric and she have always wanted David and I have been the one saying no for two years. I have asked you to talk to her with me and you don't want to deal with it.'

The Eric being referred to is likely Eric Roth, who wrote the script for the remake and previously worked with Fincher when he penned The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. 

However, this allegedly caused Rudin to launch into yet another tirade in which he appears to insult the Unbroken director some more.

'If you engage in this again, we will end up losing Fincher on the one we want him to do and will be stuck with shoving him onto a movie with no script that, underneath it all, you know in your heart and your brain should never be made,' he apparently writes in the email.

'I'm not remotely interested in presiding over a $180m ego bath that we both know will be the career-defining debacle for us both.

'I'm not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat who thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for eighteen months so she could go direct a movie. I have no desire to be making a movie with her, or anybody, that she runs and that we don't.'

He allegedly goes on: 'She's a camp event and a celebrity and that's all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming.

'We will end up being the laughing stock of our industry and we will deserve it, which is so clearly where this is headed that I cannot believe we are still wasting our time with it.’

Keeping calm: Angelina did not seem at all bothered by the leaked emails when she was photographed out in Los Angeles on Wednesday 

Also attacked: Megan Ellison, the 28-year-old producer of American Hustle (seen above with the film's stars Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) is called a 'bipolar lunatic' in one email

Coming back: Ellison later took to Twitter to respond to the leaked email and comments made by Rudin

In the end Rudin may have been right, as Fincher did indeed leave the Jobs picture, something Pascal seemed to realize when she received an email blast from entertainment site The Wrap that alluded to behind the scenes problems with Fincher and the studio over the Jobs film.

After the site wrote that he was leaving the film, Pascal wrote Fincher saying, 'WTF.'

Fincher attempted to diffuse the situation by making a comment about another story in the blast, the announcement that Girls star Adam Driver had landed the role of the main villain in the upcoming Star Wars film.

'Adam Driver is a terrible idea,' responded Fincher to Pascal's email.

The Wrap was right however, and now Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, will direct Jobs, a film that recently lost its star, Christian Bale, and replaced him with Michael Fassbender. 

Wooed: Emails appear to show producers attempting to convince Leonardo DiCaprio to star in Jobs

Jobs drama: Christian Bale (left) was originally star in the Jobs biopic, which will now star Michael Fassbender (right), whose genitalia is the subject of one email

Ouch: Kevin Hart (above) is called a 'whore' by one studio executive after requesting more money to promote his film on social media

This after the studio aggressively tried to woo Leonardo DiCaprio in a series of emails that also leaked, saying it would be great for him and Boyle to be working together again 15 years after they filmed The Beach.

The emails also reveal that in addition to his talent, people at Sony are also impressed with Fassbender's penis, with producer Michael De Luca allegedly claiming in one email that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.'

As for Rudin's notorious rage, the producer also seems to have it out for Megan Ellison, the 28-year-old daughter of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison who has quickly made a name for herself by producing Oscar worthy fare such as American Hustle, Her and Zero Dark Thirty.

Rudin appears to describe her as a 'bipolar 28 year old lunatic' in one email. 

Rudin and Pascal meanwhile seemed to have parted ways as well, with Universal now set to produce Jobs. 

Another set of emails that leaked reveal that Kevin Hart received $3million to do his last film for the studio, likely Think Like a Man Too, and that his team demanded more money for him to promote the movie on social media.

This did not sit well with studio executive Clint Culpepper, who wrote to Pascal in an email, 'It's not as if we paid him 3M and 4M respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated. We paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy.'

He then calls Hart a 'whore.'

A representative for Jolie did not immediately respond when contacted by MailOnline. 

 

Sony hackers release aliases used by stars including Daniel Craig and Natalie Portman

Sony Pictures' embarrassment over leaked details of its business deepened  as hackers released the aliases used by its stars to travel incognito.

The cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services.

Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group.

The new leaks also reportedly include contact details, including phone numbers, for the likes of Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks, as well as film budgets, scripts, details of legal claims and private employee information.

Contact details: The secret aliases and contact details of Hollywood stars - including, from left, Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Brad Pitt - are among the latest documents stolen by hackers from Sony Pictures

The latest batch of leaked files includes a folder containing 'publicity bibles' for many recent Sony Pictures releases which include phone numbers and email addresses for cast and crew on film sets, Fusion reports.

They reveal that Tom Hanks sometimes travels under the pseudonyms 'Harry Lauder' or 'Johnny Madrid'; Tobey Maguire goes as 'Neil Deep'; while Jessica Alba adopts the rapper-esque name 'Cash Money'. 

North Korean officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on Sony Pictures, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack. But they called it a 'righteous deed'.

A theory has been that North Korean hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of The Interview, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. 

Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHub Gist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!'
