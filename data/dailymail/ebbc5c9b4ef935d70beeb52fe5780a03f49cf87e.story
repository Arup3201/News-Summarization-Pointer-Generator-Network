Lithuania coach Igoris Pankratjevas knows what his defence should expect if England hand a debut to Harry Kane on Friday night.

Pankratjevas' side face England at Wembley as the duo meet in a European Championship Group E qualifier - with in-form Kane likely to be selected for his first England cap by manager Roy Hodgson.

Although he is untested at the highest international level, Pankratjevas knows his Premier League record and was also present when Kane scored a late winner for Gareth Southgate's Under-21's in a European Under-21 qualifier.

Harry Kane is likely to play a role for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday

Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for Tottenham so far this season

England manager Roy Hodgson says Kane will make his entry into full international football this week

'Statistics speak for themselves,' he said.

'I know Harry Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions so that fact speaks for itself. I've seen him play at international level for England Under-21s, he played in Lithuania recently and he is a strong forward.'

Lithuania visit Wembley having won two of their opening four Group E qualifying campaign fixtures, with only goal difference keeping them out of the top two.

But Pankratjevas knows his players face a unique test in north London and singled out England skipper Wayne Rooney as a danger man.

'We are quite realistic about it,' he said when asked about his side's chances at Wembley.

'We are not dreamers, it is always history that Lithuania are playing England for the first time ever. Obviously none of the players have played at such a stage so we are preparing them mentally for this kind of game.

'I like the England team in general recently as they have some new players along with their experienced ones. The new players give them more creativity. He is still the anchor. He has over 100 caps and he is a top player.'

With key man Arvydas Novikovas missing through injury, Pankratjevas admits he is yet to finalise his starting XI for the fixture - revealing he has '80 per cent' of his team, with the rest to be decided on Friday.

Meanwhile, Marius Zaliukas will be tasked with keeping the likes of Rooney and Kane quiet if Lithuania are to get a result and the Rangers defender is hoping to prove wrong those in Scotland who expect him to return to Ibrox having been on the receiving end of a heavy loss.

'Everyone in Scotland is laughing because they think it will be a big score,' he said.

'We want to disappoint them. Every weekend I am watching the Premier League. We all understand the kind of players we are going to see tomorrow, that makes it more special. We are not playing these teams every month or every year.'

Lithuania are playing England for the first time at senior international level.

They have met seven times in UEFA age-group competitions, with England recording five wins and two draws. Most recently, they beat Lithuania 5-0 at home and 1-0 away in 2015 European U21 Championship qualifying.

Lithuania have won only twice in 10 competitive away games — against San Marino and Liechtenstein.

Experienced centre half Marius Zaliukas (right) plays for Rangers and spent last season at Leeds, making nine appearances.

Striker Simonas Stankevicius, 19, is on Leicester’s books, but has yet to make his first-team debut.

England are one of only four teams still boasting a 100 per cent record in qualifying. The others are Slovakia, Israel and the Czech Republic.

England are unbeaten in 23 Euro and FIFA World Cup qualifying games (W16 D7), stretching back to a 1-0 defeat by Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk in October 2009. Their last competitive home loss was 3-2 to Croatia in November 2007.
