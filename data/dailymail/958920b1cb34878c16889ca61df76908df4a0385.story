Argentina declared British oil exploration off the Falklands 'illegal' and immediately set about suing five companies for 
pursuing activities around the contested islands.

Britain 
responded almost immediately, saying the islanders were entitled to 
develop their own natural resources and it was Buenos Aires that was 
breaking the law with its campaign of harassment and intimidation.

'These
latest attempts to damage the economic livelihoods of the Falkland 
Islands people regrettably reflect a pattern of behavior by the 
Argentine government,' a Foreign Office spokeswoman said.

Row: Argentina has declared British oil exploration off the disputed Falkland Islands 'illegal'

'From 
harassing Falklands shipping to threatening the islanders' air links 
with Chile, Argentina's efforts to intimidate the Falklands are illegal,
unbecoming and wholly counter-productive.'

Argentina last month pressed Britain in a diplomatic note to let it launch direct flights to the islands.

Three
decades after the Falklands War, the promise of oil reserves is 
inflaming tensions between Britain and Argentina while also boosting the
economic hopes of the islanders - estimated to number just 3,140.

Britain
has ruled the archipelago - 8,000 miles (12,900 kilometers) from its 
own shores and less than 300 miles off the southern coast of Argentina -  since 1833 as a self-governing overseas territory.

Argentina says it acquired the windswept islands, which it calls the Malvinas, from Spain in 1816.

On
April 2, 1982, Argentine forces invaded and occupied the Falkland 
Islands and South Georgia, a smaller island governed by Britain further 
out in the South Atlantic.

Anger: Argentine President Cristina Kirchner on Monday declared the British oil hunting activity 'illegal and clandestine'

Britain dispatched a naval task force 
and regained control of the islands when the Argentine forces 
surrendered on June 14, but not before 649 Argentine and 255 British 
servicemen had died.

The renewed war of words over the Falklands has intensified around the 30th anniversary of the bloody 74-day conflict.

Argentine
President Cristina Kirchner on Monday declared the British oil hunting 
activity 'illegal and clandestine' and accused the firms of operating 'in the sovereign area of the Argentine nation.'

Her government said the classification formally paved the way for criminal proceedings to begin.

'The
declaration of clandestineness clears the way for the immediate launch 
of civil and criminal action against these businesses,' said a foreign 
ministry statement that spoke of seeking fines and penalties.

It 
said the Argentine government would soon be in communication with 
Britain's Treasury, its Financial Services Authority, the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the New York Stock 
Exchange.

Argentina first announced in March that it intended to 
take legal action against the British oil concerns but it has never made
clear how it intends to go about it or where it intends to file suit.

The
companies -- Desire Petroleum, Falkland Oil and Gas, Rockhopper 
Exploration, Borders and Southern Petroleum and Argos Resources -  'are 
not authorized by the Argentine government under law,' read a resolution
published Monday in Argentina's Official Bulletin by Energy Secretary 
Daniel Cameron.

The islands' oil reserves, which have remained 
untapped until now but which analysts predict could be worth tens of 
billions of dollars, have been a major source of tension between the 
countries since their discovery in 1998.

At the time, a barrel of 
crude sold for less than $10 - today it would fetch $125 - and firms 
led by Anglo-Dutch energy giant Shell abandoned their exploration on the
grounds it was not profitable enough.

The rocketing price of oil 
since then has enticed the five companies back to the islands, hoping to
cash in on what might be one of the world's last new sources of fossil 
fuels.

To Argentina's dismay, drilling resumed in 2010 with Rockhopper and Desire Petroleum taking the lead.

Three
small companies followed suit, but until now only Rockhopper - named 
after one of the Falklands' resident penguin breeds - has confirmed 
significant reserves, in the Sea Lion field to the north of the islands.

Rockhopper
plans to start developing the field this year, and expects to pump the 
first of its estimated 450 million barrels in 2016, according to 
analysts Edison Investment Research (EIR).
