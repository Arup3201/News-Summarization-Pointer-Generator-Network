A British graduate died ‘from a nosebleed’ after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Ibiza and a ‘negligent’ doctor failed to treat him properly, a court heard yesterday.

William Hall, 22, suffered fatal haemorrhaging the day after being seen by a specialist who sent him after failing to find the source of the blood, the court was told.

Ear, nose and throat expert Juan Mari ‘did not seem interested’ when he examined him in A&E at Ibiza’s main hospital two days after the nightclub attack, the former public schoolboy’s mother told a judge.

William Hall, 22, on holiday in Ibiza, Spain in August 2006. He died 'from a nosebleed' after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Ibiza and a 'negligent' doctor failed to treat him properly, a court heard yesterday

His mother Anna Hall (pictured with her husband) told the one-day manslaughter trial at Ibiza's Criminal Court: 'William was very pale and I got the impression the other ladies who were in the room who I think were nurses would rather he was staying'

Anna Hall told the one-day manslaughter trial at Ibiza’s Criminal Court: ‘William was very pale and I got the impression the other ladies who were in the room who I think were nurses would rather he was staying.’

Dr Mari, 55, who still works at the hospital, was one of two defendants at the hearing although he was tried only by a criminal prosecutor hired by William’s family.

Ruben Garcia, a 37-year-old drug addict accused of beating up the biology graduate outside Ibiza’s famous DC10 nightclub on August 26 2006, was also tried for manslaughter by a state lawyer as well as the lawyer acting for the dead man’s family.

William was on a family holiday with brother George, now 28, mother Anna, 61, and property developer father Richard, 62.

Mrs Hall, from Staplegrove near Taunton, Somerset, fought back tears as she told the hearing: ‘William and George were trying to get a taxi to come back to our holiday apartment after their night out.

‘William said he was told by someone milling round the car park that one parked car was a taxi and to get in the back.

‘He was sat in the back waiting to go when a guy got in and started beating him round the head. It was totally unprovoked.’

The graduate, who was planning to start a masters’ degree, was told he had a broken nose when he went to hospital with his mother two days later after suffering an on-off nose bleed and vomiting blood.

Duty A&E doctor Maria Belen Fernandez told the court specialist Juan Mari agreed to come to the hospital after William suffered two nose bleeds and tests showed his haemoglobin level had dropped to 10.4, well below the normal reading for a man his age, and which should have been around 14.

But he was sent home after having his nose packed by Dr Mari during a 15-minute examination - despite experts insisting at a September 2007 inquest into William’s death in the UK  that the blood tests results were ‘red light’ warnings of heavy blood loss.

He died from an upper airway haemorrhage the following day after collapsing at his holiday apartment and being rushed back to the same hospital.

Juan Ginard, prosecuting for the family, criticised Dr Mari for failing to ‘follow protocol’ by discharging William without detecting the source of the bleed and said the hospital should have done more blood tests before sending him home.

He told the court post-mortem results showed the Brit holidaymaker was haemorrhaging blood behind his nose but the treatment he was given was for a bleed to his front nasal cavity.

‘William Hall died from a simple nose bleed,’ he said.

‘It beggars belief that in this day and age someone so young should die as a result of a something like that, of a drip by drip bleed over nearly three days, eight hours of which he was in Can Misses [hospital] under the supervision of a duty doctor and more specifically Juan Mari.’

Enrique Kupman, a doctor the lawyer called as a witness, added: ‘Packing the front of the nose when the problem is a leak behind the nose is like putting a bandage on your right hand when it’s your left hand that’s bleeding.

‘If I hadn’t detected the source of the bleed, I would have been more prudent and kept the patient in observation overnight rather than sending him home.

‘The root problem wasn’t attacked sufficiently, the tap was left open and the tragic outcome was William Hall’s death.’

Dr Mari, under cross-examination and during a last address to the court before the end of the trial, insisted he had followed protocol at all times.

He said: ‘My actions were correct. The action I took that day was the action I have continued to take every time I see someone with a nose bleed.’

Ear, nose and throat doctor Manuel Tomas Barberan, a defence witness specialising in hospital protocols for nose bleeds, added: ‘I wouldn’t have acted any differently that day and nor would 20 other specialists in the same situation.

‘Dr Mari followed protocol.’

Garcia, who confessed during today’s hearing he was addicted to heroin, admitted assaulting William but insisted he slapped him once only with an open hand and said the Brit walked away without any blood on his face.

He was arrested nearly a fortnight later after being identified by a nightclub security guard who saw him treating his swollen right hand with ice the night of the assault.

State prosecutor Isabel Beneyto told the court: ‘The origin of Mr Hall’s death was the facial trauma he suffered during the assault by the defendant.’

Dr Mari and Garcia, who both pleaded innocent, face up to three years in jail each if convicted.

Judge Clara Ramirez de Arellano deferred her verdict. She is expected to deliver it in writing in around a fortnight’s time.

William’s father said after the hearing: ‘We would like to see Dr Mari especially convicted which is why we brought this prosecution against him.

‘Experts in the UK have said the blood tests performed at the Spanish hospital should have alerted them to the seriousness of my son’s situation.’

His wife Anna: ‘William was such a lovely boy. I’m sure he would have been alive today if he had got the proper treatment.’
