A world champion typist has set a new speed record - with his nose.

Mohammed Khurshid Hussain, 23, wrote a 103-character sentence in just 47 seconds after practicing his technique for six hours a day, the International Business Times reported.

If confirmed it will smash the previous time of a minute and 33 seconds, set in Dubai in 2008 by an Indian man who used his nose to write the same sentence: 'Guinness World Records has challenged me to to type this sentence using my nose in the fastest time.'

Smell of success: A media scrum gathered around 23-year-old Mohammed Khurshid Hussain as he set a new world record for typing a sentence using his nose. He said his trick was keeping one eye closed

It took Mr Hussain, from the southern city of Hyderabad, months of training to break through the 53-second barrier after reaching it at least twice.

During his attempts the hobbyist, his hands tied behind his back, was surrounded by crowds of fans with stopwatches and an extra-large monitor attached to the keyboard.

Videos and ecstatic press conferences after the attempts have been posted on his Youtube feed.

Mr Hussain already holds the Guinness World Record for typing the entire English alphabet - although that feat was achieved with his fingers.

He achieved a time of 3.43 seconds during the challenge in February 2012, which was held in front of several journalists in a public event his home city.

He told the International Business Times: 'If you want to set a record, every millisecond counts. I typed with one eye closed, as it is difficult otherwise to locate the keys.'

It is far from the most bizarre typing feat to be recorded by Guinness.

Celebration: Onlookers and Mr Hussain cheer during a previous record attempt - the time is now even quicker

Challenge: The record setter used his nose while a crowd watched the results on a large monitor

Last year American Mark Encarnación typed on a smartphone 'The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human' in 25.9 seconds - while blindfolded.

There is also a recorded time for typing the numbers 1 to 50 with a full stop between each one.

Hind Al Mulla, from the United Arab Emirates, managed the feat in 16.3 seconds at an event in Dubai in 2009.

Grace Pak typed a 264-character text on a mobile phone with a keyboard in 56.57 seconds in Pennsylvania, U.S., in 2011, setting another record.

It was: 'The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell (UK), who filed his patent for the telephone on 14 February 1876 at the New York Patent Office, USA. The first intelligible call occurred in March 1876 in Boston, Massachusetts, when Bell phoned his assistant in a nearby room and said 'Come here Watson, I want you.'

Stay back! Supporters surround Mr Hussain with stopwatches during at attempt in which he made 53 seconds

The nose is also not the only appendage used.

Chinese amputee Liu Wei typed 251 letters in alphabetical order with his feet on an Italian TV show in 2010, the most ever recorded without a mistake.

The fastest hands-free typing overall, however, goes to American Hank Torres.

In 2011 he used facial motion capture technology to type the same sentence as Mark Encarnación in 83.09 seconds.
