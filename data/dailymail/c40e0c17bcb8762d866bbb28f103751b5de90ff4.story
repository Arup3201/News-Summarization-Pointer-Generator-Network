Cycling helmets are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but one conceptual design, which is packed with technology, includes a  controversial extra – a licence plate.

The ‘Smart Hat’ is designed for ‘responsible cyclists’ and could include a visor showing safety information and a map, if it ever enters production.

It also features a licence plate on the rear of the futuristic design, in a bid to make identifying cyclists easier.

The concept, by Sydney-based designer Tony King, has aggravated some cyclists who think that Smart Hat is a silly idea.

This is because the website claims: ‘Apart from safety considerations, an ID system would allow cyclists to share responsibility when interacting with vehicles and pedestrians.’

While it may not be popular with all cyclists, the idea has apparently got the green light from a local city council, which is keen on licensing cyclists, Daily Telegraph Austraila reported.

The helmet would include a speaker, indicators controlled from the handlebars, a tilt sensor and even a windscreen wiper among other

The concept includes:

Mosman councillor Simon Menzies said the helmet would provide a solution to make commuter cyclists more easily identifiable.

‘People who use it as a mode of transport should be registered and insured.

‘Every other road user pays for registration and it should not be any different.’

The helmet claims to integrate ‘modern, electronic safety devices’.

Cyclists using the helmet would see information displayed on its Bluetooth visor, so they would not have to take their eyes off the road to a map, for example.

Speed limits, the temperature, heart rate and warning messages could also be displayed.
