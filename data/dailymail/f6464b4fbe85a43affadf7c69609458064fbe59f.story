TV presenter Susanna Reid had an inauspicious start on Good Morning Britain as the relaunched breakfast show drew just over 
half of the audience of her old BBC colleagues, according to overnight 
figures.

The new ITV show had an average of 800,000 viewers and peaked at 1.2m , while Susanna's old show, BBC Breakfast, pulled in an average 1.5million viewers.

The launch of GMB was also markedly down on the first-morning figure for its predecessor, Daybreak, which pulled in one million viewers when it began in 2010.

Raring to go: Susanna Reid was seen arriving to film Good Morning Britain on Tuesday

ITV
 chiefs may well draw some comfort from the new show proving more 
popular than the audience levels of around 600,000 which axed Daybreak 
had been achieving in recent months.

With her daunting first day behind her, the TV presenter looked relaxed as she arrived wearing a pair of fitted jeans and a blazer ahead of hair and make-up.

So far the new look show has been met by mixed reviews and it is still early days with regard to how successful it will be further down the line. 

Helen Warner, ITV Director of Daytime told MailOnline: ‘The launch was a fantastic team effort, and we are focused on building a strong breakfast brand going forward.’

Regarding the launch day, complaints from viewers on Monday focused on the fact that Susanna's now famous legs - whose pay for the role is £400,000 a year - double that of her former BBC salary - were hidden from view.

One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.'

Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'

Viewers also found fault with the fact that the set resembled ABC’s Good Morning America.

In response to it one viewer wrote on Twitter: 'Good morning Britain is too formal and newsy and like an American morning show. #GMB.'

While another added: 'Well, Good Morning Britain looks very American so far...suited team behind desks, tickers, huge pic takes up half screen.'

Day two: Susanna looked in goods spirits with her co-hosts Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins on Tuesday

Confident: Susanna looked more than at home behind the desk on the second day

Meanwhile Sky News anchor Kay Burley told MailOnline that she found the show - co-hosted by Ben Shephard, 39, Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30 - too frantic.

The presenter, who was a reporter on Good Morning Britain's distant cousin, TV-am, in 1985, said: ‘The show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but I'm sure it'll settle down after a couple of weeks.

‘Breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning, they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing...'

Prepped: Susanna and Charlotte were both seen with papers as they arrived

Holding her own: Susanna chatted away to Ian Marshall and Jo Hemmings during the show
