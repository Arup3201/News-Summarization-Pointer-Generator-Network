Sydney ad man David Johns has pulled off one of the internet's greatest marketing stunts, designing a slick website to sell his beaten up old Holden Barina for double what it's worth.

Despite the car having clocked 188,000 kilometres and having dings on every panel, he's attracted bids of more than $2000.

The 15-year-old vehicle once had its exhaust around in its boot for weeks before being reattached.

The boss of advertising boss Chimney Digital, the company behind the stunt, says the ad is real but the sleek and impressive approach is just a complete 'piss take' which parodies serious car commercials.

'Redefined:' The 1999 Holden Barina Excel is anything but, however, it's a very clever attempt to sell the 15-year-old car

The creative adman David Johns is the brainchild behind the video where he wears sunglasses and a suit emulating the look of James Bond - but driving a Barina

David Johns, an advertising guru, is selling his 1999 Holden Excel and he is asking bidders to tweet him and offer

The Scratched-up and disheveled looking Barina is a complete 'piss-take' of the generic forms of advertising commonly seen in car advertisements

Never mind the duco: There's no hidden faults to this car it, what you see is what you get

The advertisement is a real pitch for the owner to try and get rid of it since he upgraded to a newer one recently

Chimney Digital Asia Pacific CEO Lee Ritson said: 'It is his (David John's) car - the sale is real, and it was his idea,' Mr Ritson said.

'He has been trying to get rid of it, so he came in the other week telling me 'I've got this car I'm trying to sell.'

'It's just a piss take of all the other generic car ads out there.'

That hasn't stopped people from entering bidding war though, where Mr Johns is asking people to tweet him offers.

And that's where his silky selling skills have really come to the fore - with the car attracting offers of more than $2,000, roughly double the estimated value of the 1999 model Barina XL.

But some of the more than 64,000 offers made for the vehicle have been every bit as creative as the ad itself.

'There's been some real trippers come in with offers', Mr Ritson said.

'Someone is offering 40 gallons of unicorn tears, another wants $7.31 for it,' he said.

'Apparently there's a man also willing to spend "$20 as well as sing a song".

'Like I said, It is really just a piss take.'

Dented and out-dated: incredibly there has been offers of more than $2000 for the car which comes with only three hub caps

One owner? The car comes with fully-functional CD and Audio cassette player capabilities...it's even done only 188,000 kilometers, or there about

He alleges he is the sole-owner of the 1999 Barina, a two-door hatchback designed by the former king of Australian motoring Holden, which recently announced it is ending its production line in Australia.

Mr Ritson gave his employee a $1000 budget to film the ad after he came to him with the idea, which is also part promotion for the company. The ad was filmed cruising across Sydney's Anzac Bridge and in the garage of the advertising office.

The vehicle's description on the website says it all: 'FM/AM Radio, Auto-Stop Cassette Player, CD Input, and Front and Rear wiper technology'.

The Barina's driving capabilities are limited, but it can still motor between '0-60km 'as well as drive in 'reverse'. It even has manual transmission and if that's not enough to motivate you to buy it, what about it's 'German design'?

So confident is Mr Johns of selling it he put it on YouTube, and it has reached close to 10,000 views in just two days.

'I'm trying to sell my awesome little car,' Mr Johns writes.

'It's a 1999 Holden Barina. Its not in great condition, but its still a fun little car. Tweet me an offer using the hashtag #buymybarina. I've also set up a little site for it http://buymybarina.com.'

There's a an accelerator, break and clutch function which the driver has complete access too and control of

Part of the buss words Mr Johns has used as the 'piss take' to sell his car

A very important part of every motor vehicle

It's hard to believe but apparently David Johns is the sole owner of the 15 year model Excel

The keys to the 15-year-old Holden Barina could be yours - if you successfully bid more than $2000 which is the current highest price
