Her ruthless determination has earned her the unflattering nickname The Rottweiler.

Now, it seems, Valerie Trierweiler has been living up to that volatile, ferocious image.

It was claimed yesterday that France’s First Lady flew into such a rage when she learned that Francois Hollande was cheating on her that she smashed up his office – causing  £2.5million damage.

Hopes: Valerie Trierweiler is reportedly desperate to save her relationship with cheating President Francois Hollande

The 48-year-old allegedly went on the rampage after a magazine revealed the President’s trysts with an actress.

Among the national treasures  said to have been shattered by the notoriously volatile Miss Trierweiler was a Sevres porcelain vase dating back more than 200 years to the reign of Louis XVI.

As the claims swirled around the French media, a spokesman for the Mobilier National – the office responsible for presidential furniture – was forced to ‘categorically deny’ them.

Despite this, the latest edition of Closer magazine, which first carried pictures revealing Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with Julie Gayet, 41, runs the headline: ‘The truth about the clean-up which cost the state three million euros.’

The latest twist in France’s presidential soap opera came  as Mr Hollande was told to ‘stop dithering’ about the future of Miss Trierweiler.

Closer suggests the damaging claims about
 the President’s partner have been stirred by her numerous enemies, one 
of whom tells the magazine the First Lady ‘always puts her emotions 
first’.

Reports that Trierweiler caused £2.5 million worth of damage after going on a rampage around The Elysee Palace on hearing about Hollande's affair were categorically denied

Following eight days in a public hospital suffering from stress, she is now staying in La Lanterne, the luxury presidential home in Versailles, west of Paris. There she enjoys a heated swimming pool, a cordon bleu kitchen and numerous other perks – including one of the best-stocked wine cellars in France.

Nicolas Sarkozy is likely to attempt a political comeback because he is desperate not to ‘end up like Tony Blair’.

The former French president has seen his old friend become an increasingly marginal figure on the world stage.

Despite being prime minister for a decade, Mr Blair, 60, now concentrates on making a living as a highly-paid consultant and lecturer.

Mr Sarkozy, 58, lasted only one term before losing to Francois Hollande in 2012. Despite facing corruption inquiries, he is convinced he can beat Mr Hollande in 2017.

According to Le Figaro newspaper, he has said ‘no to a life like Tony Blair’, showing that Mr Blair’s admission that he regrets having left Downing Street has not been lost on Mr Sarkozy.

He wants to avoid being ‘nothing more than an upmarket adviser’. Like Mr Blair, Mr Sarkozy is often accused of mainly being interested in making lots of money.

Closer claims that Miss Trierweiler is at least ‘under the control’ of the presidential establishment while she is at La Lanterne.

But it warns that she is determined to travel to Washington DC next month as First Lady, even though Mr Hollande wants a formal separation.

Elysee Palace sources told French media yesterday that Mr Hollande needed to stop dithering about his love life, and announce to the world exactly who his First Lady is.

Meanwhile, says Closer, the delighted Miss Gayet has already held a party for close friends and family to celebrate her relationship with Mr Hollande being made public.

A photograph of the smiling actress, who has appeared in more than 50 French films, is also splashed across the cover of the latest edition of Paris Match magazine.

In photographs which were clearly taken with her permission, she is seen walking close to her parents’ country estate in the Gers department in south-west France.

They will infuriate her love rival – Miss Trierweiler has been a staff writer on Paris Match for more than 20 years, even holding on to the job when she became La Premiere Dame in 2012.

Both women have used the media constantly to bolster their careers, and their strong links with France’s most intrusive popular magazines  will be another cause of embarrassment for Mr Hollande.

Earlier this week, his advisers said he should remain a ‘bachelor president’ to avoid further scandal.

The President is reportedly seeking legal advice on how to to bring his ten-year relationship with Ms Trierweiler to an end

The 59-year-old Socialist has made no official comment on his domestic future since revelations of his secret visits to Miss Gayet, with pictures of him arriving at a Paris love nest on the back of a scooter.

But one source said: ‘If there must be a split, it must be dignified and elegant regarding Valerie Trierweiler.

‘And above all, Julie Gayet mustn’t instantly move into the Elysee.’

The Motoblouz 'Dexter' helmet, now listed on the company's website as the 'Dexter President'

A French crash helmet company has publicly thanked President Frangois Hollande for wearing one of their products on his way to secret trysts with glamorous actress Julie Gayet.

Hollande, 59, was pictured wearing the 'Dexter' helmet made by French company Motoblouz on his way to clandestine meetings with his 41-year-old mistress.

Since the photos were published by France's Closer magazine when they exposed his affair two weeks ago, the Dexter helmets have sold out across France.

The helmet is now listed on the company's website as the Dexter President, where it is being billed as a 'Star des Medias' (media star).

Now Motoblouz boss Thomas Thumerelle has taken out a quarter-page ad in French daily Liberation to thank the president for choosing his product to his his face from papparazzi.

The ad reads: 'Thank you Mr President - for having used our helmet for your personal protection.

'We salute your choice of a French-made helmet for your scooter outings. And you will find other models on our website for your future escapades.

'You will also see that we have a collection of women's jackets, which would make an ideal Valentine's Day gift.'

Thumerelle said his company normally sold 20,000 Dexter helmets a year, but had sent out 1,000 within 24 hours of the Closer revelations.

He added: 'We were both extremely surprised and deeply proud to see the president wearing one of our helmets.

'We thought the most appropriate response would be to write him an open letter, both sincere and a bit tongue-in-cheek, to thank him for the excellent publicity.'

Hollande's popularity has also soared in France since the scandal erupted on January 10.

The philandering leader's approval rating leapt to 31 per cent this week, up from 26 per cent in October - the lowest level a French president in modern times.
