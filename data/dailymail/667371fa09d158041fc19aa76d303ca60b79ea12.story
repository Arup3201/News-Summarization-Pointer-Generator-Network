Susanna Reid’s racy routines on Strictly and her flirty interview techniques have raised more than a few eyebrows over the past few months.

But a Tory politician found herself at the centre of a backlash yesterday after suggesting she’d like to give the Strictly finalist a ‘slap’.

Deborah Dunleavy, 49, who was one of the ‘Cameron Cuties’ standing for  Parliament in 2010, provoked the row after watching the newsreader dance on Saturday’s show.

Star: BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid has impressed viewers on this year's series of Strictly Come Dancing but was criticised online by Conservative politician Deborah Dunleavy

Offence: Mrs Dunleavy deleted her Twitter account after attracting criticism for her message

She posted on Twitter: ‘Does anyone else just want to slap Susanna Reid …’

Her comments later drew furious accusations that she was advocating violence against women.

Yesterday
 Mrs Dunleavy apologised for her choice of words – but said it was 
absurd that anyone could think a ‘flippant’ comment about a reality TV 
show meant she supported violence.

Mrs
 Dunleavy failed to win a place in Parliament when she stood in Bolton 
in the General Election. Next year she  will fight for a seat in the  
European Parliament representing North West England.

The
 would-be MEP’s initial quip – in which she misspelt the BBC presenter 
and Strictly Come Dancing favourite’s surname as ‘Ried’ – was originally
 viewed by just her 733 followers.

However
 it was swiftly passed on by Sufrana Ismail, a Labour councillor in 
Bolton, who wrote that it was ‘disappointing from someone who wants to 
represent me in Europe’.

Yesterday
 the councillor added: ‘This wasn’t a personal conversation, but an 
actual message from Mrs Dunleavy to 733 people and organisations who 
were following her.

‘In an 
age when violence against women is denounced by politicians from all 
parties and closely associated with domestic violence, I found this 
offensive and inappropriate.’

Another local Labour activist, Asha Ali, posted: ‘So you’re advocating violence against another women. Classy.’

And
 Jane Black, a Labour councillor and university tutor, posted: ‘This is a
 shameful comment for someone seeking public office, you should know 
better.’

Yesterday Mrs 
Dunleavy said she was ‘astounded’ by the response to her comment, 
telling how the vicious reaction had left her feeling threatened.

She
 added: ‘I sincerely apologise to anyone who was offended by my comment –
 it was supposed to be a flippant comment about reality TV.

Surely no rational-minded person would think I was meaning to condone violence against women in any shape or form?’

Mrs
 Dunleavy, who was involved in the Conservatives’ Women2Win campaign to 
increase the number of female Tory MPs at the last election, insisted 
that she hadn’t intended any disrespect towards Miss Reid.

She
 said: ‘We all find certain people on reality television irritating, but
 she seems a very nice lady who like me is trying to hold down a job 
while looking after a family as well – it was nothing personal.

‘What I’ve found particularly upsetting is the way I’ve been lambasted on Twitter by an aggressive posse of Labour activists.

‘Some
 of my children are on Twitter and it’s very unpleasant for them to see 
their mother bullied and told she’s not fit for public office in this 
way. Unfortunately it’s this sort of abuse that puts women off trying to
 take part in politics in the first place.’

Neither Miss Reid nor the BBC chose to comment on the tweet last night.

However
 one of Mrs Dunleavy’s close  relatives said the candidate had helped 
her escape from an abusive relationship – and insisted that she would be
 the last person to belittle the impact of domestic violence.

The
 woman, who can’t be named for legal reasons, said: ‘Deborah nursed me 
when I had been physically hurt, she helped rehouse me and get me away 
from a relationship in which I went to hell and back.

‘I
 couldn’t have got through it without her help, so I can say for certain
 that she would never downplay domestic violence – this was just a 
tongue-in-cheek remark.’
