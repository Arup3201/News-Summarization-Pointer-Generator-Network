She's been moving with the times since 1959 and now Barbie is ensuring her enduring appeal with today's generation of high tech children by being given a revolutionary touchscreen dress.

The blonde doll's clothing incorporates a 4.5 square inch touchscreen and 114 multi-coloured LEDs.

Children can turn fashion designer by using their finger tips or a stylus to draw their own patterns or words on Barbie's dress. Or they can select from ready made graphics such as hearts, spots and stripes.

Barbie can then be transformed into a complete 
disco dolly as she's also sound activated - when music is played the 
lights on her dress will flash with the beat.

Her necklace is not just for show either - they work as buttons to switch between the dress's different modes.

The latest state-of-the art Barbie from Mattel was unveiled at this week's New York Toy Fair and received a positive response from fans. While a date of release in the UK has not yet been announced, it will hit shelves in the U.S. in August, priced around $49.99 (Â£33)

Barbie was created by Ruth and Elliot Handler in 1959 and has had dozens of incarnations over the years from the bestselling 'Totally Hair' Barbie to the controversial 'Drag Queen' Barbie.

She's survived accusations of being anti-feminist and damaging to young girls because of her unattainably slim waist to remain one the best-selling toys on the global market today.

Princess versions remain popular with 
children of the 21st century while other modern versions have included a 
Yoga Barbie and a doll that can be given tattoos.

Digital Dress Barbie is not the first doll combining technology that Mattel have released to keep up with the tastes of today's tech-savvy youngsters. Last year they developed the Barbie Photo Fashion Doll, which doubled as a digital camera with Barbie displaying photos on her dress.

It's a sign of the times that Barbie is being given a digital update in an era where toddlers are competent users of touchscreen mobiles and tablets such as iPads.

And while some parents may be disappointed that the new doll can be given a make-over digitally and not by manually changing her clothes - at least it means Barbie no longer needs her own wardrobe!
