Former Australian Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader John Howard is standing by Tony Abbott, imploring the Liberal Party to give the struggling leader another chance.

Howard insists that the current Prime Minister will improve and make positive changes should he survive a potential leadership spill on Monday. 

Although admitting that ‘clearly changes are needed’ from Abbott’s government, Howard allegedly declared that the Prime Minister is worthy of another chance, according to The Australian.

Howard revealed that he has been approached by ‘quite a number of MPs’ seeking the former politician’s advice on the potential spill since the leadership vote was announced on Friday.

‘I have told them essentially that the common-sense reaction is to reject the spill motion and give the Prime Minister some time,’ Mr Howard told The Australian.

Mr Howard gave Mr Abbott credit for successfully ‘leading the Liberals back to government in such a short time’.

Mr Abbott and potential challenger Malcolm Turnbull were both ministers in Howard’s government.

It’s predicted that Mr Turnbull, currently the Minister for Communications, will contend for leader of the party if Monday’s Liberal Party leadership motion is successful.

John Howard is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, having led the country from 11 March 1996 to 3 December 2007.
