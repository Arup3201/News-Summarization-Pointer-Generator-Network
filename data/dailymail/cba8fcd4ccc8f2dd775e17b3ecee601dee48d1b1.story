A disturbing photo of five unrestrained children squashed into the boot of a four wheel drive has led to the irresponsible culprit being slapped with a hefty fine and a massive loss of points.

Tiana Kirkby, 18, was in the passenger seat of her boyfriend's car on Yawalpah Rd in Pimpama, Queensland on New Years Day when she saw the unbelievable sight of the youngsters jampacked into the back of the red Ford which had the boot door wide open.

Completely flabbergasted at what she was witnessing, Tiana took a photo and posted the alarming image on her Facebook page with the one word comment: 'wuuuuut?' 

It then only took the police a day after seeing the photo to track down the 41-year-old New South Wales man who received $1932 in fines and lost three points for each unrestrained child. 

A man, 42, was fined $2,000 and lost 18 points after carrying five unrestrained children in the boot of his car

A man of his word - Chief Superintendent Des Lacy, of Queensland Police, had vowed that the offending driver would be caught and ensured that the person would be prosecuted after the fact with the photographic evidence.

'People don't realise that it might not be their driving but the driving of another vehicle that causes a collision and with that many people in the car with no seatbelts we would be looking at a fatality,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'People think it won't happen to them or there is only a small distance to travel so it will be OK and nine times out of 10 it might be, but you only need one person to ignore a stop sign or look down and cross the centre line to have a collision.' 

Supt Lacy said a report was sent to NSW Police, where the car is registered, to determine who owned the vehicle.

Tiana described the careless stunt as 'the most ridiculous thing' she had ever seen in her life.

'I've seen anything like that - you just don't see that anymore,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I couldn't see if there were more in the car without seat belts but there could have been - it's just so crazy and dangerous.'

With plans to be a childcare worker, Tiana could not make sense of the careless situation.

'I have five nieces and nephews - I really care about kids,' she said.

'They looked between the ages of 12 and six - it's disturbing.

'I would hate to think that anything happened to them.' 

She said the kids were having fun in the back of the car with the boot wide open.

'They were laughing and looked like they were having a good time but they don't know the dangers,' she said.

'But the adult driver would know - it's completely wrong.'
