Senior police last night condemned moves to allow foreign officers to take charge of British forces, a change which they said reflected a ‘paramilitary’ and European style of policing.

Ministers are expected to open up the top ranks to candidates from countries such as the US, Canada and India to combat what they called an ‘insular and closed culture’.

At the same time, middle managers from industry and the military will be allowed to enter the police at the rank of superintendent after intensive training.

But the plans sparked fury among chief officers and staff associations.

The Association of Chief Police Officers insisted there was no shortage of talent in the police and worried that existing officers would be frustrated in their efforts to seek promotion.

Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘All chief constables have served on the beat, experiencing the reality of day-to-day operational policing with the public.

‘This is the model used by other countries who have followed the British system such as the US.

‘The direct entry officer class model tends to be followed by paramilitary police forces such as the French CRS or the Italian Carabinieri.’

Relaxing the rules will end the historic principle that all officers enter the police at the rank of constable. Those hired to become superintendents will undergo intensive training so they can be on the job within 15 months.

In addition, some graduates and other high-potential recruits will be fast-tracked to the rank of inspector.

This could halve the amount of time it takes someone to reach the rank of chief constable – from around 25 years today.

In theory it means someone who joins the police aged 19 could reach the top rank in their early 30s.

The Home Office said applicants for the top jobs would most likely come from countries with similar policing systems such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.

It justified the measures on the grounds that new recruits could bring in experience of other working cultures.

The policy document which contained the proposals stated: ‘When all the senior leaders in a sector have had only minimal exposure to other working cultures it may lead to a relatively insular and closed culture among those who reach the top of the organisation.’

The changes will help lure the ‘most talented people’ to join the police and attract the ‘brightest and best’, officials said.

Policing Minister Damian Green said it would be ‘years not decades’ before a foreign national took charge of a force in England and Wales.

He compared the moves to the decision to recruit a Canadian, Mark Carney, as the next Governor of the Bank of England.

Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendents’ Association accused ministers of not valuing or trusting senior police leaders. He said: ‘The Home Secretary’s proposals send out a very strong message that the senior leadership of the police service isn’t valued or trusted or else she wouldn’t be wanting to bring in foreign police chiefs.

‘Bringing people in at superintendent level, inexperienced, unqualified, will bring some risks with them.’

In 2011, a row broke out within Government over the appointment of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

Some senior Tories pushed for the hiring of Bill Bratton, the former head of the New York and Los Angeles police departments, but Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the former Chief Constable of Merseyside, was appointed.

The overhaul of recruitment rules was proposed by Tom Winsor in his review of police pay and conditions. They are likely to come into force later this year.

Mr Green said bringing in new recruits would also allow forces to recruit more ethnic minority officers to senior ranks.

He said: ‘The issue of choosing our police leaders is of the highest importance to the future of the police. There will be a relatively small number of people coming into the police from other backgrounds, increasing the diversity of the police.’
