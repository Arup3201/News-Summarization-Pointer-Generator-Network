A boy of two hooked up to a drip was left lying across two plastic hospital chairs for six hours.

Callum Giles was denied a bed as he fought a blood infection because of chronic shortages at Southampton General Hospital.

His distraught parents John and Marie pleaded with nurses as their son writhed in pain but were repeatedly put off and told there was no room.

Two-year-old Callum Giles was left lying across two plastic chairs at Southampton General Hospital for six hours because there were no free beds

Callum's furious parents claim that medical staff refused to let him use a spare camp-bed because it had no sides - and they feared he may roll off

In desperation, they suggested using 
one of the camp beds which the hospital keeps for parents to sleep on – 
only to be told it was against health and safety rules.

Callum was forced to lie sweating in his nappy, comforted only by a blanket and pillow his parents had brought from home.

Yesterday
 Mr and Mrs Giles demanded an apology from hospital bosses and branded 
the care they received ‘absolutely appalling’. Their son is just one of 
countless patients across the country who have been left lying in 
waiting rooms and corridors due to bed shortages in the NHS.

Mr
 Giles, 34, said: ‘It was awful. Callum’s temperature was sky high. All 
he wanted to do was sleep but he couldn’t because the chairs were so 
uncomfortable. I could tell that he was in pain. He was writhing around,
 and the chairs were so sticky and hot. It’s horrible to see your child 
like that. I felt so sorry for him.’

Callum,
 from Southampton, first fell ill more than a week ago, when he had a 
high temperature and sleeping problems, and lost his appetite.

The toddler's mother Marie said she was told by nurses to sit on the blue chairs until a proper bed became available. She became so frustrated after making repeated requests for a bed that she ended up creating a makeshift one herself with the two chairs

Callum's father John, said: 'To be left lying across two plastic chairs in this day and age is unacceptable. The poor lad was so hot he was sticking to the plastic and found it incredibly uncomfortable. He was restless and unable to sleep'

After six hours of waiting on the chairs, Callum was finally given a bed at 10.30pm and was discharged the next afternoon. He has been given antibiotics and is making a good recovery

Hospital
 doctors tested Callum on Monday of last week and wrongly diagnosed him 
with a viral infection, sending him home with instructions to give him 
painkillers.

Callum’s 
condition worsened and at lunchtime on Friday he was taken to hospital 
with a temperature of 41.3C (106.3F). Tests showed such dangerously high
 levels of bacteria in his blood that doctors prescribed the highest 
dose of antibiotics available, administered via a drip.

The
 two-year-old was given a bed in the emergency department but when he 
was wheeled to a children’s assessment ward at 4.30pm he was made to sit
 in a chair and wait.

Mrs 
Giles, 29, a childcare worker, was told he would be kept in hospital 
overnight because his condition was so serious but a bed had not yet 
become available.

She said: 
‘Several times I asked if Callum could have a bed, but nothing happened.
 Even the consultant who came in to talk to us did not question the 
situation. There was no blanket offered, nothing. Callum was swept to 
the side as if he was just another number. It’s disgraceful.’

Her
 husband added: ‘My wife … got so frustrated in the end that she pushed 
two chairs together and laid him down.  His condition was bad. Blood 
infections can be fatal if they are not treated.’

Last year it emerged that 40 per cent of people waited for more than four hours to be seen at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (Southampton General is pictured)

When
 Mr Giles, a security officer, arrived at 9.30pm he suggested to staff 
that they use one of the hospital camp beds for Callum. But, incredibly,
 they said that would be dangerous and against hospital policy as the 
bed had no sides and the boy might roll out.

Callum
 was eventually given a bed at 10.30pm and was sent home the following 
afternoon. He is continuing on his course of antibiotics and is expected
 to make a full recovery.

But
 his parents, who have six other children, have made an official 
complaint to the hospital. Mr Giles said: ‘The care we received at the 
hospital was absolutely appalling. To be left lying across two plastic 
chairs in this day and age is unacceptable.

‘And to say that lying on a camp bed would be against health and safety is ridiculous – surely it’s more safe than a chair.’

He added: ‘We want to make sure that other people don’t suffer in the same way. It should be about putting patients first.’

Southampton General Hospital was criticised 18 months ago by the Care Quality Commission for a lack of staff and resources.

A
 hospital spokesman said yesterday: ‘While we are sorry to hear Mr and 
Mrs Giles are unhappy with the care their son received, these issues had
 not previously been raised with us and we are not familiar with the 
accounts presented through  the media.’

He
 added that the hospital would be happy to ‘discuss any aspect of 
Callum’s treatment with his parents’ and ‘investigate any remaining 
concerns’.
