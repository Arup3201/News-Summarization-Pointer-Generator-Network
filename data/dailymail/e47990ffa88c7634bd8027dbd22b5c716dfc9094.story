A year ago Andy Murray went to Wimbledon as a British hopeful with the burden of ‘not since Fred Perry’ on his shoulders. He ended the 77-year hoodoo, walked away with the crown, and so this year returns with a new challenge: a rematch with destiny and the tough task of keeping his title.

In the Open era only Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer have been able to follow a first SW19 singles title with a second the following year.

As a boxing fan, Murray was transfixed recently by another rematch which he hopes will help him. ‘I am a huge fan of boxing, so obviously I really enjoyed the Carl Froch and George Groves fights,’ he says.

‘The training and mentality you need for boxing isn’t too far from what it’s like to be a tennis player: you have to be physically strong but also mentally; you can’t give anything away before you compete and both fighters did this perfectly.

‘[In their first fight last year] they kept everyone guessing right up to the point Groves knocked Froch down. It was a great advert for British boxing. I thought both boxers demonstrated incredible attitudes throughout, particularly in the run-up to the second fight at Wembley.

‘Carl Froch had massively underestimated Groves in the first fight, a mistake that he learnt from, and returned stronger and better than we had ever seen before. Learning from your mistakes is one of the most important things to do.

‘I really enjoyed the never-say-die attitude from Groves in securing the rematch, he fought hard to get Froch to fight him again, and although it didn’t quite work I think he gained a lot of people’s respect, which is important in any sport. The most important message I will take away from those fights is to always have that attitude: fight till the bitter end and believe in yourself.’

Murray, 27, has heard plenty of stories about what it’s like to defend a Wimbledon title, not least from new coach Amelie Mauresmo, who won the women’s singles in SW19 in 2006.

‘Pure joy,’ is how the Frenchwoman described it. ‘Of course there is a goal of winning again and focusing on the game and what to do on the court, and how to behave,’ she added. ‘But I feel first of all it’s joy, and being so proud to be there to defend the title.’

Murray has heard that you return to Centre Court with a zip in your step, confidence pulsing through you and in the certain knowledge that you have what it takes to win the most prestigious event in the world.

‘It’s a different feeling this year,’ he says. ‘After spending so many years wanting to win and not, I always put a lot of pressure on myself heading into the Championships. But after finally finding the breakthrough last year, I think I’m definitely more relaxed.

‘This year I’m just looking forward to going out and enjoying playing tennis as the defending champion, but they’ll still be plenty of pressure from me to win!’

Retaining his crown will be no easy task. Eighteen men have won the Wimbledon single’s title for the first time in the open era of tennis since 1968, and only four of them have followed up by retaining their title the next year.

That quartet names are a roll call of some of the greatest players the game has known, all of them titans on grass in their pomp. Borg, Becker, Sampras and Federer have won 48 Grand Slam singles titles between them, 22 of those at Wimbledon

‘I’ve heard from a few of the guys that returning as defending champion is very special,’ Murray says. ‘The British fans are always incredible and I’m sure they will all be just as fired up this year. My mindset heading out onto Centre Court on the first day will still be the same as it has been every year. This tournament means everything to me, and I will be giving everything I can to go all the way again.’

So intense, so tumultuous was last year’s win, Murray barely took it in. He returned alone on the Monday to Centre Court to let it sink in.

‘It was a funny feeling,’ he says. ‘It was literally just me, so the contrast from the day before was incredible.

‘I couldn’t remember much about the final game, so being able to just stand on the court, I was able to reflect on the day before, I even tried to replay a few of the points in my head.’

Mauresmo takes over where Ivan Lendl left off as Murray’s coach. They could not be more different. Asked if she too would sit in the players’ box, unsmiling, shades on, stern and authoritarian, she can but laugh at the thought.

Then she sits up in the chair, pretending for a split second to be steely. ‘So I have to sit up straight?’ she asks. ‘It’s tough to compare Ivan and me. We are so different in every way. I don’t 
know Ivan very well. I know him through Andy’s eyes. I don’t think I 
will bring him the same as Ivan. Which is good, because Ivan brought him
 a lot and maybe I can bring him different things.’

Lendl, says Mauresmo, made Murray more consistent, physically, against the biggest opponents.

‘And something else was helping him [overcome] the finals he lost in Grand Slams. And finally finding the switch to make it happen.’

Her role, she says, will be more about psychology, at least immediately. ‘Andy’s DNA is not going to change drastically in the way he plays . . . on grass, playing the final in 2012, winning the Olympics, winning last year, he knows how to do this stuff.’

Instead it seems she will help him remain calm on the court, on top of the demons that sometimes hurt his chances in his youth. She will also share the bad times she had at her own home Slam, Roland Garros, and how she felt crushed by pressure, and arguably under-achieved over the span of her career.

‘Sharing my experience, sharing what I felt, these moments. Sharing maybe the mistakes that I made,’ is how she describes what she is doing.It was interesting to share these feelings and maybe help him try to avoid [negative thoughts]. His career is moving on and he’s learning many things . . . I should have done things a little bit differently at some points and hopefully he can learn from my mistakes.'
