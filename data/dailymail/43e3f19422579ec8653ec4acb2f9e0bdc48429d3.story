Thousands of patients are ‘playing doctor’ before they go under the knife thanks to a new app that lets them become a virtual surgeon.

The Touch Surgery app has been designed to help junior surgeons perfect their skills – but it has become a big hit with patients, too.

Keen to see what will happen to them during their knee replacement or tendon repair, they have started using the app in large numbers.

The app designed by Touch Surgery (above) to help junior surgeons perfect their skills features realistic graphics drawn up by Hollywood CGI animators and has been a big hit with patients around the world

It enables users – medically trained or otherwise – to ‘perform’ each stage of an operation by making virtual incisions on their mobile or tablet by using realistic computer graphics drawn up by Hollywood CGI animators.

Co-founder of the app, Jean Nehme, a 
trained plastic surgeon, said he had been stunned to find 40,000 
patients across the world had downloaded the app – almost a quarter of 
the 180,000 users.=

He said: ‘It’s very difficult for a surgeon to describe what they do in a procedure.

'But patients want to know the details and the risks.

‘As a result patients are using it to find out what is going to happen to them in the operation.’

Cinematographer Barrett Veldsman used the app before having gall bladder surgery.

He said seeing what happened stage by stage made the surgery appear ‘so simple, it relaxes you’.

The Touch Surgery app has a total 180,000 users - of which 40,000 are patients from around the world
