A mother-of-three diagnosed with an 'inoperable' brain tumour has defied medics after undergoing radical surgery in the USA to have it successfully removed - and could now live another 15 years. 

Laura Fischer-Beards was just 37 when she was given the devastating diagnosis after developing pains in her neck.

The nurse was told the tumour was benign but that it was too deep within her brain to operate - and she had between just three to 12 months to live.

Laura Fischer-Beards, with husband Mark and sons Elliot, Henry and Sebastian, was just 37 when she was given the devastating diagnosis she had an inoperable brain tumour - and just months to live  

She underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which proved unsuccessful. An attempted biopsy also caused her to have a bleed on the brain, temporarily paralysing her down her right side

NHS Doctors in Birmingham and London told her the tumour was like a 'spider wrapping round her brain' and warned her there was nothing more they could do.

Instead, they tried to manage her condition with chemotherapy and radiotherapy - which proved unsuccessful.

But the now 39-year-old refused to give up for the sake of her three boys and researched alternative treatments not provided on the NHS or privately in Britain.

Mrs Fischer-Beards, and husband Mark, 41, a police officer, found a pioneering treatment available in the USA for £80,000 called 'awake craniotomy with mapping'.

Without hesitation, she flew to Chicago two weeks ago.

Last Wednesday she underwent the procedure - which involved cutting open a slice of skull - while awake.

Incredibly, to avoid injury to her language, motor and sensory functions, she had to recite her children's names and birthday's so  during surgery.

And after the five hour operation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital she was delighted to be told doctors had successfully removed 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour.

Doctors say the surgery could have extended her life by up to 15 years. 

Mrs Fischer-Beards, from Berkswell, near Coventry, West Midlands, said she was desperate to survive so she could be there for her children

She said: 'It was a choice of giving up or fighting and I am not a defeatist.

'I couldn't just give up when I have three young children who need me to be there for them.

'I think anyone in my position would do the same and fight as hard as they can to stay alive.'

She and her husband said they were left with no option after a 42-day course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed to get her condition under control. 

An attempted biopsy caused her to have a bleed on the brain and temporarily paralyse her down her right side. A scan then showed the tumour's progression had not slowed. 

After meeting a doctor at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in Chicago, she took the brave decision to undertake the radical surgery last week

Consultants admitted they had run out of ideas and encouraged her to look for more radical treatment elsewhere.

Mrs Fischer-Beards added: 'I had private healthcare, so it wasn't about taking money out of the NHS, just about their belief in my chances of survival which they thought were virtually nothing.

'I have to admit it was a risk and I was really scared because I had to remain awake throughout the surgery so they could check my brain was functioning normally.

'But you do what you have to do to survive.'

Mrs Fischer-Beards is now fundraising to pay for treatment, not covered by health insurance

She is now recovering in hospital and is expected to return to the UK soon.

But the family is now left with a crippling bill of £80,000 for U.S. surgery, not covered by UK private healthcare.

Mr Fischer-Beards has been forced to stay in the country to look after the couple's three children - Elliot, 8, Henry, 7, and Sebastian,4.

He said: 'You can't put a price on life. Nowhere else does this kind of procedure because it is so tricky and risky - but I couldn't be prouder of how brave she has been.

'She was awake the whole time while they sliced open her skull and removed the tumour.

'The whole time they asked her to count and recite the boy's birthdays and names, so that they didn't disturb a part of the brain that deals with her memory.

'But she's speaking fine and they said they had removed it OK, so it looks like its been successful.

'Me and the boys just want her back home now.'

To meet the steep cost of surgery, Laura's local community has begun a Facebook campaign entitled £onebravemummy to raise awareness of her situation and raise money to help the family.

They have helped raise more than £7,000 online in a matter of days as the campaign gains momentum.

Any donations to help pay for Laura's treatment can be made via the Justgiving page  

When a tumor is near critical speech areas of the brain, it may be important to determine the exact location of these speech-related areas

Although functional MRI (fMRI) can show the various areas of activation during speech functions, it does not pinpoint the most important areas. 

These critical areas must be located using special speech mapping techniques while the patient is awake in the operating room.

Awake speech mapping involves applying mild electrical current to the surface of the exposed brain while the patient performs various tasks, such as reading. If the stimulation hinders the task, then that area of the brain is marked and preserved.

How a sleep-awake-sleep craniotomy works

The operation is begun while the patient is deeply asleep under general anesthesia (on a breathing machine). This is for the comfort of the patient and is safer.

When the brain is exposed and the neurosurgeon is ready to begin mapping the speech areas, neuroanesthesiologists carefully lighten the sedation, and then remove the breathing tube and allow the patient to talk and interact with the neuropsychologist.

Typically, the patients feel minimal or no discomfort while awake

Once the speech mapping is complete, often the tumor is removed while the speech testing continues. The procedure lessens the risk of undercutting the white matter fibers connecting speech areas.

When appropriate, the anesthesiologist skillfully places the patient back under general (deep) anesthesia, allowing the neurosurgeon to complete the operation safely with no discomfort to the patient.
