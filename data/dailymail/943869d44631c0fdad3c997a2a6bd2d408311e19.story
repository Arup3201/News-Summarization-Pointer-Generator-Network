Confusion reigns over the identity of the brutal ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' after security experts now appear to dismiss suggestions he is a former rapper from west London.

The masked man, who speaks with a clear London accent, has appeared in two chilling videos showing him beheading American journalists and issuing a threat to kill a British hostage.

The main suspect in the sickening murders was thought to be Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the so-called hip hop jihadist who left his £1million home in Maida Vale to join Islamist militants fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria.

It is now understood however, that although officials are confident they have worked out the killer's identity using high-tech analysis of his body and voice, they do not believe it to be Abdel Bary.

The executioner is understood to be known as 'John' because he travelled to join ISIS in Syria along with three other Britons, with the foursome dubbed 'The Beatles' by their fellow militants.

In the wake of James Foley's murder last month, Britain's ambassador to the U.S. Sir Peter Westmacott said the UK was 'very close' to identifying the killer

European hostages freed earlier this year have identified the Briton as being one of three jailers they dubbed 'The Beatles', who guarded them and oversaw torture and mock executions.

During extensive 'debriefings' with intelligence officers, the hostages were shown pictures of suspected UK and other European jihadists.

The former captives are understood to have been able to recognise around eight Britons they had 'come into contact' with during their months of captivity in a dozen locations around Syria.

A shortlist of British men who might have been the murderer of Mr Foley, who was kidnapped 22-months ago, was drawn up by the UK security services, FBI and Scotland Yard's counter terrorism command. A second list of Britons who may have come in to contact with him was also compiled.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, is a former musician whose music has been played on BBC Radio 1.

For more than a decade he lived with his mother Ragaa in a £1million house in Maida Vale, West London, which is owned by Westminster Council.

He walked out of the family home in 2013 to fight in Syria, saying that he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. He later boasted about the battles he had fought.

Friends said Bary – an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene – grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary.

Bary is one of six children of Egyptian militant Adel Abdul Bary, who was granted political asylum in the UK in 1993.

In 2012 he was extradited to the US, where he was wanted in connection to the 1998 United States embassy bombings in East Africa which killed hundreds of people.

Investigators said that he helped to publicise statements claiming responsibility after the bombings.

Bary Snr's eight-year legal battle made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Investigators believe Bary Snr was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network.

Bary Jr is believed to be the ringleader of the three extremists, according to the Sun.

Many of those being investigated have used social media over the past two years to make postings and these have been studied for clues as to locations and associations – dozens of pictures have featured more than one person.

Among those on the second list was Abdel Bary, 23, from West London, who travelled to Syria last year and has been linked to both 'John' and both the beheading videos.

A neighbour of Bary, a rising music star whose father is due to stand trial in the US in connection with Al Qaeda-linked bombings of embassies in Africa, previously claimed she had been told that his home had been raided several days ago. Scotland Yard denied it had searched the address.

The list also includes a former student, a computer hacker and a travel-guide writer.

Sir Peter said 'sophisticated' voice recognition technology was  used to identify the suspect who delivered a long rant on the video of Foley's murder.

The killer was not wearing gloves in the video as he gripped a knife in his left hand. 

A technique known as 'vein matching', which examines and compares veins on the hands and is among the tools investigators will use to identify him.

This technique has previously been used successfully in another terrorism case – and is said to be 'proving of interest.'

Referring to British citizens who to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight in the past few years, Sir Peter told CNN : 'It's not just about one brutal murderer - it is a threat to our citizens.

'People think that maybe as many as 500 British subjects have gone to Syria and Iraq for this cause of jihad.

Militant: Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers

Identification: In the wake of James Foley's murder last month (pictured), Britain's ambassador to the U.S. Sir Peter Westmacott said the UK was 'very close' to identifying the killer

Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He fled to Syria last year while on police bail.

It has been reported that the jihadist, whose real name Junaid Hussian, is helping mastermind cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell IS war coffers.

Hussain has not directly mentioned hacking  on Twitter, but a fellow fighter boasted of being bought pizza using celebrity's credit card details acquired by a jihadist hacker.

This week it was claimed that Hussain was married to a middle-aged former rock musician and Islam convert from Kent called Sally Jones.

Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers.

MailOnline revealed an account on the ask.fm social media site, believed to be operated by al-Britani, which gave self-identified youths advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and perks of the job from working with IS.

Another message describes the 'welcome pack' new ISIS recruits receive when they complete theIr induction process.

He is believed to be one of a group of men from Portsmouth who flew from London Gatwick to the tourist town of Antalya in Turkey, before crossing the border into Syria to join ISIS.

Computer-aided landscape analysis has been used on horrific death video of Mr Foley and those images compared to satellite and surveillance pictures.

These investigations are said to indicate it was probably taken close to the IS headquarters and stronghold of Raqqa in Syria.

US and UK military commanders are now focusing their efforts on securing the 'electronic airspace' along the Syria border with the overall aim closing down IS's ability to communicate with other forces in Syria.

After Foley's death, a senior UK source said: 'The current aim is to find and fix the command cell of Islamic State and then move to isolate other units in the mission to locate the executioner and bring him to justice... We have a mass of resources and the man will be found.'
