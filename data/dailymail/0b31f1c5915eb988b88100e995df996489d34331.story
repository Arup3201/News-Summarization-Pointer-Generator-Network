In charge: A boxer cowers in fear as the tortoise cat stares him back up the stairs

Feline fear: The boxer gives his owner a pleading look as if to ask for help to get past the cat

The boxer scratches at the stairs, howls and whimpers, but dares not take another step.

Another
shows a similar situation where the owner is forced to remove the black
cat at the bottom of the stairs in order to get the dog to come down.

A brilliant clip shows a corgi stop dead in its tracks as it spots a cat in the doorway into the next room.

It paces back and forward, staying close to the wall in a failed attempt to pluck up the courage to walk past the cat.

Try and you will fail: A dog stops dead in his tracks when he spots the cat

Cat overlord: There was no point in even trying for this dog when the master cat was placed atop the stairs

Territorial: A dark cat lies on the bottom stair, as if protecting the ground floor from the family dog, and although he tries his best to face his fear, the dog does not dare walk down the stairs

My saviour: A human hero steps in and removes the cat and the dog can finally run down the stairs

Royal guard: This corgi had the shock of his life when he discovered that the cat was blocking the kitchen door

Fear of fur: Despite trying several times, the corgi could not pluck up the courage to walk past the cat

Brave attempt: A large dog starts making its way up the stairs...

... but it soon runs back down again when a cat appears at the top
