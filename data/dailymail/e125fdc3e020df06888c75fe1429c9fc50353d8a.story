Parents angrily confronted a head teacher after he gave primary children books about tackling homophobic bullying.

Police were called after the protest, which had been orchestrated by religious campaigners, became heated.

Head teacher Jamie Barry is said to have faced aggression and verbal abuse at the meeting at Welford Primary in Birmingham, one of the schools linked to the ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal earlier this year.

It was one of 21 schools inspected by Ofsted amid claims of a conspiracy by hardliners to impose strict Islamic practices.

While Welford, which has a large Muslim intake, was given a clean bill of health, inspectors reported some children saying they believed it was wrong to be gay.

The protest occurred at a regular parents’ meeting last month.

Mr Barry was expecting about 20 attendees to discuss routine matters, only to find around 100 parents there demanding to know about the introduction of teaching materials called Challenging Homophobia in Primary Schools (Chips).

The parents had been encouraged to attend by anti-abortion group the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc), which shares common ground with conservative Muslims on several issues.

An email obtained by the Daily Mail was sent to some parents by Antonia Tully, who coordinates Spuc’s Safe At School campaign.

She listed 13 questions she asked to be forwarded to as many parents as possible to support Spuc’s view that young children should not be taught about homosexuality.

The email said the head teacher ‘needs to hear the same concerns’– such as ‘teaching children about sexual orientation isn’t making them safe [but] putting ideas into children’s heads’.

As a result, the meeting – involving parents from a variety of religious backgrounds – became heated. 

Some complaints were ‘very personal and very aggressive’, Mr Barry said. 

Staff called the police and the head was advised to leave the room, although he denies police escorted him from the premises for his own safety.

Mrs Tully said she got involved at Welford after being contacted by parents earlier this year. 

‘They told me that someone phoned the police which was a very inflammatory reaction. 

'They said nothing that happened at the meeting warranted any police involvement,’ she said. 

She has helped dozens of parents to complain to Birmingham Council about the school.

Chips, which features a series of story books, is being used in about 35 Birmingham schools.

Mr Barry said he had not been surprised to hear that some pupils had made anti-gay remarks.

‘We were aware that they might do, because culturally, within the community we serve, we know those views are heard,’ he said.

‘But it made us think that as a school we need to do a little more in terms of teaching children about diversity and relationships.

‘While we respect everyone’s right to a personal view, same-sex marriage is legal and some same-sex couples adopt or foster. 

'Our children will come into contact with these people and we don’t want it to be a shock to the system.’

Rob Kelsall, senior regional officer for the National Association of Head Teachers, said the Government must give its ‘full support’ to heads who deliver the Chips programme.
