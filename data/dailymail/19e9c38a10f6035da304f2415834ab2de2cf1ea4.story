A Texas woman cast caution to the wind during a recent shopping trip in order to chase down and publicly shame a man she says groped her inside a Big Lots.

The woman, who identified herself to reporters only as Belle, says she was fondled twice by the man on Tuesday in the Houston bargain department store.

'He made me feel uncomfortable so I started thinking, "I'm at the back of the store, I should probably get away from this back aisle,"' Belle told KTRK.

A woman at a Texas Big Lots recorded herself chasing down a man she says repeatedly groped her while she shopped Tuesday

Belle fled to the front of the store, where she informed a cashier about the startling experience. 

Meanwhile, the man who groped her took off out the door. Instead of simply letting him go, Belle went after him, her cell phone video camera rolling.

'You don't need to go around the store like an idiot, fondling women,' Belle can be heard saying to the man as he rushes down the sidewalk in the video.

As Belle continues to shout down the man, he becomes increasingly aggressive.

At one point, he stops and yells, 'I'm about to kill you,' and then lunges at Belle.

Police say 24-year-old Jerry Higgins was the culprit. He's allegedly seen in video walking away from Belle before threatening her and snatching her cell phone

He then snatches Belle's phone and takes off.

From inside the store, Belle then called 911. Soon after, Harris County police apprehended Jerry Higgins.

With her camera back in hand, Belle then recorded the 24-year-old's arrest.

Higgins was jailed on charges of criminal mischief and robbery-bodily injury.

He now sits in Harris County jail in lieu of $25,000 bond. 

Belle called 911 from inside the store and police soon arrested Belle, which she recorded with her recovered phone
