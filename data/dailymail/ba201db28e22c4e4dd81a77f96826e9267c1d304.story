It has been a cracking World Cup so far. Even the dullest of games (looking at you, Holland v Argentina!) have had the decency to end with a bit of drama.

But with the tournament now building towards Sunday's final, and just two teams remaining (excluding the perennially pointless third-placed playoff), attention's are slowly turning towards the start of next season.

And what are often the main points of topic in the campaign following a World Cup? Burnout. Tiredness. Lack of a proper break for star players.

Here, Sportsmail have taken a look at the Premier League clubs who have seen the most action in Brazil and the amount of minutes clocked up by the players who are set to return to the domestic stage come August 16...

Clocked up: Germany pair Andre Schurrle and Mesut Ozil could increase Chelsea and Arsenal's minutes played in the World Cup Final on Sunday

In most danger of a summer hangover are Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho's 2014/15 squad having registered 3,153 minutes at the World Cup so far - a number which could very well rise should Diego Costa complete his long-mooted move to the club.

Then come Arsenal in second, with 2,748 minutes clocked up so far. And with German stars Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski still involved, that number could very well increase.

In fact, the potential signings of Alexis Sanchez (390 minutes) and Mathieu Debuchy (360 minutes) would also see the club rise above Chelsea on the list - but until those moves are completed, Arsenal remain firmly in the second spot.

Manchester City are third on 2,740 minutes, including 90 from new signing Bacary Sagna, whilst cross-town rivals Manchester United are currently fourth with 2,548 - a number which could yet fall should Patrice Evra (360 minutes) move on.

Tottenham round out the top five on 1,932 minutes - with Hugo Lloris clocking up 450 of those for France - and Liverpool are sixth on 1,722 minutes (including new signings Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert), although they could lose 178 of those should Luis Suarez complete a potential move away.

Switch: Bacary Sagna has left Arsenal for Manchester City, whilst it seems that Patrice Evra is on his way out of Manchester United

But not forgotten: Whilst Luis Suarez made quite an impact in just 178 minutes in Brazil

Everton and Stoke are 7th and 8th, on 1,029 and 984 minutes respectively, whilst QPR racked up 867 minutes in Brazil - mostly thanks to Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar's 570.

Newcastle rest in 10th on 816 minutes at the moment, with one of those being registered by the mighty Tim Krul. But they are set to lose 360 of the rest as soon as Mathieu Debuchy's departure to Arsenal is confirmed.

Ron Vlaar clocked up 600 minutes of Aston Villa's 681 (with new signing Phillippe Senderos managing 81), whilst Southampton are just behind on 679.

Then come Swansea City on 437, Hull City with 364 pitch minutes and Mile Jedinak recorded all 270 minutes for Crystal Palace.

Pain: Julio Cesar clocked up 570 minutes for Brazil and QPR so far. Though he hopes to forget some of it

Big man: Ron Vlaar clocked up 600 of Aston Villa's 681 World Cup minutes

Those racking up below 100 minutes were Ben Foster's 90 minutes for West Brom, Algeria's Riyad Mahrez getting 71 for Leicester City and finally Jozy Altidore's 23 minutes for Sunderland.

Rock bottom, however, were Burnley and West Ham, with neither having a single players at the World Cup.

Will it all make a difference on the outcome of the Premier League next season? Only time will tell.
