Hitchhiker Tony Jones vanished in 1972 after walking along the Flinders Highway in Queensland. He is one of 11 people killed in mysterious circumstances on the stretch of road

The family of a hitchhiker who was killed in a 32-year-old murder mystery believes an outback 'thrill killer' could be responsible for 11 other unsolved murders along Queensland’s 800km 'highway of death'.

Hitchhiker Tony Jones vanished without a trace on the night of November 3, 1982 while walking along the Flinders Highway – last seen in Anthill Creek, known as Townsville’s killing fields, about 26km out of town.

But despite detectives conducting a full-scale manhunt, the killer was never caught.

Over the past three decades, two coronial inquests have also been conducted in an attempt to find out what happened to the missing man.

The family also hired a private investigator to no avail.

But Queensland Police have today revealed they have fresh leads into the cold case, and have reopened it for investigation.

The missing man’s brother, Mark Jones, said the family had invested a lot of time into trying to find links between this murder and several others along the same stretch of road.

'We’ve spent years trying to find links to unsolved murders like Tony’s,' Mr Jones, 53, of Melbourne told the Courier Mail newspaper.

'In terms of a fit, if you look at those with no apparent motive, you can find links. This could be the work of a thrill killer.'

The site where the lone hitchhiker disappeared on the Flinders Highway, a remote 800km stretch of road, was the same area where police found the bodies of Mackay sisters Judith, 7, and five-year-old Susan.

Both were found to have been sexually abused.

Mr Jones said this latest breakthrough gives the family fresh hope.

Northern Regional Crime Coordinator Cheryl Scanlon declined to comment on the likelihood of an outback serial killer.

'We are purely focused on this one cold case of Tony Jones and I don’t want to detract from our momentum,’’ Acting Superintendent Scanlon told reporters.

She said several anonymous phone calls to police had revealed 'completely new’ and 'very specific leads', following serious crime and homicide detectives swooping on the outback cattle town of Hughenden, 384km west of Townsville this week.

The body of Catherine Graham, 18, was found raped and slain on the same location in 2007.

In October 1978, Karen Edwards, Gordon Twaddle and Timothy Thompson were found shot in the head near Mt Isa, about 250km west of Julia Creek.

Hitchhikers Robin Hoinville-Bartram, 18, and Anita Cunningham, 19, also disappeared along the Flinders Highway several decades ago.

Robin was shot twice in the head and her skeletal remains were found west of Charters Towers in July 1972.

Anita was listed as missing but police believe she was killed with her friend.

Those murders, too, are unsolved.

A $250,000 reward still stands for Tony Jones and those with any information are asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
