Four men were led out of a New York court room and arrested yesterday after they allegedly photographed a teenager as she testified against an Orthodox Jewish leader.

The young woman, who has not been named, is involved in the sex-abuse trial of Rabbi Nechemya Weberman, who she accuses of molesting her.

The trial was thrown into turmoil after the men, believed to be supporters of Rabbi Weberman, allegedly took images of her on their phones as she gave evidence.

Strict: Rabbi Nechemya Weberman is accused of sexually abusing a 12 year-old girl. Four men, believed to be his supporters, have been arrested for allegedly photographing the girl as she testified during his trial

The four, all members of the strict Satmar sect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of which Rabbi Weberman is leader - were arrested after one of the images of the girl was posted to a Twitter account, the New York Post reports.

Rabbi Weberman is accused of fondling 
the teenager and forcing her to perform oral sex on him over the course 
of many years beginning when she was 12.

Prosecutors
say the girl's parents sent their rebellious daughter to him for 
counselling after she broke several rules of the
sect, including reading magazines like Cosmopolitan and People and 
wearing stockings that were too thin.

Rabbi Weberman was supposed to be re-indoctrinating the girl and 
bringing her back to the ultra-conservative standards of the community 
after she was branded a 'heretic.' Instead, she told a counsellor years later, that he was abusing her.

Yesterday, the judge criticised the men for outing the young woman, according to the Post.

'You know about the Torah, you know about rabbinical courts. This is a civil court,' Supreme Court Justice John Ingram told them.

'Your phones will be held for possible criminal prosecution. You may wish to avail yourself of counsel.'

The four - Lemon Juice, 30, Joseph Fried, 23, Yona Weisman, 23, and Abraham Zupnick, 23 - were taken from Brooklyn Supreme Court to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office for questioning. They face criminal contempt charges that could carry up to a year in prison, a source said.

Mr Weisman denied taking a picture, according to the Post. All spectators at the trial were then ordered to hand over their phones by the judge. One source is quoted as describing the move as being similar to what happens in a gang trial.

The rabbi's lawyers are fiercely denying the allegations. They say the girl made up the story to retaliate against him.

They say the she went to police only after Rabbi Weberman and her parents set up hidden cameras to secretly record the girl having sex with her boyfriend when she was still underage. 

Rabbi Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hope that the boyfriend would be prosecuted.The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped.

Rabbi Weberman's lawyers also claim that he had been a business partner of the girl's parents and that the families had a falling out.

The Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has rallied around the rabbi - sponsoring fundraisers to pay for his legal defence. Rabbi Weberman is charged with 88 counts of sex assault.
