Former First Lady Nancy Regan finds it ‘really hard’ to believe former President Ronald Regan has been dead for 10 years on the anniversary of his death.

Ronald Regan died June 5, 2004 at age 93, and his widow still stands by his side, even saying she still feels the former actor with her and even sees him in her dreams.

‘It is really hard for me to believe that Ronnie has been gone for 10 years. I still feel his presence every day and often find him in my dreams at night,’ the still-grieving woman said in a statement.

‘Many people have told me how much they wish we could have 'another Ronald Reagan' back in Washington, and I can't argue their logic,’ the 92-year-old matriarch continued.

‘But for me there will be only the one Ronald Reagan, a man that was both the love of my life and one of the greatest leaders this country has ever produced.’

This year also makes it 25 since the Regans left the White House in 1989.

Ronald Reagan was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California.

His aging wife still makes the trip every year to the library to visit her beloved husband’s grave, her son Michael Reagan told Closer magazine.

‘She’s still kicking,’ he said.

Several former Regan administration officials gathered at the library to celebrate the Republican’s life and legacy.

He was called a ‘statesman of the first rank’ and a ‘happy warrior,’ according to the New York Daily News.

Regan helped bring an end to the Cold War with the Soviet Union through a famous 1987 speech in which he shouted to then-Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ‘tear down this wall!’

He also survived a 1981 assassination attempt and fought a much-publicized battle against Alzheimer’s disease, which eventually claimed his life.
