A personal trainer has become an internet sensation with her bikini body guide earning her an astonishing 700,000 Instagram followers, including Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel.

Kayla Itsines, 23, from Adelaide, South Australia, works with clients near her home but has gained worldwide notoriety through her social media accounts where she shows off the enviable results of her regime.

With a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk, Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk.

Kayla, who works as a personal trainer in Adelaide, Australia, began gaining fans online by posting pictures of herself and her own workouts

Demand from followers to know how she achieved her body was so high that Kayla released an ebook so fans could follow her high intensity workouts at home with minimal equipment.

Speaking to MailOnline, Kayla explains: ‘I have always been healthy and fit. Whether it was basketball, other sport or just working out. I am far too impatient to not do something with my time.

‘Now my mission is what inspires me. I have a dream to end confusion within the health and fitness industry. Fads and scams in this industry have created so much distrust and insecurity around weight-loss programs.

‘I want all people to understand their body, have a place to learn about health and fitness and in turn feel confident & happy. I was always a little “too skinny” during my childhood and often got bullied for it.

‘I put in years of training and research to try to get my body to where it is today. Now I am in a position where I can educate girls to gain OR lose weight to get their dream body. Everyone’s goal appearance is different, but the goal is still really confidence.’

Hundreds of girls who follow Kayla's 12 week guide post their own before and after pictures to her

Kayla says her aim is to counter the distrust and insecurity around weight-loss programs created by fad diets and scams

So many people enjoyed the training style in my videos and kept requesting that I release a book of workouts so in January 2014 I released a training program and nutritional guidelines that are for women only.’

Kayla, who doesn't touch alcohol, is the first to admit that obtaining the ‘perfect’ body or getting into shape isn't easy, and her Instagram account is filled with motivational tips and phrases as well as details of her low fat healthy meals.

However, the Instagram star is all about balance, shunning extreme or fad diets, and admits she allows herself to indulge every now and again.

‘If I'm not at the gym, I'm usually at the park with my Siberian Husky. I like to spend as much time as possible outside, even if I'm not training.

‘I do have a weak spot for Tiramisu but because I am lactose intolerant and this has dairy in it, I can only have it once every so often… but this is probably a good thing!’ 

Although she admits staying in shape and losing weight can be hard, Kayla also allows herself to indulge every now and again

Kayla's workouts are all about high intensity circuits which focus on problem areas as well as burning as much fat as possible in the shortest time

Her realistic and honest approach, as much as the advert of her body, is what has made Kayla so popular online.

Currently with over 700,000 followers on Instagram, 145,595 likes on Facebook, and over 40,000 twitter followers, Kayla says her time sensitive workouts are key to her success.

‘I feel extremely lucky to have such amazing online followers, who I am able to chat to on a daily basis! It's definitely one of the best parts of my job.

‘My training concept in the Bikini Body Guide is about getting the most out of a limited amount of time. In today’s society most people are time poor so I wanted to help them burn as much fat as fast as possible in as little time as possible without sacrificing quality of training. 

‘By applying science-based concepts to my particular style of training I was able to get the outcomes that girls wanted, such as flat stomachs, toned thighs, and strong, slim arms.’

As well as thousands of girls, hundreds of whom send her their before and after pictures following completing her 12 week guide, Kayla has drawn attention from some of the most lusted after women on the planet.

Renowned for their bodies and intense workouts, Victoria Secret model Candice Swanepoel is one of Kayla’s fans.

‘Candice Swanepoel follows me. This was such an amazing moment for me. Candice has been one of my favourite models for such a long time. To have her enjoy what I have been doing online was such a pleasant surprise.’

And it seems we are sure to see more of Kayla as her fame increases and she releases more guides.

'Girls of all ages, all over the world have been enjoying my programs and there will definitely be more coming soon!'
