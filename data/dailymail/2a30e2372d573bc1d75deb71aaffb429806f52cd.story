A Cairo court today ordered the government to block access to the video-sharing website YouTube for 30 days for carrying an anti-Islam film that caused deadly riots across the world.

Judge Hassouna Tawfiq ordered YouTube be blocked for carrying the film, which he described as "offensive to Islam and the Prophet (Muhammad)."

He made the ruling in the Egyptian capital where the first protests against the film erupted last September before spreading to more than 20 countries, killing more than 50 people.

A Cairo court today ordered the the Egyptian government to block access to YouTube for one month after the video-sharing website carried an anti-Islam film last year.Â  Muslims from all backgrounds waved

The ruling, however, can be appealed and, based on precedent, might not be enforced.

The 14-minute trailer for the movie 'Innocence of Muslims' portrays the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, a central figure to Islam, as a religious fraud, womaniser and pedophile. It was produced in the United States by an Egyptian-born Christian who's now a US citizen.

Egypt's new constitution includes a ban on insulting 'religious messengers and prophets.'

Broadly worded, blasphemy laws were also in effect under former President Hosni Mubarak prior to his removal in a popular revolt two years ago.

Human rights lawyer Gamal Eid said the decision to ban YouTube stems in large part from a lack of knowledge among judges about how the internet works. Activists say this has led to a lack of courtroom discussion on technical aspects of digital technology, leaving cases based solely on threats to national security and defamation of religion.

'This verdict shows that judges' understanding of technology is weak,' Eid said. 'The judges do not realise that one wrong post on a website does not mean you have to block the entire website.'

Eid, who is executive director at The Arabic Network for Human Right Information, said the government should file an appeal and make it clear to judges that, at most, only specific pages on websites should be blocked.

His group released a statement saying that the decision to block YouTube is counterproductive, citing thousands of videos that seek to promote a better understanding of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad on the website.

YouTube's parent company, Google, declined requests to remove the video from the website last year, but restricted access to it in certain countries, including Egypt, Libya and Indonesia, because it said the video broke laws in those countries.

At the height of the protests in September, YouTube was ordered blocked in several countries, including Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah issued an order blocking all websites with access to the anti-Islam film in the conservative kingdom.

Lawyer Mohammed Hamid Salim, who filed the case against the Egyptian government, alleged the film constitutes a threat to Egypt's security, adding that YouTube refused to remove the film despite its offensive content. Protesters in Cairo scaled the US Embassy's walls and brought down the US flag in the first demonstration against the film last year.

More than 3,500 British Muslims, some from as far afield as Glasgow, waved banners and chanted slogans outside the search engine's UK headquarters to demand the company removes the film from the internet in October.
