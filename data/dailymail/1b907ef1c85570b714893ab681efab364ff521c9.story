Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been accused of using Wojciech Szczesny as a scapegoat after the goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers at Southampton.

Szczesny has been absent from Arsenal's last two wins (both clean sheets) against Stoke  in the Barclays Premier League and Hull in the FA Cup third round.

It has led former Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski to back his compatriot and claim Wenger is doing nothing more than pointing the finger at Szczesny.

'I think the smoking in the showers incident was only an excuse to fine Wojciech. Wenger made sure someone was a scapegoat,' The Sun report Tomaszewski as saying. 

'He is losing in the race for the Champions League places and if they miss out, that would be a huge loss.

'Szczesny was at fault for both goals against Southampton, but that's not the most important thing in this situation.'

David Ospina replaced Szczesny against Hull and Stoke for his first Arsenal appearances since October 1 in the Champions League against Galatasaray. 

The 26-year-old has not conceded, winning the Premier League games 2-0 and 3-0 respectively.
