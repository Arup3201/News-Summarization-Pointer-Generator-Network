Families on the Somerset Levels fled their homes today after flood water rose by two feet in just a few hours when river defences were breached.

Police in helicopters took to the skies on Wednesday night and used a Tannoy system to urge residents to abandon their homes.

But many homeowners in Northmoor, Saltmoor and Fordgate were reluctant to leave and watched helplessly yesterday as waves of sewage-filled water engulfed their houses.

Julian Taylor, 72, and his wife Mary, 
68, initially resisted evacuation - but yesterday fled after they 
watched nine inches of murky water pour into their home in Fordgate.

District councillor Julian said: 'We are out now. Nine inches came up in just a few hours.

'It
 was awful. We are out now, we've put the dogs in kennels and we are 
staying with friends on a short-term basis but ultimately we have 
nowhere to go.'

Heavy rain 
fell into the swollen River Tone which poured into an 
already-overwhelmed reservoir near the villages and over the top of a 
man-made defence wall.

Maria Mae also abandoned her Fordgate home after 2ft of water poured into her cottage in the early hours of this morning.

She said: 'We couldn't do it any more, so we decided to just move out.

'It's terrible. We moved to this beautiful place to retire, because we love Somerset.

'It's so devastating to see it going underwater. I am living like a refugee at the moment out of five bags.

But Michael Price, 75, is refusing to leave his home in Northmoor - despite rising water lapping against the side of his house.

He said: 'It's going to have to be a 
further major catastrophe before we decide to evacuate. Providing we 
still have heating and power, we shall stay.'

Police have promised residents who left their homes that they would be safe.

Chief Superintendent Caroline Peters of Avon and Somerset Police said there had been just three flood-related thefts, and only 19 crimes in the area so far this year.

She said: 'You are safe. We have extensive patrol plans. We have ramped up patrol pans to cover 24/7 to be visible.'

She defended her decision to put up the helicopter-mounted tannoy system, urging residents to leave, after critics said it was over the top and 'frightening'.

She said: 'We considered this very, very carefully and we did think about what would be the outcome and would it scare people.Â

'But the reasoning and main decision that I made to put the helicopter up was that people had felt they weren't being informed and kept up to date.

'It was important to get that message out to make that informed choice to make that decision whether that were going to stay or not.'

'Until about 3am this morning people were taking themselves to the rescue centre that was set up, where they stayed for the night.

'The people that did go mainly wanted to go under their own efforts and were able to do so.

'We did carry out several rescues in flood hit Somerset last night, but these were mainly from stranded cars and similar situations.

'We generally were just advising people to leave and most of them did so under their own steam.'
