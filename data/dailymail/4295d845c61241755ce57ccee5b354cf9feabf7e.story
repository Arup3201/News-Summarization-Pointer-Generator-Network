Former NFL pro Scott Mitchell is barely recognizable after shedding an impressive 124lbs - roughly the weight of 138 footballs.

The 47-year-old ex-athlete from Utah decided to get in shape after losing his father to obesity last year and signed himself up as a contestant on The Biggest Loser.

In a preview of tonight's episode, Mitchell's family are seen fighting back tears as they catch a glimpse of his much svelter 6ft 6in frame for the first time.

'It was a person that I remember 14 years ago,' Mitchell's wife Wendy says. 

His son Zach adds: 'I'm just so proud of him and what he's accomplished.'

Through 15 weeks of grueling training, Mitchell went from 366lbs to a lighter 242lbs.

Topping off his transformation, he also received a wardrobe makeover and haircut.

The father-of-five told the Associated Press that he really struggled with his weight during his career which saw him play for teams including the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens.

He said he routinely gained 15 to 20 pounds each off-season but when he retired in 2001 things spiraled out of control.

'There were no more football seasons to get ready for,' he recalled.

'I had worked out because of my job, and after retiring I kind of resented exercise because of that. So I just slowly put on weight.'

Mitchell's health gradually suffered with sleep apnea and high blood pressure kicking in. He was also borderline diabetic.

In a bid to get back to his former self, he agreed to take The Biggest Loser challenge filled with dread. 

Besides the physical demands he knew lay ahead, he was living with shame he neither wanted to confront nor share with an audience of millions.

'You have no idea how terrified I was,' he said. 'Pro athletes don't have emotional issues - or aren't supposed to. You can't show any kind of weakness. There's no crying in football.'

Along with the exercise and nutritional regimen, he tangled with emotional issues he had long held at bay.

Shoulders to lean on: In particular, he recalled a morning hike when he 'just lost it' and 'sobbed uncontrollably'

'Once I got there, they said, "You're gonna lose weight, but you'll gain it all back unless you figure out why you gained it in the first place."'

And, yes, he cried.

In particular, he recalled a morning hike when he 'just lost it' and 'sobbed uncontrollably'.

'[I thought] about how in my life I was focusing on the things that brought me pain and sorrow, and how that was a big part of why I gained weight. I wanted to quit. I didn't want to deal with it."

But he did.

'I realized I had shut myself off emotionally, and when I opened myself up, there was a lot more to me than I was giving myself credit for. I told myself, 'You're a great guy, Scott, and you have a great life.'"

He's determined to make good on that mantra, as The Biggest Lose powers to its season conclusion January 29.

Mitchell calls the experience 'beautiful, wonderful, lifesaving. And the hardest damn thing I've done in my life.'

Harder than his rough-and-tumble football days?

He laughed. 'Not even close.'

Among the other athletes to appear on the show will be Former tennis star Zina Garrison , WNBA pro Vanessa Haydenand, the heaviest contestant, Rob Guiry, the Western New England University rugby coach, who weighs in at a whopping 483lbs.

The winner will walk away with $250,000.
