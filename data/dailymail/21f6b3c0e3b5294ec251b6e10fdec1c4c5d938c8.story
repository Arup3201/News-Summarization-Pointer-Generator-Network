She's long been a fan of sailing, famously beating husband Prince William during a race around Auckland Harbour during the Royal Tour Down Under.

Now Kensington Palace has announced that the Duchess of Cambridge has become royal patron of a new sailing charity, The 1851 Trust, which aims to help bring the America's Cup home.

In a statement released by the palace, the Duchess spoke of her love of sailing and said she hoped the trust would inspire a new generation to take up the sport.

Kate, who has not been seen in public since August due to severe morning sickness, said: 'I am delighted to be royal patron of The 1851 Trust.

“I feel very fortunate to have enjoyed sailing from a young age and I know it is a great way of providing young people with the opportunity to develop skills and confidence.

'It is a hugely exciting time for sailing as the British challenger bids to bring the America’s Cup back to Britain.

'I am looking forward to being part of this journey and I hope that through The 1851 Trust we can engage and inspire a new generation into sailing along the way.'

The 1851 Trust is the charitable arm of the British challenger’s bid to bring the America’s Cup back to Britain and is supported by Ben Ainslie Racing.

It will work with young people under 25 years old to encourage them to become involved in sailing and the marine industry.

Known affectionately as the 'Auld Mug', the America's Cup was first offered as a prize by Queen Victoria in 1851, who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the Isle of Wight.

After a schooner named America from New York took the trophy, which was made especially for the race by jewellers Garrard, the cup was renamed in its honour, and both cup and race have carried the moniker ever since.

A two-yacht race, the America's Cup is fought between the previous year's winner - known as the 'defender' - and a challenger, which is usually the best boat from a series of run-off rounds.

But while Britannia might rule the waves in other respects, a British team is yet to take the trophy which, despite having been won by Swiss and Australian teams in the past, has for the most part been doggedly defended by the Americans - among them last year's winner, San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club - throughout its 132-year history.

That, however, is something the Duchess of Cambridge and Sir Ben hope to change, and hope, given enough sponsorship, to assemble a race-winning boat and the sailors to crew it over the next three years.

Sir Ben Ainslie, who is also a patron of the 1851 Trust, spoke of his excitement about the challenge ahead and what it could mean for the marine industry.

'We’re really excited about what the Trust can do,' he said. 'We are dependent on the oceans and the marine industry needs to become a leader in environmental stewardship, and in finding solutions.

'Young people are the key, there are great opportunities in the marine industry, and we want to open those opportunities up to as many people as possible – the more talent you have working on a problem, the better the solutions will be.'

It might be named for the new world, but the America's Cup has very British origins.

First offered by Queen Victoria in 1851, the inaugural America's Cup race was run around the Isle of Wight.

After a boat from New York named America triumphed, the cup was renamed and teams from the US have dominated the winner's roll call of honour ever since.

However, all that could be about to change if the Duchess of Cambridge and Sur Ben Ainslie get their way.

With the 2017 event in their sights, the pair plan to put together and train a winning team and hope to have the cup back in Britain within three years.
