Tourists who have escaped to Venice for a final summer romantic break have had to swap their sandals for wellies as the city is hit with an early seasonal high tide.

Partly engulfed by the high waters, some of the city's most iconic and romantic sites have become underwater obstacle courses for visitors.

Holding suitcases high and dry over their heads, buying emergency pairs of Wellington boots and wading through the knee-deep water, some tourists took the challenge in their stride while others seemed less impressed.

Coping: Tourists in Venice's St Mark's Square were forced to go barefoot as the water level rose unusually high for this time of year

Closed up: Shops were closed and only the bravest visitors ventured out into the flooded streets as the tide engulfed parts of the city

Locals, wearing full dry-suits and prepared for the seasonal flooding, looked un-phased by the unusually high tide, going about their normal day but surrounded by water.

The high water, known as 'acqua alta', usually happens between autumn and spring, but appears to have arrived early this year.

The unusually high tides occur for a number of reasons, but primarily because of the addition of certain weather conditions coupled with the astronomical high tide caused by the alignment of the sun, moon and other planets.

Fascinated: This tourist seemed entertained by he high water level in the city, caused by a combination of astronomical tides, weather systems and Adriatic tides

Some seemed to take the event in their stride while others looked less impressed with the challenge

Dampener: The bad weather and unseasonably early acqua alta may have put a dampener on those hoping to grab a late summer romantic break

Low pressure systems in the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the West of Italy, and strong southerly winds, known as scirocco, are both causes for concern when tides are high during the winter months.

The Adriatic Sea also has it's own oscillating tide, known as the 'Adriatic seiche'. While not as noticeable as the astronomical tide, when the two are in sync, the water level is likely to rise and fall further.

Since 1867, exceptional tidal events have been recorded - the first being in 1867 itself, when the water level rose 153cm above sea level.

The year 1966 also saw an unprecedented acqua alta, after which the city established a dedicated service to monitor and analyse tidal data and predict when tidal flooding was likely to occur

High and dry: Tourists queued along a raised platform in St Mark's Square to take a boat to a drier part of the city, while seagulls made the most of the novel waterways

Bad weather in Venice has in part played a role in causing the unusually early acqua alta this year

The year 1966 also saw an unprecedented acqua alta, after which the city established a dedicated service to monitor and analyse tidal data and predict when tidal flooding was likely to occur.

Today's tidal flooding was short-lived however, and posed a challenge only for tourists wishing to take a coffee sat in Saint Marc's square for example.

But even that was still achievable, if visitors were happy to either get their feet wet or sport some sensible water-proof footwear.

Sign of the times: Gondoliers are soon to be fitted with GPS systems to monitor the speed and position of boats in the wake of calls to better regulate Venice's waterways

They have navigated the lagoon city for hundreds of years, with only the stars and a wooden oar to steer them on their way.

But Venice’s famous gondoliers will soon be dragged into the 21st century- their boats are set are fitted with GPS systems.

The new regulatory bit of kit, which 
will monitor both the speed and route of the vessels, comes as part of a
crackdown on water traffic following the death of a tourist on the 
city’s canals.

Fifty-year old Joachim Vogel from 
Germany died in August when the gondola he was travelling on collided 
with a vaporetto water bus.

Until now Venice has operated as 
something of a free for all with cruise ships speed boats and water 
taxis joining small craft jostling for space on the major canals.

But following the accident on the 
17th August the council have set out proposals to bring Venice closer in
line to cities based on dry land.

The city’s mayor Giorgio Orsoni said 
after the accident: 'We have to think of the Grand Canal as a street, a 
main street like that of all cities, with particularly heavy traffic. We
need some discipline.'

Under the clampdown the gondolas will
also have to have number plates like cars, and reflector strips to make
them more visible to night-time traffic.

Processions of gondolas floating 
together to enjoy a traditional serenade will soon become a thing of the
past as groups travelling together are considered a hazard.

Under proposals already announced, 
the city is to introduce a floating congestion zone, which would prevent
the gondolas operating in the congested Grand Canal before 10.30 am.

If approved the plans will also include breathalyser tests for gondoliers and a ban on mobile phones.

Changes: Venetian lawmakers want to bring the city's watery transport service in line with land equivalents, following the death of a tourist travelling in a gondolier which was hit by another boat

Ugo Bergamo the councillor who drew 
up the new regulations said ‘We have no alternative, we can no longer 
pretend that problems do not exist.’

There was a need to cut water traffic
on the most overcrowded stretches of the Grand Canal by 50 per cent, he
said. A recent study showed that in the space of just 10 hours, 1,600 
vessels passed under the Rialto Bridge.

Aldo Reato, the president of the 
gondoliers' association, said his members had yet to sign up to all the 
proposals and would make their views known at a meeting this week.

Jaochim Vogel and his family were 
flung into the water when their gondola collided with a vaporetto water 
taxi, near the famous Rialto Bridge, one of Venice’s most popular and 
picturesque sights.

Mr Vogel was crushed to death. His three-year-old daughter was treated in hospital for head injuries, but survived.
