An Australian woman whose fiance died in a plane crash in Laos that has killed 49 people today told how she had lost the 'love of my life, my soul and my future'.

Michael Creighton, 42, an aid worker based in the Lao capital, Vientiane, died alongside his 71-year-old father, Gordon Bruce Creighton, when a Lao Airlines plane plunged into the Mekong River last night.

Among the other victims was a  Sydney family-of-four named as 39-year-old tax consultant Gavin Rhodes, his 35-year-old wife, Phoumalaysy Rhodes, and their children, Jadesuda, three, and 17-month-old Manfred.

Heartbreak: Melanie Fuller with her fiance Michael Creighton who died in a plane crash in Laos

A
 passenger manifest from Lao Airlines identified Jadesuda Rhodes as Lao,
 but the airline later confirmed that all four family members were 
Australian.

Michael Creighton was an operations 
manager at Norwegian People's Aid's mine action program and lived in 
Laos with his fiancee, Melanie Fuller.

Miss Fuller, who was not on the plane, posted a message on her Facebook page saying: 'I have lost the love of my life, my 
heart, my soul, my future, my children, my world and myself,' Fuller 
posted on her Facebook page.

'For everyone wondering that is the loss I will live with forever. xxxx xxxx'

Michael Creighton was a former member of the Australian Defence Force and later worked for the United Nations.

He spent the past 20 years doing humanitarian work in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq, Switzerland and Cambodia.

Gordon Creighton, a retired teacher, was visiting his son in Laos.

'We
 have lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best 
mate in one tragic circumstance and are trying to come to terms with our
 loss,' the family said in the statement.

Rescuers in fishing boats pulled bodies from the muddy Mekong River today as officials ruled out finding any survivors from the plane that crashed in stormy weather.

Backpacks, an airplane propeller and passports were among the debris scattered on the riverbank where the Lao Airlines turboprop plane apparently hit hard before skidding into the water and sinking Wednesday. 

'So far eight bodies have been found. We don't yet know their nationalities,' said Yakao Lopangkao, director-general of Lao's Department of Civil Aviation, who was at the crash site in Pakse, in southern Laos.

'We haven't found the plane yet. It is underwater. We're trying to use divers to locate it.'

Devastation: Officials ruled out finding any survivors from the plane that crashed in stormy weather 

He ruled out finding survivors. 'There is no hope. The plane appears to have crashed very hard before entering the water.'

Some bodies were found as far as 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the crash site, he said. 

'We
 have asked villagers and people who live along the river to look for 
bodies and alert authorities when they see anything,' he said. 

Fleets
 of small fishing boats and inflatable rafts plied the muddy, vast 
waterway as part of the search with men in life vests peering into the 
water. After storms Wednesday, the search took place under sunny blue 
skies. 

Thailand, which 
borders Laos, was helping with the search. It sent 30 scuba divers to 
assist in the search for bodies, said Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Sek Wannamethee.

The state-run Lao Airlines released an updated list of the 44 passengers' nationalities on Thursday.

It
 said the flight included 16 Lao nationals, seven French, six 
Australians, five Thais, three Koreans, two Vietnamese and one person 
each from Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the United States.

Cambodian authorities said one of the plane's pilots was a 56-year-old Cambodian with more than 30 years flying experience. 

Details of the crash remained murky. Lao Airlines said in a statement that the plane took off from the capital Vientiane and 'ran into extreme bad weather conditions' as it prepared to land at Pakse Airport.

The area is known for its remote Buddhist temples, nature treks and waterfalls that draw tourists. 

Mystery: The airline said it had yet to determine reasons for the crash of the ATR-72 aircraft (above), which was virtually new and had just been delivered in March

The airline said it had yet to determine reasons for the crash of the ATR-72 aircraft, which was virtually new and had just been delivered in March. The crash occurred about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the airport. 

French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR said in a statement that 'the circumstances of the accident are still being determined.'

It said that it will assist in the investigation which will be led by Lao authorities. 

The ATR-72 has been involved in 16 crashes since it went into service in 1988, according to databases kept by the Flight Safety Foundation and the Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives.

The death toll from Wednesday's crash was the second highest on record involving an ATR-72; accidents in the U.S. in 1988 and Cuba in 2010 each killed 68 people.

ATR had delivered 611 of the planes by the end of last year.
