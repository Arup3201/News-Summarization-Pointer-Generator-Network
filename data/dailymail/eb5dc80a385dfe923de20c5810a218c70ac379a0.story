Self-defense: An 80-year-old Florida woman grabbed her gun and called 911 during a home invasion. While the burglars were breaking a window to her residence, the police dispatcher told her to put the gun down

Mrs Logan grabbed her gun and dialed the police emergency number as she headed downstairs to scare or shoot whoever was there

'It is a little frightening. You know that you don’t have the security that you thought you had,' she told FOX Tampa Bay.

It was broad daylight, just around 2:30 in the afternoon and Mrs Logan  was all alone in the house because her husband was playing bridge at a friend’s house.

Instinct took over and she grabbed her gun  and called the police.

'Once I realized it wasn’t my husband, you have no idea how fast you can go,' she said. She was surprised at the advice she was being given.

Determined: The burglars cut out the screen and window panes to the back door

In a police report, officers said the suspect used a large rock to smash the bottom glass out of the door. They then cut out the screen, but NJ was waiting on the other side of the door with her run.

'When I called 911 she kept saying put the gun down, put the gun down, and I said I’ll put the gun down when I see the police,' Logan told the dispatcher.

'I believe in guns inside your house,' she added. 'I don’t think anybody has the right to break into your private domain.'

She yelled out warnings to whoever was downstairs.

'I didn't want to shoot. I really didn't want to have to shoot anybody,' she said.

Mrs Logan says she has no intention of giving up her personal weapon and says that the whole experience has shaken her up

Although she managed to deter the burglars on this occasion, Ms Logan says she sleeps better knowing that she has a gun just inches away.

Holmes Beach Police Chief William Tokajer said there have been a few incidents in Mrs Logan's neighborhood.'I think it's a wake up call to any would-be burglar,' Chief Tokajer said.
