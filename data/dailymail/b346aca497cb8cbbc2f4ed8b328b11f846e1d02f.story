Brendan Rodgers sent a reserve team into the lion's den as he made seven changes to the Liverpool starting line-up for the Champions League match at the Bernabeu.

There was no Steven Gerrard, no Raheem Sterling and no Jordan Henderson in the starting XI against Real Madrid on Tuesday. In their place were Lucas Leiva, Emre Can and Fabio Borini - hardly renowned as stalwarts of Liverpool's first-choice team so far this season.

In some quarters, Rodgers' men have been described as 'brave', as 'plucky', as having 'given a good account of themselves'. Hard work and team ethic is a commendable attribute, but this is the Champions League - Europe's elite competition.

137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 

130 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool’s starting XI.

642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid’s starting XI. 

£59 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu on Wednesday. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels.

27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That’s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield.

2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to Wednesday. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium.

3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. 

Unfortunately for Liverpool the statistics do not lie - and, on this occasion, they paint a bleak picture of a side who were never in the contest with Carlo Ancelotti's side.

So let us run through these numbers.

First up, shots on goal. Madrid's star-studded side managed 27 attempts on Simon Mignolet's goal, with nine of them finding the target - including Karim Benzema's strike which separated the sides. When Real destroyed Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield two weeks ago, they managed just 14 attempts on goal.

The eight saves which Mignolet was forced to make ensured the Reds stopper made the most in a single game for Liverpool since the Reds faced Everton in November 2013 (on which occasion he saved nine times). 

Liverpool, on the other hand, managed a mere four attempts on goal. Not four on target, four shots in total with just a solitary effort from Alberto Moreno testing opposition keeper Iker Casillas. In the first half they had precisely zero efforts on goal, while Real had 13.

What's worse, they have now failed to score in three successive Champions League game - the first time they have managed to do such a thing since September 2006.

Well how about blocked shots then? Real were denied by Liverpool defenders on 12 occasions while the Reds forced the home side to block just one effort.

Borini, Liverpool's sole striker, did not register a shot in the entire match while attacking midfielders Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic managed just one between them.

Conversely, Real's attacking trio of Benzema (two), Cristiano Ronaldo (six) and Isco (one) shared nine. Benzema himself has scored an impressive five goals in four Champions League appearances so far this season. His goal on Tuesday also ensured he has scored in four consecutive European matches for the first time since March 2011.

Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. 

Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend.  

Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: 

Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli

Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid:

Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini

So let's move on to possession. As the home side you would expect Real to shade it slightly, yet they kept the ball for 60.2 per cent of the match with Liverpool enjoying just 39.8 per cent possession. OK this statistic is not terrible, but the wastefulness and inept attacking ability of Rodgers' side when on the ball was clear for all to see.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Toni Kroos, Rodrigeuz et al completed a staggering 711 passes with an accuracy of 90.9 per cent. Joe Allen, Lucas, Can and Co? Well they made just 479 passes with an accuracy of 86.6 per cent.

Interestingly, for an away side deemed as 'plucky' and who expected to defend for long periods of the game, Liverpool won just 22 tackles to Real's 24. The home side's ratio of successful tackles was also higher as well (87.5 per cent to 72.7 per cent).

- Karim Benzema has scored five goals in four Champions League appearances this season.

- The French striker has scored in four consecutive CL games for the first time since March 2011.

- In the first half, Liverpool failed to have an attempt of any kind. Real Madrid had 13 shots (including blocked).

- Real Madrid finished the game with more shots on target (9) than Liverpool managed shots of any kind (4).

- Liverpool's bench (137) had made more Champions League appearances than their starting XI (130) before Tuesday's match kicked off.

- Simon Mignolet made eight saves against Real. The last time he made more in a single game for Liverpool was versus Everton in November 2013 (9).

- Liverpool have failed to score in three successive CL games for the first time since September 2006.

- Real Madrid have won 10 home Champions League games in a row.

Real also won more interceptions (21 to Liverpool's 15), had far more corners (seven to one), as well as destroying Liverpool in terms of the total number of crosses (23 to eight).

The 3,669 Reds supporters present at the game paid £59 per ticket for the Bernabeu clash - not to mention the cost of travel and accommodation. They witnessed a starting XI with just 130 Champions League appearances between them - although there were 137 appearances sitting on the substitutes' bench - take on the current European champions, who had nearly five times that number on display.

These statistics are a damning indictment of Rodgers' team selection.

The scoreline may have been an extremely flattering 1-0, and his side may have defended admirably at times, but the Liverpool boss must surely have learned never to put out a reserve team in Europe's premier competition again.
