A Muslim cab driver has been fired after he threw out a family carrying an unopened bottle of wine because he said 'it's against my religion.'

Adrian Cartwright, 46, had hired the taxi to take his family out for dinner at an Indian restaurant near Oldham, Greater Manchester.

But before they could make the five-minute journey the driver, in his 20s, spotted the bottle of white wine and promptly refused to take them.

The family was turfed out onto the pavement and he drove off.

On his Facebook page a furious Mr Cartwright wrote: 'We all got inside the car and the driver said: "Is that alcohol?’"When I said ‘yes’ he replied: ‘I am sorry but I can’t allow it in my cab – it’s against my religion’.

'I knew it wasn’t worth arguing so we had to get out.'

He added: 'The meal I had that evening was a Halal meal, whose methods I don’t agree with, but tolerate out of respect.

'I expect anyone offering a public service to do the same, and will be contacting the licensing department to suggest that the driver is politely asked to do so, or hand his badge back.'

He also complained to the driver's employer Borough Taxis, who have around 70 Muslim drivers, and within half an hour he was sacked.

The company's former chairman, Fazal Rahim, who has also driven for them for almost a quarter of a century, said the driver's attitude was unprofessional.

'I am a practising Muslim, like a lot of the drivers. This was not a decision based on race or religion, however, but about being a professional taxi driver,' Mr Rahim said.

'As taxi drivers, we cannot be moral policemen. If I picked a customer up from a pub, should I ask him if he has been drinking? Of course not.

'We need to provide a great service to our customers and as a company we have prided ourselves on that for many years. I don’t know the lad in question but I can only put this down to youthful ignorance.

'We take people wherever they need to go, whether to a pub, church, mosque or synagogue.'

The family had booked the cab so they could go out and celebrate Easter Sunday together.

The taxi company has apologised to Mr Cartwright and his family and explained why the cabbie must be sacked.

'We would like to apologise to Mr. Cartwright and his family for any upset or offence caused. Borough taxis would also like to inform customers past and present that we do not agree with the actions of the driver,' they said in a statement.

'As soon as the directors heard of the incident an emergency meeting was held and the driver was dismissed with immediate effect only 30 minutes after the incident occurred.'
