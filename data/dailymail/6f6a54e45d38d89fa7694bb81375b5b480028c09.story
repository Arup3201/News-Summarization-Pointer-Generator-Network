A husband-to-be went to extreme lengths to make sure his fiancee had the most romantic proposal ever.

Penrith's Tim Blacketer set up a 'scavenger hunt' day for Katie Crowther-Wilkinson, which included pampering, lunch with her friends and a hired limousine.

The 25-year-old, who had just finished his masters in radiation therapy, spent four to six weeks planning the perfect day for his girlfriend of five years.

Katie Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to a scavenger hunt, with the clues guiding her through a spectacular day of pampering, lunch with friends and a limousine before the big surprise

Katie Crowther-Wilkinson's perfect day all led up to the incredible moment when her boyfriend, Tim Blacketer, proposed to her

'Kate's not someone who likes to be the centre of attention,' Mr Blacketer told Daily Mail Australia.

'I knew we weren't going to have a big wedding and I just wanted to show her how much she meant to me and give her a day she would never forget.'

On Saturday, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to getting her nails and make-up done, shopping, breakfast and lunch with friends, and then a limousine to Wendy’s Secret Garden in Lavender Bay.

At each location, the exercise physiologist was given a clue, riddle or compliment to lead her to the next destination.

To kick off the day, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was woken up friends to go to a hair appointment at 8am then breakfast. 

She was then taken to a Parramatta shopping centre where she had her nails done and did some shopping.

After that she had lunch with more of her friends and was whisked away to get her make-up done. 

At the end of the day, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to a limousine ride. 

When she arrived at her final destination, she finally figured out why she had been treated to such an elaborately planned day.

'When she did get to the garden she did break down and I had my mates standing behind me, with signs that read: "Will you marry me?" Mr Blacketer said.

'Once she saw that all my close family and friends starting crying. It was a big crying fest.'

The couple are now having their dream home built in Oran Park and are looking at having their wedding at the end of next year.
