West Ham are stepping up their attempts to secure the long-term future of wonderkid Reece Oxford as Manchester United launch a bid to sign the youngster.

The Hammers are desperate to keep hold of the 15-year-old from the clutches of the Premier League's elite.

West Ham will open talks with Oxford's representatives over an improved deal at Upton Park, which could see the defender fast-tracked into the senior set-up.

Hands off: David Sullivan has criticised bigger clubs for trying to poach West Ham's young talent

But Oxford has serious options to choose from, with United the latest club to show a firm interest in the teenager.

Arsenal and Chelsea are also keen on the youngster, but United are thought to be leading the race for Oxford should he decide to quit the Hammers.

Speaking earlier this month co-owner David Sullivan spoke of the club's intention to keep Oxford and blasted England's top sides for continually poaching the lesser clubs' best talent.

'It almost makes you give up on having an academy if they can come in and nick your best 15-year-old. What's the point?,' Sullivan said.

In the hunt: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are one of many top clubs interested in Oxford

The England Under-16 international has already trained with the club's first team and can expect more senior opportunities at Upton Park next season.

Despite being 15, he has already turned out for West Ham's Under-18s side, as well as their U15s and U16s.
