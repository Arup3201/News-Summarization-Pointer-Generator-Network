Taxes on low alcohol wine should be cut to encourage people to get less drunk, a health minister has said.

Jane Ellison told a Parliamentary committee she had been in talks with the big supermarkets amid growing concern that the booze content had ‘gone up and up and up’ in the last 30 years.

She said she wanted to spark a ‘shopping revolution’ with more people choosing cheap and lower-strength wines.

Ministers are increasingly concerned by middle-class drinking, with the strength of wines getting stronger

Mrs Ellison told the Lords committee said there was a ‘frustration’ that European law made it impossible to give tax breaks to low-alcohol drinks.

She said: ‘There are some areas of frustration. We do need to return the flexibility, to be able to go further.

‘One of my particular interests would be in trying to use market forces to drive the low-alcohol market. Over time we have seen the level of alcohol in wine creep up and up and up.

‘I would love to be able to do more to create more of a market for these low alcohol products.’

Under EU law, wine must be taxed at the same rate - regardless of its strength. Products also cannot be described as wine unless it contains more than five per cent alcohol.

But Mrs Ellison said she wanted to have the ‘flexibility’ to cut taxes on low-alcohol market.

However, cutting the cost of lower-strength wine is likely to raise concerns that people will simply increase the volume of alcohol they drink.

Public health Minister Jane Ellison said the level of alcohol in wine had crept 'up and up and up'

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘The Government supports any future changes to the EU rules to allow duty on wine to rise in line with alcoholic strength, as is the case with beer.

‘However, such a change would need agreement across Member States.

‘In the meantime we continue to work on ways to help people drink less, including through encouraging the availability and choice of lower strength products.’

Mrs Ellison also revealed that the UK had been blocked from forcing alcohol giants to include a calorie count on beer, wine and spirits.
