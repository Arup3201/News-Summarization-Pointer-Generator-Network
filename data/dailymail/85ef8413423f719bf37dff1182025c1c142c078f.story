'Cruel and callous' thugs have blinded a cow in one eye after they shot it with a crossbow

The 14-month old Galloway heifer was found in distress with the bolt sticking out from its left socket.

Farmer Chris Pickering, of York, was disgusted when he found the animal in pain on Tuesday and immediately pulled the crossbow out.

Cruel: Police are investigating the callous crossbow attack on a small herd of cows which has left one heifer blinded in one eye

The cow, part of a conservation grazing programme, is now recovering but will lose the sight in her left eye.

Mr Pickering, 44, said: 'It's shocking. It's a cruel, horrible, nasty thing to do. How anybody could shoot a defenceless animal in its eye with a crossbow is unbelievable.

'I got to the field and saw the crossbow just sticking out of her eye.

'I didn't want the crossbow to catch on anything like a hedge and pull her whole eyeball out, so I yanked the crossbow out of the cow's eye.

'We gave her antibiotics and some painkillers to keep her calm.

'I spoke to the vet straight away and 
someone came out to look at her last night, and they've said that she 
seems to be okay. She will lose the sight in that eye, though.

Recovery: Farmer Chris Pickering said he left the cow in the field with her friends to avoids any further distress while she recovers

The crossbow bolt was fully embedded in the cow's eye socket and Mr Pickering pulled it out himself

'We're just going to keep a close eye on her and see she's okay.

'We've left her in the field with her friends, as there are five cows altogether, and we thought it would distress her less if we kept things normal.

'These cows are part of a conservation grazing programme in conjunction with Natural England.

'They're on the land to graze rough grass down to make the ground more friendly for birds and other wildlife, to prevent it going back to scrub land.'

Will Durrant, a walker who found the cow, said: 'Who in their right mind would shoot an animal with a crossbow? It's ridiculous'

Mr Pickering,
who is the farmer responsible for the animals on behalf of BHE 
Agricultural Contractors, added: 'We've never had anything like this 
happen with cattle. I want everyone involved in this, the RSPCA and the 
police.'

Will Durrant, a walker who found the 
cow, said: 'In the past the cattle have been chased by dogs and all 
sorts, and now it's got a crossbow bolt in its eye. It's terrible.

'Who
in their right mind would shoot an animal with a crossbow? It's 
ridiculous, and I'm very sad about it. To see it embedded in its eye was
very sad.'

Irate: Mr Pickering said he doesn't want to let the attackers get away with it, and wants the police and RSPCA to get involved

The injured cow, left, will lose its sight in its left eye

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police, said: 'This was a callous and unnecessary act against a defenceless animal.

'Clearly, this sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable as is any cruelty to animals and enquiries are underway to identify those responsible.'

Leanne Plumtree from the RSPCA said their officers were also investigating and urged anyone with information to come forward.
