Branislav Ivanovic has amazingly escaped an FA charge following his violent confrontation with Everton midfielder James McCarthy.

The Chelsea defender dodged a ban despite TV footage showing Ivanovic wrapping his arm around McCarthy’s throat and choking him. It also appeared to show Ivanovic move his head in the direction of McCarthy.

But a three-man panel of former referees decided Ivanovic’s behaviour was not worthy of a red card, meaning he has escaped retrospective action and a possible three-match suspension.

The incident took place during a melee in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton

The decision is a victory for Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who has complained of a campaign against the Premier League leaders ever since striker Diego Costa was hit with a three-match retrospective ban for a stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can.

The FA also looked into suggestions that Ivanovic had bitten McCarthy on the shoulder during the incident, a claim the Serb vehemently denies. But after discussions with Everton on Thursday, the FA decided there were no grounds to take that allegation further.

But both clubs have been charged with failing to control their players after the clash that marred Chelsea’s 1-0 win. And despite the escape for Ivanovic, Chelsea are believed to be unhappy at being charged at all.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez said Ivanovic should have been sent off but the FA have chosen to take a lenient approach, as they did when Leicester boss Nigel Pearson went unpunished for putting his hands round the neck of Crystal Palace’s James McArthur last Saturday.

In a statement on their website the FA confirmed: ‘Branislav Ivanovic will not face any further action in relation to an incident involving Everton’s James McCarthy.

‘All three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence. The panel did not believe the conduct was worthy of a dismissal.’

On the charge in relation to failing to control their players, an FA statement read: ‘Both Chelsea and Everton have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. Both clubs have until 6pm on February 17 to respond to the charge.’

Martin Keown – I think he's just about going to get away with this, there's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head. He'll get away with it for me.

Steve McManaman: I don't think it was worth a red card, Jon Moss, the referee didn't see the incident - it's up to the law makers now.

Robbie Savage: I've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that? If the referee sees the movement towards McCarthy it's a red for me.

Michael Owen: It's a yellow for me - nothing more. 

Phil Neville: It's not clear cut enough for the FA to ban him for three games, for me. It's not good what's he done granted, but I don't think the FA will take action.
