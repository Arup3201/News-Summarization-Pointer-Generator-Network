If you've always wanted to own a slice of children’s literature, now’s the time.

The Tuscan villa that served as the inspiration for the classic fairy tale Pinocchio is up for sale for £9million.

The gardens of the mansion, just outside Florence, include a lawn known as the Field of Miracles, that features in the cautionary tale of a wooden puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy.

This villa inspired the author of Pinocchio and has three hectares of garden including a lawn known as the Field of Miracles

The author, Carlo Collodi, lived near Villa di Colonnata at the time when he wrote 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' 130 years ago, and picked up ideas for his stories in the local tavern.

The story inspired one of Disney's best loved animated movies

One of the tales he heard was about the Field of Miracles, a lawn under which a real-life gardener at the villa unearthed a stash of gold coins.

In Collodi's fictional story, the crafty Fox and Cat characters induce Pinocchio to bury his gold coins in the field, where they say they will grow and multiply.

The 30-room mansion, boasting towers, large wine cellars and 17th century frescos, is advertised for sale on the property website idealista.it for Euro 10million.

Local historian Giuseppe Garbarino said that there were numerous areas of the property that appear in the puppet's adventures.

In the seven acres of garden is a lake with an island and a cottage that according to local legend is the home of the fairy ‘with the blue hair’ that helps Pinocchio on his travels, he said. 

'Beneath her cottage is a cave, with a
 tooth-shaped rock, that served as the inspiration for the mouth of the 
whale that swallows the puppet in the story.

'Even
 the characters of the Fox and the Cat were based on nicknames for local
 thieves who had buried their stolen goods in an Etruscan tomb.'

The
 character of the blue fairy was based on a girl who worked at the house
 and and had heard the story of a puppet who came to life from her 
mother, he said.

The Field of Miracles lawn is where a gardener famously found a hoard of coins in the 19th century, a story that was included in "The Adventures of Pinocchio"

Mr Garbarino, who is helping to sell the house, said he hopes the new owners develop the literary connection. He said: 'This name is such a draw. It would be wonderful if they would turn the gardens into a Pinocchio Park, with trails and guided tours.'

The villa has been in the Gerini family since 1656, when nobleman Ferrante Capponi bought it for 3,000 crowns, but has been a a country residence for noblemen since the 1400s.

Pinocchio is the story of humble carpenter Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet out of a walking stick, which magically comes to life. Pinocchio dreams of becoming a real human boy.

The story was written in the 1880s as a series published in a children's journal but became famous worldwide as the 1940 Disney film.
