An advert designer based in San Francisco chose to change her life by learning to dance in a year.

'My dream is to get good enough to dance in a Coca-Cola commercial,' writes Karen Cheng on her website.

One day she decided to get up and start making her dreams a reality, and Cheng has blogged about every step.

Karen Cheng is an internet sensation with more than 600,000 views on her YouTube video

From researching local dance classes 
to scouring YouTube for videos and tutorials to body popping at her 
desk - she did it all and she did it constantly.

'I don't practice every day because I'm disciplined. I practice every day because I'm obsessed,' she writes.

She used motivational app Lift to 'help keep herself accountable'.

The video shows her beginnings with 
robotic, awkward arm movements on day four, her progress on days 86 and 
136 when she loosens up and a grand finale on day 365.

Cheng wears a neon vest top and leggings as she jumps off a train at San Franciscoâ€™s BART South Station to perform a raunchy routine.

Exactly 365 days after she embarked on the project and she dances almost like a
professional.

One day she hopes to be just as good as her idol, 
dubstep and hip hop dance legend Marquese 'Nonstop' Scott. He 
features in music videos, TV shows, adverts and live shows.

Day four shows how robotic her movements started out

Day 86 and she is freer with herself and her body movements flow easier

Day 136 and she is busting out some impressive moves, not unlike those seen performed by professionals
