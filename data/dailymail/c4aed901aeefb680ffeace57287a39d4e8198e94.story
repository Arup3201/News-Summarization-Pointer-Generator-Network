Three teenagers and a 21-year-old are being questioned today in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old stabbed to death in east London yesterday.

Another youth was found with stab wound as is in a stable condition in hospital.

Police cordoned off the murder scene yesterday afternoon on Sandringham Road, Forest Gate, East London

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the 21-year-old was arrested last night. He added: 'An 18-year-old and two 17-year-olds are being questioned in connection with the murder.'

Today Champion's older sister, Jennifer, said he was the 'best brother in the world'.

The 20-year-old, who lives in Canning Town, east London, said: 'He always looked after me, always provided for us when I couldn't provide for my two-year-old child.

'He always acted like my older brother, so protective of me. I bought him cupcakes because I thought he would be injured and I could just say to him, 'Don't get yourself into any more trouble'. But they (his attackers) took my life away. My mum is heartbroken.'

Police were called at around 2pm to Sandringham Road following reports of a fight near Sandringham Nursery School.
