A mongrel dog that lost her snout and upper jaw saving the lives of two young girls in the Philippines is heading home after being patched up at a California hospital.

Sadly, doctors couldn't reconstruct Kabang's missing snout but they were able to heal the dog's wounds and treat other ailments, before she was released on Monday from the University of California, Davis veterinary hospital.

Kabang had her snout and upper jaw sheared off in December 2011 when she jumped in front of a motorcycle.

Newspapers in the Philippines reported she saved the lives of her owner's daughter and niece, who were apparently in the path of the oncoming bike.

UC Davis veterinary professor Frank Verstraete said Kabang was in hospital for seven months but doctors were unable to reconstruct her snout and jaw.

After the animal's heroic act, doctors discovered Kabang was also suffering life-threatening cancer, and got to work treating her with a dose of chemotherapy. 

After completing six weekly intravenous chemotherapy infusions, the hospital announced in December that Kabang appeared to have beaten the cancer she was suffering from, Gina Davis, the primary care veterinarian at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital in Davis, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

The dog, however, was still undergoing treatment for heartworms in her arteries before she was able to have the gaping wound on her face closed. Full treatment of that condition was put on hold during cancer therapy.

Kabang had the first of three arsenic-based heartworm shots on December 4 and received the other two in the second week of January.

'It will be one to two months for her to recover from that before she goes in and has the surgery,' Davis said in December.

The horrific accident occurred in 
December 2011 when the daughter of Kabang’s owner, nine-year-old Dina 
Bunggal, and her cousin three-year old Princess Diansing, were playing
with the dog in Zamboanga City, Philippines.

The dog ended up in Davis hospital in 2012 after a nurse from Buffalo, New York, spearheaded a fundraising campaign to bring her to the U.S. Veterinarians in the Philippines were apparently unable to treat her injuries.

Care For Kabang raised over $20,000 from 22 countries to cover the costs of surgeries, visas and airfare.

Surgeons were planning to perform two or three procedures. The first involved dental work, extractions and covering exposed roots. They then closed the dog's wound and restore nasal functions.

Prior to the surgeries, the dog's bony structures were exposed to air, increasing the chance of infection, Davis said.

Kabang will now return to he owners in the Philippines. The bill for her treatment is expected to top $10,000.

Close call: Doctors in the Philippines suggested that Kabang's owner put her down, but he would hear none of it

Grateful dog: Kabang was found in a rice paddy as a puppy and was nearly killed for meat, but her owner's daughter and niece pleaded for her life

Global effort: A New York nurse helped raise more than $20,000 from 22 countries to pay for Kabang's medical care in the U.S.

Davis said in December that despite Kabang's many conditions, the dog appeared to be in good spirits.

'She has come through everything very well,' Davis said.

'Her appetite is still good. She's still bright and happy.'

Kabang's face became tangled in the spokes of the bike's wheel, and her entire upper jaw was torn off.

Kabang, who became a mother to six 
little puppies in April 2012, had a rough start in life when Dina's
father Rudy found her abandoned in a rice paddy.

He brought the dog home to fatten her 
up and feed her to the family, but his daughter and niece convinced him 
to spare Kabang and keep her as a pet - a lucky move for both dog and 
family.
