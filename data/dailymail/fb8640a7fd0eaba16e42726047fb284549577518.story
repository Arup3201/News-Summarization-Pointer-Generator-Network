More stormy weather is set to batter Britain this weekend - with some areas hit with almost a month's rainfall in 24 hours and gusts of up to 70mph.

Despite relatively pleasant conditions today, the Met Office has issued three yellow - or severe - rain warnings until tomorrow as yet another stormy front moves in from the Atlantic.

Two yellow warnings were in place for Northern Ireland and Scotland yesterday, while another for the north west and west of England was issued early this morning.

Cumbria and surrounding areas face up to 80mm of rain on Sunday. The average rainfall for Cumberland in February is 102mm.

Already flooded areas in the south and south west will not escape either  - with up to 15mm of rain falling on Sunday.

The Environment Agency still has 48 severe flood warnings issued across the UK following what the Met Office has described as the wettest winter on record.

Strong winds of up to 70mph will rip 
through western coastal areas of the country, The Met Office said today.

Areas of Wales and the south west will be hit with up to 50 to 60mph, it added.

A spokesman for the Met Office explained the further barrage of bad weather was due low pressure moving in from the Atlantic.

They added: 'The wind will start to pick up from this afternoon and it will stay windy through the rest of the weekend.

'80mph will be the top end of the scale and 70mph winds are more likely across the west of the country.

'Much of south west England and Somerset will not suffer from too much rain - around 10-15mm is expected before the end of Monday.'

The latest storms come as Met Office scientists warn recent stormy weather could be linked to climate change.

An open letter, printed in The Times yesterday and signed by weather experts, including the Met Office's chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo, said the risk of flooding is increasing with global warming.

The letter states: 'We have looked at the potential influence of climate change and all the evidence from observations, theory and models which show that a warming world leads to more intense daily and hourly rainfall.

'When we add rising sea levels, then the risk to our communities from serious flooding and coastal inundation are increasing with climate change.'

However, they warned that the link between recent flooding and climate change was not 'definitive' and further research was needed.

They said: 'What we have not said, because that is a matter of ongoing research, is that the recent storms are definitively linked to climate change.

'The UK has always been buffeted by Atlantic storms and it is reasonable to expect occasional extremes.'

The letter is also signed by Professor Stephen Belcher, a leading climate change expert from the Met Office Hadley Centre, Professor Adam Scaife, who studies monthly and decadal climate change, and Dr Mark McCarthy from the National Climate information Centre.

The comments come in the wake of a political row over the extent climate change is to blame for the heavy flooding which have inundated large parts of Britain over recent months.
