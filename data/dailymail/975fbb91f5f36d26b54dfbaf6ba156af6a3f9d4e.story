A man in the U.S. has been arrested over claims he sexually assaulted and squeezed to death a 67-year-old mental health patient after a chance meeting with the woman in a local shop.

Miguel Piedra, 49, was brought into custody on Wednesday at his home in Fort Worth, Texas, on a murder charge, police said. He was being held with bail set at $500,000 (£310,000 pounds).

Officers said the remains of the woman, whose identity has not been released, were found last Sunday afternoon just outside a local park by a passerby, according to the Star-Telegram.

Texas police officers said that it was unclear whether Miguel Piedra, 49 (pictured) had offered the woman a lift

Investigators believe Mr Piedra came across the woman early last Saturday morning at a local shop near where the 67-year-old resided in a mental health home.

Sgt. Joe Loughman said CCTV cameras outside the store captured the woman getting into Mr Piedra's car, and she appeared to get into the vehicle voluntarily.

Sgt Loughman said: 'It is unclear if he offered her a ride or if she asked him for a ride. He exited his vehicle and spoke to the victim without being spoken to by the victim.'

Authorities are still trying to reach the woman's next of kin.

Sgt Loughman declined to detail how officers linked Mr Piedra to the murder, only saying that he was arrested at his Fort Worth home.

Court records show Mr Piedra was convicted in 2007 of driving while drunk and sentenced to 45 days in jail.
