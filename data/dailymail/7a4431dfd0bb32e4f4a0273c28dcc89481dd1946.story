Screaming passengers fled a busy tube train fearing a bomb after a commuter’s electrical device overheated, causing sparks and smoke to billow out of his bag.

Rush hour commuters poured out of Chancery Lane station in central London while others were in tears following the bomb scare at 9.30am.

Those nearby reported hearing the man's bag 'pop' and then start to smoke, before he threw it down on the platform, sparking chaos at the station.

The man who owned the device immediately got off the Tube and spoke to staff after he realised his device was smoking, British Transport Police said.

A spokesman said no one was hurt in the incident, and it is not being treated as suspicious.

It is not yet known what the device or manufacturer was involved.

'It looks like a battery in a 
passenger’s device which he had in his bag has overheated, and that is 
what caused the sparks and smoke to come from his bag.

'We don’t know what the device is, if it is a laptop or a computer.

'He
 then approached staff and explained what happened. Our officers are on 
their way to Chancery Lane station to speak to staff and get his 
details.

'We are not treating it as a suspicious incident, and nobody was hurt.'

Jez Smith wrote on Twitter: 'Tube: Smoke and sparks coming from cannister in carriage at Chancery Lane. Crying girlfriend thought she would die.'

Commuters tweeted about the panic sweeping the underground this morning

Another witness, Natasha James, wrote: 'Stuck at Chancery lane, smoke everywhere something went off in a mans bag on the tube. Everyone screaming and running. Horrible experience.'

Alex Townley tweeted: 'Unpleasant start to the morning at Chancery Lane station this morning as everyone ran off the train screaming about smoke leaking from a bag.'

Mr Townley wrote: “I heard it turned into a full on bomb scare - the owner of the bag threw it down the platform I heard?! Madness.”

A number of electronics companies have had to recall computers after devices overheated and caught fire.

The incident triggered a bomb scare among passengers who fled the scene screaming

Last month Panasonic recalled more than 43,000 laptop battery packs after three of them caught fire in Japan and Thailand.

The batteries were sold to customers in Asia with a Panasonic CF-S10 and CF-N10 series laptop between April and October 2011.

The firm issued a separate recall in Europe as a safety precaution involving an unspecified number of battery packs sold with its Toughbook CF-H2 tablets between June 2011 and May 2012.

In April, Sony announced a recall of its Vaio Fit 11A laptops because their non-removable battery packs posed a fire risk.

There is no suggestion that Panasonic or Sony manufactured the device which caused panic at Chancery Lane station.
