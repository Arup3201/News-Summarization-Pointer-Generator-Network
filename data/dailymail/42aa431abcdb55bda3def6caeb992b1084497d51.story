With Christmas party invites on the up and temperatures dropping, sales of longer, midi-length dresses are soaring.

Fewer women are choosing thigh-revealing styles than ever before, as the trend towards longer hemlines continues.

Sales of some midi styles are up as much as 168 per cent compared with November last year at high street store Debenhams.

Even the girls from The Only Way Is Essex who are famous for their short hemlines, are opting for longer dresses

Bosses have carried out research among customers and predict that hemlines are set to fall further still, with celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Katie Holmes leading the style pack by sporting designs that finish between below the knee and the ankle.

Even the more risque celebrities like Katie Price and the cast of ITVâ€™s The Only Way Is Essex - who once insisted on mini skirts and dresses even in sub zero temperatures - have followed the new trend and are experimenting with the modest trend.

A Debenhams spokesman said: 'We are entering an age of cover-up. Hemlines are plunging to below the knee as women go for a classier look inspired by TV shows such as Mad Men.

'British women are dressing for austerity, and that means skirts have become deadly serious - as women have a midi-moment.'

Pencil skirts, pleated skirts, and flared skirts, all of which are knee length or longer, have almost swept the mini skirt away for women in their mid 20s.

The survey revealed that women now desire a longer, below-the-knee skirt to create a better, more professional impression at work, and also want something that can be worn on both formal and informal occasions - saving them money.

And elegant, figure-hugging pencil skirts, inspired by 1950s fashion styles and television programmes such as Mad Men, are now the most popular design on the high street.

With over half a million dresses sold in
the run-up to Christmas at Debenhams alone, mini styles are still 
popular with teenagers and women in their early twenties.

But once women reach 25, it seems they are choosing the more sophisticated, classic 'midi' look.

Earlier research by the high street store showed that many women still wore short mini styles until they were 45-years-old.

Celebrities like Elle McPherson and Sarah Jessica Parker are among older women who proudly showed off toned pins.

The spokesman added: 'There is no doubt that we are seeing much less flesh being exposed on the average British high street.

'A glimpse of stocking has certainly become a thing of the past.

'However, we still believe that the mini skirt is simply too powerful a fashion icon to disappear entirely.

'They are still hugely popular - especially with our younger customer - and we fully expect hemlines to raise again in the near future.'
