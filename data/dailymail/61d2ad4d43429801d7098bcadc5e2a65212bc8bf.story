Coronation Street has sparked a storm of protest from viewers after an episode showed a child being smacked.

Hundreds took to web forums and Twitter to express outrage at the scene which features Faye being hit by her adoptive mother’s boyfriend Owen Armstrong.

The builder, played by Ian Puleston-Davies, loses his temper after the ten-year-old schoolgirl deliberately poisons the  fish in his pond.

He is seen whacking 10-year-old Faye, played by Ellie-Louise Leach, on the back of the legs as she winches in pain.

Monday's episode attracted 9.5million viewers and has led to a small number of complaints to Ofcom and ITV.

But many more fans used social networks and blogging sites to express their disgust at show’s producers.

One web forum poster described the character’s actions as 'psychotic'.

Another said: 'He was really laying into her, or that was the writers' intent.'

An angrier fan added: 'Don’t think it should have been shown. Not necessary in this life today. No need for it.'

Since the Children’s Act came into effect in January 2005, parents are legally allowed to smack their children.

But use of 'excessive force', which cause visible bruising, graze, scratches, minor swellings or cuts, could result in assault charges.

The furore appears to be a sign of the times. Even a few years ago, similar scenes are unlikely to have raised as many eyebrows.

It also reflects that the issue of smacking children is still a huge taboo in society.

Coronation Street, along with other prime-time soaps, regularly shows much more violent and controversial scenes – albeit featuring adults - which generate little comment.

These have recently included the rape of Carla Connor by her partner Frank Foster, a hostage drama which ended with escaped prisoner Tony Gordon shooting dead his cellmate and an explosive tram crash which left several characters dead.

Since joining the soap last January, Faye has been something of a problem child and has been seen trying to disrupt her mother’s budding romance with Owen.

The focus of many complaints is that Owen is not the child’s father but the boyfriend of her mother Anna Windass, played by Debbie Rush.

While many objected to the actual smack, some critics said it would have only been appropriate for her mother  to discipline her in such a way.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Owen should never smacked Faye as she wasn't his child but she deserved a smack.'

Staff from children’s charity the NSPCC have said they are glad the show's producers have raised the debate.

Spokesman Phillip Noyes told Mail Online: 'We all accept that parents have to be in charge and that clear and consistent boundaries are essential for children and young people to have a secure and happy childhood.

'But evidence shows that smacking is not an effective form of punishment and sets a bad example, especially for children who have a troubled past as in this storyline.

'It teaches children that violence is an answer and it undermines the trusting relationship between a child and their carer. Young people tell us it leaves them feeling frightened and confused but often doesn’t actually deter them from repeating what they were smacked for.

Under the 2004 Children's Act, which 
came into force in January 2005, mild smacking is allowed but any 
punishment which causes visible bruising, grazes, scratches, minor 
swellings or cuts can result in legal action.

Those who break the law can be punished with up to five years in jail.

'And for a minority of bad parents who 
go well beyond smacking and seriously harm their children, it is all too
often used as an excuse to social services, the police and the courts.'

The plotline was announced in November but it sparked little controversy at the time.

Today, the show’s producers said it did not condone Owen’s actions, adding that that follow-up storyline made this clear.

Anna is expected to end the relationship over the incident.

A Coronation Street spokesman said: 'We most certainly don’t condone Owen’s actions – as will be seen by the ramifications of the slap, and the effect it has on his relationship.'

An ITV spokesman said: 'The episode and subsequent episodes do not condone the slap and it has far reaching ramifications for the character of Owen.

‘That said we have no problem with sparking a healthy debate on this issue.'

Actor Puleston-Davies said he and scriptwriters had approached the smacking issue cautiously.He said: 'I think any controversial subject handled in the right way is good controversy not bad controversy.

‘I know it was talked about within the writing group and with the producers at length, so they were very careful.

'I was very aware that I wanted to go through the script with a fine-tooth comb.

‘From the moment it was suggested, they took it very carefully and very slowly, so it took a long time to reach the script stage, and rightly so. I'm happy with the finished result.'

MP John Hemming said that he agreed with smacking as a form of punishment.

He told the Mirror: 'There is a line when it comes to these things, and the main thing is what is best for the child.

'Parents are best placed to decide what is best. Smacking, when used responsibly, can work in the child’s best interests.'

He added: 'How can you make it illegal for a parent to slap their child on the wrist? The Government should think carefully before making any changes.'

In a 2010 survey by the Children's Society to identify the biggest risks for children aged six to 15, just a third of adults believed slapping children as a standard punishment was 'high risk' to their welfare.
