Hillary Clinton has mended fences with Barack Obama and 'looks forward to hugging it out' at a swanky party, according to her spokesman, just days after the publication of an interview in which she had harsh words for the president's handling of the crisis in Syria.

Speaking last week to The Atlantic, the former secretary of state said Obama's 'failure' to arm rebels opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.'

She was referring to the murderous terror group ISIS, which has left a swath of death and destruction in its wake as it plows through Iraq and claims to have established an Islamic caliphate.

A Clinton spokesman, however, said Tuesday that she had 'called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership.'

Awkward: Hillary wants to 'hug it out' with her former boss and mend fences agfter she publicly criticized his foreign policy

The statement, delivered first to Politico, acknowledged that Clinton and Obama have 'had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents.'

But '[l]ike any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when she they see each other tomorrow night.'

That could take the edge off of what would otherwise be an awkward encounter at a party Wednesday night on Martha's Vineyard.

The event will honor Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic 
adviser Vernon Jordan.

Clinton, whose reputation as a calculating politician precedes her, is likely to be seen as a craftily playing both sides of the political fence.

Distancing herself from an increasingly unpopular foreign policy will help her among moderates who have tired of a middle-path Obama White House that declines major engagements and, some argue, has given U.S. adversaries room to run.

But publicly seeking reconciliation before a social gathering whose attendees have loose tongues and deep pockets and could simultaneously ingratiate her among far-left Democrats who are shopping for a candidate who will stay Obama's course for four or eight more years.

Clinton's press flack emphasized on Tuesday that she shares Obama's 'deep commitment to a smart and principled foreign policy that uses all the tools at our disposal to achieve our goals.'

The former diplomat is on the Massachusetts island for a book-signing session; the Obamas are in the midst
 of a two-week vacation. It was unclear whether former President Bill Clinton also planned to attend the party.

In her Atlantic interview, Clinton drew the sharpest distinctions 
yet between herself and Obama in a rebuke of his cautious approach to global crises.

'Great nations need organizing principles, and "don't do stupid stuff' 
is not an organizing principle,' she said, referring to a version of the phrase Obama and his advisers 
have used privately to describe his approach to foreign policy.

Asked for her organizing principle, she replied: 'Peace, progress and prosperity. This worked for a very long time.'

Clinton
 wrapped her critiques in expressions of respect for the president and 
sympathy for the tough global decisions he grapples with from the Oval 
Office.

On Monday, a 
vacation day for Obama, he dealt with issues involving Iraq, Ukraine, 
Gaza, Syria, as well as terrorism and Ebola in Africa.

'He's thoughtful, he's incredibly 
smart, and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all 
moving at the same time,' she said.

'I
 think he is cautious because he knows what he inherited, both the two 
wars and the economic front, and he has expended a lot of capital and 
energy trying to pull us out of the hole we're in.'

However,
 Clinton offered an uncompromising defense of Israel's battle against 
Hamas in Gaza and argued against Obama's decision not to build up a 
rebel fighting force to confront Syrian President Bashar Assad.

President Barack Obama is currently on vacation on the island of Martha's Vineyard. On Wednesday he and Hillary Clinton will attend the same get-together just a few days after she slammed Obama's approach to Syria in an interview

Hillary Clinton signs copies of her book Hard choices in Huntington, New York last Wednesday. Clinton will be in Martha's Vineyard this week for another book signing

Clinton previously described her advocacy for the Syrian rebellion in her recently released book Hard Choices, a slow-selling memoir about her time leading the State Department.

Obama has said supporting the rebels would not have stopped al-Qaida-inspired groups from rampaging across Syria and inside Iraq today. Clinton and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reportedly argued for arming the rebels who first stood up to Assad three years ago.

Since then, the question of 'arming the rebels' has become more complicated, as fighters linked to al-Qaeda and other fundamentalist Islamist groups have joined the rebellion.

The White House declined to respond to Clinton's comments in The Atlantic, but said her team gave them a heads-up before the interview was published.

Clinton, who lost to Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, has not said definitively whether she will run in 2016. But her decision to sit down for an in-depth interview about her foreign policy vision and to distinguish herself from the unpopular incumbent for whom she worked is the latest signal she's seriously preparing for a bid.

Republicans say she won't be able to escape that she carried out Obama's foreign policy for his first term without public complaint.

'Hillary Clinton spent four years executing Barack Obama's foreign policy, and in year five of Obama's term it's ridiculous for Hillary to try to swindle voters into thinking what's happening around the world isn't a product of Obama-Hillary diplomacy,' Republican National Committee spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski said in response to Clinton's interview.
