A young man with the mental age of a nine-year-old was stabbed to death in a ‘shocking’ street attack over a North Face jacket, a court heard today.

Dean Mayley, 24, was targeted for his jacket as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the Old Bailey heard.

Three teenagers got out of a waiting car and, while two blocked Mr Mayley’s path, another stabbed him once in the heart, jurors heard.

Dean Mayley, 24, (pictured left with his nephew) was stabbed to death as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the court heard. Mr Mayley suffered from microcephaly which made him 'vulnerable’

As the attackers made off in the car, passers-by went to help the victim who staggered into the road before he collapsed, the court heard.

Mr Mayley, who suffered from brain disorder microcephaly which made him ‘trusting and vulnerable’, died in hospital less than two hours later.

A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a single stab wound to the chest.

Prosecutor Simon Denison QC said: ‘It may well be that Dean’s mental condition meant that he didn’t understand what was happening, or what they wanted.

‘But he didn’t hand them anything in the course of that confrontation.’

Four teenagers aged between 17 and 19 are on trial for the attempted robbery and murder of Mr Mayley.

Mr Denison told jurors: ‘The evidence in this case will shock you. The attack on Dean Mayley was captured very clearly by a CCTV camera that overlooked the area of pavement where it happened.

‘You will, I’m afraid, see the footage of the way he was confronted and you will see (a 17-year-old defendant) stab him, and you will see him immediately stagger into the road and collapse as a result of the injury caused to him.

‘I have no doubt that it will shock you and make you angry.

‘You will, I am sure, as fellow human beings feel enormous sympathy for him and for his family, who have to cope with his sudden loss in these circumstances.’

But the prosecutor warned the jury to set aside these feelings and decide the issues ‘fairly and dispassionately’ on the evidence.

He said all four defendants in the dock played a part in the murder.

Mr Denison said: ‘All, you may think, depressingly young.

‘But all plenty old enough to pick on an innocent victim when they have a knife and all old enough to know what can happen when you stick a knife into someone.’

The 17-year-old who allegedly struck the fatal wound had only celebrated his birthday a few days before, the court heard.

Another 17-year-old and Ryan Beresford, 19, stood in Mr Mayley’s way, and 18-year-old Michael Mensah drove them all to and from the scene, it was alleged.

The prosecution linked Mensah to another mugging in the same area just days earlier in which a 15-year-old boy was forced to hand over his North Face bodywarmer and mobile phone.

Four teenagers aged between 17 and 19 are on trial at the Old Bailey in London (above) for the attempted robbery and murder of Mr Mayley. They all deny murder in connection with the incident on February 7

In the earlier incident, Mensah allegedly drove the robbers to the scene in his Fiat Punto, although the victim was unable to identify the two young men who then ran off.

Mr Denison said: ‘Exactly the same area, same method, same sort of target, and same car - Michael Mensah’s car.

‘The other victim gave them what they wanted, and he was not physically harmed.

‘Dean Mayley didn’t. He is dead.’

Beresford, of Acton, west London, and Mensah, of Greenford, west London, along with the two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named, all deny murder.

Beresford, Mensah and one of the 17-year-olds deny attempted robbery. But the 17-year-old who allegedly stabbed Mr Mayley has admitted the charge of attempted robbery, the court heard.

Menseh alone is accused of the earlier robbery on January 28. He denies the charge.

The trial continues.
