A Georgia mom has expressed her outrage after the school her special-needs six-year-old boy attends restrained him with metal handcuffs ‘for his own protection’ after he became disruptive.

Lakaisha Reid said that her son, Patrick, suffered painful bruises on his wrists after a school resource officer at Pine Ridge Elementary cuffed him for misbehavior.

The school said it took the controversial course of action because he was being disruptive and destructive.

It said in a statement to WXIA: ‘[Patrick] was acting in a disruptive manner and being self-destructive during school today. He ran out of school onto a busy, public street and was pursued by three school staff members.

‘The student was secured and returned to the school… for approximately one hour, the student was scratching, kicking and hitting school personnel and continued to exhibit violent behavior, running into walls, banging his head on tables and placing his health at risk.’

But Mrs Reid disputes that handcuffing Patrick was necessary.

Concern: Mrs Reid said her son was ‘yelling and screaming’ when she arrived at the school

She told Ktla.com: ‘He just ran away from school. It does not require handcuffs for this. He’s a special-needs kid.’

Patrick was ‘yelling and screaming’ when she arrived at the school with her husband after being told about the situation by an official.

Mrs Reid said that the only situation in which it would be necessary to cuff a six-year-old would be if ‘he was robbing a bank’.

She added: ‘They need to have police officers that are trained for special need kids or for any kids that are that age. That’s pretty young for handcuffs already, you understand? Anything can happen with those handcuffs on him.’
