A California jury recommended the death sentence for the 29-year-old convicted of killing his girlfriend's family when they told her to dump him in 2007.

The 12 person jury in the murder case of Iftekhar Murtaza deliberated for three hours Thursday before coming to their decision. Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals waited until Monday to make the decision.

Murtaza was convicted last month of killing his ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak's father and sister by burning down the family's Orange County home after becoming 'upset' when the then 18-year-old dumped him.

At the time, she said her Hindu parents threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she didn't leave her Muslim boyfriend.

Maximum sentence: Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted last month of murdering his ex-girlfriend's father and sister following their break-up. Today, a jury recommended the death penalty for Murtaza

The cold-blooded killer was found guilty of two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and one conspiracy count on , but declined to convict on kidnapping and murder during a burglary charges on November 22.

'We're very pleased with the verdicts,' prosecutor Howard Gundy said after the receiving the guilty verdict last month, adding he was ready to move to the next phase.

Two of Murtaza's friends were previously convicted of the killings. Vitaliy Krasnoperov was sentenced to life in prison, and Charles Murphy Jr. is scheduled to be sentenced in December.

Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home when he got 'upset' about their break-up

Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man

Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Mr Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'.

From the outset of the trial, prosecutors claimed he planned the murder plot and paid a friend $30,000 to help him kill the teen's parents so he
 could be with her.

Mr Murtaza 
said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting
 with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead.

'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech.'

'I was frustrated, I was upset,' he continued, 'I just wished they would accept me.'

'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.'

Mr Murtaza said he repeated his wish that the Dhanaks would die or disappear to dozens of friends out of his sense of frustration and despair and that his relationship would be fine if not for them.

The prosecution contended Dhanak wanted to end the relationship with the disturbed man because he had become controlling and violent.

Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings

Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter

Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight

Leela Dhanak broke down on the stand as she talked about still hearing her spouse’s screams of terror in her sleep years later.

Mrs Dhanak told the Orange County courtroom that she was attacked when she came home in May 2007 and fell unconscious.

She was found on the front lawn of a neighbors property by police, who had responded to a fire at Mrs Dhanak's home.

The woman woke up from a coma three weeks later to discover the family’s Anaheim Hills mansion had been burned, and her husband, 56-year-old Jaypraykash Dhanak, and eldest daughter, Karishma Dhanak, 20, killed.

Last month, a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire.

Autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury.

Their bodies had been found in a park in Irvine about two miles from the University of California dorm where Shayona Danak lived.

The scorned ex-boyfriend was interviewed by police within the days of the horrifying plot and was soon arrested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 stashed in his luggage.

So happy together: Mr Murtaza (left) tied the knot with fellow suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti (right), 20, in a 2011 jailhouse ceremony - the newlyweds were separated by a chain-link fence

During her testimony, Mrs Dhanak admitted she didn't particularly like Mr Murtaza, but had her daughter truly loved him, she would have supported the young couple.

‘She was too young to fall in love with any guys,’ she told the court.

In June 2011, Mr Murtaza married 20-year-old suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti in a jailhouse ceremony after exchanging letters for five months.

Ms Bilotti is charged with first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. 

She faces 32 years to life in prison for helping a friend, Derek Christopher Adams, murder a man in 2010.
