Where does Martin Kaymer’s stunning eight-stroke success at the 114th United States Open at Pinehurst stand among the great major championship performances of the last 30 years?

Rory McIlroy was kind enough to place it above his own masterclass at Congressional three years ago, which would slot it just below Tiger Woods at his absolute best at Pebble Beach in 2000 and at his absolute bravest at Torrey Pines in 2008.

Personally, I wouldn’t go that far. McIlroy was 23 when he won by eight, the youngest winner since Bob Jones in 1923. Kaymer is 29, the sort of age you might expect a golfer to pull off an astounding feat, if he has it within him.

You could see the difference in the admirable manner in which the German managed his game. I didn’t rate his chances because he is relatively poor from the tight lies that were prevalent around the greens, but Kaymer solved that problem with the age-old solution of reaching for his putter.

He showed the humility of a champion at the 7th hole during the final round, when a bunker lay between his ball and the flag. Most pros would have taken the challenge on and risked the double bogey, but Kaymer acknowledged his weakness, putted the ball to 20ft and took his one-stroke punishment.

Other than that, he was practically blemish free as he followed up his wire-to-wire success on the lush Florida acres at the Players Championship last month with a similar  triumph at burnished Pinehurst.

It would be no surprise if he went on a Sir Nick Faldo-like streak and won a bunch of majors in a relatively short space of time.

The last time he was this good, after he won the 2010 USPGA Championship, he promptly fell apart. Here was another private man finding it difficult to cope with the spotlight. ‘I was doing countless interviews and I thought I had to say something and make headlines,’ explained Kaymer. ‘Now I’m  comfortable just being myself.’

While a step behind Adam Scott, McIlroy and Henrik Stenson in terms of ballstriking, the advantage he has is his deadliness with the putter. While the aforementioned trio are streaky, Kaymer’s perfect technique rarely lets him down.

‘He’s definitely a more complete player 
now than in 2010 and his short game is improving all the time,’ said his
 Glaswegian caddie Craig Connelly, whose own part in Kaymer’s success 
should not be underestimated. ‘He was talking with Bernhard (Langer) 
before he went out, who was telling him “Let’s get closer to that German
 Grand Slam”. Now there’s only one to go.’

With Langer chipping in with two Masters titles, the only one left is the Open, to be staged next month at Royal Liverpool with its plethora of deep bunkers. Kaymer, as it happens, might be as good as anyone in the world right now out of sand.

Then there’s the Ryder Cup. The last time at Medinah he was struggling but showed his unbending nerve by sinking the winning putt. This time at Gleneagles he will be the rock of Paul McGinley’s team. ‘He’s got the whole package and he’s obviously someone you wouldn’t relish facing,’ said American Keegan Bradley.

One month after Scott’s elevation to world No 1, Kaymer’s victory was another significant landmark for one of the game’s quiet men. Twitter-free, with all his energies and focus on the task at hand. There’s a lesson there, for those willing to learn.

How nice that Laura Davies’s first event as a Dame just happens to be the biggest tournament in the women’s game; the US Open.

And how fitting that it’s on a Pinehurst course she will adore. If you must give out gongs to people for playing games, it’s hard to think of a more fitting recipient than this 50-year-old standard bearer.

‘I’m sure my mates will give me a bit of ribbing over my new title,’ she said, and you can be sure Davies will give it back with the same free spirit that has characterised her play all these years.

‘I heard Martin has been allowed to play the number three course all week. Is that true?’

American Kevin Na wryly sums up the widely-held sense of incredulity among his fellow competitors regarding Martin Kaymer’s earth-shattering performance at Pinehurst No 2 last week.

‘The world’s worst-kept secret,’ said Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, announcing the return of Royal Portrush to the Open rota on Monday. Although it was still secret enough, apparently, to escape the person doing the R&A’s Twitter feed.

‘Still some distance away,’ was the official tweet in reaction to the story in these pages last month.
