Three U.S. service members have been killed in an IED attack in Afghanistan, it was confirmed today.

The deaths come amid a week of increased violence by the Taliban after Afghans voted in the presidential elections.Â

Earlier this week, eleven people, including election monitors, were killed when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in the country's north the day after the presidential runoff.

Sediq Azizi, spokesman for the provincial governor in Samangan province, said on Sunday that a minibus hit an IED the night before, with the blast killing six women, one child and four men in the provincial capital Aybak.

Azizi said four of the victims were employees of the country's election commission, which organized Saturday's vote.

In a separate incident, the Taliban cut off the fingers of 11 civilians on Saturday in western Herat province to punish them for voting in the presidential runoff, police spokesman Raoud Ahamdi said.

The Taliban had warned people not to participate in the vote.
