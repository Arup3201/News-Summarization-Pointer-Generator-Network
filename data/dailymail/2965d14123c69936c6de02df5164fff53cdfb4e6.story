Reckless: Marvin Travon Hicks was arrested after he crashed his car, killing a two-year-old girl, while running away from police

Police have arrested a California man after he led them on a high-speed chase before slamming his car into another, killing a two-year-old girl and severely injuring her mother.

Marvin Travon Hicks, 43, was taken into custody Friday and charged with suspicion of felony vehicular manslaughter. He is being held on a $1 million bail and is due to appear in court on Monday.

Meanwhile, the victim was identified as Madison Ruano, a two-year-old girl who was considered a ‘miracle’ child after she survived being born severely prematurely at 25 weeks and weighing less than two pounds.

According to the official report, police started pursuing Hicks after he ran a red light on Sierra Highway, shortly before the fatal collision. 

Authorities say he then weaving between cars going at speeds over 100 mph and even drove briefly on the wrong side of the road in an attempt to avoid police.

It was at that point that Hicks drove his black Toyota straight into the blue Lexus driven by Ruano’s mother.

Both the woman and child suffered massive trauma to their upper body and were immediately taken to the hospital, where the little girl later died. Her mother remains in serious condition.

Meanwhile, Hicks was surrounded by several officers with their guns drawn, according to The Antelope Valley Times. Photographs from the scene show the front of Hicks' car was completely totaled and that he had a difficult time standing as he was pulled by police from his car.

It was unclear whether drugs or alcohol had anything to do with the crash, though deputies on the scene said Hicks appeared to be in a state of inebriation.

Hicks also has a long history of drunk and reckless driving. In October 2001, Hicks was convicted of driving under the influence, while in August of 1995, he was convicted of misdemeanor hit and run.

Already, condolences over the young 
girl’s death are pouring in, with people leaving balloons and stuffed 
animals at the intersection where the accident took place.

Meanwhile, a Facebook tribute page for the girl described and a memorial fund has raised nearly $3,000 for the family.

On
the Facebook page, Ruano was described as being ‘precious little light 
to ALL who encountered her.’ It also describes how Ruano managed to 
survive, despite being born nearly three months early and at only 1 
pound and 14 ounces.

By the time she left the hospital, she was a healthy four pounds, much to the relief of her parents.

‘We
know that Madison is now in the arms of our dear Lord, Jesus,’ the page
reads. ‘We are thankful for her life and the short time that we had her
with us.'
