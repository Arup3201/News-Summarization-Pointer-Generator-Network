Six New Jersey residents have filed a federal lawsuit against Governor Chris Christie, the state of New Jersey, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and others over traffic jams in September that made them 'late for work.'

The suit filed in federal court Thursday appears to be the first civil claim over traffic jams that appear to have been caused as political punishment for the Fort Lee mayor. The plaintiffs want it certified as a class action.

Lawyer Rosemarie Arnold says she filed it after learning this week that lane closures on an approach to the George Washington Bridge were 'deliberate actions.'

Bridgegate has prompted scrutiny of nearly every aspect of the Christie administration and his Port Authority appointees

She says that her clients were late for work and that one suffered a panic attack.

Christie has denied involvement. His spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The news comes after a woman who died after her ambulance was delayed due to the road closures enacted by Christie's political aides was identified as a 91-year-old mother-of-two who moved to America from Italy for a better life.

Florence Genova had a heart attack at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey, on September 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock.

However, her family today said they don't believe that her death was due to the delayed emergency response caused by the George Washington Bridge lane closures ordered by Chris Christie's aides.

Mrs Genova's daughter Vilma Oleri, 57, told the New York Times: 'I honestly believe it was just her time. 'We want to stay out of it. It's not political.'

But angry friends neighbors have have expressed their outrage that her care may have been compromised in any way for what appears to have been an act of revenge on one of Christie’s political opponents.

The 91-year-old was taken to the nearby Englewood Hospital where she died later that day. It is not clear if the delay in the ambulance arriving contributed to the death of Mrs Genova, a widow whose husband died five years ago.

On Thursday, Christie said he was 'heartbroken and humiliated' as he apologized for his staff's 'callous' conduct leading to the 'Bridgegate' controversy that will either dampen his hopes at a run for the White House or strengthen his image as a no-nonsense executive who places a premium on accountability.

The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election

Christie revealed at a two-hour press conference that he has fired Bridget Kelly, the deputy chief of staff who conspired to block vehicle lanes to the George Washington Bridge, snarling traffic and delivering a political blow to a New Jersey mayor who refused to back the governor's re-election bid.

'I terminated her employment because she lied to me,' he said. 'I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.'

Christie also dismissed Bill Stepien, his former campaign manager who just days ago seemed destined lead the state's Republican Party, saying that exercising leadership sometimes requires politicians to fire their friends. Stepien has also lost a lucrative consulting deal with the Republican Governors Association, which Christie leads.

Christie, who appeared confident and traded barbs with reporters, could see his presidential hopes disappear if it is proved he knew about the affair. He insisted that he first learned Wednesday about a raft of emails that exposed his staff's conspiracy. 'I was blindsided,' Christie said.

He also said that he never considered resigning over the issue. 'Oh my god. I didn't do anything wrong. That's a crazy question,' a bullish – but not bullying – Christie told reporters.
