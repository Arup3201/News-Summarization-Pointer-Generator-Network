A man has been arrested by police investigating the murder of a woman whose body was discovered in flats this morning. 

The 49-year-old will be questioned by Staffordshire Police later over the woman's death at a property in Stoke-on-Trent. 

Officers were called to the tower block of flats at around 10.30am where the woman, believed to be in her thirties, was discovered.

It is understood the man and the woman are known to each other. The cause of her death is not yet known, and forensic teams continue to work at the scene.

Superintendent Jane Hewitt from Staffordshire Police said: 'We are working to support the family of the woman at this very tragic and difficult time and I urge people not to speculate about the incident and allow the detectives to establish the circumstances which led to the death of the woman.

'Local police officers are speaking to residents in the block of flats and surrounding areas to gather any information and to provide reassurance. 

'I urge anyone with any information to call Staffordshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'
