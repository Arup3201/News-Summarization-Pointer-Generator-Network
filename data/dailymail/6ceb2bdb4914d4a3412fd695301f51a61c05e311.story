Likely 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made pointed comments on America's current foreign policy, putting some rare distance between herself and the Obama administration.

The 66-year-old - who was Obama's top diplomat during her time as Secretary of State - said she disagreed with the government's embattled approach to international affairs during an extended interview with The Atlantic magazine.

The interview was published as President Obama faces major backlash over the way he has handled the current crises in Israel, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq, Fox News reported.

'Great nations need organizing principles,' Clinton told The Atlantic.

Keeping her distance: Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, dramatically distanced herself from the President's approach to foreign policy in an interview published Sunday

'And ''don’t do stupid stuff'' is not an organizing principle.'

Clinton specified her main concern was the situation in Syria.

She said America should have armed Syrian rebels in the early stages of their uprising against President Bashar al Assad.

'The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad — there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle — the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,' she told The Atlantic.

Clinton has long advocated that more should have been done in Syria and those opinions in the memoir she wrote of her years in State Department called Hard Choices.

Clinton did say that Obama's mantra of 'don't do stupid sh--' was an attempt to assure the American people the government was 'not going to do anything crazy', but that she doesn't think that was the right approach.

Under fire: President Obama, who is currently on vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, has been widely criticised for his approached to halting ISIS advances in Syria

Last week Obama ordered air strikes and humantiarian airdrops in Syri - the first airstrikes in Iraq since 2011.

The decision came after a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed his administration had a record-high disapproval rating, with 60 percent of those polled saying they did not approve of Obama's approach.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called Obama’s response 'clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least', according to The New York Post.

'This is the possibility of a cataclysmic scenario,” McCain told CNN’s State of the Union.

He said the radical Islamist group is quickly spreading around the region.
