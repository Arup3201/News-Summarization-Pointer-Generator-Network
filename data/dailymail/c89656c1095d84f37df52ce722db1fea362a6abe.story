An Indianapolis man has shot and killed his brother after finding him burglarizing his home.  

The homeowner, identified by WTHR as Derrick Anderson, 34, found a broken window at his home just after midday on Saturday and, fearing a burglar had found his firearms, called police.

But before authorities arrived, he confronted the intruder - his younger brother Demond Anderson - and they physically fought before Derrick shot his brother, police said.

When officers arrived at the home on East Riverside Drive, they found Demond Anderson unconscious. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
