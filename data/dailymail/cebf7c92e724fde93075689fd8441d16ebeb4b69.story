Most of us are happy with a toothpaste that costs a couple of pounds. But a new generation of super-toothpastes costing up to £100 a tube has emerged — with extravagant promises such as rejuvenating gums and regenerating enamel.

So, is it worth splashing out? Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, who leads an expert panel of dentists that examines manufacturers’ claims to ensure they are clinically proven, gives his verdict:

BREATH FRESHENER

Dr Katz California Breath Plus, £8.95, californiabreathuk.co.uk

Part of a range by Dr Harold Katz, dubbed Hollywood’s ‘Bad Breath Guru’. Is claimed to help with the most stubborn bad breath and fight cavities.

TASTE TEST: This is a dense, clear gel. There is none of the familiar foaming action of a conventional toothpaste. It glides over the teeth as you brush. It doesn’t have a bad after-taste, but nor do you get a minty-fresh mouth feel.

DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘The toothpaste contains all of the usual ingredients: water, abrasive silica, which is very fine quartz that aids the cleaning process, and flavouring.

‘The only extras are xylitol — a sweetener that inhibits the growth of bacteria, which is also found in a lot of supermarket own-brand toothpastes — and flavourings, such as peppermint oil, but nothing to justify the price.

‘The claims being made are excessive. It says it gets rid of and prevents bad breath — but there is nothing I can see in there that indicates that is going to be the case.

‘This is an under-formulated and over-sold product.’

COCOA TOOTHPASTE

Theodent 300. Was £103.95, now £67.55 (biovea.com)

The most expensive toothpaste on sale. It uses a patented formula with an extract found in cocoa beans, which the company says can replace fluoride.

TASTE TEST: A white paste with mild minty taste. This boasts that it is ‘not harmful if swallowed’, and advises users to brush and rinse, then brush a second time and spit out the excess.

If you swallow it, there is an unpleasant hint of cocoa . . . and a sudden urge to retch.

DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘I can’t find any robust scientific evidence that this works. It’s fluoride-free, so I’d be surprised if it had any decay-preventing effect, which is the key thing you want out of a toothpaste.

‘In terms of spitting rather than rinsing, I would advise everyone to do that. But brushing twice? Other than telling you to use twice as much of a very expensive toothpaste, I can’t explain that.

The price is utterly unjustified — 20 times the cost of a well-researched toothpaste for something fluoride-free. You’d be better off with a 25p fluoride toothpaste from Tesco.’

WHITENING TREATMENT

Dr Oliver White Smile Whitening Toothpaste, £12, spacenk.com

Dr Joe Oliver is founder of London’s Welbeck Clinic, which boasts numerous celebrity patients, including Helena Bonham Carter. This claims to use hydrogen peroxide to gently whiten teeth. It also contains anti-tartar and anti-stain ingredients intended to help teeth stay whiter.

TASTE TEST: A speckled green gel with a moderate foaming action. It has a sour minty taste which, thankfully, doesn’t linger once you have rinsed.

DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘Some whitening toothpastes do have an effect, thanks to abrasive ingredients that remove stains from the surface of the teeth. It is claimed this one whitens teeth using hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent.

‘Toothpastes sold in the EU can legally contain only 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide, and the chance of that amount having an effect is virtually non-existent.

‘You need to be getting at least 30 times that amount to achieve anything. There is nothing that would be costly in any way — a product at an eighth of the price is going to be as good.’

ENAMEL REBUILDER

Regenerate Enamel Science toothpaste, plus ‘boosting’ serum kit, £40, selfridges.com

Said to be the ‘first dental care system able to reverse the erosion process’. With each use, the ingredients form a fresh supply of enamel mineral which binds to the teeth.

TASTE TEST: The toothpaste itself is glittery-white and the most dense of the four. It produces a strange tingly sensation on your gums, but the taste is pleasant and minty.

The twice-daily toothpaste is used as part of a combination with a serum applied for three days in the month.

DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘This one is the result of ten years of research and there are already extensive published scientific studies to support what it says the product’s doing.

‘Regenerate as a name is perhaps a little bit misleading, because you’re not going to regrow enamel. What it does is put a new coating of minerals — which appears to be virtually indistinguishable from enamel — over the teeth.

‘This is really exciting science. It is expensive but, with ten years of research and as a unique product on the market, there’s a real reason for the premium price.’
