Yesterday, the Queen gave her Christmas Message to the nation as her Diamond Jubilee year draws to a close.

Since her first message in 1952, The Queen has ruled through enormous historic events and periods of change.

Here, MailOnline looks at the defining Christmas Messages of each decade.

1950s

Queen Elizabeth II gave her first Christmas message in 1952, broadcast in sound only on television in the UK.

However, her message five years later was perhaps more significant as it was the first to be televised.

The Queen read from the Long Library at Sandringham House and in her message she noted how it was the 25th anniversary of the first Christmas message broadcast on radio.

Historic: The Queen is pictured in the Long Library at Sandringham House following her first televised Christmas Day message in 1957

She also highlighted the advance of 
technology which allowed her message to be seen by people up and down 
the country in their homes.

However,
despite marking how things were changing, she also spoke about the 
importance of holding on to ideals and values such as religion, 
self-restraint and honesty.

1960s

During
this decade the Queen gave birth to Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. It
was a period of huge social upheaval which the Queen reflected in her 
1966 message.

She used the broadcast to speak about the increasingly prominent and important role played by women in society.

Tragedy: The scene in October 1966 where 116 children and 28 adults died when a slag heap collapsed and enghulfed Pantglas Junior School in Aberfan, Wales, which the Queen referred to in her message that year

It was also during this year that the Aberfan disaster occurred, in which 144 people were killed following the collapse of a colliery spoil tip into the Welsh village.

No
Christmas address was given by the Queen in 1969, because Elizabeth felt
that with the investiture of Prince Charles and the release of a 
documentary about the Royal Family she had had enough coverage on 
television.

1970s

A number of the Queen's Christmas Day messages during this decade reflected on the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland.

The monarch also celebrated the wedding of her daughter, Princess Anne, to Captain Mark Phillips.

Ongoing tensions: Many of the Queen's messages in the 1970s reflected on The Troubles in Northern Ireland, including Bloody Sunday in 1972 (above) in which 26 civil rights protesters were shot by British soldiers

In 1977, the Queen's speech 
celebrated the Silver Jubilee. She used her message to express hope for a
reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

In August of that year, she visited Northern Ireland for the first time in 11 years and she attempted to help push for peace.

1980s

The first Christmas Day Message of this decade attracted a record 28 million viewers in the United Kingdom.

The
Queen reflected on celebrations for The Queen Mother's 80th birthday 
and used her message to address the themes of service in all its forms.

Event: The Queen's 1982 message marked the 50th anniversary of the first Christmas message. She delivered this message in the library of Windsor Castle for the very first time

The Queen's 1982 message marked 
the 30th anniversary of the first Christmas message. She delivered this 
message in the library of Windsor Castle for the very first time.

The year was marked by British troops fighting in the Falklands War and so the theme of the message by the Queen was 'the sea'.

Prince William was also born this year, with Prince Harry born in 1984.

In 1990, Her Majesty 
paid tribute to the role of the armed services as troops prepared for 
Operation Desert Storm in the First Gulf War.

A
year later, her message highlighted the huge changes occurring across 
Eastern Europe and particularly the Soviet Union, which was dissolved 
into 15 states on Christmas Day.

In 
her speech in 1995, the Queen reminded the country of the 50th 
anniversaries of VE Day and VJ Day and paid tribute to soldiers who had 
died in the Second World War.

Two
years later, the Queen's message opened with a reminder of a personal 
loss when Princess Diana died just a few months earlier. But she also 
spoke of her joy of married life.

In 1999, she told how she was looking forward to the new Millennium.

The Queen used her first Christmas Message of the new Millennium to reflect on the role of faith in communities.

The
following year, Her Majesty made reference to foot-and-mouth disease, 
which had crippled Britain's farming community, and the September 11 
terrorist attacks.

Her 50th
Christmas broadcast in 2002 was tinged with personal sadness for the 
Queen as she reflected on the deaths of The Queen Mother and Princess 
Margaret.

But she also remembered the joyous scenes when the nation celebrated her Golden Jubilee.

In
2005, she drew attention to tragedies such as the south-east Asia 
tsunami which killed more than 230,000 people in 14 countries, the 
earthquake in Kashmir and the 7/7 bombings in London.

Critics
pointed to her omission of Prince Charles's wedding to Camilla Parker 
Bowles, with some in the media describing it as a 'snub'.Â 

A year later was the first time the speech was made available as a podcast.

In
2008, she addressed people's concerns about the global economic crash 
and called on the nation to work for a better future and not accept 
defeat.

In 2010, the Christmas message for filmed for the first time at Hampton Court Palace.

She
spoke of the unifying force of sport at building communities and 
featured footage of Prince William and Prince Harry playing football 
with orphans in Lesotho.

This year, the Queen paid 
tribute to the success of the Olympic and Paralympic athletes at London 
2012 and reflected on the celebrations for her Diamond Jubilee.

It was filmed for the first time in 3D... in stark contrast to that audio-only Christmas message of 1952.
