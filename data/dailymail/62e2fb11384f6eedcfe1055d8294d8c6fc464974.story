Taking action against a dreaded weight gain is never easy. But for one woman it was a matter of life or death.

Jennifer Bodek, 48, was so overweight that she slipped into a coma and 'died' twice.

But after losing 15 stone, Jennifer, who is now a more manageable size 22, says she has conquered her battle with the bulge.

Jennifer tipped the scales at a mammoth 38 stone after gorging on chocolate and packets of crisps.

However, two years ago she was rushed to hospital after suffering respiratory failure due to the  excessive strain her weight put on her body.

After being released from hospital, the former foster carer, from Thurso in the Highlands, went on a crash diet and has now shed more than one third of her body weight.

She decided it was time to slim down after it took 10 nurses and specialist heavy machinery to find her real weight.

The comfort eater has now confessed that she scoffed more than 8,000 calories a day including her favourite snack of 24 packets of crisps and 20 chocolate bars in one sitting.

She has lost 15 stone in the last 18 months through healthy eating and a new-found love of swimming and has slimmed down a curvy size 22.
