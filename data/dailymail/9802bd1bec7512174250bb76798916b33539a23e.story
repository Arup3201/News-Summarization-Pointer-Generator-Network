David Luiz claims he can cope with the pressure of leading a nation of 200 million people when Brazil take on Germany in Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final.

The former Chelsea defender captains his country after Thiago Silva’s appeal against a booking during the 2-1 victory over Colombia - his second of the tournament - was thrown out by FIFA.

Brazilian wonder kid Neymar is also out of the semi-final with a fractured vertebrae, but Luiz is confident of reaching Sunday’s final in the Maracana.

The Paris St Germain centre-half said:
 ‘I'm ready. I’m vice-captain and this group is very easy to handle 
because everyone's very down to earth.

'It won't be a tough job at all.’

Luiz has the full support of his team-mate Hulk. 'He's just the best,' the Zenit St Petersburg forward said.

'He's very caring and very attentive, no matter who he's with. It's not every day that you come across someone like him.

'The
 whole world knows what he has to offer on the pitch - and to my mind, 
he and Thiago (Silva) are the best central-defensive partnership in the 
world - but as his team-mates, we also know what a great person he is 
too.'

Luiz Felipe Scolari, who flew with 
Silva from their Rio training base to Belo Horizonte by helicopter 
instead of travelling with the rest of the squad, will play Dante 
alongside Luiz.

Brazil need 
some attacking flair in the team after the injury to Neymar and could 
use Chelsea forward Willian in an advanced role against Germany.

Luiz
 Gustavo is expected to return to the team after suspension, leaving 
Fernandinho and Paulinho fighting it out for the remaining place in 
midfield.
