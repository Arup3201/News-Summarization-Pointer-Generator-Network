Arrested: Joseph Callahan, 69, was arrested on Monday, accused of making a terrifying arsenal of guns and bombs at his home in Connecticut

A 69-year-old married Connecticut man accused of stockpiling an incredible arsenal of guns, ammunition and home-made bombs in his $1million mansion was arrested on Monday.

No one yet knows what Joseph Callahan had in mind for more than 250 guns, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosive devices police say they found at his house in Fairfield.

But yesterday Callahan, who has a chemistry background, was charged with 11 counts of illegal possession of explosives, six counts of first-degree reckless endangerment and one count of manufacturing bombs.

On his LinkedIn page, Callahan says he is president of chemical company Remair.

He also worked at gun manufacturer Remington Arms for nearly two decades.

The Hartford Courant reported that local police and federal agents raided the five-bedroom property last week after a reported burglary.

Instead, officers found 274 firearms, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and a large amount of hazardous materials on October 1.

Authorities immediately closed down Bronson Road, where the home is located.

It then took two days for experts to deal with the dangerous materials and make the area safe.

No one was injured in the operation, which included agents from the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, alongside state and local police.

Fairfield police chief Gary Macnamara described 'tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition strewn through the residence', as reported by Fox Connecticut.

There were also scores of containers of highly explosive material stored at the large property at 1625 Bronson Road.

Christopher Tracy, Fairfield's acting fire chief, said in a press release last Wednesday that 'a large amount of various chemicals' were found at the home.Â 

Danger: Authorities found larger amounts of explosive materials stashed at the property

Dennis
Schain of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 
added that some of the chemicals may have been used by Callahan in his 
rocketry hobby.

Then, on Monday, the 69-year-old was arrested. He is reportedly cooperating with authorities and was released from custody to remove the remaining dangerous chemicals.

The Courant reported that haz-mat professionals and fire department officers will remain on the scene until Callahan fully complies with the court order to dispose of the material.

He is due in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on October 16.
