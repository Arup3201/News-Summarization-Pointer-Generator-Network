This is the Muslim convert who walked into a police station and said he wanted to kidnap and murder Prince Harry.

Ashraf Islam – who used to be called Mark Townley – made the chilling  threat the day after Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich, it emerged yesterday.

After arresting him, officers discovered Islam, 30, had carried out internet searches for ‘kidnapping’, ‘guns’ and ‘vans’ on his laptop.

Confession: Mark Townley, (left) converted to Islam and changed his name to Ashraf Islam (pictured more recently, right). He admitted threatening to kill Prince Harry the day after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby

They also found that he had visited 
terrorist and firearms websites. Two days later, Islam, of no fixed 
address, pleaded guilty at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in West London to
threatening to kill Harry.

The Prince has served in Afghanistan and is a
keen supporter of Help For Heroes – the charity whose T-shirt Drummer 
Rigby was wearing when he was murdered.

Islam was remanded in custody to await
sentence.

Police are looking at whether he was part of network and are 
examining details of a trip he made to the Middle East in 2010.

As Townley, Islam has a string of 
convictions.

In 2008 he was convicted of fraud after he conned former 
soldiers out of hundreds of pounds.

Using the alias Antonio Mendez, he 
advertised bodyguard courses claiming participants would be guaranteed 
security work in Iraq.

Dozens paid a registration fee of £250, believing they would get their Security Industry Authority licence and a job.

Islam was given a suspended prison 
sentence. That year he was also accused of running a modelling scam in 
Dublin said to have netted £750,000.

Islam then returned to Bangor in 
Northern Ireland, where he grew up, and embarked on a failed venture 
that left youth clubs and sports clubs out of pocket.

In 2011 he was 
jailed for eight months for conning 26 photography students out of £150 
each. In prison he underwent a dramatic transformation.

On his release 
he appeared with a shaven head, long beard, bulging muscles and tattoos.

Answering to the name Ashraf Islam, he said he had undergone a 
religious conversion from ‘non-practising Christian to part-practising 
Muslim’.

But he added that he only selected the parts of Islam he liked.

Killed: Drummer Lee Rigby died when he was attacked in a street in Woolwich, London, last month

Target: Harry is thought to be a high profile Taliban target because of his service in Afghanistan and an interview he gave where he said he had killed Taliban insurgents in active duty
