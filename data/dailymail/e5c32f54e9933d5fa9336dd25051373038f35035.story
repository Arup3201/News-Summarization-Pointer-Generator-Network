Ashwell Prince has insisted he does not consider Andrew Gale’s curse-laden tirade against him during the recent Roses match to have been racist.

Gale, the Yorkshire captain, is alleged to have told Lancashire’s Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country, you Kolpak f*****’ – a reference to the South African’s status as a non-overseas player – and has since been charged with using racist language by the ECB.

But Prince, who denied provoking the altercation on the third evening of the match earlier this month, said he was offended only at the manner in which Gale spoke to him. He added that Gale was reported to the ECB by the umpires – and not by him.

Prince’s comments – which were made in answer to a question about whether he considered ‘Kolpak’ to be a term of racial abuse – will be welcomed by Yorkshire, who have stood by their captain following the incident.

Prince said: ‘I took offence to the way he spoke to me, that’s the bottom line,’ Prince told Ballz Radio in South Africa. ‘The way the guy approached me and spoke to me – that’s what I took offence to. I didn’t stand there and think, “That may be a racial slur”.

‘What happened was the guy walked towards me and had a go at me and I defended myself. If the ECB feels there’s racial connotations to it, that’s up to them to do whatever they want to do. It’s gone all out of control at the moment.

‘People are calling me a cry baby, but at the end of the day I want to clear it up. I didn’t report this guy to the ECB, the umpires did.’

The newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain Gale
