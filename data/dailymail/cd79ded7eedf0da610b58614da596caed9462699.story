Two Taliban attackers, one driving a fuel tanker, killed at least 12 people in a twin suicide bomb attack near a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan today.

A militant on foot blew himself up, then a huge blast from a truck bomb destroyed much of a local bazaar near the military outpost in Wardak province's Sayedabad district.

Four Afghan police officers and eight civilians were among the dead. The 53 injured - some with 'serious' wounds - included two Nato troops and 10 policemen.

'The number of wounded is so high that it can hardly be counted,' said Wardak police spokesman Abdul Wali.

The bombings around dawn in the town about 40 miles from Kabul, served as a reminder that even after a decade of fighting, U.S. and foreign troops are still engaged in a war despite the start of a withdrawal of coalition forces.

One of the suicide bomber detonated a vest rigged with explosives outside a compound housing the district governor's office, while the other detonated the tanker bomb on a road separating the compound from the base.

'It was a very powerful explosion,' said provincial police chief Abdul Qayum Bakizai. 'It broke windows all over the area.'

'Most of the injuries are from broken glass from the windows of homes and shops. It was so powerful we couldn't find much of the truck.'

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, which he said was targeting the U.S. base.

Last year a bomb attack at the same base on the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., 77 American soldiers were injured and five Afghans killed.

In a separate incident today, Nato said two US soldiers were killed in eastern Ghazni province. It did not provide any further details about the deaths.
