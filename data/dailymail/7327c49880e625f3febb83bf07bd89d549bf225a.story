The captain of the Costa Concordia arranged to flee in a helicopter, abandoning passengers and crew, on the night of the shipwreck, his Moldovan lover has claimed.

The giant cruise ship hit rocks and sank off the Mediterranean island of Giglio on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people, in Italy's worst maritime catastrophe since the Second World War.

Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial for multiple manslaughter, dereliction of duty and abandoning ship, and faces up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty.

Domnica Cemortan, the dancer who was accused of distracting the captain on the night of the crash, made the revelation after giving her former lover an ultimatum of six days 'to tell the truth'.

But when he was unforthcoming the blonde former hostess claimed that she was part of a plan to leave the ship and those aboard to their fate.

She told Italian weekly Oggi that Schettino told her to follow him up to the deck. She said: 'We went up on bridge 11. Schettino has said that he was going to look at the condition of the ship, but really we were there to wait for a helicopter to take us away.'

She claimed: 'While on board hell was unleashed, and dozens of people lost their lives, a quick and painless exit had been arranged for the privileged few.'

The Moldovan dancer, who has admitted having an affair with Schettino, 52, issued an ultimatum to her former lover, last week on her Facebook.

She wrote on September 23: 'Francesco Schettino I give you six days to tell the truth about what happened immediately after you gave the command to abandon ship. Just six days!'

In the interview she said did not understand why he had told her to accompany him to deck 11 to inspect the ship, rather than one of his colleagues. But when they reached the top she began to get a better idea.

'The commander looked impatient, kept looking around, as if waiting for something. At one point he said, "But here nobody can see us."'

 'Godlike': Last year, Miss Cemortan told how skipper Schettino, pictured returning to the Giglio harbour in February, was 'like a god on the ship'

It was obvious that they were waiting for a helicopter she said, adding: 'Later I asked him if he interrupted a helicopter was coming, but he said that the plans had changed and we had to go back down to the lower decks.'

Last year, Miss Cemortan told how skipper Schettino was 'like a god on the ship'.

She first met him while working as a translator for Russian passengers on the Concordia. But they soon began an affair. 'It started during my second week on board,' she told Italian gossip magazine Oggi.

She would sneak into the captain’s cabin at the end of her shift, usually in the early hours of the morning.

'There weren’t many people around at that time. Nearly everyone was asleep. You could take a bit more of a risk. I kept the affair secret in order to protect myself, as well as the captain.'

A month later she returned to the ship as his personal guest. On the night of the shipwreck Miss Cemortan had dinner with the captain and was then invited up onto the bridge to see the Concordia pass close to Giglio in an ill-fated 'salute' to the island. Minutes later the ship hit rocks.
