A policewoman was caught on tape during a harrowing 911 call as she described the moment she shot and killed her ex-boyfriend after he broke into her home.

Officer Sara Berkey, 30, from Ohio was audibly distressed as she told a dispatcher that she had shot her ex-boyfriend Adam Jovicic, 29, of Cuyahoga Falls, at her Hiwood Avenue home.

Berkey said: 'Hurry, hurry, my boyfriend just broke in and was beating me up and I shot him.'

Jovicic was taken to Akron City Hospital, where he died at about 5 a.m. Thursday from two gunshot wounds to the abdomen, according to the Summit County Medical Examiner. 

Investigators described the incident  as a home invasion case after Berkey called 911 and left the phone on.

Throughout the seven-minute recording, obtained by the Northeast Ohio Media Group voices can be heard in the background.

Berkey screams throughout the call. She can be heard yelling: 'I'm sorry' and 'No, please' throughout the recording.

Meanwhile, a man's voice can be heard asking the woman if she wants to die and says 'I have nothing to live for.' 

Other parts of the recording are inaudible. 

Berkey was knocked unconscious and suffered other minor injuries, according to a Munroe Falls police report obtained by Cleveland.com

Jovicic, a former corrections officer at the Summit County Juvenile Detention Facility was likely drunk when he broke into her home, according to investigators.

But reports suggested that officers were in the driveway when the shots were fired and Berkey can be heard later talking to them. 

Berkey, an officer since 2008 works in Kent city schools but has been placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated. 

She had an exemplary work record, according to her personnel file with several commendations from superiors for work she performed as a patrol officer.

She had only just taken on a new position as the school resource officer at Kent Roosevelt High School.

Munroe Falls Mayor Frank Larson  asked the Summit County Prosecutors Office to review their investigation.

The prosecutors will decide whether Berkey will face criminal charges. However, Larson believes that she acted appropriately.

He said: 'She did what she had to do. Everyone has a right to defend themselves. No one has a right to attack another person. You can only imagine what she's going through.'
