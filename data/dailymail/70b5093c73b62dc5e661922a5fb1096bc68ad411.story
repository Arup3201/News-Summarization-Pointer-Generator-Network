Ezequiel Lavezzi has posted a picture of himself with some of his team-mates on his official Instagram account, as Argentina linked up ahead of their international friendlies with El Salvador and Ecuador. 

The PSG winger is included in the national squad for the first time since the World Cup final against Germany in Rio de Janiero last July.  

Argentina play El Salvador on Saturday at FedEx Field in Washington, and then face Ecuador at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey three days later.

Lavezzi has made 37 appearances for his country since making his debut in 2007, scoring four goals

Lavezzi is joined in the squad by forwards Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain. Despite struggling to adapt to English football, Manchester United's Angel di Maria is also included.

There was no room, however, for Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis, who was a regular starter for Argentina during their World Cup campaign. 

The friendly matches against El Salvador and Ecuador come as part of preparation for June's Copa America in Chilie, where Argentina will take on holders Uruguay, Paraguay and Jamaica in Group B when the tournament kicks off.
