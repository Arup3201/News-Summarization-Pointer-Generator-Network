These celestial snaps are designed to show Dorset in the best possible light.

Taken by one amateur star-gazer, they reveal a darker side of the southern English county that is rarely seen by the outside world.

With shooting stars swirling in the sky, city lights gleaming into the heavens and even a space station shooting through the Milky Way, they capture the night sky in all its glory.

And with the dramatic astral motifs acting as backdrop to a variety of iconic natural and man-made landmarks, they follow in the footsteps of countless artists who have used their art to explore the striking relationship between the heavens and earth.

They were taken by Stephen Banks, 23, who used long exposures and admirable patience to create the incredible shots.

They include some of the county’s most iconic locations including the lighthouse at Portland Bill and the Hardy Monument, which commemorates the Dorset Vice-Admiral.

Stephen wanted to launch a collaborative project this summer, but the weather was so bad he decided to take all these photographs himself.

When conditions looked right, he set off to remote areas where there is little light pollution and sat for hours under the night sky pointing his camera upwards.

Talented: Laser show on Weymouth beach. The pictures were taken by amateur photographer Stephen Banks

For most of his pitcures he took dozens of long exposure snaps and then later merged and layered them to create one single image using the computer software Photoshop.

One shot even shows the International Space Station as a streak of light moving in its orbit around the earth.

Stephen, who works for a PR company in Bridport, Dorset, taught himself the techniques used to produce the magical photos by reading his camera manual.

Other places in his collection include a sculpture near Dorchester and Weymouth during an Olympic laser display.

Collaboration: West Milton village in Dorset. Stephen took the pictures as part of his Dorset by Night project, which he wants others to contribute to

Stephen, who wants others to contribute to the 'Dorset by Night' project, said: 'Last year I did a similar project based just on Bridport where I live.

'This year I decided to begin a collaborative project based on the Bridport one, but taking in more of Dorset.

'Unfortunately the weather has been so bad that I didn’t have much time to encourage others because when the sky was clear I went out.

'Some I took on long exposures of 30 seconds, which is the longest my camera will allow.

View over the Olympic sailing venue from Portland in Dorset. Vincent Van Gogh once wrote, 'looking to the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map. 'Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?'

'And some are compiled from a number of exposures and that’s what makes the stars look like they are moving across the sky.

'I particularly like the one of the Hardy Monument. Dorset is a good county for this type of photography because there is not much light pollution.

'There is also one of the International Space Station appearing to cross in front of the Milky Way.

'I’d love to collect other photos from different photographers.'

Star-gazing has long infatuated people, including Vincent Van Gogh, who wrote: 'Looking to the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map.

'Why, I ask myself, shouldn’t the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?'

The Dorset by Night project is available to see on social media.
