Switzerland progressed to the last 16 of the World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory over Honduras courtesy of an exquisite hat-trick from Xhedran Shaqiri.

The Bayern Munich playmaker fired home a brilliant curling opener to set Ottmar Hitzfeld's side on their way before adding to his tally on the half-hour mark following a neat one-two with Josip Drmic.

Shaqiri completed the hat-trick by slotting home Drmic's square ball with twenty minutes to go.

Switzerland will now face Lionel Messi's Argentina in the next round.

Switzerland are through to the last 16... and will face Lionel Messi's Argentina!

Following Ecuador's goalless draw with France, the Swiss progress to the next round on six points with the South Americans finishing third on four points.

Honduras finish the tournament without a single point to their name.

That game will forever be remembered for Shaqiri's three goals - what a player!

Hat-trick hero Shaqiri is replaced by former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Blerim Dzemaili.

What a sublime performance from the Swiss playmaker.

I can see why Liverpool like Shaqiri. His reading of the game is brilliant and he can obviously finish, too. Might have added a bit to his price tag, though.

Switzerland's deadly duo of Drmic and Shaqiri celebrate

Switzerland: Michael Lang comes on for Granit Xhaka

Honduras: Oscar Garcia is replaced by Andy Najar

Josip Drmic - who looks a real handful and will join Bayer Leverkusen this summer despite reported interest from Arsenal - is replaced by Haris Seferovic.

Shaqiri grabs his hat-trick and Switzerland are out of sight!

Super play by the Swiss - Josip Drmic totally exploited the space afforded to him on the left and charged forward before beating his man and laying the ball off to Shaqiri who stroked the ball into the net.

Jerry Palacios picks up the first booking of the evening - obviously his younger brother Wilson takes after him.

Jerry Palacios is bundled over in the box by Djourou but referee Nestor Pitana waves play on.

A definite penalty and the Hondurans are right to feel aggrieved. 

Exactly play by Rodriguez as he covers for the keeper and nips the ball off the line after Bengtson had rounded Diego Benaglio in the Swiss net.

Honduras frontman Bengtson raced into the box and looked likely to get on the end of a teasing ball but bizarrely attempted to score with his head despite the fact the ball was barely off the ground!

Had he stayed on his feet the New England Revolution forward would have surely found the back of the net.

...and Honduras make their second change of the evening as Roger Espinoza is replaced by Marvin Chavez.

Switzerland lead Honduras at the interval and it's fair to say that first-half was very much the 'Shaqiri Show'.

Here's some brilliant snaps of Shaqiri's opener...

So, Switzerland lead 2-0 and it's fair to say the first-half has very much been the 'Shaqiri Show'.

Here's some brilliant snaps of the playmaker scoring his opener...

Costly, Honduras' fourth all-time top goalscorer, has looked in some discomfort for a while now and has been forced off through injury.

Jerry Palacios, Wilson's older brother, comes on in Costly's place to earn his 25th cap.

Sportsmail reported last week that Liverpool were interested in Shaqiri after losing interest in Southampton's Adam Lallana.

Brilliant again from Shaqiri. And once again I'm not convinced by Victor Bernardez's defending there.

Looking good for Switzerland so far. This could be a hammering unless Honduras find a way of holding possession. 

Shaqiri doubles his own tally to extend Switzerland's lead.

Great movement by the playmaker as he latched on to Josip Drmic's through ball and found himself one-on-one with Valladares.

The Bayern Munich man then kept a cool head to slot the ball into the corner of the net.

So good. Really well-worked goal. Made it look easy.

Switzerland have been slightly under-rated during this summer's tournament.

As well the experience and know-how of Hitzfeld, the Swiss have an abundance of talent among their ranks.

Shaqiri, Gokhan Inler, Stephane Lichtsteiner, Valon Behrami, Ricardo Rodriguez, Granit Xhaka... a host of stars used to playing for top clubs in Europe's main leagues.

The ball falls to Brayan Beckeles in the area after Granit Xhaka failed to properly head clear a free-kick but the Honduras full-back can only volley wide on the turn.

After six years in charge of Switzerland, Ottmar Hitzfeld is set to retire following the World Cup.

The German has won 19 club trophies during spells with Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Grasshoppers and Aarau.

Let's hope the Swiss progress so that Hitzfeld can go out on a high.

The last time these sides met it was 0-0. Typical of this World Cup, this game has already given us more. Belter of a goal.

What a stunning strike from Xhedran Shaqiri.

The Bayern Munich midfielder sends a curling effort into the top right hand corner to give the Swiss the lead.

Must be said, however, Noel Valladares should have perhaps done better - didn't even dive; just made a lackluster jump for it and watched it sail in.

Huge early chance for Switzerland. Mehmedi broke down the left after a weak challenge from Wilson Palacios - what a poor World Cup he's had - and Drmic shoots straight at Valladares.

Maynor Figueroa, Roger Espinoza and Wilson Palacios - who all played for Wigan, amongst others, in the Premier Leag - will be looking to guide Honduras to their first-ever Wrld Cup victory.

Meanwhile former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou starts at the back for Switzerland while ex-West Ham man Valon Behrami plays in midfield.

The Swiss, usually so sound at the back having conceded just six goals in qualification, conceded five against France in their last matc as they lost 5-2.

However, having claimed a dramatic late win in their first World Cup game against Ecuador, the Swiss can go through with a draw providing the South Americans lose to the French.

This will be the second ever meeting between these sides.

The previous match played out involving these teams came in the 2010 FIFA World Cup; it ended 0-0 and it was also the last group game for both sides.

Honduras have never won against European opposition at a World Cup (D3 L3).

Honduras have failed to score in their last 4 games against European team at World Cup.

Switzerland have never lost against a CONCACAF team at World Cup (W1 D2).

Benaglio, Lichtsteiner, Inler, Xhaka, Behrami, Rodriguez, Mehmedi, Drmic, Djourou, Schaer, Shaqiri.

Valladares, Figueroa, Bernardez, J Garcia, W Palacios, Bengtson, Costly, B Garcia, Espinoza, Claros, Beckeles.

Both sides still have a chance of progressing to the last 16.

However, Honduras, currently bottom of the group on zero points, need a win and hope Ecuador lose against France - goal difference will also come into play...
