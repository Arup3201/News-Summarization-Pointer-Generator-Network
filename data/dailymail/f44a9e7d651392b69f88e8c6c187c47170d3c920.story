Miss New York Kira Kazantsev was named the new Miss America on Sunday night, marking the third year in a row that a contestant from her state has walked away with the crown in the nationally televised pageant.

Kazantsev received the crown at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall from outgoing Miss America - and Miss New York - Nina Davuluri.

For her talent performance, Kazantsev sang Pharrell Williams' Happy while sitting cross-legged on the stage and banging a red plastic cup on the floor.

Spelling mistake: Twitter was soon awash with people pointing out  the misspelling of Pride and Prejudice author Austen in a caption during Kazantsev's talent performance 

Her win came despite an embarrassing spelling mistake that appeared on screen during her talent performance. As Kazantsev sang her heart out, information about her interests popped up on screen - including that she loves anything Jane Austin (sic). 

Twitter was soon awash with people pointing out the misspelling of Pride and Prejudice author Austen.

Many on social media were critical of Kazantsev's performance, but she said she was inspired by the 2012 movie Pitch Perfect in which Anna Kendrick's character auditions for an a capella group by performing rhythmically with a cup. 

Kazantsev also said she did it to show future contestants they can win the Miss America pageant by performing whatever talent routine they like, regardless of what others think of it.

'The reason why I chose to do that talent is I wanted every single little girl in America to be able to see that you can do that talent - you can do whatever talent you want on national television - even with a red cup - and still be Miss America and have the time of your life,' Kazantsev said. 

'I literally in that minute and 30 seconds had the most fun I've ever had, and that's because I stayed true to myself and I did what I wanted to do for my talent, no matter what everybody else told me, and it paid off. I'm very happy about it.'

Kazantsev, who named combating sexual assault in the military as the issue about which she would want female U.S. Senators to press their male counterparts, won a $50,000 scholarship with which she plans to attend law school.

She also plans to speak out against domestic violence during her yearlong resign as Miss America.

Her victory marked the third year in a row that a contestant from her state has walked away with the crown in the nationally televised pageant. Kazantsev received the crown at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall from outgoing Miss America — and Miss New York — Nina Davuluri

Kazantsev will begin a schedule this week that will see her travel 20,000 miles a month.

Miss North Dakota, Jacky Arness was chosen by her peers as Miss Congeniality.

The pageant shone a positive light on the struggling seaside gambling resort, which has been in the national news for all the wrong reasons lately: a rash of casino closings, thousands of unemployed workers, and a domestic violence case involving a former NFL star.

For three hours Sunday night, America got a different look at Atlantic City. The Miss America pageant presented an upbeat view of the city where it began in 1921.

It featured iconic Atlantic City visuals including its beach, Boardwalk, the Steel Pier, Black Fish Pier near Brigantine, and the Atlantic City Beach Patrol station. 

'Atlantic City is facing a challenging economic climate and our hearts go out to all of those who have lost their jobs,' said Sam Haskell III, CEO of the Miss America organization.

'We hope that our Miss America telecast... will generate great interest for Atlantic City on a national scale as we showcase their beautiful beaches and Boardwalk.' 

There has been no shortage of compelling story lines leading up to the selection of the next Miss America, including the way personal tragedy has shaped the public service platforms of several contestants.

The brother of Miss Wisconsin Raeanna Johnson killed himself after a secret addiction to methamphetamine. Her platform was the impact of substance abuse on the family.

The father of Miss Kansas Amanda Sasek killed himself when she was 17. Her platform was helping people find their strengths. 

Miss Delaware Brittany Lewis is still waiting for an arrest to be made in the 2010 slaying of her sister. Her platform is combating domestic violence.

Miss Idaho Sierra Sandison proudly displayed her insulin pump when she graced the stage during the bikini round. The 20-year-old was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes two years ago. 

Sandison didn't progress past the final 15 round, but wrote on Instagram that she was proud of her performance.  

'Instead of feeling panicked as I expected, I am completely at peace,' she wrote. 'I did my best. I got to show my pump on the Miss America stage.'

There was drama and even some low-brow comedy leading up to the finale. Miss Rhode Island, Ivy DePew, collapsed onstage during the first night of preliminary competition, but made it back the next night after two trips to the hospital for dehydration.

An incident that generated much amusement among viewers was when cameras caught Miss Nebraska Megan Swanson opening her legs a bit too widely and accidentally showing the world way too much of herself.

The embarrassing incident happened as host Chris Harrison was previewed the evening wear phase of the competition and the hashtag #MissNebraska immediately started trending. 

And supermodel and business mogul Kathy Ireland took the stage to burp on command on a dare from pageant host Dena Blizzard on the second night.
