A brother and sister have died in an apparent murder-suicide at an upmarket hotel in Puerto Rico.

Kimberly Katherine Radcliffe, 28, was shot and killed by her brother 32-year-old Thomas Brian Radcliffe. The siblings were from Bonita Springs, Florida, according to Police Captain Diana Crispin. 

The two were found on Sunday in the upscale San Juan Water Beach Club Hotel in the Isla Verde tourist district.

Authorities said today that the 
incident was still under investigation but believed that Thomas 
Radcliffe shot his sister before turning the gun on himself.

They had apparently been on vacation in the U.S. island territory for about a week. No motive has been released.

Miss
Radcliffe is believed to have recently ended a relationship and had 
been given money by her father so that she and her brother could travel,
local paper El Neuvo Dia reported. They had visited Disney World in 
Orlando, Florida before traveling to Puerto Rico.

A
number of vodka bottles were found in the room and the siblings were 
believed to have been intoxicated at the time of the murder-suicide. 

The Water Beach Club Hotel is located in the historic center of San Juan and costs around $230 a night for a double room.
