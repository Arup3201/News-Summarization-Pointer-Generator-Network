A glamorous TV presenter with close family ties to Vladimir Putin claims well-to-do young Russians are desperately fleeing the country due to his authoritarian policies.

Ksenia Sobchak, who has known the Russian president since she was a child, said growing numbers of people are leaving Moscow, seeking citizenship, residency or visas for western countries. 

Ms Sobchak's father, Anatoly Sobchak, was a political mentor to Putin and introduced the ex-KGB officer into the world of politics.  

Ksenia Sobchak, daughter of Vladimir Putin's mentor Anatoly Sochak said many of her friends were actively trying to flee Moscow because of the Russian President's hardline regime and the economic slump

Sanctions imposed by the West over the Kremlin leader's annexation of Crimea and military threats to Ukraine have led to major economic turmoil with the rouble plunging to its lowest-ever level, slashing the savings of many people.

Ms Sobchak said: 'This is the main society talk in good restaurants in Moscow. It is either getting citizenship, or residence permits, or the like.'

She said she would join new anti-Putin protests even though she is 'scared' of being sent to prison.  

'My friends, all they are talking about is visas.'

She said: 'They keep sending me these messages, like "Ksenia, there is Bulgarian citizenship", "nine other options open until the end of November" or "I got mine in the Czech republic", or "I got mine somewhere else".'

Ms Sobchak is the daughter of Putin's mentor Anatoly Sobchak, former mayor of St Petersburg, who gave the strongman his first political post after he quit as a KGB spy when the Soviet Union collapsed. Earlier he taught law to Putin at Leningrad State University.

Putin was so close to the family that earlier it was widely thought he was godfather to Ms Sobchak, though this is denied.

Ironically, in 1997, Putin helped Anatoly Sobchak flee Russia to Paris when he faced a criminal investigation.

The 33-year-old celebrity said in an interview with Echo Moscow radio that she had 'nowhere to run' and would stay in Russia, unlike many of her friends.

Her comments came as new statistics show an alarming surge of Russians leaving their country with the highest ever figure of 203,000 in first eight months of the year. Many believe it is an underestimate.

Many of those deserting Russia are the wealthy seeking to preserve their fortunes from the boom years, but also include 'qualified specialists' in management, technology and science, who are vital for the economy.

Capital flight - sending money abroad - is expected to hit a staggering £60 billion this year further crippling the Russian economy.

In a blistering critique of her father's protege, she criticised the increasing personality cult around Putin, arguing it was driving Russia to ruin.

'Our passion for relying on big personalities is what - sadly - is killing us,' she said.

Ms Sobchak - who also owns a magazine and a restaurant - said she is ready to join new street protests against Putin, even though state TV channels boycotted her after she took part in earlier demonstrations.

She also faced a probe of her finances.

'I can lose my magazine, my restaurant, I'm prepared to take these risks,' she said.

'I won't be going to set cars on fire with you, and I am not ready to go to jail for my beliefs.

'I am ready to lose my job, money, my social status, but there is a bit of an internal borderline. Mine is that I am not ready to go to jail.'

She admitted this could be seen as 'my weakness, cowardice'.

She warned: 'In every normal Western country, any person who is not prepared to go to jail can be politically active and even think about a political career.

'In our country everything is too tough. In other words if you are ready to be jailed, to be like Mandela, then you can claim a right to become the next president.

'And if you are not ready, then don't even try.

'This is why I am not doing it, and I honestly say I am not ready to experience a Russian jail even for my beliefs that are important for me. I am scared.'

She alleged Putin has 'so much money' that he is no longer interested in 'building another house in Crimea or getting another yacht'.

She did not say where the alleged money came from. Last year his official salary was around £65,000, a drop in the ocean compared with oligarchs who have made fortunes in his presidency.

The Kremlin has denied claims that Putin is once of the world's richest men.

He thinks of himself as a 'big patriot' and he seized Crimea because he believed the West 'let him down' by meddling in his sphere of influence in the former USSR, added Ms Sobchak.
