America's famous Smithsonian Institution, home to the original star-spangled banner and Neil Armstrong's spacesuit, hopes to set up a British outpost - but it will not share many of its most famous artefacts.

It will be the world's biggest museum's first foreign branch and is proposed for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.

Entry to the new £33million gallery, proposed on the site of the London 2012 water polo arena and due to open in 2021, would be free like the majority of the capital's museums.

But it appears many of the Smithsonian's most celebrated exhibits in Washington, which also includes the Wright brothers' Flyer and Thomas Edison's first light bulb, would not come to the UK. 

London outpost: America's Smithsonian Institution, the world's biggest museum, is to open a new home abroad in the Olympic Park, which will also bring in a host of other new projects

Star attraction: This flag raised when America defeated Britain in 1812 is one of the Smithsonian's most famous artefacts - but it is too fragile to travel to Britain  

The 'iconic' flag raise to celebrate Britain's defeat in America in 1812, which inspired the American national anthem, is considered 'too fragile'.

A decision has not been made on Dorothy's ruby slippers from 'The Wizard of Oz,' the Apollo space capsule that carried the first moon landers or art recovered when the British set fire to the White House. 

But the proposed 40,000-square-foot Smithsonian gallery would feature permanent and rotating exhibits from Smithsonian sites including the National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of American History and National Museum of Natural History and various art galleries. 

The Louvre, The Guggenheim, the British Museum, the Tate Gallery and The Hermitage are other major museums also to have expanded globally.

Smithsonian Acting Secretary Al Horvath said: 'We envision this as being a Smithsonian facility that really allows us to show the breadth and depth of everything that we do. 

'So it won't be specifically focused on one topic but will allow us to run the gamut of things that we do - history, science, art, culture and the like'.

History: Neil Armstrong's spacesuit worn on the moon and Louis Armstrong's first cornet is among 137million items held by the museum 

First flight: The Wright brothers' Flyer is also held. Orville Wright is shown here at the controls watched by his brother Wilbur at Kitty Hawk in 1903

John McCarter, chairman of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, added: 'It's a great opportunity for us to get started and really to tell America's story.'

It will be funded by donations raised by Mayor of London Boris Johnson and entrance fees for special exhibitions.

The Washington Smithsonian, which is the world's largest museum, was set up in 1846 using money from James Smithson, a British scientist who never went to the Unites States.

From geologic features such as Plymouth Rock to undeniable antique treasures including Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat, the Smithsonian has 137million artefacts across 19 museums.

The London branch would be at the heart of the 'Olympicopolis' cultural centre that would open in 2021. 

New location: The Smithsonian, pictured in Washington, will share its site with the V&A, and will be free like most of London's museums

The V&A, Sadler's Wells and London College of Fashion would share the site with the new Smithsonian.

Around it will be West Ham's new home in the Olympic Stadium, an international broadcast centre taken over by BT and a new University College London Campus.

Boris Johnson said: 'It would be a massive coup to attract the Smithsonian Institution to east London.

'It will be a  bright shining star in a constellation of heavenly bodies'.
