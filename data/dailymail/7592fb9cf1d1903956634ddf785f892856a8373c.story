John Terry claimed it was the only remaining question about the title credentials of this Chelsea team: Could they win without Diego Costa?

At Crystal Palace came an emphatic response. ‘We are strong as anyone and hungry to win the league,’ said Terry. Like Jose Mourinho, Chelsea’s captain cherishes those victories which demand character as well as class.

‘We showed we have strength in depth by winning without Costa,’ Terry added. ‘That was the one question mark about us. He’s done so well people wondered, if he was out, who could come in and do it?

It seems that the Premier League’s penchant for own goals this weekend was contagious. Aleksander Rajcevic scored two own goals to consign NK Maribor, who visit Chelsea tomorrow, to a 2-1 home defeat byCelje in the Slovenian First League.

The result meant Maribor slipped to third, six points behind leaders NK Domzale.

‘Loic Remy was very sharp and has looked it in training. We have Didier Drogba and his qualities. The guys are showing maturity away from home. That’s what is needed from us this year.’

With a five-point lead at the top and only two points dropped from eight games, Chelsea must ride out this Costa-less spell if they are to mount a genuine title challenge.

It might be different if the Spain striker is ruled out long-term but at the moment it is a question of managing his injured hamstrings, in the hope he will be able to play without fear of a twang.

Mourinho has ruled Costa out of the game against Maribor in the Champions League on Tuesday and gives him ‘very little chance’ of starting at Manchester United on Sunday. Like Terry, he was quick to seize on the psychological meaning of the result.

‘There is a general feeling our team has improved because of Diego and Fabregas,’ said Mourinho. ‘And it’s right. But, at the same time, this team had big improvement. It was good to have an important victory without the player who has scored so many goals and given us so many points.’

Chelsea had 72 per cent possession against Palace, their highest figure this season and the fifth highest in the Premier League. 

When they lost at Selhurst Park in March, Mourinho accused his team of lacking ‘balls’, a word he refused to say on camera, so he scribbled it on a reporter’s notepad. After the win on Saturday, he took a pad and grinned as he wrote ‘big balls’.

‘It’s not just about being brave, fighting a lot or coping with a physical match,’ he said. ‘This was about imposing our game. From minute one, we pass and circulate the ball. Control and stability, I like that.’

Oscar and Cesc Fabregas scored either side of red cards for Cesar Azpilicueta, who will miss games against Manchester United, Shrewsbury (in the Capital One Cup) and QPR, and Damien Delaney, now absent for Saturday’s trip to West Bromwich. Fraizer Campbell pulled one back in stoppage-time.

Palace boss Neil Warnock, who was in his office with Mourinho before kick-off, watching Manchester City beat Spurs, complained about Chelsea players intimidating referee Craig Pawson. ‘Four or five surrounded him,’ Warnock said. ‘I think they influenced things. It’s not an even platform.’

Jose Mourinho called Cesc Fabregas’ goal ‘scandalous’. Here’s why.

17 Passes involved in the build-up that swept from end to end.

8 Players involved in the move. Only Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois did not touch it and Cesar Azpilicueta had been sent off.

9 Total touches by Fabregas.

Chelsea’s sublime goals were underpinned by a ruthlessness to rekindle memories of the first team Mourinho built at Stamford Bridge, a decade ago. ‘We are reaching that level,’ Mourinho agreed.

Others in the camp detect it, too, including Terry, who captained the club for the 500th time.

There have been plenty of scrapes in the 12 years since he took the armband, but it was hard to fault his performance at Selhurst Park.

‘To be captain after all these years is a great achievement,’ said Terry.

‘There will be a day when I have to hand it someone else and hang up the boots. But I’m feeling great, playing well in a very good side and we’re aiming for trophies.’

Terry admits the only question mark over Chelsea had been their capability of winning without Diego Costa

VIDEO Mourinho pleased with team evolution

'Craig Pawson clearly upset Neil Warnock but to be fair to him, pretty much every referee does that.

'It started when Pawson, in keeping with current trends, chose not to caution Damien Delaney for his first tackle, which was a poor one.

'To be consistent he let John Terry escape with a similarly poor tackle because it was also his first.

'There can be no argument about Cesar Azpilicueta’s red card for a shocking tackle on Mile Jedinak, nor the first of Delaney’s yellow cards — he had been given his chance.

'His silly challenge on Loic Remy then gave the Chelsea players the chance to pressurise the inexperienced Pawson into levelling things up to 10 men a side, which he duly did.'
