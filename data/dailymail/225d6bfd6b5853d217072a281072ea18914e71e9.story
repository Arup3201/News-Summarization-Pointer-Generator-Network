If you’re a fan of passion fruit, you’ll be even more passionate about this.

It’s the ‘sunshine passion fruit’ – a yellow version that’s twice the size of its purple relative, and tastes much sweeter.

The fruit, named for its bright yellow skin, is being sold in Britain for the first time as part of a government-backed scheme to help Kenyan farmers.

They are available at Asda, where a pack of two costs £1.

The supermarket giant says they have seen a big increase in the sales of exotic fruits. Mango have risen by 40 per cent compared to last year, while pomegranates are up 30 per cent and persimmons are up 60 per cent.

Also known as grenadilla, passion fruit is native to South America and was first introduced to the UK in the 19th century.

Usually the size of an egg, the crunchy, slightly sour seeds inside are often used in desserts or salads, but the Kenyan variety, because of its sweeter seeds, can be eaten straight away.

The Kenyan passion fruit is grown by smallholder farmers with funding from the Department for International Development and it is hoped exports of the fruit will help boost local economies in rural Kenya.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: These new fruits are an excellent example of how leading British companies are joining the fight against global poverty. They taste pretty good too.  Making sure Kenyan farmers can sell their goods will create new jobs, boost incomes and ultimately help end their dependency on aid.’

A pack of two passion fruits costs £1 and is currently available in 69 stores, with plans to roll out to 113 later on.

Gemma Barlow, from Asda’s Fresh Produce team said: ‘We’re constantly looking for new and exciting products to bring into Asda and the ‘sunshine’ passion fruit brings a ray of sun to the family fruit bowl this autumn, and is sure to be a hit with exotic fruit fans.’
