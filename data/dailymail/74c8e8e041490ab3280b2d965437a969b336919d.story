The 2015 Miami Open kicked off on Monday, but some of tennis' finest found time to visit the Seaquarium before taking to the court, where they swam with dolphins in the 30 degree heat.

Among the group were Juan Martin Del Potro, American Sam Querrey, Feliciano Lopez, Sabine Lisicki and France's Alize Cornet.

The group posed in front of the dolphins, before jumping into the water themselves to interact with the sea creatures, a privilege that would usually cost $210 (£140) to the average visitor.

The tennis stars, most of whom will be in action at Crandon Park Tennis Center on Wednesday, kissed and swam with the dolphins at the venue in Key Biscayne, Florida.

Del Potro, who has been plagued by injuries, dropping to 616 in the world rankings, will kick off his Miami Open campaign on Thursday against Canadian Vasek Pospisil, while Sam Querrey - on home turf - will face Victor Estrella Burgos in his first round match.

On the women's side of the draw, Sabine Lisicki, fresh from her Indian Wells semi-final appearance, receives a bye in the first round and will face either Julia Georges or Jana Cepelova in the second round in Miami.

Some of the world's best will compete at the tournament, which runs until April 5 in Florida. Andy Murray will play, but faces a tough run as he is in the same half of the draw as Rafael Nadal.

The British No 1 is set to face Donald Young, who he recently beat in the Davis Cup, or Yen-Hsun Lu in his first match of the tournament.

Elsewhere, world No 1 Novak Djokovic will also compete, while on the Ladies side of the draw, top three seeds Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Simona Halep are all in action.

Feliciano Lopez will look to take a step closer to the top 10 in the world with a good performance in Miami
