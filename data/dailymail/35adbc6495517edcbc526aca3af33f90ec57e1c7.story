Bemused visitors to a small seaside town became movie extras - when a Bollywood film crew descended on their town.

Residents walking the decks of Saltburn Pier were thrust into the action as directors making a movie called 'Shaandaar' tried to set the scene on a typical day in Saltburn-By-The-Sea, North Yorkshire.

The Manchester-based production company caused a stir among passing locals as crowds gathered to get a glimpse of the film-making.

'I had to walk with my dog along the pier as the crew filmed the action.

'It will be something to look out for when the film is released, but I wouldn't say it was my 'big break' really.
