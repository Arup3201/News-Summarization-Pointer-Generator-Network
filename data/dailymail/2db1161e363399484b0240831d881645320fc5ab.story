Earlier this week Turkey withdrew its bid to stage the Ryder Cup in 2022, leaving five nations in the running ahead of inspection visits from tournament officials which will get under way this week. 

Ahmet Agaoglu, president of the Turkish Golf Federation, said: 'We have greatly enjoyed working on this project and assessing whether we would be in a position to launch a viable bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup.

 'Although we believe that Turkey is now an established golfing destination, with a collection of world-class courses, it has not proven possible to secure the necessary logistical arrangements in order to proceed and so we have reluctantly decided to withdraw from the process at this time.
