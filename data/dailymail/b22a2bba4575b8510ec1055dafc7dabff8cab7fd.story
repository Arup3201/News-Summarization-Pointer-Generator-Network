A cyclist is making his way more than 1,900 miles across Europe fuelled only by food he is able to rescue from bins along the way.

Baptiste Dubanchet set off from Paris, France, in April and is cycling all the way to the Polish capital, Warsaw, in a bid to raise awareness of how much food we waste.

The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill.

Along the way he has stayed with locals met online, who agreed to put him up for free, but he has refused any food - or even a beer - other than what has already been discarded.

When he's been unable to find a sofa to sleep on he's camped out in the open.

'The objective is to make this trip relying only from food destined to be thrown away, from hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets and markets, in order to denounce food waste,' he says on his website.

Campaigners in Britain have welcomed his project, pointing out that even as we throw away hundreds of thousands of tons of edible food, there are people who do not have enough to eat.

Mr Dubanchet chose to make the journey by bicycle to keep his carbon footprint as close to zero as possible. He set off on April 15 and last weekend he arrived in Konin, Poland, for the last leg of his journey.

Mr Dubanchet in the Netherlands: He said the idea came to him when he was travelling in the developing world

As he travelled throught Germany, he told a reporter for The Local that his first objective when arriving at a new town is to track down sources of food.

'I have to find food fast because after all the cycling I am tired and I need the energy,' he said. 'Is my stomach full or empty? That is the most important thing, not what I am eating.'

He has a sign written in each country's language to explain his project, but said many businesses have a policy of not giving anything away - even if it's to be thrown in the bin.

Some workers, he says, have even risked their jobs to help him out.

Mr Dubanchet said the idea came to him when he want travelling in Latin America and South East Asia after he graduated. He said the sight of so many people going hungry compelled him to do something to highlight how much food we waste in Europe.

He wrote on his blog: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable.

'I find some food thrown away just because the packaging is wet or damaged, whole bags of fruit in the bin because one of the fruit is bruised, yoghurts, cheese, or other products discarded because of irrelevant expiry dates.'

Epic journey: Mr Dubanchet has visited six countries on his trip across Europe, and not spent a penny on food

Mary McGrath, chief executive of British charity FoodCycle, which takes food destined for the bin, cooks it up and serves it to people at risk of food poverty, welcomed Mr Dubanchet's initiative.

She said: 'Baptiste has highlighted the unacceptable level of food waste that exists at all stages of the supply chain - from farm to fork.

'In the UK it is estimated that over 400,000 tonnes of food is thrown away at retail level yet over 4 million people are affected by food poverty.

'Food poverty and food waste shouldnâ€™t co-exist in the same communities but unfortunately they do.

'We should be doing everything possible to ensure that as much edible surplus food as possible is going to help people who are struggling to get by.'
