An elementary school teacher has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder after she ran over a grandmother while driving drunk.

Erica Kristine Flynn knocked down and killed Kathleen Searcy, 66, in Chandler, Arizona, at 10.30pm on December 27 while she was three times over the legal alcohol limit. 

The 30-year-old who taught the third grade at Frye Elementary School was reportedly driving at more than 75mph when she ran a red light and slammed into the victim's vehicle as she turned.

She was not wearing her seat belt at the time and smashed her head into the windshield on impact.

Deadly: According to police the third-grade teacher was driving at 75mph when she ran a red light and slammed into the victim's car. She was arrested and has now been charged with second-degree murder 

According to KPHO, Flynn did not apply the breaks before the crash and may have smoked marijuana. 

Flynn, who was only in her first year of teaching, was booked into county jail with a mugshot showing her with a black eye and cuts all over her face.

She appeared in court in a wheelchair with her arm still in a sling. She was in tears as a judge told the court she had no previous criminal history.

He said: 'You have no felonies, no misdemeanors, no juvenile record, not even a traffic offense that is showing up.'

The judge decided to release her on bail after she agreed to stay away from alcohol and not get behind the wheel of her car.

She will return to face the judge for a status update on January 15 and will have a preliminary hearing on January 22. 

Detective Seth Tyler of Chandler Police told Fox Phoenix 10: 'This was a completely avoidable traffic incident that happened and it happened because one individual decided to consume an exorbitant amount of alcohol and made the selfish decision to get into her car and drive.' 

A spokesman for the Chandler Unified School District told the station that Flynn would not be returning as a teacher after the holiday break.  

Charged: Flynn arrived for her first court appearance in a wheelchair and with her arm still in a sling. She cried when a judge reminded her that she had no criminal history 

Career: She was in her first year of teaching at Frye Elementary School in Chandler. School officials have said that after Flynn's arrest she told them she would not be returning
