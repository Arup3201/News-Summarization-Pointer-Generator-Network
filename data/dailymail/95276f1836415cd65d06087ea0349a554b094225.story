These daredevils needed a head for heights as they leaped from a 72ft-high bridge over a river in Kosovo as part of an annual high diving competition.

Some 27 divers took the plunge and entered the competition, leaping from the  Ura e Shenjte bridge over the river  Drini i Bardhe, close to the town ofÂ  Gjakova, earlier today.

Hundreds of spectators gathered on the river bank to watch as Sali Riza Grancina performed his winning dive, scooping the top prize which takes place every year on the outskirts of the town, around 62 miles from the Kosovan capital Pristina.
