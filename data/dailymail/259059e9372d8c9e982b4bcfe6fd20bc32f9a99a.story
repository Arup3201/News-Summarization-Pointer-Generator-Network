It's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether Manchester United are playing Champions League or Europa League football next season. 

Four of the Premier League's top six - Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - in their next fives games. Make-or-break for Louis van Gaal and his players.

Other than the home clash with relegation-threatened Aston Villa on April 4, Sunday's visit of Spurs would appear to be United's best hope of three points over the next month and a half. But recent results tell a different story.

Having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against Tottenham, United now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north London outfit.

Mauricio Pochettino's men battled to a 0-0 at White Hart Lane in December but Spurs have won their previous two visits to Old Trafford, ending a 23-year wait for victory with a 3-2 triumph in September 2012.

United had gone 26 games without defeat at home to Spurs in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a Jonny Evans own goal and strikes from Gareth Bale and Clint Dempsey gave Andre Villas-Boas' men a memorable win in Manchester.

And Tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen sealed a 2-1 victory for Tim Sherwood's side.

Two draws at White Hart Lane - 1-1 in January 2013 and 2-2 in December 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories, taking Spurs' unbeaten run to an impressive five games.

So impressive, in fact, that they are only the third team to manage such a run against United.

Liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002, winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at Old Trafford - and drawing once.

Blackburn Rovers also went five games unbeaten against the Red Devils between 2004 and 2006, winning at Old Trafford in September 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at Ewood Park.

Just three points behind United going into Sunday's game, Tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at Old Trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era.

Victory would mean Pochettino's side would be out of the Champions League places by goal difference only, something they will be confident of improving upon in upcoming games against Leicester, Burnley, Aston Villa and Newcastle.

And in  Harry Kane, the Premier League's hottest striker and Premier League Player of the Month for February, Spurs have a man capable of causing United's frail defence all sorts of problems.

Their games against in-form Liverpool, local rivals City and league leaders Chelsea will be extremely tough but Van Gaal should be just as wary of Tottenham.

After decades of domination, Spurs have quickly become United's bogey team.
