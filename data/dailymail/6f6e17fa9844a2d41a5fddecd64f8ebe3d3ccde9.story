Salford owner Marwan Koukash has hailed the impact made on the Super League club by Australia coach Tim Sheens.

The 64-year-old Sheens has spent the last fortnight acting in an advisory capacity with the Red Devils as Koukash looks to turn the struggling outfit into a team of champions.

Iestyn Harris' men have taken three points out of a possible four since the arrival of Sheens but Koukash believes his legacy will be there long after his return to Australia after next Friday's game at Castleford.

'We have all benefited from Tim being here,' Koukash told Press Association Sport. 'Everybody, from chief executive Martin Vickers to assistant coach Ian Watson, we have all gained from his experience.

'I have picked up a huge amount of ideas about what we are missing and what we can do to take the club forward.

'We've talked about the type of players we should be signing, especially when the marquee player allowance comes in.

'He is very passionate about the game and his knowledge is absolutely incredible. He has a vision for the sport for the next 10 years.'

Sheens, who has agreed a new 12-month contract with the Australia Rugby League to continue as national coach for a seventh season, will be in the stands on Sunday when Salford take on Wakefield.
