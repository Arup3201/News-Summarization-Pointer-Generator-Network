A couple in Boston are celebrating the arrival of their baby girl, who weighed more than 14lb when she was delivered on Tuesday.

Caroline Ruscak and her husband Bryan knew their baby was going to be large, but neither they, or their doctors, were expecting baby Carisa to be quite so big.

Her size brought gasps from the staff in the operating room of Massachusetts General Hospital, who say she is the biggest baby to be born at the hospital in a decade.

Record-breaker: Carisa is the biggest baby to born in Boston for a decade

'Everyone in the operating room was like, "Oh my God, look at the size of this baby! Letâ€™s get her on the scale. 
What does she weigh?" Nobody could believe it,' Mrs Ruscak said.

At 14lb 5oz, Carisa Ruscak is the biggest baby born at Massachusetts General Hospital in a decade, and second heaviest ever born there.

The record holder for the Boston hospital is a baby born In 2002, who weighed 14lb 80z.

The biggest surviving baby born in the U.S. is Sammisano Otuhiva, who weighed 16lb 1.8oz when he was born in California in August 2013.

The heaviest infant ever born in the U.S. was a 23lb 12oz newborn delivered in Ohio in 1877. Sadly the baby boy, who was 30in long, lived for only 11 hours. 

The record for the heaviest, healthy baby in the world was a boy born in Italy in 1955, who weighed 22lb 8oz.

By contrast, the lightest baby is Rumaisa Rahman, who weighed only 9.17oz when she was born in Illinois in September 2004. She is now a happy and healthy nine-year-old.

At 22in long and weighing in at 14lb 5oz, Carisa is about the size of six-month-old.

She was just a few ounces lighter that a super-size baby born at the hospital in 2002.

'We're bigger people in general. It just makes sense,' Mrs Ruscak told CBS Boston.

When Mrs Ruscak had a check up three weeks before her scheduled cesarean-section she was told her second child would be about 11lb 5oz.

The couple's two-year-old daughter, Claudia, had weighed 10lb 10oz so the parents weren't surprised, although Mrs Ruscak said she had been far more uncomfortable with the pregnancy.

'It validated me because I was in a lot of pain when I was pregnant, so to hear the size, it made sense,' the new mom said. 

She added 
that in the final month of her pregnancy she had got fed up with people 
stopping her in the street to ask if she was carrying twins.

Dr 
Jennifer Kickham, who helped with the delivery, said: 'We were expecting
 a big baby, but we weren't expecting one quite that big.'

'The baby came out screaming and crying and it was a beautiful delivery,' she said, adding that neither mom or baby had diabetes.

Mr Ruscak told WCVB: 'When she came out at 14 and a half pounds, I couldn't believe it. I took a picture of the scale just to document it because I couldn't believe how big she was.'

Carisa may be nearly twice the average 7.5lb weight of a newborn, but she is happy and healthy and due to go home with her parents on Friday.
