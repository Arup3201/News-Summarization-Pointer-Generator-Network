Police have revealed they know not only the cause of death of Hollywood movie executive Gavin Smith, but also why the man was killed.

Smith's body was found in a shallow grave in Palmdale, California, on October 26 by a group of hikers, and identified a few days later.

He had been missing for two and a half years, having last been seen on May 1, 2012.

Missing: 20 Century Fox executive Gavin Smith was last seen on May 1, 2012. After a year investigating his disappearance, police declared Smith dead and said it was a homicide case

Now, Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department has told ABC News there is evidence that Smith, who was missing before his body was found this week, was slain in his own black Mercedes.

At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with Chandrika Creech, whom he met in rehab.

Then, in March of last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech - the husband of Chandrinka and a convicted drug dealer currently serving time in prison.

And while police will not say if John Creech is a suspect, they did note that they were well aware of the affair between Smith and Chandrika and said that John reamins a person of interest.

'There’s potentially a lot more evidence for us to process, which could develop additional leads, which detectives will have to follow up on,' Dolson said. 

'We're very far along and we've made a lot of advancements in the investigation over the past couple of years.'

Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, were devastating to his wife Lisa and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin.

Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband.

'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.'

She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women.

Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills.

Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus.

She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family.

It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house.

Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress woman.

'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said.

She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.

Apr. 14, 2012: Gavin's 21-year-old son, Evan, takes to Twitter to express his frustration over a family situation. 'Thoughts and prayers out to my amazing Mom and bros plz,' the USC student writes. 'My dad decided to leave the family last nite. Real family sticks together.'
