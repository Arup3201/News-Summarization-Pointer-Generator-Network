Viva Forever! The Musical set to open at the Piccadilly Theatre on December 11

It's been four years since they reunited for their Return Of The Spice Girls tour.

And following months of speculation whether or not they would join forces again, all five members of the Spice Girls got together in London today to announce details of a West End musical based on their songs.

Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown and Geri Halliwell went back to where it all began - the St Pancras Hotel in London, where they filmed their Wannabe video in 1996.

Forever! launch at St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London

Just like the hotel, which has since been restored and is looking a lot better these days, few would disagree the girl group are also looking much improved from their '90s heyday.

The musical, entitled Viva Forever!, will tell the story of 'a beautiful, talented girl and her best friends who get swept up in the obsession of today's TV celebrity culture'.

The musical 'charts her journey into the world of overnight fame and its impact on her relationships with her mother and the friends she thought she'd have forever'.

Victoria, arguably the most successful financially since leaving the group, flew in specially from Los Angeles.

Looking more military than 'Posh', the mother-of-four, 38, wore a black dress and peep-toe knee-high boots.

However, while her former bandmates had wide smiles, Victoria kept her usual stony-faced demeanour.

Mel B, 37, who looked far from 'Scary' in
 a grey shift dress and spiked Christian Louboutin heels, had flown in 
from her new home in Australia via LA.

Geri, 39,
 and Emma, 36, were going for girlie looks in short dress and killer heels, 
with the ex-Ginger Spice appearing to be wearing the same Jimmy Choo 
strappy sandals worn by the Duchess of Cambridge recently, albeit in 
gold instead of silver.

Back to where it all began: The group famously filmed the video for their debut single Wannabe at the same hotel in 1996

Mel C, 38, appeared to have left her Sporty Spice persona firmly in the past with a floaty white Ane maxi dress, which has also been worn by Karen Gillan and Kylie Minogue.

The five women had joined forces to announce details of Viva Forever, a musical based on their songs and written by comedienne Jennifer Saunders and producer by Judy Craymer, the theatrical impresario behind the success of Mamma Mia!

Speaking at the press conference, Craymer hailed the group: 'I loved what the Spice Girls did for women's confidence. There's something very empowering about them.'

Saunders, who cameoed in their film Spice World, said: 'The second I knew this project was up for grabs I rang my agent and said I had to be involved.'

Viva Forever! is the latest 'jukebox 
musical' to hit the West End - that use original songs as a basis for an
 original storyline.

While 
Mamma Mia! (Abba), Thriller Live (Michael Jackson) and We Will Rock You 
(Queen), have been a huge success, other musicals such as Our House 
(Madness) have not been as popular.

In the run-up to today's announcement, all five Spice Girls have been hinting on their respective Twitter pages.

On Saturday, Victoria hinted: 'Big event next week, what should I wear??

'Excited to be travelling to London tomorrow!!! packing!!!!'

Mel B wrote this morning: 'Whoop whoop where my spice biatches at!!! Lovin ALL spice fans always!'

Time has been good to them: Mel C, Emma and Mel B all look gorgeous in their demure ensembles

Over the past few years, Mel B has often hinted of a possible reunion for the girl group, but it is yet to come to fruition.

However, Victoria was said to be against the idea because she is focused on her career as a fashion designer.

In March, Mel C dismissed speculation they would reunite for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert: 'Not true. It was an honour to be asked (for the Jubilee concert), but not everyone is comfortable about doing it so we have to respect each other’s feelings about that.'

While not directly addressing the 
Spice Girls reunion speculation, Beckham said this year: 'I was never 
going to be the best singer and it wasn’t my passion.'

The
 group's reunion today comes four years after their sell-out Return Of 
The Spice Girls world tour, which ended prematurely after they cancelled
 the gigs in South America, South Africa and Asia.

During
 their four years in the charts, they enjoyed nine No.1 singles and two 
No.1 albums in the UK, including one No.1 single and album in the U.S.

The musical is due to open at the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End on December 11.
