QPR striker Charlie Austin and Tottenham talisman Harry Kane are on the verge of a sensational call up for the England squad.

Austin, who has scored five times for Rangers this season, is being monitored by England head coach Roy Hodgson and his scouts.

The Rangers forward, who scored against Chelsea in the 2-1 defeat last weekend, narrowly missed out on a place in the squad for the game with Slovenia (November 15) and Scotland (November 18).

Kane scored Tottenham’s winner at Aston Villa at the weekend and has already scored 10 times this season.

Hodgson said: ‘I think Charlie Austin is doing very well at QPR an he’s a player we have our eyes on.

'Harry Kane, who again doesn’t necessarily get into the team as first name on the team sheet, is another one we have our eyes on.

‘So, I’d like to think there are others, Rickie Lambert’s not just  there because there’s no alternative. 

‘I believe he’s done a good job for me in the past, for the team in the past, but he understands that I can’t give him a lifetime guarantee that if he’s not playing enough football, not doing well then he won’t just lose his place in the Liverpool team, he’ll lose his place in the squad.’
