Doctors demanded last night that a new health helpline due to be introduced across most of England within days should be suspended, warning that lives could be at risk.

The British Medical Association wrote to the head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, urging him to delay Monday’s full national roll-out of the 111 service.

Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘We cannot sacrifice patient safety to meet a political deadline.’

Fears: The new 111 health helpline number will be rolled out nationwide from Monday but the BMA has written to the head of the NHS and asked him to suspend the service due to fears it will put patient safety at risk

Earlier this week the Mail reported fears about the state of the service, but by last night doctors and health unions were convinced it would be a ‘chaotic mess’.

Some patients using limited 111 pilot schemes are already waiting several hours for urgent medical advice, while others have been told to phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk to them.

A parent of a sick baby was told by a 111 worker: ‘I don’t know what to do.’

From Monday, the 111 line will replace NHS Direct and GP out-of-hours numbers across most of England.

Concerns: The BMA has warned NHS chief executive David Nicholson that the service is being 'run on the cheap' with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses

Patients who are not ill enough to need an ambulance will be told to ring the free number for medical advice round the clock.

But pilot schemes have thrown up a string of problems ranging from computer crashes to ambulances being sent out needlessly.

Dr Buckman said: ‘There have been 
widespread reports of patients being unable to get through to an 
operator or waiting hours before getting a call back with the health 
information they have requested.

In
some areas, such as Greater Manchester, NHS 111 effectively crashed 
because it was unable to cope with the number of calls it was receiving.

‘The
chaotic mess now afflicting NHS 111 is not only placing strain on other
already overstretched parts of the NHS, such as the ambulance service, 
but is potentially placing patients at risk.

‘If someone calls NHS 111 they need immediate, sound advice and not be faced with any form of delay.

When
patients rang the number in Greater Manchester this week they were 
played an automated message which told them to ring back the following 
day ‘‘when lines are less busy’’.’

In
Wiltshire, where the line was introduced earlier this month, call 
handlers have been sending ambulances to people with hiccups, sore 
throats and earache.

There are concerns that calls are 
being handled by staff with just ten days training who read out a series
of set questions from their computer.

Mess: Fears about the state of the service in trial areas have been reported, with some people kept waiting for hours. Doctors and health unions were convinced it would be a 'chaotic mess'

Dr John Hughes, a GP in Crumpsall, near Manchester, said: ‘I am extremely worried. Within less than 11 hours the service was in meltdown. Calls weren’t being answered for hours, patients were having to ring up 999 ambulances.

‘These are non-clinically trained people. They work their way through a computer system which directs them to the next question to ask.

‘This is an extremely slow system and in some areas the computers weren’t even working and they had to do it on paper.

Political decision: Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's GP committee, warned that patient safety should not be sacrificed to 'meet a political deadline'

‘It really can’t go live on Monday because patients’ lives will be at risk. I have had reports of a 90-year-old lady having to wait more than an hour and a half for an urgent call.’

NHS Direct was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning up in A&E.

On the whole it is deemed to have been a success although it has occasionally been overstretched during flu and norovirus outbreaks.

Now NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends.

They will be put through to a call 
centre worker who will decide if they need to go to A&E, a GP 
clinic, a chemist or can get by with over-the-phone advice.

The
operator can potentially send out an ambulance, put someone straight 
through to a nurse, book an out-of-hours GP appointment, or direct the 
caller to a pharmacist or dentist.

In
some areas of the country the new service will be run by private firms 
while in others it will be overseen by NHS ambulance services.

But
the BMA has also warned that the service is being ‘run on the cheap’ 
with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses.

While
nurses represented around 36 per cent of staff at NHS Direct, they only
comprise around 17 per cent of the NHS 111 workforce.

The
union Unison claims that 400 nurses who worked for NHS Direct have been
made redundant as there were not enough 111 jobs available.

Replacement: The new 111 service replaces NHS Direct, with patients who are not ill enough to need an ambulance told to ring for medical advice

Untrained: There are concerns that calls are being handled by staff with just ten days training who read out a series of set questions from their computer

Some regions are struggling to set up the new service and the NHS Direct 0845 4647 service will continue to be available to callers in these areas.

A spokesman for NHS England, the new body in charge of the health service, said: ‘The service has great potential to be a fast, efficient, all-round service that ensures patients get the right care for their needs.

‘This is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe, high quality service that patients and the public can trust.’
