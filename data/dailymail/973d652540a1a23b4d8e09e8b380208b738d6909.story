Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorneys are fighting to move his trial from Boston, saying a photo of a bartender shoveling snow from the finishing line last week shows there is still an 'unprecedented level of public feeling' about the event.

Lawyers for the bombing suspect filed a motion on Monday after federal prosecutors opposed earlier requests to move the trial from the city.

In the motion they included a photo of local bartender Chris Laudani shoveling snow from the finishing line, which was widely shared on social media as people sought to uncover his identity.

'All major Boston media outlets reported on a photograph depicting a 'mystery shoveler' who cleared the Marathon finish line of snow during this week's blizzard,' defense lawyers wrote.

'Boston's bias': Attorneys for Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have argued that this photo of a bartender shoveling snow from the marathon finishing line last week shows he will not get a fair trial

'Such stories, and the widespread reaction to them, underscore the impossible task of unmasking juror bias in the very community where 'everyone owns the Marathon',' they wrote, the Boston Herald reported. 

They argue that Tsarnaev, who is accused of setting off two bombs at the finishing line on April 15, 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260, will not be able to get a fair trial in Boston.

A judge has previously rejected two requests to have the trial moved. 

Another previous motion filed days after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris claimed that the violence had stirred 'extraordinary prejudice' relating to the trial and called for it to be delayed - but the request was rejected.

Lawyers are in the process of selecting jurors for the trial but on Monday, jury selection was suspended because of a snowstorm battering the area.

It is the third time bad weather has stalled the already lengthy process in the past week.

They need a pool of nearly 70 qualified jurors before selecting the final 12 jurors and six alternates who will serve in the case.

So far, U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole and the attorneys had questioned 114 jurors individually, according to Masslive.com.

Laudani, who has run the marathon five times, was unmasked as the snow shoveling hero after a local resident snapped him at work and shared the image online.

He explained that he was shoveling snow outside his workplace a few doors away when the idea came to him to head to the finish line. 

'The finish line is my favorite spot in the whole city so I wanted to go down there and dig it out because I don't think it deserves to be covered in snow,' he told the Today show on Thursday.

'Obviously it holds a special place in everybody in Boston's heart but for me it was more about the spirit of the Boston Marathon and the incredible amount of encouragement and positivity that surrounds the event and how much people, including myself, just love the race.'

Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to the bombings that he allegedly carried out with his older brother Tamerlan, who was killed during a police manhunt.

It is believed that when Tsarnaev's case begins, his lawyers are likely to pin the bombings on Tamerlan, his 'role model'. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was 19 at the time. 

If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
