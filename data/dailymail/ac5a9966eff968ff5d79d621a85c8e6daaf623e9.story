Elizabeth Truss, an education minister, has called for an end to 'segregation in toy departments'

Toy makers risk damaging girls’ chances at maths and science by marketing certain toys only at boys, an education minister warned last night.

Elizabeth Truss called for an end to ‘segregation in toy departments’ that results in some products being marketed only at one sex.

Miss Truss, minister for education and childcare, said she backed the calls by campaign group Let Toys be Toys, which is pressing manufacturers and retailers to promote toys in a gender-neutral way.

She gave the example of chemistry sets marketed at boys, which she said was the ‘antithesis’ of Government efforts to persuade more girls to study science.

In an interview with The House magazine, she said: ‘I think toys are toys. Let Toys be Toys are running a fantastic campaign about abolishing the segregation in toy departments.

‘The idea that a chemistry set should be for boys is the antithesis of what we want to promote.

'But at the same time we need to make clear that science and maths aren’t just about engineering cars, they’re also about developing (social media site) LinkedIn, developing cosmetics, marketing.

‘All sorts of jobs require science and maths, whether it’s fashion or farming, whatever you might aspire to, these subjects are useful. So we need a bit of balance I think.’

Miss Truss, who has two daughters, acknowledged that she had brought toys from the controversial pink and purple coloured Lego Friends range, which has been condemned by some feminists.

But, asked about the range, she admitted misgivings, saying: ‘You’ve happened on a complete dilemma we face in promoting maths and science. I don’t know if you remember that dreadful EU campaign where they had “go into science so you can help design lipstick”, or something like that.

‘I’ve brought both sorts of Lego. I’ve got two daughters and I’ve bought traditional Lego and Lego Friends. To some extent you’ve got to engage children in what they’re interested in. You can’t just present something that’s totally different. Otherwise the child will just go off and spend their pocket money on what they want.’ 

She warned that toy makers' marketing risks damaging girls' chances of succeeding in maths and science

The campaign for gender neutral toys has enjoyed growing influence in recent months.

In December, Marks & Spencer announced that all of its toys would be marketed in a gender-neutral way by the spring of this year.

The move followed an internet campaign highlighting the way the retailer sold technology and science themed toys as ‘boys stuff’, while marketing craft toys only at girls.

In a wide-ranging interview, Miss Truss also said ministers were keen to make changes to the ‘Victorian’ school day.

She said there was a ‘double benefit’ to encouraging schools to open from 8am to 6pm, with children from poor backgrounds having access to better facilities to do their homework, and working parents benefiting from the extended hours.

Miss Truss said ministers wanted to ‘encourage schools to respond to what parents want and to offer those hours’.
