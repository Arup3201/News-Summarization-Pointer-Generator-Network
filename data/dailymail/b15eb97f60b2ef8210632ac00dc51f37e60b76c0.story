Her devotion to her career and husband has ensured Zara Phillips a reputation as one of the more down-to-earth royals.

But the hard-working ethos has not always been her approach to life, her father has admitted.

Zara was 'a brat' when she was a child, Captain Mark Phillips has 
revealed - although he readily admits he was not a great father to her 
and her brother Peter.

The Queen's granddaughter, 31, is now preparing to compete in the Olympic eventing team, but there was a time when was far less hard-working and well behaved.

The ex-husband of the Princess Royal said he struggled when she was a small child, but tried to instil a sense of responsibility in her as she grew up and had the run of the family's country pile Gatcombe Park, in Gloucestershire.

Zara's older brother Peter 'knew where the line was and he didn’t cross it', Captain Phillips told the Sunday Times magazine in an interview.

'Zara, on the other hand, who came along four years later, was much more difficult, much more of a brat. I don’t think she accepted that line at all.'

The siblings were sent to boarding school but returned to the home of their father and Princess Anne in the holidays.

'They knew that to have freedom they had to earn it,' said Captain Phillips. 'They also didn’t want their father peering over their shoulder every time they went off and did something by themselves.

'They knew that if they were going to have a party here, they could have fun, but they also had to respect things. So if there was spilled wine on the carpet, or a broken vase on the table, they knew Father, for one, wasn’t going to be pleased.'

The captain later married second wife Sandy Pflueger, an American dressage rider, but recently reportedly left her for equestrian Lauren Hough, 35.

He said his son was a 'great father' to his two daughters with Canadian wife Autumn Kelly.

'Peter has already proved to be a great father — a much better father than I ever was. I was never good with small children. Once Peter and Zara could walk and talk, and be useful, I could relate to them much more.'

His son backed up this view, saying his father was not home as much as he would have liked to have been, largely because of his relentless work ethic.

The 34-year-old added: 'Would I leave my children in the care of my father? Probably not, to put it bluntly. I think he’d possibly get distracted by something horse-related and wander off leaving them.'

Captain Phillips is coaching the US eventing team for London 2012, so is not able to have much contact with Zara or lend her support during the competition.

But he declared himself thrilled for his daughter and delighted she could 'tick the Olympics box' after ticking so many others.
