Romelu Lukaku can score the goals to keep Everton in the Premier League, according to manager Roberto Martinez.

The Belgium international impressed while on loan from Chelsea last season, but struggled initially after making the move permanent last July.

A total of seven goals before Christmas was fewer than Everton might have expected from a striker they had just spent a club-record £28m on.

Romelu Lukaku has been 'phenomenal' in 2015, according to Everton manager Roberto Martinez

Lukaku has struggled at times this season after his £28million move from Chelsea in the summer

But the 21-year-old has scored 11 times since the turn of the year, finding the net in each of Everton's last three matches.

Martinez puts that recovery down to the fact that Lukaku is no longer suffering the after-effects of helping Belgium reach the quarter-finals of last summer's World Cup.

Everton are far from safe in the Premier League as they prepare for  Sunday's trip to relegation-threatened QPR.

But Martinez feels that the goals of Lukaku will see them out of trouble.

He said: He said: 'We made a big investment in him because we always felt that he's a one-off.

'It's always tough for players after a World Cup, and Rom found it extremely difficult.

'But I've been so impressed by the manner in which he's put everything together.

'I think he's been phenomenal. His performances from January have been impressive.

'Now the target is to see that in the next 10 weeks, and make sure he finishes the season really strongly.

'Rom's becoming the type of player who needs one chance to make the difference.

'He likes to carry that responsibility, which is something that goes with your character. He's the full package.'

Martinez has no doubt that Everton are in a relegation fight.

Last Sunday's 3-0 home victory over Newcastle was only the second time his side had won in 12 Premier League matches.

He said: 'Any team who haven't got 40 points in the final third of the season are fighting for every point. Make no mistake about it.

'It's a massive period of the season for us. Every point is going to be extra significant for the team.'
