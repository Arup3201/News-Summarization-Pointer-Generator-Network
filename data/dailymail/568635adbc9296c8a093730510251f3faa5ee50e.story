Confession: Linda Shearsmith, 53, was spared jail for the attack on her partner in their holiday home

A knife-wielding girlfriend threatened to kill her lover and hit him over the head with a bedpan after he wet himself during the night.

Linda Shearsmith, 53, flew into a rage and launched the attack while her boyfriend was still sleeping at their holiday home in Whitby, North Yorkshire.

Magistrates heard Shearsmith was fed up of his troublesome bladder - adding he 'doesn't shut up' - and yelled 'you trashed mine, (so) I'll trash yours' before damaging items including pictures.

Shearsmith, whose partner later said he did not want the case to come to court, admitted assault and criminal damage after the attack on November 3.

Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard she was 'extremely angry' at being woken by her partner's accident, and hit him three times over the head with a bedpan.

She had previously delivered an ultimatum to the unnamed man, who is also her business partner and who had been in a relationship with her for eight months.

He had persistently wet himself after drinking and had a history of 'making a mess', the court heard.

But he remained in the bed despite being banished to the sofa, Shearsmith said, which sparked the argument.

The court heard when she was arrested, she admitted attacking her partner after failing to wake him up.

'He p***** all over so yeah, I hit him over the head,' Shearsmith, from Brough, East Yorkshire, told officers.

The attack left the victim with 'soreness' on the head, the court heard.

When questioned about her partner by police, Shearsmith added he 'doesn't shut up'.

However, the man did not want the case to come to court and did not seek compensation.

And in his brief mitigation, her solicitor David Camidge said Shearsmith, who had one previous drink driving conviction, has been 'very concerned about the outcome of the case'.

Shearsmith thanked magistrates after she was sentenced to 80 hours' unpaid work and told to pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge.

She was also told to complete an alcohol treatment order.
