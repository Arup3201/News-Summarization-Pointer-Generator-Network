California actress Carla Orlandi was able to hug her father for the first time in her life on Wednesday thanks to the help of a DNA website that helped her trace her biological family.

Orlandi, who was born in Puerto Rico, had no details or memories of her parents but she never stopped looking for them.

The actress, who has appeared in TV series CSI, found her father Gary Erbe, after adding her DNA information to the ancestry.com website.Â

Father and daughter had spoken a couple of times on the phone since finding each other, but they met for the first time in San Diego.

In an emotional reunion, the pair hugged each other tight as Erbe arrived at the airport to spend six days with Orlandi, her husband and their six children.

'I've been searching for 21 years, and because of the miracle of DNA [we] found each other,' Orlandi told Fox 5 San Diego.

Her father, Erbe, who was originally from Arkansas, said he was 'pretty blown away' about finding his daughter, who he had also been searching for.

Erbe had met Orlandi's mother, Caroline, in Washington state and soon fell for the beauty queen.

They went their separate ways after about a year, and only later did he discover that Caroline had become pregnant and put the child up for adoption.

Orlandi was adopted by a Puerto Rican couple and later moved to New York City to study acting after she was spotted by a modelling agent.

Sadly, Caroline died before Orlandi could get in touch with her, ABC 10 reported.

Erbe said he had searched for Orlandi for years, and even returned to Bellingham where he had met her mother, to try to find her.

Finally, a close DNA match between Orlandi and one of Erbe's grandsons brought father and daughter back together.

The website provides analysis of subscribers' genetic makeup and ethnicity, as well as providing information about close relatives who have also provided a DNA sample using their home kit.

Orlandi said she felt as if her 'heart is going to explode' during the longed-for reunion this week.
