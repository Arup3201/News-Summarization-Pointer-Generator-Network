The suspected mastermind behind a global match-fixing ring rigging hundreds of football games, including some of the world’s biggest matches, is ‘assisting’ police with inquiries.

Singaporean businessman Dan Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, is accused of heading a crime syndicate that made millions of dollars betting on rigged Italian football matches. 

The Singapore Police Force confirmed that they were questioning Tan and it is thought he is a key figure in the ‘Last Bet’ investigation into corruption in football by global law enforcers Interpol.

Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said the arrest of Admir Suljic and the questioning of Singaporean businessman Dan Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, show that they are not above the law

The crime group is thought to be made up of people from Singapore and the Balkans and are believed to have manipulated the results of Italian league matches in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons.

A police statement said: ‘Dan Tan Seet Eng, a Singaporean who has been named in reports so far, is currently assisting Singapore authorities in their investigations.

‘We have been offering assistance and sharing available information with affected countries and will continue to do so.’

'Key element': Admir Suljic was arrested on Thursday accused of criminal association aimed at sporting fraud and considered key in the probe into match-fixing between 2009 and 2011

The move came after Italian police 
arrested Tan's alleged associate, Slovenian Admir Suljic, on Thursday, 
after he had been on the run since December 2011. Police in Singapore 
gave information to Interpol which made Suljic’s arrest possible.

Suljic, who is accused of criminal association aimed at sporting fraud, flew to Milan from Singapore to turn himself in to the authorities.

He is considered a 'key element' in the probe into match-fixing between 2009 and 2011. 

An arrest warrant has also been issued for Tan but the Singapore Police Force did not say if it would turn him in to international authorities. 

Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said the arrest of Suljic, followed by the questioning of Tan, is ‘important because the world believes that law enforcement can't do anything to take down this criminal organisation, the world believes that (Tan) and his associates can't be touched, that they are above the law’.

Mr Noble said: ‘We will follow the rule of law.

‘The hope is that (the suspect) will cooperate with law enforcement and tell us all he knows.’

Italian Police said Suljic would be taken to a prison in the city of Cremona. 

The
 Italian police said in a statement: ‘His direct involvement in the 
international criminal group, made of Singapore nationals and people 
from the Balkans, has emerged from the investigation.’

FIFA's security director Ralf Mutschke (pictured with Mr Noble) admitted soccer officials had underestimated the scope of match-fixing after FIFA revealed estimates that organised crimes takes as much as £9.6bn a year by fixing matches

The
 Singapore police statement continued: ‘In response to media queries, 
the Singapore Police Force confirms that it had informed Interpol 
National Central Bureau (NCB) Rome and Interpol's Command and 
Coordination Centre at Interpol HQ in Lyon, France of the travel plans 
of a person wanted by the Italian authorities for investigations into 
match-fixing.

‘The Singapore Police provided this information as part of the regular and ongoing exchange that the Singapore Police Force has with its counterparts.

‘The person has since been arrested 
by the Italian authorities and NCB Rome has sent a message to NCB 
Singapore thanking the Police for its support in this matter.’

'Arrogantly happening daily': Chris Eaton, from the International Centre for Sport Security, said: 'Football is in a disastrous state'

The
 investigation comes as official football bodies revealed that football 
has become a multi-million pound industry for the mafia, Chinese 
gangsters and Russian crooks which is fuelled by match fixing.

Internet
 betting, criminal gangs and even the economic downturn have all 
contributed to making football an obvious target for the criminal 
underworld. 

Europol, the European Union's police body, announced last week it had found 680 'suspicious' games worldwide since 2008, including 380 in Europe. 

'Football is in a disastrous state', said Chris Eaton, director of sport integrity at the International Centre for Sport Security. 

'Fixing of matches for criminal gambling fraud purposes is absolutely endemic worldwide... arrogantly happening daily.'

FIFA has estimated that organised crime takes in as much as £9.6billion a year by fixing matches. In Italy alone, a recent rigging scandal is estimated to have produced £1.6 billion for the Camorra and the Mafia crime syndicates, Eaton said.

The total amount of money generated by sports betting would equal the gross domestic product of Switzerland, ranked 19th in the world.

Sportradar, a company in London that monitors global sports betting, estimates that about 300 football games a year in Europe alone could be rigged.

And criminals have realised it can be easier to shift gambling profits across borders.

'These are real criminals — Italian mafia, Chinese gangs, Russian mafia,' said Sylvia Schenk, a sports expert with corruption watchdog Transparency International.

While Ralf Mutschke, FIFA's security chief, admits that soccer officials have underestimated the scope of match-fixing. 

He told Associated Press that 'realistically, there is no way' FIFA can tackle organised crime by itself, saying it needs more help from national law enforcement agencies.

Match-fixing is used by gambling rings 
to make money off bets they know they will win. Matches also are rigged 
to propel a team into a higher-ranking division where it can earn more 
revenue.
