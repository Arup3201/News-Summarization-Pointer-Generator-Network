The Clinton clan hit the streets of New York City today to take the newest member of the family out for a stroll.

Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton walked down Fifth Avenue in a pack on Friday, alongside Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky.

Chelsea pushed the stroller with baby Charlotte, now three months old, while Bill walked alongside the two, with a protective hand on the pushchair.

Hillary, wearing shades like her daughter, wore a dark blue coat and brighter blue sweater teamed with a purple-colored scarf. The family was pictured crossing 19th Street amid crowds of New Yorkers.

It is one of baby Charlotte's first outings since she was seen cradled in Chelsea's arms leaving the plush Manhattan hospital where she was born in late September.

Since the birth, Charlotte has been growing up in the family's $10million apartment in the nearby Flatiron District.

The couple bought the home in the beautiful Whitman Building, near Madison Square Park, a year ago - relocating from their last $4million apartment just a block away.

The $5,000-square-foot apartment occupies an entire floor of the building, and comes with four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and den.

Its interior is lit with natural light, thanks to the floor to ceiling windows that look over the nearby greenspace.

The couple also have their own 252-square-foot terrace to baby-proof.

Friday's family jaunt is another example of the elder Clintons' keen grandparenting.

While Chelsea was pregnant, the power couple both spoke at length about their excitement at having a grandchild while Chelsea was pregnant, and made many long visits to the hospital after Charlotte was born, before declaring themselves 'over the moon'.
