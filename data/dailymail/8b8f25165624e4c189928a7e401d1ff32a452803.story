It's the unofficial yearbook for his graduating class.

Renowned portrait photographer Michael Jang was a student at the California Institute of the Arts in the 1970s, known for its hard partying and successful graduates such as director Tim Burton and Seinfeld actor Michael Richards (aka Kramer).

But before he made a name for himself, Jang kept a photographic diary of his time at 'Cal Arts', capturing the hedonism, raucous parties and self-discovery which defined the era.

Now he's released the black-and-white snaps in his first-ever Instagram account, uncovering nude and drunken dancing, crowdsurfing, college campus wanderings and stolen kisses.

Blast from the past: Portrait photographer Michael Jang has released a series of incredible photos he took as a student at the California Institute of the Arts in the 1970s

Epitome of cool: Michael Jang snapped pop icon David Bowie signing autographs for fans at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in 1972, the same year he released his album 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'

'The pictures that you see in College are from me walking around with a camera all the time - 
not for my elective specifically, but rather to keep my chops together. 
Like doing musical scales so to speak - to be fluid. When you do street 
photography, you have to sense that picture coming, before it happens; 
you have to be in the right place and time,' Jang told Vice.

'I’d
 walk the halls of Cal Arts and I would hear people behind closed doors 
singing, dancing, and taking breaks to unwrap their blistered feet.

'The
 painters were always painting, and the photographers would pack up 
their gear and do their big photo-safari weekend once a week maybe, and 
then come back and spend the rest of the time doing the negatives, the 
contact sheets another day, work prints another day, and that was your 
week or two.

'I
 thought the actual way to get better at photography was taking 
pictures, not doing all the darkroom stuff. It is important your first 
year, but after that...'.

Jang unwittingly captured a pre-Baywatch David Hasselhoff dancing while holding a plastic cup and Seinfeld's Michael Patrick wearing a flat cap with one arm around a woman.

Also featured in his collection is legendary sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, father of singer Norah Jones, who was then head of the Cal Arts music department, and even pop singer David Bowie who dropped into one of the college parties.

Cal Arts was established by Walt Disney in the 1960s, and many of its graduates now work at Disney.

'[It] makes
 me think about how being photographed is different now. Then, you most 
likely never saw pictures of yourself if taken by someone else. We’re 
talking film here,' Jang, who was just 20 when he took the snaps, told Nerve.

'Developing negatives, making contact sheets, then serious darkroom 
time making prints. Now an image taken is instantly shared on a number 
of media platforms. This has to have an effect on the way people see 
themselves in regards to photography...

'At
 the time they were just taken without the thought of fame or financial 
gain. They are a wonderful collection and it’s a privilege to be a 
viewer into that world.'

Jang, now based in San Francisco, is a highly-regarded portrait photographer known for snapping cultural elites such as William Burroughs, Alice Walker and Jimi Hendrix.
