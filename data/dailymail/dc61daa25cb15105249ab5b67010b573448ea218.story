An American suicide bomber who blew himself up for a group with links to al-Qaeda, attracted no attention from authorities despite having made an earlier trip to Syria.

Moner Mohammad Abusalha, 22, a US college drop out, was part of a mass suicide bombing on May 25 in Syria which targeted several army positions.

The al-Nusra Front, a militant Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, said he used a truck carrying explosives to conduct the attack.

American suicide bomber, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, was not closely monitored by the authorities, despite having visited Syria the previous year where he was initially trained

Before he carried out the attack, Abusalha had already made a trip to the conflict zone, where he claimed he was first trained up. 

Between the two visits, he spent more than six months in the US but was not put under surveillance by the authorities.

His movements went unmonitored despite a major push by U.S. security and intelligence agencies over the past two years to track the flow of foreign fighters in to and out of Syria. 

At the centre of that effort is a task force established by the FBI at a classified complex in Virginia that also involves the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center.

'It is extremely difficult for the FBI to identify individuals in the U.S. who have this kind of goal,' said George Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, which led the Abusalha investigation. 'It requires a loved one or really close friend to note the changes...The family has to intervene.'

In Syria, the American attached himself to the extremist group, al-Nusra front, who have links to Al-Qaeda

Abusalha had already been to Syria the previous year, but the US officials allowed him back in to the country 

Abusalha, who was a keen basketball player, initially departed for Syria in late January 2013. 

His first stay in the country was brief and he left a month later for Jordan where his grandparents lived, before making a pilgrimage by bus to the Islamic holy cities Mecca and Medina.

He returned to the US on May 12, where he was questioned by custom officials. 

To verify his story, Custom and Border Protection officers called his mother who vouched for her son and said he had been visiting relatives. As such, Abusalha was allowed to make his way back in to the country.

Back in the US, his movements were not monitored - despite his trip to the conflict zone.  

Just over six months later, in mid-November, Abusalha returned to Syria in a carefully disguised journey from New York to Istanbul to Cairo, which was a false endpoint.

In a chilling video, he said: 'When I came to Syria, I had nothing. 'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.

In a show of loyalty to the al-Nusra Front, Abusalha burned his US passport on a recorded video 

Once back in Syria, Abusalha attached himself to the al-Nusra Front, an extremist group with links to Al Qaeda.

In May this year, he drove a truck packed with explosives toward a restaurant full of Syrian soldiers.

It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abusalha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops.

The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions.

U.S. counterterrorism officials are still debating the significance of al-Qaeda's decision to use Abusalha in an attack on the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, rather than aiming him at a Western target. 

Abusalha is counted among the 100 or so Americans who have travelled to Syria or attempted to do so

In a video released by The Nusra Front, the extremist group claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives.

In the footage, Abusalha is shown saying: 'Glorious is God, and thanks God, his is a grace from him. When I came to Syria, I had nothing.

'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.' 

'Heaven is better,' he said in a previously-released video. 'When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation.

'You are not safe. I have one word to say ... we are coming for you. Mark my words.

'You think you killed Osama bin Laden? You sent him to paradise.

'Just know that we are coming.' 

Beach life: Abusalha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad

Abusalha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad.

He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami.

The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports.

Abusalha is counted among the 100 or so Americans who have travelled to Syria or attempted to do so, according to senior US officials.

But in reality, officials admit, the total has risen to 130 or more, and it includes individuals about whom only fragments of information are known. 

The clearest cases­ involve U.S. citizens arrested by the FBI before they depart. But other cases are incomplete, based on false names or partial identities assembled from references on social media or U.S. intelligence sources. 

Americans account for a tiny fraction of an estimated 15,000 fighters who have flocked to Syria from other nations. 

The majority are from elsewhere in the Middle East, but at least 700 have travelled or attempted to travel from France, with an additional 400 from Britain and 250 from Germany.
