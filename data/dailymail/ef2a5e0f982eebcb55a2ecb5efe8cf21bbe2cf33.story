Four men have been jailed for a Match.com dating scam which saw vulnerable single women duped out of £220,000.

Monty Emu, Emmanuel Oko, Chukwuka Ugwu and Adewunmi Nusi were sentenced at Winchester Crown Court today after using fake profiles to con women out of their life savings.

They posed as middle-aged men under the names James Richards and Melvyn Binion to develop a relationship and then start asking for cash.

A total of 14 women fell for the scam after they were fed gushing messages that claimed the father of the man – ‘a widower’ – had died and left £1.5million in his will.

But the bachelor said he would need £700 to go to India to access the money, funded by the victims, and then would say he had hit problems on the trip and beg for more money to release inheritance.

The cash was paid into bank accounts and transferred to others before it was withdrawn around Portsmouth, Hampshire.

Divorcee Suzanne Hardman, 56, lost a staggering £174,000 after being pursued by a man she believed to be 48-year-old Mr Richards.

Mrs Hardman, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said in a victim impact statement read to the court the ordeal made her feel 'sick to her stomach', robbed her of all self-respect and left her unable to eat or sleep.

The court heard the scam 'constantly plays' on her mind and she has had to take time off work through stress.

The statement said: ‘I felt very vulnerable, sick to my stomach and ashamed.

‘I felt no one could ever get to me in this way and have lost self-respect because of it.

‘I feel that it is my fault. I was the one caught up in this and feel it was my own undoing.

‘Looking back I ask myself why I did not realise what was going on and warn others about the dangers of online dating.

‘I have tried to put the incident to the back of my mind but cannot.

‘One of the worst things is that through this I have never seen or heard this “James”.’

Another victim was Michelle Sparham, who gave away money saved to help her son through university, today told the packed court her life was wrecked after she was approached by Mr Binion.

She described herself becoming a 'selective mute' who struggles to talk to adults and even refused to go into hospital after being diagnosed with pleurisy and pneumonia last October.

She said she tried to throw herself into work, clocking up 14 hour days in a bid to prove herself.

Fighting back tears in the witness box today, Mrs Sparham said: ‘I no longer trust any adults, male or female.

‘I just do not believe what they tell me and do not pick out the positive or good people are telling me.

‘Before this incident I was a trusting person and this organisation has affected my daily life.

‘Now I tend not to trust anyone and this can make my life very confusing and hard work.’

She added: ‘For about 12 years I was a marathon runner and weighed about 10 and a half stone but since this I have gained weight.

‘Since this deceit against me I do not believe I deserve anything good and feel the need to constantly punish myself.’

Sylvia Choi, another of the group’s duped women, said she ‘hit rock bottom’, did not want to leave the house, suffered nightmares and was too scared to answer the phone.

One message sent to the women from the fake profile read: ‘You make me feel important, you make me feel safe and wanted, something I have not felt for a very long time.

‘I knew our friendship would grow from the first time we spoke but neither one of us could have begun to imagine the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand.

‘You are my soulmate, my best friend, my life, my inspiration - my everything.’

Sentencing at Winchester Crown Court today, Judge Susan Evans said the 'large scale' scam had an enormous effect on the 'lonely and emotionally vulnerable' victims.

She said: ‘This was a sophisticated conspiracy to defraud. It played upon the trusting, the lonely and the emotionally vulnerable.

‘The amount of planning involved in this scam was substantial and would have required a number of people.

‘Fake profiles had to be set up - they had to be convincing, they had to be detailed, listing things like their religion and what they were looking for in a partner.

‘A fake passport was set up for James Richards and legal looking documents were created.

‘Someone had to write all those emails - some were repeats but some had to be “fact specific”, and a number of people must also have been involved in phone calls with the victims.

This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash

‘The characters had to be played by individual people on the telephone and they had to keep track of the plot so the calls made sense to the victim and were believable.

‘They were orchestrated, detailed and plainly rehearsed to perfection.

‘This was a large scale fraud and a very unpleasant one.

‘The distressed victims speak of depression, sleepless nights, loss of confidence, an inability to trust others and feelings of humiliation, embarrassment and shame.

‘Some of those targeted were utterly taken in.

‘That is unsurprising. They believed themselves to be in a relationship with these people and the hurt and distress you caused them was enormous.

‘As many of them say, it is not even about the money, it is about the emotional hurt that you caused them.

‘Some of them lost substantial amounts of money they could ill afford to lose.

‘For Mrs Hardman it was her life savings and for another it was the money she saved for her son to go to university.’

Detective Constable Darrin Carey, from Hampshire Police, said the 'devious' group constructed a 'web of lies' to exploit the emotionally vulnerable.

DC Carey added the case should act as a warning to con artists that they will be caught, and thanked victims for their 'courage' in reporting their 'distressing' ordeals.

The Crown Prosecution Service has applied for all assets from the crimes to be confiscated.

Oko, 29, from Southsea, Hampshire was given eight years in prison for the fraud charge and four years for money laundering, to be served concurrently.

Emu, 28, from Southsea, Hampshire, was handed three years and six months, and Ugwu, 28, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, was sentenced to 46 weeks in prison.

They attended the University of Portsmouth at the time of the scam.

Fashion designer Nusi, 37, from Hermitage in Berkshire, who has previous convictions for alcohol and driving offences, received an 18 month jail term.

Two others - Brooke Boston, 29, of Southsea, Hampshire, was cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering and Eberechi Ekpo, 26, also of Southsea was also cleared of money laundering and fraud by false representation part way through the trial.
