We've already seen smart rings that tell the time, and rings that show notifications from a smartphone but the latest wave features rings that control just about anything you can think of.

Ring by Logbar is the latest wearable tech worn on the forefinger that can be used to control smart household items, apps, and even make payments with the swipe of a finger.

For example, drawing an envelope shape
 in mid-air opens an email, drawing a camera opens the camera app on a 
connected phone, or drawing a musical note will start playing songs.

Ring, pictured, can control apps or smart household items using finger gestures. Wearers can draw an envelope shape to open emails, for example. It can also be programmed to switch smart lights on and off, and change channel on smart TVs. The Ring connects to these items via Bluetooth

The battery-powered Ring is fitted with motion sensors, a touch sensor, a Bluetooth chip, LEDs and vibration pad.

To activate the Ring, wearers press a button on the side. 

Wearers can choose to receive alerts and notifications, such as new emails or Facebook posts, using either vibrations or flashing lights.

The Ring comes with a number of gestures pre-installed, but these can be customised via an Android or iOS app.

Logbar’s Ring can be connected directly to a smart device, or any compatible device within a network including smart lights and TVs. 

Logbar claims Ring can perform up to 1,000 gestures before its battery needs to be replaced.  

Ring also comes with Text Transmission that lets people write messages by drawing letters with their finger in mid-air.

It was created by Californian-based firm Logbar's CEO Takuro Yoshida and is expected to go on sale in July. Early versions of the device can be pre-ordered for $145 (£87). 

To activate Ring, wearers press a button on the side. The battery-powered Ring is fitted with motion sensors, a touch sensor, a Bluetooth chip, LEDs and a vibration pad.

Wearers can choose to receive alerts and notifications, such as new emails or Facebook posts, using either vibrations, or flashing LEDs located near the power button.

The Ring comes with a number of gestures pre-installed but gestures can also be customised using the Ring app.

The Ring Font feature can also be used to calibrate the text transmission meaning Ring will recognise the wearer’s handwriting.

Compatible apps can be bought from the dedicated Ring store, pictured left. The Ring comes with a number of gestures pre-installed but gestures can also be customised using the Gesture Maker in the Ring app, right

To make payments, Ring connects via Bluetooth to Apple’s iBeacon app.

Using GPS, the ring locates the shop or restaurant the wearer is in, they can then trace their finger over the numbers on the bill to tell iBeacon how much they have been charged. The payment is then confirmed. 

Logbar’s Ring can be connected via Bluetooth directly 
to a smart device, or any compatible device within a network including 
smart lights and TVs. It will also work with Google Glass and smartwatches.

Ring currently works with iOS 7 and Android 4.4. Logbar is working on a Windows Phone version. 

Logbar's Ring only detects the movement of the finger it is being worn on and the company claims Ring can perform up to 1,000 gestures before its battery needs to be replaced.

To achieve funding for the Ring, Yoshida set up a Kickstarter campaign that runs until April 4.

Yoshida wanted to raise $250,000 (£149,000) but the campaign has already reached more than $433,000 (£259,000).
