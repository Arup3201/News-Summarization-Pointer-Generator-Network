This week, Spencer Matthews was pictured showing off his toned abs and impressive pecs as he did back-flips off a yacht.

But this time last year, his physique wasn't quite so svelte. The Made In Chelsea star had piled on the pounds after indulging in a hard-partying lifestyle.

Now the reality show regular has revealed his muscly new look is the result of a week spent dragging logs and lifting tyres at a boot camp in Norfolk run by former soldiers.

Fat to fit: Spencer has lost a stone thanks to a gruelling fitness regime dreamed up by army instructors

Show off! So thrilled is Spencer with his new look, he couldn't resist showing off for the paps

The old Etonian had gained weight 
thanks to his love of late night meals, but decided he wanted to look good for the 
new series of Made In Chelsea which starts in the middle of September.

Spencer,
25, was determined not to have a repeat of his return to the show last 
year when he arrived on set looking decidedly podgy.

Keen to start off on the right foot, he opted for gruelling 12-hour
a day work out sessions with British army PT instructors at the No 1 
Boot Camp in Norfolk.

To keep hunger pangs at bay, the star also admitted to using fat burning supplements made from appetite suppressing green coffee beans.

Spencer said; 'The Forza Green Coffee 
really helped when the rations at the camp were meagre. It basically 
took my mind off wanting to go and have a snack and stopped me from 
going crazy for food.'

And his dedication certainly seems to have paid off, as he managed to drop a stone and now tips the scales at a slimline 13st.

Spencer said: 'It’s been a very hard slog getting in shape but No 1 Boot camp don’t let you quit. They had me doing 50 burpees every time I did a fitness session - burpees are a nightmare.

'It’s a squat thrust followed by a star jump. I would suggest very strongly that you don’t try to do 50 in a row.'

This is the second time that Spencer has visited the boot camp. He previously went to the Ibiza camp and lost 13lbs but his party lifestyle saw him put most of the weight back on.

This time however, he hopes to maintain his healthy 13st frame - preferably without any more visits to the boys in green.
