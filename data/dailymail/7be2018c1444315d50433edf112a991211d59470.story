Cold logic suggests he has got no chance. Conventional golfing wisdom points towards him using the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool as a chance to get some competitive rounds under his belt before a serious tilt at the season’s final major, the US PGA Championship in three weeks.

So what happened when the big question came, and what would be an acceptable performance this week? Tiger Woods settled for a one-word answer: ‘First.’

Pressed if that meant that second would be unacceptable, he smiled and replied: ‘Yeah, same as always.’

Win or die: Tiger Woods is targeting victory at The Open

On target: He is aiming for his first victory at The Open since 2006

It is not often that packed media interview rooms are held spellbound by Woods, reflecting his willingness on far too many occasions to fall back on non- committal answers. But here a room containing some 200 people were genuinely held captive.

Asked why rust would not be a factor given he has played just two competitive rounds in four months following back surgery, Woods rewound the clock to the 2008 US Open. ‘It was the same back then,’ he said.

‘Between the Masters and the US Open I played nine holes and didn’t break 50 but I still won in a play-off, with a broken leg and a ruptured cruciate. I’ve proven I can do it.’

Woods even allowed a glimpse behind the public mask, and what it meant to return here to the place where he won in 2006, his first major victory following the death of his father Earl that April.

‘I was going through a pretty tough time in my life and so it meant a lot to win,’ he said. ‘I’d pressed pretty hard at the Masters because I knew that would be the last major my dad would see me play.

And then I didn’t play well at the US Open and missed the cut there miserably. Then I came here and just felt at peace. When it got to Sunday I was just so calm inside it was surreal.’

Has Woods come back to the sport a changed man? Uncharacteristically, he talked openly about his fears and relief both before and after his surgery.

Triple crown: He has lifted the Claret Jug on three previous occasions

Familiar territory: And won his third and most recent title at Hoylake in 2006

2006 At Hoylake, Woods won his third Open by two shots.

2007 Tied 12th, five shots off winner Padraig Harrington.

2008 Did not play after knee surgery.

2009 Missed the cut after two bad rounds.

2010 Shot an opening 67 but finished tied for 23rd.

2011 Missed the tournament with injury.

2012 Tied for third, four behind winner Ernie Els.

2013 Tied for sixth, five shots adrift of Phil Mickelson.

‘For a while I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t do anything, and it certainly made me appreciate just how fortunate I had been to play the game for the  better part of 17 years at a pretty high level.

‘Previous surgeries, when my knee and leg were trashed, I could still swing the club. I couldn’t do it with this injury. Just the daily things of moving around, I couldn’t actually enjoy my life.

‘If you ask anyone who goes through this surgery, they will tell you it changes your whole life. It takes away all the pain.

'Yes I was sore from the incision but I remember sitting in the recovery room and the overwhelming feeling was one of relief because I knew it was only a matter of time then before I could get strong and play at the elite level again.’

Woods missed the cut comfortably in his comeback event two weeks ago but for the first time in his life after such a result was still smiling.

‘It was such a big moment for me because I’d gone at the ball pretty hard and suffered no  setbacks,’ he said. ‘I could play out of the rough, I could hit full shots and I was able to recover each day. That just wasn’t the case before.’

The 38-year-old is feeling so  good right now he is even talking about playing in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

‘I’ve been on teams with the likes of Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk for the whole of my professional life and we’ve gone from being rookies to veterans and it has been fantastic,’ he said. ‘Hopefully we will do it again.’

First, The Open. Woods has not won one since that momentous triumph here but it remains a cherished priority.

Asked about the different reactions when he is holding the Claret Jug or wearing the Green Jacket, he replied: ‘More people want to drink out of the Jug. With the Jacket, a few wanted to take pictures but everyone wanted to slam back a couple out of the Jug.’

So to the return to Hoylake. Padraig Harrington might have been overstating it when he said Woods’s  victory here in 2006 was the finest of all his 14 major triumphs but it is clear that it is high up there on the list for Tiger as well, for emotional and professional reasons.

‘It’s just great to be back here and rekindle some of the memories of that fabulous week,’ said Woods. ‘The people were fantastic. They knew what I was going through and were just so supportive.

'It’s been the same this week, and so great to see so many people walking and following us in practice with the crowds getting bigger all the time.

‘Obviously a lot has changed in eight years. The course is different, I’ve got a completely different golf swing and as a  person I’ve been through a lot. From the loss of a parent to having two kids, life is very  different now.’

Asked if he would play into his 50s to catch Jack Nicklaus’s total of 18 majors, Woods was unequivocal: ‘Hopefully I will have it done by then.’

Not that he is underestimating the scale of the challenge of  winning as many majors from now on as Mickelson has won in his entire career in order to overtake Nicklaus.

‘I think it gets harder every year,’ he said. ‘We’ve just had a run where there were 16 or 17 first-time  winners in a row. So the fields are getting deeper and the guys are hitting it further and further. But I am getting stronger as well and I am only going to get stronger and faster, which is great.’

Thirty minutes in the company of Woods can often feel like your life ebbing away. This particular half an hour went by in a flash.
