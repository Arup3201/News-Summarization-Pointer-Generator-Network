Billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart's battle with the Nine Network over the second episode of a controversial TV drama about her family may not be over.

The sixth richest woman in the world is considering her legal options, despite reaching a last-ditch confidential settlement with the network before the closing instalment of the House of Hancock was televised on Sunday night, AAP reports.

Ms Rinehart's solicitor Mark Wilks said after the program that Nine had been aware of glaring errors in the second episode that were misleading and 'twisted'.

Despite the network's disclaimer the show was a 'drama, not a documentary', it remained devoid of factual accuracy, he told AAP.

After a legal battle on Friday, Rinehart only agreed to the controversial drama being aired if a disclaimer pointed out the show was 'fictionalised'.

Gina Rinehart's final moments with her father were wrongly depicted in the Channel Nine drama House Of Hancock, according to her lawyers

No other details of the agreement were made public.

However, in a new litany of complaints, Mr Wilks said scenes showing Ms Rinehart conversing with her deceased father were 'entirely false'.

'(The scenes are) offensive and endeavours to question Mrs Rinehart's sanity, soundness of mind or acumen,' he told AAP.

Mr Wilks dismissed what he said were suggestions Ms Rinehart had conspired to prepare a deed that would circumvent her father's final will.

The suggestion Ms Rinehart confronted her father while he was in hospital was also offensive and inconsistent with the reality she loved her father and wouldn't upset him in hospital, he said.

Ms Rinehart's solicitor also complained the show got dates wrong.

Rinehart took urgent legal action in the NSW Supreme Court in a bid to stop the Nine Network from airing the second half of its program, House of Hancock, on Sunday night.

'Ms Rinehart did not arrange security glass for HPPL's offices until late 1997,' Mr Wilks said.

The complaints follow a confidential settlement between Ms Rinehart and the network after the billionaire was granted an early viewing of the second episode by the Supreme Court.

The court took the unusual step of sitting on a Saturday to the resolve the dispute before the show aired. 

The Nine Network confirmed the second episode of the controversial drama, which documents the trials and tribulations of the billionaire Hancock mining dynasty, would go ahead via a tweet on Saturday.

It revealed the lawyers who were operating on behalf of Ms Rinehart had reached an agreement after she had watched the program.

The comment on Twitter said: 'Gina Rinehart's lawyers reach confidential agreement in #Houseof Hancock case. The show will air tomorrow as per schedule.'

The series dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart and her late father Lang Hancock.

The first episode focused on the romance between the Ms Rinehart's father and his Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson, which triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family when she became his third wife in 1985.

Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose. 

More than 1.4 million viewers tuned in for the first instalment last Sunday.

Mr Hancock and his daughter (pictured here in real life) had a strong relationship in the eighties, but it later deteriorated following his relationship with Rose 

Tad Watroba, executive director of Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement to Nine's network boss David Gyngell following the first episode saying it was 'tacky' and 'damaging the memory of good Australians'. 

He said many of the scenes aired were fictitious, unfounded or grossly distorted.

'I know the facts, and this show has turned out to be a tacky grab for ratings, damaging the memory of good Australians along the way,' Mr Watroba said.

'Since starting promotion of the show, Channel 9 has not bothered to fact-check anything despite repeated offers when people have pointed out mistakes. 

Scenes from the series showed Hancock (played by Sam Neil) having sex with housekeeper Rose Lacson (Peta Sergeant) and Rinehart discovering their affair.

'You're the subject of dirty old man jokes from one end of Australia to the next,' Ms Rinehart, who was played by Mandy McElhinney, says.

Her headstrong father retorts: 'You're the embarrassment, not me, you've let yourself go since having kids.. Look at the baby elephant you've become,' he barks.

Hancock, once Australia's richest man, was smitten with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap and pursues the relationship smashing the bond he shared with his only child.

What ensues is an increasingly bitter public feud spanning two decades involving murder accusations, drug charges, court cases, illegitimate children and betrayal until his death in 1992, aged 82. 

Among the alleged errors in House of Hancock, according to Mr Watroba, is the fact Mr Hancock and Ms Rinehart had a loving, father/daughter relationship.

Mr Watroba also said Ms Rinehart was very close to her mother and did not continue to holiday or honeymoon in the United States when her mother was dying as the show has suggested.

'Mr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her. The scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother loved her son-in-law also,' he said.

Rose was initially hired by Ms Rinehart to help her newly widowed father after her mother Hope Margaret passed away in 1983.

She went on to marry her boss two years later in 1985.

Ms Rinehart was bitterly opposed to the relationship and made a point of not attending the wedding in Sydney and even opposed Rose's business visa when she her father first began dating.

The mining heiress now remains locked in a bitter legal fight with two of her children, John and Bianca.

The pair are trying to remove their magnate mother from the position of trustee of the multi-million dollar family trust, set up by Hancock for his grandchildren in 1988.
