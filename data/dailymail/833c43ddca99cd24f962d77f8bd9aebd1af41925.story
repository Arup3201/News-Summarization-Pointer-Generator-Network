It seems like just yesterday that David and Victoria Beckham announced the arrival of their first child.

But today Brooklyn Beckham, rumoured to have been named after the place he was conceived, turned 16 years old. 

His birthday marks the end of an 18-month period in which he has stepped out from his parents shadow, becoming all the more famous in his own right.

It's official: two of New York Fashion Week's most watched women, Kim Kardashian and Victoria Beckham have been upstaged by their adorable daughters.

But whilst little North West has been hitting the headlines for her tantrums, Harper Beckham managed to hold it together for her mother's Fall 2015 catwalk show. Well, when surrounded by Anna Wintour, as well as David, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz Beckham, who wouldn't be stunned into silence?!

As ever, she looked ridiculously cute, this time wearing a black pleated dress by Bonpoint, which features a cutesy contrast Peter Pan collar. We love this formal frock, and Harper has clearly inherited her mum's love of the little black dress!

Unfortunately, this exact style flew off the shelves as soon as Harper was spotted in it, but luckily there are plenty of options to help you dress up your little darlings. This Fendi number in particular is just too cool for school.

Indeed, from attending fashion shows, to modelling for magazines and even a rumoured romance with a Hollywood actress, Brooklyn has put his name firmly on the map.

He was even gifted a pair of shoes by Kanye West on his big day, he posted a picture of a fresh pair of Yeezy Boosts on his Instagram account this morning saying: 'Thanks Kanye for the yeezys.' 

Of course, it can't hurt that David and Victoria are undoubtedly one of the most famous and best-loved couples in the world.

And their much adored family unit, including Brooklyn's siblings, Romeo, 12, Cruz, 10 and Harper, three, has gone a long way to cementing their overall popularity. 

They have been taking Brooklyn out from a young age. As a little boy he was regularly spotted at his father's football matches or out and about with his mother.

But it's only been in the last year or so that he's truly stepped out of his shell, even attending events on his own.  

On Instagram, the teen is incredibly popular, having only opened his account in November he already has 359,000 followers. 

Brooklyn has boosted his popularity by joining Instagram and posting pictures of his family

Brooklyn often posts photographs of himself posing for selfies to his Instagram account, much to the delight of his young fans 

In August Brooklyn attended the If I Stay premiere in LA. At the time he was rumoured to be dating actress Chloe Moretz who stars in the film

He regularly posts selfies which amass thousands of likes and pictures of himself enjoying the jetset lifestyle including luxury holidays around the world. 

When in November he posted an image of himself with his designer mother at the wedding of Elton John and David Furnish it was picked up by websites around the world.

But Brooklyn's transformation into the young man he is today first started as long ago as November 2013, when Victoria took him as her date to the Harper's Bazaar Women of the year awards.

Since then he has become a regular on the red carpet. In February and September 2014 he hit the FROW at his mother's NYFW shows. 

Attending again in February this year along with his little brother's and sister.   

Brooklyn is a regular at his Mum's fashion shows, pictured her at her February show with his siblings Harper, being carried by Victoria, Cruz (front) and Romeo (left)

Brooklyn always dote on his younger siblings, he was photographed carrying a sleepy Harper through the streets of New York following his Mum's fashion show  in February

In October he took part in his first ever solo photoshoot for New York Times Style Magazine, looking very much the spitting image of his famous father.

Indeed much has been made of the likeness between Brooklyn and his father, especially after he bleached his hair blonde - as his Dad once had - in January. 

At the time he posted a picture of himself on Instagram, hilariously captioning it: 'Blonds have more fun.' 

His rumoured relationship with Chloe Moretz, 17- neither part have confirmed or denied that they were ever a couple - also helped to boost his profile.

The pair were regularly spotted out and about together in 2014. Chloe has described Brooklyn as: 'A very good guy,' adding, 'I like hanging out with him. 

And in December he was photographed leaving red carpet event, ‘A Night With Nick,’ along with singer Talia Storm and blogger Tessie Hartmann.

Brooklyn was supposed to join Arsenals training academy but unfortunately he failed to make the cut, it was announced that he had not managed to get a sponsorship in February

One of a handful of appearances  where neither his mother or father played chaperone. He also attended the premiere of If I Stay (in which Chloe stars) without them in Hollywood in August.

But despite this move into the limelight Brooklyn, it seems, remains grounded. In fact, it has been widely reported that he has a job in a local coffee shop which apparently pays him just £2.68 an hour.

He is also a hands-on big brother to his younger siblings Cruz, nine, and Romeo, 12, and sister Harper, three, often photographed carrying and cuddling her.

And he still enjoys the same hobbies that most young teenagers enjoy such as skateboarding and hanging out with his friends. 

Unlike most teenagers though, Brooklyn does have a superstar sporting legend as a father, and he is tipped to follow in his dad David’s footballing footsteps.

However, a spanner was recently thrown in the works for the young star after he was dropped from Arsenals training academy after failing to earn himself a scholarship.
