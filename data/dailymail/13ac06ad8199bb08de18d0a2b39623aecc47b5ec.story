Kevin Hart has been asked where he stands with Sony after leaked emails showed that one studio executive labeled him a 'whore' for wanting more money to promote his film on social media.

Hart was out in Los Angeles on Monday night when he was asked if her would work for the studio again, but refused to answer the questions.

This as a possible new leaked email claims the actor was paid millions to promote two films on Twitter to his 14.8 million followers.

An affable Hart politely declined to tell a TMZ reporter if he planned on working with Sony in the future, the studio that is releasing his next two films, The Wedding Ringer and Get Hard.

'I don't answer those questions,' said Hart, who went on to say that he is 'politically correct' and 'a happy guy.'

Meanwhile, in an email posted to BikiniRobotArmy, a Twitter account that has been posting leaked email exchanges, producer Clint Culpepper responds to an inquiry as to whether or not the actor might send out a tweet promoting the Denzel Washington film The Equalizer by saying, 'Yep. He owes us. I also got him to tweet on NGD. We paid him an extra 2M to tweet on 2 pictures. Let me [see] what I can do. What would you have him tweet? A :15 spot saying check it out and I can’t wait to see this? Or "how excited am I to see Equalizer this weekend?"' 

NGD is likely a reference to the Idris Elba film No Good Deed, which Hart sent on a tweet promoting in early September. 

'Make sure yo go support my Brother @willpowerpacker this weekend by seeing "No Good Deed" .... @TherealTaraji & Idris kill this movie!' wrote the actor on September 12.

Interestingly enough, Culpepper is the same executive who called Hart a 'whore' after members of his team asked that he be compensated for promoting one of his upcoming film's on social media.

Culpepper was emailing Sony Pictures Chair Amy Pascal at the time, who responded to his diatribe with a brief note implying she was aware of the situation.

hart responded by writing on his Instagram; 'Knowing your self worth is extremely important people.

'I worked very hard to get where I am today. I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taking advantage of.

'I OWN MY BRAND…I MAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR MY BRAND….I PROTECT MY BRAND….which is why I’m able to brush ignorance off of my shoulder and continue to move forward.

'I refuse to be broken people…with that being said its now time for me to get back to building this empire that I’ve always dreamed of!!!'
