A few years ago, it would have been very unusual to find them gracing the fruit bowl.

But they are now the fastest-selling exotic fruit in Britain.

Sales of persimmons overtook kiwi fruit, mangos and avocados in the build up to Christmas, according to industry experts.

More than four million of the fruit, which resemble bright orange tomatoes, were sold in British supermarkets in 2012 – double the number sold the previous year.

Experts put the success of persimmons down to their health benefits.

They are rich in vitamins A and C, contain calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium and have twice as much fibre per 100g than an apple.

And, perhaps most importantly at the start of the new year, research has shown persimmons help lower the density of alcohol in the blood which, along with the sweetness, makes them a great hangover cure.

At around 50p each, they are also cheaper than most exotic fruits.

Persimmons, which are mainly grown in China and Japan, can be eaten with the skin on without special preparation and can be used in salads, with chicken, lamb or pork, or to make desserts.

Dean Hayden, exotic fruit buyer for Asda, said: ‘The market for persimmon is growing at a huge rate. Persimmon is a very accessible fruit.

'It’s consistently sweet, you can eat it hard like an apple or soft like a peach and importantly you waste nothing, not even the skin, which is edible.

‘Customers get great satisfaction from their purchase and repeat sales tell us it’s a favourite and will continue surprising many more customers to come.

‘Several years ago the produce industry were saying persimmon would be the new kiwi fruit.

‘They were right but it’s taken until now for us to develop; we now have a better understanding and control of the processes required to deliver this great value and versatile fruit that we see today, better late than never.’
