Popular choice: Peanut Butter sales have reached an all time high

Britons shelled out more than £1million a week for peanut butter last year resulting in sales of the savoury spread reaching a record high.

As jam and marmalade fall out of favour, new research reveals peanut butter is now the popular choice of spread for many.

According to market analysts Mintel, sales of peanut butter have increased by 20 per cent in the past two years, growing from £47 million to £56 million in 2012.

Volume sales increased by a similar amount of 17 per cent over the same period, to reach nearly 60 million jars.

As peanut butter sales rocket, sweet toothed Britons have also been splashing out on chocolate spread with sales up 24 per cent to £46 million in 2012.

Almost one in 10 (seven per cent) Britons have switched from jam or marmalade to peanut butter or chocolate spread.

Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink at Mintel, said: 'Peanut butter and chocolate spread have become popular choices for the family breakfast, gaining share at the expense of traditional favourites jam and marmalade.

'Both spreads have benefited from increased innovation and marketing campaigns to widen usage occasions. Moreover, growing economic pressure has forced more consumers to cook at home, so variety has become particularly important especially for households with children.'

Overall, sales of sweet spreads reached £389 million in 2012, up from £367 in 2010, an increase of six per cent between 2010 and 2012.

Despite the increasing popularity of peanut butter and chocolate spreads, the nation remains sweet on jam. 

Jam is still bought by 67 per cent of consumers and is still the largest sector within the sweet spreads category, with a value and volume share of 30% and 36% in 2012 respectively.

But, while jam accounts for the biggest market share, sales have remained flat at £118 million between 2010 and 2012.

Traditional: Sales of jam and marmalade are down with consumers opting for jars of peanut butter

But it is bittersweet news for marmalade, which accounted for just 14 per cent of the market value in 2012, with sales down by seven per cent over the past two years to £56 million in 2012.

In terms of age, usage of marmalade peaks among the over 55s (57%) compared to 18 per cent of 16-24 year olds.

Ms Soininen said: 'While sales of marmalade have suffered, there is no doubt that the market could benefit from an ageing population.

'Steps to enhance the health image of marmalade products by incorporating more added health benefits such as vitamins, energising ingredients, antioxidants and added fibre, could offer product standout.'

Honey has shown resilience to rising prices in the sector, growing ahead of the overall sweet spread market.

Value sales of honey increased eight per cent between 2010 and 2012, to reach £107 million. 

'Honey usage has been driven by its health positioning and natural credentials, as well as premium varieties such as Manuka.

'Honey's natural health associations have given it a more up-to-date image, than other more traditional spreads.'
