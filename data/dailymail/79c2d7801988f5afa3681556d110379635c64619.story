Controversial: A new rival book titled No Easy Op alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote No Easy Day, could have been motivated by revenge on SEAL Team 6

He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

But the Navy SEAL who wrote the first hand account of the mission could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades.

A rival book alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote ‘No Easy Day’, had ‘bad blood’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit.

‘No Easy Op’ claims that the soldier was ‘ostracized’ when he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting.

Feeling scorned Bissonnette could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction.

No Easy Day, which is due out tomorrow, is the first account of the bin Laden operation from a member of the squad who was there.

But it has proved controversial because Bissonnette, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen, did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it.

It also disagrees with the official White House version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the Obama administration consternation.

According to the New York Times, the book says that Bissonnette was ‘repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service’ with nothing but rejection.

The rival book claims that Bissonnette, seen in this photo talking to TV show 60 Minutes about the Osama bin Laden Pakistan raid, was rejected by his comrades after he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business

It claims he was ‘ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to Virginia from a training operation’, before eventually leaving.

The book says: ‘In the infantry-bred world of Army Special Operations, no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics,’

Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider last Thursday

No Easy Op has been written by sofrep.com, a web site for former Special Operations team members.

Brandon Webb, a former SEAL sniper who founded the site, said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the bin Laden team, although none of them are identified.

Talking to the New York Times, Mr Webb refused to say whether Bissonnette was involved in No Easy Op, even though he has spoken to him in the past.

seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV 
programme showing an image of President Obama

Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this 
compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces - and Matt Bissonette 
claims that if SEAL Team 6 had never made it there they were to explain 
that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their Pakistani allies

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad 
compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the 
Situation Room of the White House

In a statement, Kevin Maurer, one of the co-authors of No Easy Day said: ‘After spending several very intense months working with Mark Owen on this book, I know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending America all over the world.

‘Any suggestion otherwise is as ill informed as it is inaccurate.

‘What’s more, Mark has an unshakable respect for the US military, in particular the men he served with.

‘That’s why not one negative word was written about anyone he served with.’

whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first 
fired upon him
