When 23-year-old Rhonda Kristen Casto fell to her death on a hike with her boyfriend six years ago authorities ruled it a tragic accident caused by slippery conditions on the steep trail. 

The young Portland, Oregon mother's case was reopened last week however, when Casto's then-boyfriend Stephen Wagner Nichols, 40, was arrested at San Francisco International Airport and charged with her murder.

Nichols did not appear to be a suspect in his 9-years-younger girlfriend's death when her lifeless body was found at the bottom of an 100-foot embankment on March 16, 2009.

Killer boyfriend? Stephen Wagner Nichols, now 40 (left), was arrested at the San Francisco Airport on February 12 in connection to the 2009 death of his then-girlfriend Rhonda Kristen Casto, 23 (right). Casto's falling death during a hike was ruled accidental at the time 

The victim's mother told FOX 12 at the time that Casto was mother to a young daughter. 

'I think about her last moments, and what she was thinking when she fell,' Casto's mother said in March 2009. 'How she's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps. And how I'm never going to get to see my daughter again.'

Not many details were released about Casto's death at the time, other than that a 'male companion' (now identified as Nichols), called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the Eagle Creek Trail, about 45 minutes east of Portland.

The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past, due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine. 

The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery. 

Consequences: If convicted, Nichols could face 25 years to life in prison for Casto's (pictured) murder 

Heartbreaking: Family members say Casto left behind a young daughter, and confirmed that she was dating Nichols at the time of her death

Narrow: At the time, Casto's death was ruled accidental. It was then believed that she slipped of the trail. Pictures of the Eagle Creek Trail show how narrow it becomes at points 

Casto was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on Columbia River Gorge trails like Eagle Creek that year. 

'The trail is very steep and narrow there, and it's been pretty wet and slippery,' Hood River County sheriff's Deputy Matt English told The Oregonian in 2009. 'There was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot.'

It's currently unclear why Casto's case was reopened, and the cause of death switched to homicide. 

However, authorities say that a grand jury was assembled last April and that they filed a secret indictment for Nichols' arrest on one count of  murder.

He was arrested February 12 at the San Francisco Airport. It's unclear if the Bend, Oregon man was doing at the airport. 

Nichols is currently being held without bail, after being arraigned in Hood River Court on Friday. he  faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

His next court appearance is scheduled for March 3 at 11am.
