Claire Diaz-Ortiz didn't need to make 'the call' that she had gone into labor.

Friends, family and the 332,000 other people that follow the long-time Twitter employee on the social media site were all-to-aware of each step of her dramatic delivery this weekend, because she posted about the process live for the world to see.

What started with questioning whether her water had broken about 4.30am on Saturday finished with the arrivial of her daughter, Lucia Paz Diaz-Ortiz, some 14 hours later - and a whole lot more in between.

Commitment: Claire Diaz-Ortiz - an early employee at Twitter, where she  leads the social innovation department - has live-Tweeted through the labor of her first child

Where it all started: Claire Diaz-Ortiz, who lives in Buenos Aires with her husband, Tweeted this at 4.30am Saturday

According to BuzzFeed, Claire's live labor was occurring in Buenos Aires, where she lives with her husband.

The couple had great difficulty getting to the ER, with their car overheating twice.

They eventually left the car on the side of the road and, after a short wait, managed to find a taxi.

By this point, numerous celebrity Twitter followers of Claire's, such as Ugly Betty actress America Ferrera and model Christy Turlington, had sent her messages of support.

Claire managed to maintain a strong sense of humor throughout the process, specifically making fun of her husband and commenting that her doctor looks just like reality TV star Bethenny Frankel.

DÃ­az-Ortiz is also an author, speaker, and technology innovator.

Her book Twitter for Good: Change the World, One Tweet at a Time is credited as being the first how-to guide for social media philanthropy.

She has also written Greater Expectations: Succeed (and Stay Sane) in an On-Demand, All-Access, Always-On Age.

No doubt a book about motherhood will soon be in the works.

And finally, just like her dedicated mom, little Lucia got her own Twitter account, moments after being born.
