You may think any superyacht would be large and luxurious enough for the most discerning of people.

But now the world’s most luxurious vessel has enough room for guests and an entourage of helpers because it features its own detachable floating bungalows and even a swimming pool and garden.

The 250ft long (77metre) vessel has been designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules so that guests don’t get under the owner’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea.

The 250ft long (77metre) vessel has been designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules so that guests don’t get under the owner’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea. This concept shows that friends, children and the owners could all have separate floating 'bungalows' while the vessel is anchored

The brochure for the superyacht shows modules being towed along until the vessel reaches its destination. Once anchored, the modules can be separated and used as tiny floating boltholes.

It also has its own inflatable walk-ashore pontoon so guests can move straight from the boat onto the beach without dipping their toes in the water.

Despite its enormous size, owners could sail the carbon-fibre yacht very close to the shore because of its shallow hull design.

A giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got, guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness.

The yacht, called the 77m X R-Evolution, is still a concept but its designers say it could be made for hundreds of millions of pounds.

The luxurious creation is the brainchild of yacht designers Pastrovich Studio from Monaco.

Its brochure reads: The ‘77m X R-Evolution is a mother-ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up.

‘Imagine - instead of guest apartments, each daughter vessel is a different luxury object: a swimming pool, a garden, even an artificial beach complete with its own palm trees.

A giro system (illustrated) would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas are, so guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness

The ship is currently only a concept. This design shows that it could be built with berths for motorboats and a swimming pool connected to a hexagonal 'dining island' which would create an incredible setting for dinner

The X R-Evolution is currently a concept and would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build.

It would measure 250ft (77metres).

It is designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules.

Modules could include ‘bungalows,’ a swimming pool, garden, artificial beach, dining area and ship berths to suit an owner’s needs.

The carbon fibre yacht has a shallow hull design s it can anchor close to the shore.

A giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got. 

‘Lay anchor in the Virgin Islands and deploy your apartments anywhere you desire.

‘Be waited on hand and foot by the crew living aboard the mother-ship or go it alone in your own isolated beach fronted apartment.’

‘Combine this with the simple, inflatable, modular jetty connected directly to the beach and guests can move freely between the mother ship and their own private apartment.’

Emanuele Gallo Perozzi, a spokesman for Pastrovich Studio, said: ‘In this project our main goal was to assure the owner total privacy.

‘On a luxury 77 metre yacht there are up to 40 crew working all the time and so the owners and their guests sometimes need to escape.

‘Usually, clients ask us to develop small, fast tenders they can use to spend a night at anchor far from the main vessel.

‘So we thought why don't we provide the main vessel with one or more “bungalows” that can be detached and anchored as the owner desire?

‘These bungalows can be set as rest places, floating swimming pools, private gardens, floating platforms with real sand.’

The vessel's brochure reads: The ‘77m X R-Evolution is a mother-ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up.' Modules of a bungalow and swimming pool with an area for sunbathing can be seen being towed along by the yacht in this illustration

If someone did pay the vast sum of money needed to build their bespoke yacht, complete with floating modules, they could choose their own modules and play with the configuration of them being towed along. These designs show how a pool, dining area and boat berths could be arranged
