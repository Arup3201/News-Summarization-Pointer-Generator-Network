If you usually take armfuls of outfits into the changing room but end up with just one at the till, don’t worry ladies – you’re not alone.

Only one in ten of the items tried on in clothes shops end up being bought, a survey found.

Even those that make it out of the store may never be worn, according to the research.

The average woman spends around £40 a month on clothes which simply linger at the back of her wardrobe.

Four in ten British women go shopping once a fortnight and eight in ten say they love the experience

But while they may be particularly picky in a high street changing room, women are much more likely to keep goods bought online.

A quarter of all clothes bought on the internet are never returned to retailers.

The survey also revealed that British women struggle to define their personal style.

Only 39 per cent of the 2,000 who were
questioned claimed to be confident about knowing which clothes and 
accessories suited their look and figure.

Despite their struggles in the changing room, most women – 81 per cent – said they enjoyed shopping for clothes.

One in ten said they went shopping on a
daily basis, while the same proportion said they bought ‘fashion’ 
items once a week. But by far the biggest number – 40 per cent – said 
they were most likely to hit the high street every fortnight.

British women are not so good at spotting what suits them from the hanger

The remaining number said they went shopping around once a month. The survey also showed the growing pull of online retailing.

Forty-five per cent of the women who 
took part said their preferred to buy their clothes on the internet, 
compared with 38 per cent who still liked to shop in-store.

When asked to evaluate how much they 
spent on unworn or returned fashion-related items, 37 per cent said the 
cost was ‘between £20 and £40’ each month. The research was carried out 
by website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk.

Its spokesman said: ‘I was quite 
surprised to see how many women admitted to wasting money on purchasing 
fashion related items that did not suit them.

‘Wasting money on items that you do not need or will not wear is a sure fire way to land in debt.’

But he added: ‘It is reassuring at least to see so many being smart with their personal purchasing choices.

‘If items don’t appear to suit them in
the changing room, it seems British women are leaving them firmly on 
the rail in the shop.’

One in four fashion items purchased online by the respondents was either returned or remained unworn
