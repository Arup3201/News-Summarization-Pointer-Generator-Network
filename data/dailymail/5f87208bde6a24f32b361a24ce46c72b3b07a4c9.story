The report warns the CQC is not carrying out enough inspections to ensure patients are not at risk

The health watchdog has lost the confidence of the public after missing some of the worst scandals in hospitals and care homes, according to MPs.

The Care Quality Commission is not carrying out enough adequate inspections to ensure patients are not at risk, they said.

In a scathing report, MPs from the health select committee warn that ‘patients, relatives and the public do not have confidence in the CQC’s standards or the outcomes of its inspections’.

The watchdog had declared that the maternity unit at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria, where up to seven babies died, was providing ‘safe’ and ‘high-quality’ care.

The CQC also failed to act after being contacted by a whistleblower at Winterbourne View care home, in Bristol, where staff were torturing adults with learning difficulties. It inspected the home only after a BBC Panorama investigation.

The CQC is responsible for 30,000 care homes, hospitals and GP practices. Last February its chief executive, Cynthia Bower, was forced to resign, albeit with a £1.4million pension pot. It has since promised to overhaul the way it is run.

Inspectors visited the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria in 2010 and claimed that it was meeting all ‘essential standards’.

But the maternity unit is now the centre of a police investigation over the deaths of seven babies and two mothers since 2008 and a coroner has warned that midwives may have ‘colluded’ to alter medical records and cover up their mistakes.

And the Winterbourne View care home in Bristol has since been closed down and six workers have been jailed for neglect and abuse.

The report says the watchdog needs to ‘raise the bar’ when inspecting care homes.

Often the CQC inspects a home and concludes it is safe - even though patients and relatives are concerned the care is poor.

The watchdog has been repeatedly criticised over the last two years amid concerns it is not protecting the public.

Tory MP Stephen Dorrell, chair of the committee said: ‘The CQC’s primary focus should be to ensure that the public has confidence that its inspections provide an assurance of acceptable standards in care and patient safety.

‘We do not believe that the CQC has yet succeeded in this objective.

‘The CQC needs to ensure that its inspections represent a challenging process which is designed to find service shortcomings where they exist, ensure, when appropriate that service providers address them rapidly, and report promptly both to providers and users of the service.

‘The CQC also needs to show that it treats feedback from the public as free intelligence and that it acts swiftly when serious complaints are brought to light this way.’

David Behan, the CQC’s new chief executive said: ‘In our strategic review we consulted widely on a clear statement of our purpose and role.

‘We also set out our intentions to improve how we communicate with the public, make better use of information, and work more effectively as an organisation and with others, including those who provide care.

‘We have already begun to make some of these changes and will continue this process next year.’
