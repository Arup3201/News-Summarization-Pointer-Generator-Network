Maths: Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, said he had not 'done the arithmetic' on what impact green levies make on bills

Energy bills will still rise even if the government cuts green levies, one of the country’s biggest power firms admitted today.

Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, signalled that his firm will join the other four big energy firms in pushing up prices before the winter hits.

Yesterday he compared environment charges on bills to a 'stealth poll tax' pushing up prices for everyone.

But today he admitted that he did not actually know what their impact was and had not ‘done the arithmetic’ on how much they actually added to bills.

MPs last night tore into the Big Six energy companies, accusing them of 'abuse' by driving up prices, which means families across Britain struggle to afford to heat their homes.

They accused the firms of giving 'meaningless' statements as they sought to blame variously increased transport costs, green energy schemes and investment in new power stations for their decision to hike bills.

Mr Cocker was the only senior executive to appear, with the other firms sending junior managers or PR men.

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

Today Mr Cocker stepped up his criticism of environment measures, which the government demands are funded through bills.

But he refused to rule out price rises in the coming weeks, saying on BBC Radio 4: ‘Our prices have not yet gone up, we haven’t announced anything.

‘We continue to keep it under review. We will keep any price rises as low as possible for as long as possible.

‘Fundamentally things in the energy mix keep driving costs up.'

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

the cost of going green

The Big Six energy firms are ripping off customers and acting 'like a cartel', the boss of a smaller competitor has claimed.

Ecotricity's Dale Vince said energy companies had been taking advantage of consumers since the utilities were privatised and the market is 'dysfunctional'.

Mr Vince said wholesale costs alone could not justify the increase in bills.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'They have cited three factors: the rising cost of wholesale fossil fuels, Government levies and the cost of distribution.

'All three of those are valid, in the case of wholesale price rises right now, if you look back over 12 months, then they are not justified in raising their retail prices because of wholesale movements in this year.

'We had a close look at that and therefore announced our own price freeze.'

Mr Vince added: 'I don't think you need an inquiry to tell you this market is dysfunctional, you just have to look at it. Six big players have a 95 per cent market share and they seem to operate like a cartel, the prices go up in conjunction.'

Mr Cocker again complained about social costs, environmental obligations and the upgrading of networks as reasons for companies continuing to put prices up.

He said: ‘If you take those [green taxes] off then pound for pound we will take off those costs.’

But when pushed on how much those costs are, Mr Cocker said he had not got the exact figures to hand.

‘I haven’t done the arithmetic to see what the total picture is but what we would say is pound for pound we would take those costs off.’

David Cameron has promised to ‘roll back’ green levies on bills, with the government expected to fund insulation programmes and help for elderly people to keep warm through general taxation.

Mr Cocker added: ‘There are many more discussions to be had with the Government to remove these [green taxes] from the bill and make them as efficient as possible.’

Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were scrapped.

Mr Cocker told MPs yesterday that green levies acted as a 'regressive stealth tax essentially' 
and should be paid for from general taxation and not imposed on energy 
bills.

Neil Clitheroe, chief executive 
officer of Scottish Power, revealed the firm's planned rise of 8.6 per 
cent had triggered a furious response from customers.

He told MPs: 'We immediately got customers calling us worrying about their bills after our price rise last week.

'We had 60,000 customers call us almost straight away with worries about their bills.'

But during the hearing in Parliament yesterday, Labour MP John Robertson warned that 'thousands' of people were dying of hypothermia because they could not afford to pay their bills.

He said customers who fell into debt were being moved onto pre-payment meters which effectively forced them to 'self-disconnect' because they could not afford to buy any credits.

Labour MP Ian Lavery highlighted reports that more than three million elderly people feared that they would not be able to keep themselves warm during the winter.

'The report also said that 24,000 people could die because of the hikes in energy prices from yourcompanies.

'It is an absolute outrage that that is being allowed to happen in one of the richest economies in the world. It is an absolute abuse from the big six energy companies,' he added.

Soaring profits: This graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up. The wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable

Ofgem analysis shows that the average bill stood at £1,320 this month, up £70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year.

Wholesale energy costs – which 
make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed, up 
just 1.67 per cent or £10 in a year.

VAT, operating and other costs make up £1,255 of the bill, up £40 or 3.29 per cent.

However the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills, up 111 per cent from £45 in 2012 to £95 now.
