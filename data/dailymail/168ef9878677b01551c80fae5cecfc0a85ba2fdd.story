A hard-working nurse was killed by a lorry outside his own hospital after he tripped on a pavement and fell under the wheels.

Male nurse Anecito Obsioma, 55, had volunteered to work an extra shift in the NHS hospital when he fell into the path of the heavy goods truck.

An inquest heard the Filipino-born nurse - known to friends as Cito - was supposed to be on a day off.

But instead he offered to work an extra shift so he could send more money back to help his family pay for his terminally-ill sister's medical bills in the Philippines.

Tragedy: Anecito Obsioma was on his way to work when he tripped and fell under the wheels of a lorry and suffered 'catastrophic injuries'. He was hoping to earn more money to help pay for his sister's medical bills

He stumbled on the kerb and fell under its wheels just yards away from the hospital's A&E department.

An inquest heard Mr Obsioma suffered 'catastrophic injuries' after falling under the rear wheels of the Scania lorry as it delivered food to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Doctors and nurses immediately rushed to his aid, but they were unable to save him and he died just hours later.

His partner Robert Sullivan said he was 'disgusted' by the state of the pavements at the site of the accident on the roads around the hospital grounds.

Repair works at the time forced pedestrians to walk into the road or ambulance bay outside A&E before returning to the pavement where Mr Obsioma tripped.

Mr Sullivan said: 'It was his day off but he went in for the overtime to try to earn a bit more money to send home for his sister's medical expenses.

'He loved his work and his patients. He always cared for everyone.'

Popular: Mr Obsioma - known as Cito to friends - was hugely popular and described as a devoted nurse who 'loved his work and his patients'

Cardiff coroner's court was told Mr Obsioma had been a theatre nurse for 10 years at the largest hospital in Wales.

On the morning of the tragedy he was 'a little bit late' as he walked to the hospital from his nearby home in the Cathays area of the Welsh capital.

Lorry driver Michael Wilkins told the inquest it was around 8.10am on November 12 last year when he noticed a man, later identified as Mr Obsioma, crossing the road.

Mr Wilkins said: 'I saw someone walking on my left hand side and as I passed him he seemed to be stepping onto the pavement when he stumbled.

'I looked in my left wing mirror and I saw him hit the side of the truck and bounce off it and fall onto the pavement.

'I didn't see if I had run over him. I hit the brakes and ran back and he was on the road and already being looked after by people.'

Hospital visitor Geoffrey Watson was driving in the opposite direction when he saw Mr Obsioma stumble and fall under the rear wheels on the lorry.

Mr Watson said: 'The pavement wasn't in very good condition and he missed his footing and fell under the back wheels.

'People came out from A&E straight away to attend to him.'

CCTV cameras caught the moment the NHS nurse hit the curb with his right foot as he attempted to step back onto the pavement from the road.

The inquest heard doctors desperately tried to save their colleague but after two hours he succumbed to the 'catastrophic injuries' he suffered.

Accident: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where Mr Obsioma died

Assistant Coroner Tom Atherton said there were no drugs or alcohol in Mr Obsioma's system which could have led to him being unsteady on his feet that morning.

Mr Atherton said Mr Obsioma's died from 'multiple injuries' after the 'tragic accident'.

He said: 'It is quite clear he stumbled as he first made contact with the pavement, which caused him to stumble and fall into the road.

'He was most unfortunate that a lorry was passing at the time and as a consequence Cito, having stumbled, fell into the road and under the rear wheels.

'The injuries he received were extremely serious and despite the efforts of the emergency department at the hospital nothing could be done to save his life and he passed away two hours later.'

The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.
