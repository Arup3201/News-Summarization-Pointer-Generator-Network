A photographer has spent five years driving across America taking photos that represent a wide swath of the country.

Curran Hatleberg, who has driven from coast to coast five times or more, says he was interested in looking for ‘sort of shared familiarity and human contact in a country I called home but I didn’t know much about’.

He spent the five years shooting the two ongoing photographic series, Dogwood and The Crowded Edge, and says he never really knew where he was going when he got into his car.

Sometimes he would travel with the intention of eventually landing on a friend’s or family member’s couch, but the destination could change on a whim.

‘Initially, it was spawned by a desire to see what I could see and learn something along the way and have an adventure,’ Hatleberg tells Slate.

He says he tried to take pictures that serve as ‘open-ended imaginative space’ where the viewer’s interpretation of the image was not guided by preconceptions about the region.

‘If it becomes too specific, there's less room for creative imagination on the part of the viewer.’

Hatleberg says his journey was a quest to find moments that contained ‘colliding emotional spaces’, often a sense of beauty combined with a sense of sadness.
