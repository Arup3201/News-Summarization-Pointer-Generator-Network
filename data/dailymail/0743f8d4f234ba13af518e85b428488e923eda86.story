NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has told German officials he is prepared to testify over the extent to which the U.S. government tapped Angela Merkel's phone, it is claimed.

The former CIA intelligence officer met with German MP Hans-Christian Stroebele in Moscow to discuss him becoming a star witness in a possible future public inquiry.

And, in an escalation in the diplomatic row, prosecutors have hinted they are prepared to defy an American extradition request in order for fugitive Snowden to testify in Germany.

Mr Stroebele told ARD channel: 'He 
expressed his principle readiness to help clarify the situation. Basis 
for this is what we must create. That’s what we discussed for a long 
time and from all angles.'

The
MP, 74, who is a member of the German parliament's control committee 
which is responsible for monitoring the work of intelligence agencies, 
added: 'He is essentially prepared to come to Germany and give 
testimony, but the conditions must be discussed.'

Germany's
outrage over reports of bugging of chancellor Merkel's phone by the U.S. National 
Security Agency (NSA) prompted it to summon the U.S. ambassador for the first time in living memory, an unprecedented post-war 
diplomatic rift.

Germany's parliament will hold a special session on November 18 to discuss the tapping, and the Greens and far-left Left party have demanded a public inquiry calling in witnesses including Snowden.

The
German Federal Prosecutor’s Office may summon Snowden to be a witness 
in the case, German justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
told Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday.

'If
our suspicions prove correct and a case is opened, the German Federal 
Prosecutor’s Office will have to consider the possibility of 
interrogating Snowden as a witness,' she said.

If Snowden were to come to Germany for the case, the EU country could breach US’ requests for extradition, the minister added.

Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger also said that the phone tapping is illegal and constitutes a crime, therefore those responsible should be held accountable.

Thursday's encounter was Snowden's first known meeting with a foreign politician.

It is also his first known meeting with any specific foreigner other than his father and a group of former U.S. national security officials he met in early October.

Earlier this week it emerged Snowden had begun a working for a large Moscow-based website.

The 30-year-old American fugitive's new role is surrounded by secrecy for 'security reasons', it was claimed.

But his lawyer has denied that Snowden will be a state employee.

News of his new role comes as a picture purporting to show Snowden on a tour boat on the Moscow river was shown by Life News.

The former National Security Agency contractor is behind a series of major intelligence links on US and British snooping of telephones and the internet.

city

His Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, who denied the post was as a state employee, said: 'Edward starts work in November.'

'He will provide support for a large Russian site,' he said, refusing to name the new employer or give details of his role.

Snowden fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges.

President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually.

Snowden has been spotted only a handful of times in Moscow.

The Russians imply there is a risk he could be kidnapped or assassinated by the CIA.

Western sources say the fact he is being concealed in Russia shows he is under the control of the Moscow secret services.

Not working for the Russians: Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia after going on the run from the US, is not taking up a state job according to his lawyer

A picture purporting to show Snowden was released on Thursday by a Russian site with close ties to the secret services.

He was wearing a cap, without glasses, leaning on the rail of a tour boat on the Moscow River. In the background is Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.

The same website earlier this month published a photograph of Snowden pushing a shopping trolley, later confirmed as authentic by his Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena.

The photograph 'proves that the former US agent either lives permanently in Moscow or visits regularly,' claimed the site.
