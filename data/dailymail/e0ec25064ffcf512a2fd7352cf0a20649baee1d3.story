New data this week shows more American women are choosing to give birth at home opposed to in a hospital setting at an increase of 29 per cent in recent years.

The two-digit percentage increase between 2004 and 2009 after a 14-year decline was compiled through birth certificates of American-born babies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2009 the agency saw the highest number of home births ever recorded at 29,650 since the data first began collecting in 1989.

At home: More women are choosing to deliver their babies at home than ever with a 29 per cent increase in recent years according to a report this week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

'Itâ€™s women who are consciously rejecting the system,' says the report's coauthor Eugene Declercq, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University to MSNBC.

According to the report's findings, the most common participants are women 35 and older and those who have had several previous children.

The recent years' spike is attributed to non-Hispanic white women whose numbers increased by 36 per cent - from .80 per cent in 2004 to 1.09 per cent in 2009.

Boost in figures: The report found that 2009 had the highest number of home births ever recorded at 29,650 since the agency first began documenting them in 1989 with White non-Hispanic women composing the recent surge

With those numbers the report finds that one in every 90 births for non-Hispanic white women is now at home.

Those home deliveries typically go under the care of a midwife.

Marian MacDorman, a statistician with 
the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the CDC, 
emphasized to HealthDay News that that increase is 'pretty large,' 
notably for a four-year period.

Coinciding
with the uptick in numbers, the risk profile for home births have also 
declined - the numbers of home births having lapsed in the earlier years
between 1990 and 2004.

The risks reported with at-home 
delivery, which is recommended only to those experiencing a healthy, 
low-risk pregnancy, can be fetal distress, cord prolapse, hemorrhage, 
high blood pressure and premature rupture of membranes leading to the 
mother's transfer to a hospital, according to the American Pregnancy 
Association.

Hollywood talk: Film documentary The Business Of Being Born produced by talk show host Ricki Lake drew criticism from the American Medical Association which later delivered a report on the risks involved with at-home deliveries

With the recent decline in home risks, additional reasons for the recent increase in home births may be the desire for a 'low-intervention' birth, the mother having specifically desired surroundings, a so-called Hollywood motivation, and even lower costs.

'An average uncomplicated vaginal birth costs about 60% less in a home than in a hospital,' the American Pregnancy Association states on its website.

Hollywood celebrities undergoing home births and even publicly documenting their experience, such as talk-show host Ricki Lake who produced a film titled the Business of Being Born, may also play a factor in the recent increase.

Motivated: Talk show host Ricki Lake gave birth to her second child at home, similar to most other women according to the recent report, leading her to produce the documentary The Business of Being Born

'When they see celebrities doing it, they think 'Oh, this is a great idea,'' Dr. Mary L 
Rosser, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx told HealthDay News

Gisele Bunchen, wife of NFL New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, gave birth to their son at home in a bathtub in 2009, as well as model Cindy Crawford, actress Pamela Anderson, actor John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston, actress Meryl Streep, and actress Demi Moore with actor Bruce Willis.

'I can't imagine they are scared everyone will have a home birth because I did,' Ms Lake told the New York Daily News after the American Medical Association feared her documentary advocated home birthing without emphasizing the risks.

In 2008 following, the association publicly warned those risks.

Dr Rosser herself, who believes she sees the celebrity trend, notes that she personally doesn't recommend it to her own patients.

'I emphasize to people there is a two - to threefold increased risk of 
neonatal mortality,' Dr Rosser said explaining that even when there's a low-risk pregnancy, things can go wrong.

'You cannot 
predict postpartum hemorrhage,' Dr Rosser said.

Like the statistics found in this week's report by the CDC, Ms Lake's first child was delivered in a hospital while her second was at home.

'After the first birth, I felt intrigued to learn about midwifery...' she told Babble.

'My second son's birth was something I researched for a long time, and then I had this birth experience that was so positively transformative,' she said.

According to the Boston Globe, Gisele Bunchen was inspired by Ms Lake's documentary leading to her choice of having an at-home birth.

'It's so great to hear that (Gisele) had a positive home-birth 
experience,' Ms Lake responded to the Globe following. 'Not only because it was at home 
and in water, but because it says a lot to girls who follow her.'
