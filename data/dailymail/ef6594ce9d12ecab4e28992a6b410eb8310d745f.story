London Fashion Week has been and gone in a flash, and my main focus has of course been on the beauty trends. 

From bold brights at Burberry and glossy minimalism at Christopher Kane to the downright kooky pastel-painted brows at Badgley Mischka, I can safely say I'm now stocked up on some serious beauty as well as fashion inspiration.

One of my favourite beauty looks from the SS15 shows came from Marchesa, who sent their models down the catwalk in floaty festival florals, led by the gorgeous Georgia May Jagger.

This week Binky has been recreating her favourite looks from London Fashion Week 

The make-up at Marchesa combined fresh, flawless skin with Bardot-esque lined eyes, blending inspiration from both the sleek and glossy look of Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge and the carefree, rock-chick style of It-girls Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne.

Lucy, Spencer and I appeared on a special edition of The Million Pound Drop last week, where I went for a very similar beauty look featuring a 60s style eye and peachy lip. It's a timeless look that's both wearable and bang on trend - here's how to get it:

Binky took inspiration from the Marchesa SS15 show that saw Georgia May Jagger take to the runway

GET THE LOOK

THE BASE

First, create a velvety-smooth base by spritzing a layer of DiorSkin Airflash Spray Foundation onto your face and buffing in with a foundation brush. 

The super-light, silky formulation airbrushes away blemishes whilst giving the complexion a radiant glow for a flawless, catwalk-ready finish.

Binky says that it is important to get a velvety smooth base to create a soft natural look

Binky has opted for soft peachy tones for a subtle spring time look

THE EYES

Start by applying a neutral taupe or beige shadow like Daniel Sandler Matte Shadow Compact in Cedar. Use a fluffy brush to blend the shadow all over your eyelids, to subtly define your socket line and disguise any discolouration on the lid.

Next, for a sleek and streamlined eye, flick a liquid liner like DHC Liquid Eyeliner EX across your upper lash line. 

Follow up with generous lashings of Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara on your top and bottom lashes. Add a touch of nonchalant rock-chick definition to your lower lash line by wiggling the brush over the lash right from the root.

Binky's make-up this week is made up of peachy tones so can be worn during the day

Gently fill in your brows with the Clarins Eyebrow Pencil, warming the nib with your fingers so the colour looks soft and natural. 

Use the handy brush on the other end of the pencil to blend the colour into your brows, brushing in light upward strokes for a fashion-forward, full finish.

THE CONTOUR

Brush a slight dusting of Caudalie Mineral Bronzing Powder just under the cheekbones to add some some warmth and definition to your face. For a subtly radiant glow, sweep a touch of Too Faced Absolutely Invisible Candlelight Highlighter across the tops of your cheekbones.

Binky's calender is released in just a few weeks and apparently much of it involves shots of the reality star in her underwear

THE LIPS

Finally, add a pretty pop of coral-pink colour to your lips with Dior Rouge Trianon Edition Couture Colour Lipstick in Rose Crinoline. 

Use a lip brush to apply the colour in a light, sheer layer, giving your pout a natural flush. To fake a Jagger-style full pout, dab a slick of Vaseline on to the centre of your lips.

I also wanted to tell you some exciting news – my 2015 calendar is going to be released in just a few short weeks! 

I've been finalising the images for each month, and I can reveal that quite a few more pics of me in my favourite lingerie by Bluebella made the cut.  

Stay beautiful,
