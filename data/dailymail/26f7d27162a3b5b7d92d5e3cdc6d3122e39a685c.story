Hapless: Florin Constantin, 28, was caught red-handed with 10 mobiles phones in Norwich

A Romanian thief who wore specially-adapted leggings under his trousers to hide 10 mobile phones he stole from a gig has been jailed.

Florin Constantin, 28, was caught red-handed when the owners desperately called their phones and they started ringing.

The crook had only been in the UK for six weeks when he drove to Norwich specifically to steal phones from the Waterfront bar.

The Eastern European immigrant had 
already received a caution from the Met Police in London for going 
equipped to another music venue.

Staff alerted by outraged victims 
nabbed Constantin in Norwich after hearing loud ringing from his 
trousers, a court heard yesterday.

District judge Peter Veits jailed the
 villain at the city's magistrates' court for 12 weeks. Judge Veits told
 Constantin: 'You have come to this country with no means of support, no
 job to come to.

'Unfortunately, like many other 
people, you have then got pressured into criminal offences in order to 
live. I don't see you as the prime mover in this offence, but you still 
have taken part quite willingly.'

He added: 'If you were going to change
 your ways, you would have taken the chance after you were cautioned by 
the Met less than a month ago.

'But you came to Norwich specifically 
to steal these phones. There was no other reason for you coming here. I 
hope when you are released you will think about how to live in an honest
 way.'

Constantin, using an interpreter, yesterday admitted 10 counts of theft on Tuesday.

He gave his address as a road in 
Romford, Essex, but the court was told that he was of no fixed abode as 
he was not known at that address.

Phil Charnley, prosecuting, said: 
'He's a Romanian national and has only been in this country six weeks. 
He received a caution from the Met Police on February 8 for going 
equipped to a music venue.

'He had worn adapted trousers to conceal stolen items. He travelled with others to Norwich. He went to the Waterfront, was noticed by staff as being out of place. During the evening several phones were reported as being stolen by concert goers.'

Mr Charnley added: 'The defendant was detained and the phones were concealed in leggings worn beneath his trousers. Ten phones were returned to their owners, with a total value of Â£2,620.

'In interview he said he'd been approached by another Romanian at an internet cafe in London, asking if he wanted to earn some money by helping in the theft of mobile phones.

'This man provided him with leggings to wear under his jeans and they drove to Norwich. The other man stole the phones, but the defendant concealed them in special pockets in his leggings.

'The theft of mobile phones from music venues is a national problem and security staff have been specifically trained to look for attendees who don't fit the profile for the event.'

James Burrows, defending, said: 'He confessed at the police station at the first time of asking and also pleaded guilty at first time of hearing here.

'He came to the UK six weeks ago looking for work, but there's no work. He has not yet managed to get a National Insurance number needed to work here lawfully.

'As for the rest, you don't really need to hear. He was used by others. He was a labourer in Romania and came here on the premise that the grass was greener.'

Detective Sergeant Vicky Flatt, of Norfolk Police community safety team, said: 'We know that clubbers and people attending music venues are targeted by thieves, as nightspots provide ideal hunting grounds.

'People in large crowds are less likely to notice someone tampering with their bag or taking something from their pocket.

'Full credit must go to the staff at the Waterfront for their vigilance and swift action which ultimately led to Constantin being arrested.'

Police have worked closely with venues and staff to highlight phone thefts after a similar incident at last year's Sundown Festival in Norfolk. There a thief was found to have 20 stolen mobiles hidden inside tights underneath his trousers.
