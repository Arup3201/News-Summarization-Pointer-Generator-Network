He is known for his cool on-screen persona as much as for his frosty off-camera feuds.

And now TODAY show host Matt Lauer is upset that executive producer Jim Bell is being phased out for Alexandra Wallace, sources told RadarOnline.

A source close to the situation exclusively told the website that the longstanding co-host of TODAY is ‘not happy that Bell…has been forced out,’ adding that Lauer never had a good working relationship with Wallace, who is a longtime supporter of ousted Ann Curry.

Wallace, who previously worked with 
NBC News and CBS, will also challenge Lauer’s wish to use only NBC-paid 
experts to remark on current events, the source said, so as to be more 
applicable to TODAY’s viewers.

A spokesperson for NBC did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment.

Mr Bell, who had worked for the show 
since 2005, was responsible for the choice to broadcast this summer’s 
Olympics on a delay, so that the events shot live in London would then 
be shown at prime time in the U.S.

The executive decision caused 
outrage, as viewers missed out on London’s Opening Ceremonies, gymnast 
Gabby Douglas’ stunning gold medal-winning performance, and sprinter 
Usain Bolt’s 100m victory hours after they actually happened.

Bell will go on to be the full-time executive producer of the network's Olympic coverage.

He was also responsible for what many
thought was an offensive overlook of a national moment of silence on 
the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Rather than 
airing the moment, the TODAY show aired a segment with Kardashian 
matriarch Kris Jenner talking about her breast implants.

NBC is expected to officially announce
the departure of Bell soon, after the morning program lost its 16-year 
consecutive ratings win to the competition.

The
set at Studio 1A in New York's Rockefeller Center has been in a state 
of constant flux, with a revolving door among the cast and a lack of 
viewer confidence in the show that once dominated morning television.

New York Times media reporter Brian Stelter broke the news on Monday, citing unnamed sources who said Alexandra Wallace, now a senior vice president of NBC News, will succeed Bell and become the first female EP of the morning program.

Sources suggested to the Associated Press that Wallace will assume the role on an interim basis, while the Peacock Network searched for a replacement.

But NBC insiders have remained tight-lipped about when the forthcoming changes could take effect at 30 Rock.

Stelter spun the story on Twitter to highlight the fact that Bell is expected to assume a full time role producing the upcoming Olympics but the move is seen as a clear sign that Bell is taking the fall for the pandemonium on set that has been turning off viewers.

Bad morning: After rumors of tension on the set, Ann Curry announced on June 28th that she was leaving the Today Show in an emotional farewell that left viewers squeamish

Not pleased: Though Matt Lauer tried to assure Curry of her contributions to the show, it was clear to viewers that she was shown the door

Bell, who started his career as a sport's producer, took the helm at Today seven years ago - taking on the role when the show was at the height of its success in 2005.

The program has long been seen to be untouchable with its 16-year lead among viewers but ABC's Good Morning America has given the NBC show a run for their money.

In April, Today lost in the ratings battle to GMA, which has grown in popularity among the am sect with its full-loving crew of Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. 

In response to the crushing loss, Today said farewell to Ann Curry, who was crowned the co-host of the show in 2011 after serving as the newsreader for years, but her unceremonious exit did not sit well with viewers.

'This is not as I expected to ever leave this couch,' she said on June 28, when she gave an emotional goodbye to viewers.

Rumors were rampant that Matt Lauer, the long serving co-host, had been unhappy with Curry's performance and had pushed for her departure but Bell came forward as the fall guy, saying he had decided to push Curry out. 

'We made some tough calls,' Bell told The Hollywood Reporter in a soul-baring interview in September.

'I think it’s really unfortunate how that played out,' he continued about the drama over Curry's ouster.

'Obviously the transition didn't go quite as we had hoped,' he conceded, admitting that viewers may have been turned off by how the episode played out. 

'Matt, I need to say for the record, 
really should not bear any of the blame for that. I’m the executive 
producer of the show. He’s not. He’s the public face of the show, so 
he’s taken some of this. But it has been wrong. And that fact should be 
corrected.'

Despite the bad press about the show's direction, he expressed confidence (at least, at that time) in the future.

'We’re taking some shots. But that’s OK. We have the right team in place now. We’re just trying to move forward here.'

But
even with his assurances that Lauer was not the bad guy, Lauer became 
cast as a bit of a diva when reports emerged he negotiated a lucrative 
contract, estimated at $25 million, that reportedly allowed him to cut 
back on his work schedule despite his pay increase.

Former
lawyer turned cheery TV personality, Savannah Guthrie, was named 
Curry's replacement in July and even with her girl-next-door charm and 
astute reporting abilities, the show has continued to struggle alongside
the competition.

Bad timing? At the precise moment that CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment's 
silence to commemorate 9/11 from, NBC's TODAY show was airing an interview with Kris Jenner about breast implants

Users of Twitter took to the social networking site to express their disgust over the perceived lack of respect from NBC in broadcasting an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence at 8.46. a.m.

After taking a hit to their ratings, Lauer 
addressed the show's decline in a CNN interview in May and took 
responsibility for its lackluster performance.

‘Perhaps we have let up on in the 
past couple of years ... the competition is tougher and there are a lot 
of challenges out there,’ he said on Piers Morgan Tonight on May 30.

'When people start to write articles 
about what might be wrong with the Today show you know where you should 
point the finger, point it at me because I have been there the longest. 
And it's my responsibility,’ he added.

But with a new side-kick, reports circulated that Lauer saw himself as the show's savior and began micromanaging decisions on set at 30 Rock, much to the chagrin of the show's crew.
