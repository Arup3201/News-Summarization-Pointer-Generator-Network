Entire new towns and cities must be built across the country to tackle Britain’s housing crises, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said it was time to ‘rediscover that proud tradition of creating new places’.

In a speech to the National Housebuilding Council, Mr Clegg warned that without a dramatic increase in house building home ownership would remain a ‘pipe dream’ for a generation of young people.

The Government is making £225 million available funding to 'unblock' a series of major local housing projects which have 'hit a wall'.

Together, the schemes - which range in size from 4,000 units to 9,500 - will provide up to 48,600 new homes.

But Mr Clegg said the shortage of homes is becoming so acute, there will in future need to be even more ambitious, with new developments of 15,000 to 25,000 homes.

He said housebuilders should draw inspiration from the garden cities of early 20th century, such as Letchworth and Welwyn, and the new towns of the post-war era like Milton Keynes and Stevenage.

‘We can either condemn ourselves to haphazard urban sprawl – the surest way to damage the countryside,’ he said.

‘We can cram ever more people into existing settlements, concreting over gardens and parks – and bear in mind we already build the smallest homes in Western Europe.

‘Or we can build places people want to
live. Places which draw on the best of British architecture and design,
which have their own identity and character.

‘Which, rather than destroy the countryside, actually have a crucial role in keeping it intact.

‘Places put together in a way that makes sense for modern British families.’

Mr Clegg announced the European Investment Bank will be injecting £400m into the UK affordable housing sector to help build new energy efficient affordable homes.

He said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a 'generational shift' in the debate, with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted.

'The babyboomers of the fifties and sixties, people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the Second World War, are now watching their children struggle.'

He went on: 'The plight of the next 
generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly 
tangible and real. And as we, as a society, become more open to 
development that creates the space for politicians to be bold.'

Mr Clegg warned Britain is already building 100,000 fewer houses than is needed every year.

Over
the next decade, each year, the UK is going to grow by around 230,000 
households, he said. ‘Last year we managed to complete 117,000 – just 
over half.

‘Unless we take
radical action, we will see more and more small communities wither, our
big cities will become ever more congested as we continue to pile on 
top of each other,  and the lack of supply will push prices and rents so
high that unless you or your parents are very rich, for so many young 
people, living in your dream home is going to be a pipe dream.’

Concerned: The Deputy Prime Minister warns that unless radical action is taken to boost housebuilding, for many young people their dreams of a home of their own will be no more than a 'pipe dream'

He said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a 'generational shift' in the debate, with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted.

'The babyboomers of the fifties and sixties, people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the Second World War, are now watching their children struggle,' he is expected to say.

'The plight of the next generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly tangible and real. And as we, as a society, become more open to development that creates the space for politicians to be bold.'

Dr Adam Marshall, policy director of the 
British Chambers of Commerce said: 'Unblocking stalled sites alone is 
not enough. We would challenge the government to be more ambitious and 
increase the Homes and Communities Agency’s (HCA) target by a further 
100,000 homes by 2015, which would provide a substantial return in 
economic growth.'
