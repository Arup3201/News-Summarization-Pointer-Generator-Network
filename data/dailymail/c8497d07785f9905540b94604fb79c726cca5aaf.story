She's topped best dressed lists and proven her fashion prowess on X Factor, so it made sense for Nicole Scherzinger to channel her style expertise into a clothing line.

The former Pussycat Doll has been busy creating a new clothing line for brand Missguided and fashion fans will be delighted to hear that it's landed online.

The singer showcases her new collection in all its glory and there's plenty of sexy black jumpsuits, figure-hugging bodycon dresses and electric blue cut-out midis - all for under £50.

It's here! Nicole Scherzinger's full Missguided collection has finally been unveiled

'I cannot explain how excited I am about this range,' Nicole told MailOnline.

'I have always worn Missguided and I love the clothes so it was just a perfect match,' she said of the collaboration.

The range, named Nicole x Missguided, was shot on location on the outskirts of Los Angeles and Nicole shows off each and every outfit to perfection.

Steamy shoot: Nicole shot the range, which she describes as 'urban chic', in the hot climes of Los Angeles (dress, £40)

Hell for leather: Nicole, who is a firm fan of leather, has incorporated it into her new range to add a 'tough edge' (dress, £50)

All white! Nicole says she 'cannot explain' how excited she is for her fans to see the collection, which goes on sale mid March (dress, £45)

The debut 30-piece collection aims to take influence directly from Nicole’s statement style, uniting her favourite signature looks with the season’s most coveted trends.

'It's inspired by the catwalk mixed with my personal style. I would describe it as clean, sexy, strong and graphic but also classy and feminine; it's urban chic,' she explained.

Nicole has taken inspiration from the sports luxe trend spotted everywhere from Christopher Kane to Ashish with her sporty-inspired jumpsuits.

While directional dresses with cut-away detailing and dramatic mesh-contrast crops and bodysuits were seen at the likes of Mark Fast and Lucas Nascimento.

Wearable: The debut 30-piece collection, which 
is priced between £15- £30, aims to include casual day wear and more 
dressy evening wear (trousers, £35, top, £20)

Dressing up: Fashion fans can expect sexy black jumpsuits, figure-hugging bodycon dresses and electric blue cut-out midis

Speaking about her favourite pieces, Nicole said: 'I love the dresses and the racer back tees, you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion.

'I am also a huge fan of the fishnet pieces, I designed them to look edgy but still be classy. It's all what I wear myself, I love to funk it up but still keep it clean.'

On top of her designing and modelling duties, Nicole has been working on some solo music material.

She said: 'I am so excited for my fans to hear this. I look forward to them welcoming me back into the music world.'
