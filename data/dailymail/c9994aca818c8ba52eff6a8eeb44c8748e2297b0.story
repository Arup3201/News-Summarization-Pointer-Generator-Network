A waiter was cheated out of a tip on Saturday after serving a group of Alabama football fans who appeared to be in a sour mood after their team lost.

Instead of leaving a tip on the $20.25 bill at a Tennessee wing restaurant, the customer scrawled Alabama's motto 'Roll Tide' in the gratuity box and berated the waiter for being 'proud' of Auburn.

Forrest Swan, a 22-year-old university student, said he hadn't realized the customers were Alabama fans and was just making small talk when he commented on the game.

But his comment touched a nerve with the guests, with one of them writing: 'Don't talk about being proud of Auburn to an Alabama fan. There's your tip!'

The 22-year-old, who was working a double shift at the restaurant, told Busted Coverage the group was made up of two men and a woman in their early 20s.

'They weren’t even wearing any Alabama stuff or anything that would tell me they were Alabama fans,' he said.

When a friend tweeted a picture of the receipt, some people cast doubt on its authenticity, but Mr Swan and Vaughan Crittenden, who posted it online yesterday, confirmed it was real.

Mr Swan, who supports Virginia Tech, said he was just making small talk with the customers and had said Auburn deserved to win after the last-second touchdown in the Iron Ball.

'I just walked away. I wasn’t even talking s***, like "Alabama sucks" or "you guys lost",' he said.

According to Busted Coverage, the customer contacted the restaurant later to say that he had tried to leave a $4 tip but that it hadn't gone through.
