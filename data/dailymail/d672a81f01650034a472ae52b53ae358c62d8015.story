Neighbours have described the moment they heard a 75-year-old great grandmother gunned down through her own door screen.

The body of Helen Dawson Key was found just inside her home at Toongabbie, in western Sydney, about 10am last Thursday (November 20).

Authorities have confirmed that Mrs Dawson Key was shot in the head; the bullet having passed through the front screen door before striking her. Police are baffled by the killing.

Ms Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing the shot.

'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said.

Great Grandmother Helen Dawson Key, 75, was shot in the head at the front door of her home in Sydney's western suburbs. Police are baffled by her killing a week after it happened and want public help in tracking down the killer

'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said.

'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago.

'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say "hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.'

Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing, said police were still trying to determine why Mrs Dawson Key was targeted.

'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said.

'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club.

'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.'

Ms Dawson Key, a member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club, formed 'many strong friendships within the club', according to a statement.

'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read.

'The club confirms that Helen was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event, which is reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community.

'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.'

Det Supt Willing said Strike Force Elermore had been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help.

'We believe Mrs Dawson Key was shot just prior to 6pm the previous day (Wednesday 19 November),' Det Supt Willing added.

'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door.

'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.'
