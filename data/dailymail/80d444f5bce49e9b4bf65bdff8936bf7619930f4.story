A Coyote Ugly-style bar is facing closure after drawing dozens of complaints from neighbours woken up by customers 'whooping' at staff until 3am.

The Players Coyotes bar in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, is being investigated for excessive noise after nearby residents complained of loud music being played until the early hours of the morning.

The sports bar employs scantily-clad barmaids to dance on the bar and squirt water at customers every 15 minutes, in scenes similar to the 2000 film Coyote Ugly.

The barmaids also jump on to the bar to dance every time a goal is scored when a football match is shown at the bar.

Environmental protection officers from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council have visited the bar, which is open until 3am on Friday and Saturdays, and this week called for its licence to be reviewed because of ‘noise nuisance’

Residents have complained to the council saying that loud amplified music can be heard until 3am at the weekend and 2am on some nights during the week.

They have also complained they can hear punters ‘whooping’ as the barmaids dance on the bar.

Joel Hewett, 22, said he ended up giving up his flat near the club as the noise was ‘unbearable’.

He said: 'It was a nightmare. Thursday, Friday and Saturday involved ear plugs during sleep regardless of what time, so I’ve moved out of my flat and got another one further away.'

Justin Plenderleith, 36, said: 'The place is ridiculous - all night long you hear pumping music and men whooping and shouting at the girls.

'It’s got to a stage where people around here just can’t get a good night’s sleep.'

The Mayor of Tunbridge Wells last year, John Smith, said at the time that he was opposed to the bar opening, adding: 'Risque night-time ventures aren’t part of our vision and plan for the town.'

Inspiration: The venue, inspired by the film Coyote Ugly (pictured), could now have its licence suspended or revoked

Council chiefs say the licence could be suspended or revoked if the venue is found to be in breach of its licensing conditions.

A spokesman for the council said this week: 'There is an application for review of the licence for Players Coyotes sports bar in Church Road on the grounds of the licensing objective Prevention of Public Nuisance because of the level of noise from the rear gardens.'

The owner of the bar James Pemble was unavailable for comment.
