It's been more than two years since Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs laid down plans for a futuristic new campus and now new images give the closest indication yet as to how the pioneering structure will look.

Nicknamed the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape, the 175-acre project will feature a man-made forest of more than 7,000 trees and the building itself will take almost quarter of an hour to walk around.

The ring-shaped structure was Jobs’ 
brainchild, yet after his death British designer Jony Ive took the 
project on with the help of architect Sir Norman Foster, and now the local council has approved their ambitious plans.

Apple has released never-before-seen images, like the one pictured, that give the closest indication yet as to how the firm's new futuristic headquarters will look. Nicknamed the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape, the 2.8 million-square-foot Campus 2 project is expected to cost a total of $5 billion

When Jobs first submitted the plans back in 2011 the campus was billed as 'the best office building in the world'. It has taken since then to get approval from the local council and its likely the campus won't be completed until 2016.

Reports in April claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by around $2 billion (£1.32bn), pushing the total cost up to around $5 billion (£3.14 billion) and putting it a year behind schedule.

Earlier this year Apple was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping designed, a slightly revised floor layour, renderings, and a bicycle plan, however the overall main design wasn't changed. Under these updated plans, the campus was renamed Apple Campus 2.

Appearing as a giant saucer  the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees.

The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space.

Among the 7,000 trees that will be planted around the campus, the firm intends to plant species that blossom at different times of the year. This includes apple trees, as well as cherry blossoms, plum trees and other fruit trees and bushes similar to the ones pictured

Inside the third-of-a-mile wide building will be 1,000-seater auditorium where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the company's keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion, pictured, that will also be an access point for employees and guests

This room-sized mock-up of the planned new Apple headquarters in Cupertino was released last month before executives submitted their final plans to the council

Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt.

The new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars into the underground car park. They also show the parts of the car park that will be on show pictured covered in plants and greenery to help it blend in with the natural surroundings.

Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests.

During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light, pictured

Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design, pictured. The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff

Natural gas will, primarily, provide 
the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in 
emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.

‘You see the energy and the love and 
the attention to detail that we've put into this,’ said Apple CFO Peter 
Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans.

‘We have treated this project just as
we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most 
creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades
to come.’

The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut’.

Earlier this year Apple was asked to submit updated plans from the original 2011 design. This led to the campus being renamed as Apple Campus 2. The new plans feature underground parking hidden from view. The new images, pictured, show access roads that lead into tunnels that will take cars into this underground car park

Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this latest image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in

The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling.

‘This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'’ said Apple’s Whisenhunt.

In the centre will be an enclosed arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News.

‘We love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that truly belong here,’ Oppenheimer said, ‘we're bringing back the beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.’

Campus 2 was designed by Norman Foster's firm Foster and Partners. The architectural experts also designed Wembley Stadium, London City Hall and The Gherkin.

Apple has also factored in a 90,000-square-foot cafeteria, part of which is pictured. It will cover at least two storeys of the predominantly glass building and will feature oak tables and chairs

The cafeteria will also feature an outside dining and picnic area, pictured. Apple's Campus 2 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building

'The
concept of the building,' Oppenheimer said, 'is collaboration and 
fluidity. It'll provide a very open-spaced system, so that at one point 
in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find 
yourself on the other side later that day.'

Apple’s
current office building at 1 Infinite Loop will remain and the new 
offices down the road will be built in addition to the current 
offices, which house around 2,600 workers.

When Jobs first presented the plans in 2011, he said his firm was 'growing like a weed.’

'We
do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,’ he 
said. ‘I really do think architecture students will come here to see 
this.'

Employees will additionally be given a 90,000-square-foot cafeteria that connects to an outside dining and picnic area. This will be a short work from the fitness centre in the north of the building.
