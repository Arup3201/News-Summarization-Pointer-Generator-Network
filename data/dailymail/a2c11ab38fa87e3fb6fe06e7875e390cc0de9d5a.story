Following the unveiling of Google's self-driving cars, taxi firm Uber, pictured, has said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles

Smartphone apps have already revolutionised the way many of us book taxis, and now developments in technology are about to take this revolution a step further.

Following the unveiling of Google’s new self-driving cars yesterday, taxi firm Uber has said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles.

CEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers.

Speaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: ‘The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car.

‘When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.’

Uber is part of a wave of smartphone apps that match taxi drivers to customers in seconds.

The Californian-firm operates in more than 100 cities in 30 countries, but other similar apps are available including Hailo, GetTaxi and, most recently, UK-based Taxicode.

Each app lets users compare rates and add credit cards to an account so they don't need cash.

They have been criticised by local taxi companies for driving down costs and killing competition.

Although Kalanick said that driverless cars are still a new technology, he said the transition would take some time, but was ‘inevitable’.

Google plans to have prototypes of its self-driving car ready to test later this summer, and claims the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’.

It added the car has a ‘friendly’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology.

The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be, and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians.

Speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically-designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles.
