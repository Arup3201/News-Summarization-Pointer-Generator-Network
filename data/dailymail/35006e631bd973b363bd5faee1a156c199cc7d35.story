A father was in custody in France today after allegedly strangling his son because he was spending too much time playing online games.

The 43-year-old, who had not been named, launched the attack in the village of Luc-sur-Orbieu, near Narbonne, on the southern Mediterranean coast.

He was at the family holiday home when he snapped because his 23-year-old son was constantly playing on his computer.

Police from nearby Lezignan-Corbieres attended the scene of the killing just before 11pm on Easter Monday, Midi Libre newspaper reports.

'A source close to the enquiry evokes a possible argument linked to the young man's addiction to internet games,' it says.

An autopsy was due to be held to determine the exact cause of death, while the father was being held on suspicion of murder, the source added.

The case resembles one in South Korea last week, in which a South Korean man strangled his infant son to death in order to carry on playing online games.

The 22-year-old was charged with the murder of his two-year-old son after he admitted suffocating the child so he could leave the house and go back to playing online games at an internet cafe.

Police arrested the unemployed man in the city of Taegu, South Korea, on Sunday after finding the body of his child in a suitcase wrapped in a trash bag near his home.

The man, identified only by his surname Chung, had earlier reported the boy missing.

Officers initially believed he had left his son to starve to death by abandoning him for 10 days while playing games.

But Chung later confessed to 'covering the child's nose and mouth with his hand,' more than a month ago, killing him so that he could go to an internet cafe, a police officer said.
