Ed Miliband and Philip Hammond were criticised yesterday for saying the floods had proved that climate change was a threat to our national security.

The Labour leader said the country was ‘sleepwalking into a national security crisis’ because too many politicians failed to accept that climate change was causing the recent extreme weather.

He added that global warming had the potential to destroy the homes, livelihoods and businesses of millions of people.

Defence Secretary Mr Hammond then weighed in to describe climate change as ‘definitely’ a national security issue. He added that it was ‘clearly a factor’ in the recent bad weather.

The comments come amid growing criticism from Tory backbenchers that politicians were assigning blame for the extreme conditions to climate change, despite there being little evidence.

Last night, as ministers struggled to get to grips with the extreme weather, Prime Minister David Cameron unveiled a £10million business support scheme to help small firms in flood-hit areas.

Mr Hammond said a further 5,000 troops were on standby to offer their services to flood-stricken communities, but he risked angering councils by suggesting many of them had not asked the Army for help soon enough.

The Defence Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Army will carry out a ‘rapid inspection’ of the nation’s flood defences to assess damage caused by the floods.

It will be carried out over the next five weeks - compared to the two years it usually takes.

In an interview with The Observer, Mr Miliband criticised Mr Cameron for abandoning the green rhetoric he used in opposition, and he called on all parties to unite behind scientific evidence that climate change was a key factor in extreme weather.

He said climate scepticism among his backbenchers meant that the Prime Minister’s ability to give leadership was seriously hampered.

‘We have always warned that climate 
change threatens national security because of the consequences for 
destabilisation of entire regions of the world, mass migration of 
millions of people and conflict over water or food supplies,’ said Mr 
Miliband.

‘But the events of the last few weeks have shown this is a national security issue too, with people’s homes, businesses and livelihoods coming under attack from extreme weather. And we know this will happen more in the future. The science is clear. The public know there is a problem.

‘But because of political division in Westminster, we are sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change. The terrible events of the last few weeks should serve as a wake-up call for us all.’

A poll for the same newspaper showed that 51 per cent of voters believe the recent floods are a sign of climate change, while 24 per cent do not. The rest said they did not know.

Mr Hammond offered some backing to the 
Labour leader on Sky News, saying: ‘All the evidence suggests that 
climate change is a significant factor in the weather patterns that 
we’re seeing and Ed Miliband isn’t saying anything new.

‘We’ve already identified climate change as one of the strategic threats that we have had to deal with.

‘The Ministry of Defence produces an annual report called Strategic Threats and it identifies climate change as one of the threats alongside rogue nuclear states.’

Asked whether he endorsed that, he said: ‘It’s a national security issue, definitely.’

Mr Hammond also criticised councils for failing to call in the Army, saying: ‘We offered troops quite a long while ago to civil authorities who wanted them.

‘What we’ve done over the last ten days is push them a bit more aggressively at those civil authorities.’

Last night Tory MP for Clacton, Douglas Carswell, said: ‘When politicians like Ed Miliband start talking about climate change, it’s because he hasn’t not anything else to talk about.

‘He said nothing on uncontrolled mass immigration - he was wrong about that. He said austerity would lead to recession - he was wrong about that.

‘So all he is left doing is talking in abstract terms about changing the weather. Politicians can’t even control our own borders so the idea that they can change the weather is absurd.

‘All Ed Miliband has done about climate change is put up domestic energy bills when he was minister.’
