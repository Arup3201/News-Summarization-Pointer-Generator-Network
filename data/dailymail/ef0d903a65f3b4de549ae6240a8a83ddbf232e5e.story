Nick Clegg ‘put his fingers in his ears’ when told his free school meals policy was in chaos, it was claimed last night.

The Deputy Prime Minister is accused of ignoring Whitehall warnings that the £1billion plan was a ‘dumb gimmick’.

Dominic Cummings – a former adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove – said officials were given only one hour’s notice of the policy announcement.

Fingers in his ears: The Deputy PM was accused last night of ignoring signs a key policy was in chaos

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and wife Miriam launched the free school diners policy at Lairdslands Primary School near Glasgow last year, but critics say it is an uncosted gimmick

On Monday, headteachers savaged the schools meal plan – for pupils aged four to seven – saying they did not have the facilities to cope with an extra 1.5million lunches.

Mr Cummings said the Department for Education had dismissed the policy but Mr Clegg struck a deal with David Cameron to be allowed to push it through in return for the Tories announcing marriage tax breaks.

‘Officials in the DfE were unanimous that it was a bad gimmick and 
introduced in a way that makes it hard to avoid implementation chaos. 
Officials were obviously right,’ Mr Cummings said.

He described the 
£150million funding announcement for new kitchens as a 
‘back-of-the-fag-packet’ calculation from Mr Clegg’s spin doctors.

He
 added: ‘Because Clegg only thinks about politics ... he assumed that 
our opposition was because it was a Clegg idea. It wasn’t.

‘Our 
opposition was because it is a dumb idea, badly executed, which shows 
why politicians should have less power over schools.’

He had earlier tweeted: ‘Officials warned Clegg/Downing St and told them the £150million is junk but fingers in ears.’

Jonathan
 Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘There’s no such thing as a free
 lunch and Nick Clegg’s dog’s dinner of a policy is proof of that.

‘Taxpayers
 are footing the bill for a policy that was about winning applause at 
conference rather than helping children or families struggling with the 
cost of living.’

Mr Laws dismissed the claims from Mr Cummings, 
saying: ‘What he said about the

backdrop to the introduction of this 
policy is complete and utter balls. The DfE was not opposed to this 
policy, it was the result of pilots undertaken since 2009.

‘This 
stuff from Dom reflects his personal views, it doesn’t reflect the views
 of the Secretary of State, who I have spoken to extensively about this,
 including before our policy announcement.’

Mr Clegg weighed in with
 an article on the Lib Dem website, writing: ‘I would love the Liberal 
Democrats to be able to take all the credit, but the truth is that 
Whitehall has been looking at this for the last five years.

‘This isn’t back of the fag packet stuff. The evidence shows that free school meals make a real difference in our classrooms.’

But
 Labour said Mr Cummings’s claims amounted to ‘very serious allegations 
which call into question the quality of decision-making in the 
Department for Education and in the Coalition as a whole’.

Heads 
criticised new guidance that urges schools to ask pupils to choose their
 menu options at least two hours before they eat and operate staggered 
lunch breaks which could mean some youngsters eating as early as 11am.

Kevin Baskill, head of Christchurch Primary in Ilford, Essex, expressed his doubts about the policy yesterday.

‘It’s a fantastic idea, but not very well thought out. It’s a pity they didn’t sort out the details and then announce it,’ he said. ‘What we’ve discovered is that we’ll end up with a scenario where every day is rather like a Christmas lunch.

‘I wanted a second canteen so 150 four-year-olds could have a nice pleasant experience at lunchtime. Now, I suspect, that will become a very busy canteen.

‘I know money has gone to local authorities that will be passed through to schools, but I’m not sure it will meet the huge demand.’

Peter Malcolm, head of Rayleigh Primary in Essex, said the school needed extra kitchen equipment.

‘We don’t know if we will get the funding yet, so we don’t know if we can even cook the food yet,’ he added. ‘It’s very difficult to make a plan, if you don’t know what you can afford to do,’ he said.

The free meals policy will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child.
