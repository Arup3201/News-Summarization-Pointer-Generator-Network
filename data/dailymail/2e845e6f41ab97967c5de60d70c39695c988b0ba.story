A Vanderbilt University fraternity has been suspended after a brother sent an email which made light of the school's current rape case.

The email was sent to prospective new members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity on September 22, announcing upcoming events.

One of the events included a Monday Night Football viewing at the house.

The Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at Vanderbilt University has been suspended following an insensitive email sent to prospective new members one of the brothers

Insensitive: The email invited new members to a football game viewing party which they promised would be a 'rape free' event - referencing the current rape case involving four former members of the school's football team

'We have refreshments and stadium seating. This will be a rape-free event...I promise. Football is safe again,' the email said.

The author of the email was referencing the current rape case involving four former members of the Vanderbilt football team.Â 

Ex-players Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie have each been charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery for allegedly raping a student in her dormitory last June.

Brandon Banks, 19 (left), and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19 (right), are also charged in the crime

Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography.

On October 3, the school formally suspended the ATO fraternity while they investigate the incident.

All fraternity events have been cancelled, including recruiting events.

Scene of the crime: The victim was allegedly raped in Brandon Vandenburg's room at Gillette House, above, with the three other players present. The incident was also recorded on Vandenburg's camera phone.

Following the fraternity's suspension, the university issues a statement condemning the email.

'It conveys a message that is reprehensible in its disrespect for women and is not representative of the Vanderbilt University student body or the values that we uphold as a community,' wrote Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor for public affairs.

The fraternity is also facing punishment from their national office.

ATO's CEO Wynn Smiley deemed the email 'abohorrent' and said that they too have put the chapter on suspension while they conduct their own investigation.

Despite apologizing, the member who sent the email has since been expelled from the fraternity.
