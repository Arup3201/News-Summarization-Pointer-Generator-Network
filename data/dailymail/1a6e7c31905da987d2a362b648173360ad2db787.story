Nina Pham still doesn't know exactly how she contracted Ebola, but the intensive care unit nurse says she has no regrets about treating Liberian Thomas Duncan. 

Ms Pham was one of the ICU nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas responsible for the care of Mr Duncan, who died from the virus in October.

She and fellow nurse Amber Vinson both contracted and survived Ebola, but neither are sure how they were exposed to it. 

But just six weeks after the 26-year-old was declared Ebola-free, the modest nurse insists she is not a hero and was 'just doing [her] job'.

Now looking much healthier, Ms Pham is among the Ebola fighters recognized by Time magazine as their 'Person of the Year'. 

'I would just say that I did my job,' she told Khou.com.

'I had a patient that needed my help, and I was going to help him.' 

But speaking about the moment she was told she had Ebola, she said: 'I thought it was a death sentence; flashbacks to Mr Duncan's disease and how it progressed eventually to his death came to mind.'

She recalled a CDC doctor and her chief nursing officer approaching her in hazmat suits - and she knew from their faces the news was bad. 

And she admits she still suffers from nightmares about treating Mr Duncan, and about dying.

Despite surviving the deadly disease, she still struggles with fatigue and worries about the lasting effects of the experimental drug she was given.

But luckily, Ms Pham can rely on fellow nurse Amber Vinson for emotional support.

But despite people being afraid of her and the critics who questioned the decision to save her dog, who was feared to have also been exposed to the virus, Ms Pham has no regrets.

Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case.

She adds people have been afraid of her, including not wanting to shake her hand in church, even after health officials declared her free of the virus.

And although she is not sure whether she will return to nursing, Ms Pham would gladly donate her blood to another Ebola patient if necessary. 

Announcing Time magazine's prestigious title yesterday, editor Nancy Gibbs said: 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight.

On Wednesday, 'the Ebola fighters' were named as TIME's Person of the Year 2014. The magazine is putting out five front covers to honor the fighters, including Dr Kent Brantly, left, and Dr Jerry Brown, right

'For tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving, the Ebola fighters are Time's 2014 Person of the Year.'

The White House welcomed the accolade as a tribute to the "heroism and selflessness" of countless health care workers fighting the worst Ebola outbreak in history. 

'The administration, including the president, could not be prouder of the brave men and women who've committed themselves to this effort in a foreign land,' said spokesman Josh Earnest.

'These are men and women who deserve international recognition, and today we are pleased that they're receiving more of it.'

President Barack Obama has made an effort to calm hysteria in the United States over how Ebola is contracted by welcoming survivors to the White House.

After surviving her ordeal, Ms Pham was welcomed to the Oval Office in October and hugged by the President. 

The worst ever Ebola outbreak has left more than 6,300 people dead worldwide, nearly all in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.
