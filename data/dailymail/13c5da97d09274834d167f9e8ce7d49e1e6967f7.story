It remains an ugly stain on a beautiful, pristine career, the night Cristiano Ronaldo erred at the moment of his country’s greatest need. Donetsk in Ukraine on a steamy June night and Portugal exited the 2012 European Championship in the semi-finals on penalties to Spain.

Incredibly, Ronaldo didn’t take a kick. Due to take his country’s final penalty, the contest never got that far. Subsequently, inevitable questions were asked of his mental stature. Did the self-proclaimed world’s best player really hide at the back of the line?

When the dust settled, Ronaldo claimed Portugal were not allowed to change the order of takers they had submitted to the match referee. There is no mention of that, however, in UEFA’s rules. Whatever the truth, he merely watched — hands on hips — as defenders missed penalties in front of him, and then he sat and cried on the pitch.

Above criticism: Ronaldo (centre) is a hero in Portugal and is looking to get his World Cup up and running

No wonder, then, that the Ballon d’Or winner drove his country so forcefully and brilliantly through qualification for this World Cup. As he scored four times in the group phase and then destroyed Sweden with a play-off hat-trick, perhaps he had redemption on his mind.

That night in Stockholm last November he was at his imperious best. It was a stunning individual display, a lethal mixture of arrogance and supreme desire. It gave credence to the theory that a fit and firing Ronaldo here in Brazil could drag Portugal to unimagined places almost on his own.

Certainly that is the way that the Portuguese see it. In his home country, they recognise Ronaldo for exactly what he is. He is their one and only chance here. Without him they are a very modest group of players. With him, they immediately step up at least two levels.

That is why that night in the east of Ukraine two years has been forgotten in his home country. That is why they pray his troublesome groin allows him to pay freely against Germany in Group G in  Salvador on Monday.

‘There was never any need for him to make anything up to us,’ said one Portuguese commentator recently. ‘What happened in Ukraine was unfortunate but we don’t blame him. We don’t think he ducked that penalty.

‘He is all we have. He never has a need to apologise, no matter what he does or doesn’t do.’

It’s certainly the case that, in Portugal, Ronaldo is not the type of hero who is continually asked to prove himself. He has 49 goals from 111 caps and his place in the national consciousness is secure.

In England, we argue today about Wayne Rooney’s international future. Over the weekend, England captain Steven Gerrard has received criticism, too. That simply doesn’t happen to Ronaldo, even on the occasions — that are not so rare — when he appears to treat the Portuguese team merely as a showcase for his individual gifts.

On Monday night, Germany will know that the Real Madrid forward is pretty much all that stands between them and their usual steady start to a major tournament. They will know also that Ronaldo didn’t actually finish his season with Madrid in particularly good form.

Stunning: Ronaldo celebrates his first of three goals in the play-off against Sweden when he was at his imperious, arrogant best and dragged Portugal to the World Cup

Ronaldo may have contributed the final act of last month’s Champions League final — scoring from the penalty spot in added time of extra-time — but his overall performance on the night was fitful. At times he looked rather tired.

Winger and a prayer: Portugal fans will hope Ronaldo has recovered from his injury in time to face Germany

Fabio Coentrao, a team-mate for club and country, said last night: ‘Cristiano is a very important player for us. He’s the best in the world. He’s a super-athlete, but he had a very exhausting season.

 ‘There is no doubt that all the games he played with us have taken a toll on him, physically and mentally. However, he has a tremendous will of helping the national team. He cares so much. We hope that will carry him through.’

Testimonies and tributes to Ronaldo’s importance and  brilliance have characterised Portugal’s lead-up to Brazil 2014. Portuguese journalists laugh at themselves as they admit that, at times, he is all they ever ask coach Paulo Bento about.

Prior to Monday night’s game, Silvestre Varela has been quoted as  saying he would happily give up his own place in Bento’s squad if it helped to guarantee Ronaldo’s fitness.

‘A World Cup without him is not a World Cup,’ said the Porto winger.

Sporting Lisbon’s sought-after holding player William Carvalho, meanwhile, has described Ronaldo as an ‘inspiration’. Only Bento himself has attempted to place some sort of cap on the expectation that inevitably envelopes his team whenever Ronaldo is in it.

‘We must deal with the pressure from outside,’ said Bento on Sunday night. ‘The fact that we have the best player in the world doesn’t force us to be world champions.’

Ronaldo was probably born a decade or so too late to have any real chance of winning something with his country. He contributed to Portugal’s narrow failure on home turf in Euro 2004 but, at 19, was not the player then that he is now.

The fabled golden generation of Luis Figo and Rui Costa may not ultimately have underachieved had Ronaldo been in their midst. Certainly the players Bento has to choose from now do not compare.

Ronaldo has perhaps two World Cups left in him and this one finds him where he has always wished to be — recognised as the best in his sport. On Sunday night, Lionel Messi stepped out for Argentina but this time he does not hold star billing. Ronaldo will have that.

The kid from Madeira is the centrepiece of this year’s World Cup. He has reason enough to make sure he adorns it with his unique form of dazzling brilliance.
