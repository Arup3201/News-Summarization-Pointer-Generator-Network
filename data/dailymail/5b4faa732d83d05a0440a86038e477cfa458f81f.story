A 17-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by ten men is pregnant and claims one of the men is the father of her unborn child. 

Last month ten men were given injunctions by Birmingham City Council barring them from contacting the teenager or other under 18s they did not know after a judge ruled they had sexually exploited her.

But it has emerged during court hearings into the case that the teenager is pregnant and claims Sarfraz Riaz, one of the men who was given an order to stay away, is the father.

The girl had described 32-year-old Mr Riaz as her 'boyfriend' during proceedings at the High Court in London and said he had fathered her child.

A 17-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by ten men in Birmingham, who were given injunctions to stop then contacting her, is pregnant and claims one of them is the father, the High Court has been told 

A judge had previously banned any reporting of her pregnancy but decided to lift the ban after ruling that publishing the details were unlikely to lead to her being identified or cause her more distress than she had already suffered.

It was lifted after representations by the Press Association news agency who said it was important that the public were made aware that pregnancy was a consequence of sexual exploitation.

Mr Justice Keehan said the decision was difficult and a balance between the girl's human right to respect for private life and the media's right to freedom of expression.

But he said he doubted that revealing the pregnancy would significantly increase the girl's distress or the risk of her being identified.

In his ruling he said Mr Riaz had been a 'most unimpressive witness' who had denied being the father of the teenager's child or having sex with her. 

'I note that (the girl's) assertions that Sarfraz Riaz was her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child were made at a time when she was fully supportive of him,' he said. 'Accordingly it would appear that her assertions were not borne out of malice or to falsely implicate him.'

He added: 'Sarfraz Riaz denied ever having sexual intercourse with (the girl), he denied being the father of her unborn child and he denied sexually exploiting her. Sarfraz Riaz was a most unimpressive witness.

'(The girl) may be wrong in identifying him as the father of her unborn child but her assertion, at a time when she was supportive of him, indicates that they had had sexual intercourse. On the totality of the evidence I find they so did and that Sarfraz Riaz is lying when he denies the same.'

Birmingham City Council applied for injunctions  to protect the girl from exploitation (picture posed by model)

The judge said Mr Riaz was serving a prison sentence for a sexual assault which does not relate to the girl. He has maintained he was wrongly convicted for the offence. 

Mr Riaz has 14 criminal convictions including for offences of burglary, racially aggravated assault and drugs offences.

The court heard that the 17-year-old girl had suffered a 'difficult childhood', had frequently ran away from home and had been made the subject of a police protection order when she was 13 after she went missing for six days.

The judge said when in her early teens the child had placed herself in situations of 'grave risk' and had been seen getting in and out of cars 'in the company of adult Asian males'.

She was housed by Birmingham City Council as a young teenager and police and social workers said she had been at risk of serious harm. 

The judge had been told at hearings at the Family Division of the High Court in London and Birmingham that more recently the girl had been found in hotel rooms and around cars with men by police in Birmingham.

The council applied to the High Court for civil injunctions against the men to protect the girl from being exploited.

Mr Justice Keehan said last month he was 'satisfied' that each of the men had sexually exploited the girl and made orders barring them from contacting the 17-year-old until she turned 18 and any other under 18s they did not know. 

He made orders against: Mohammed Anjam, Omar Ahmed, Naseem Khan, Mohammed Javed, Shah Alam, Sajid Hussain, Rahman Aziz, Imran Uddin, Mansur Ahmed and Mr Riaz.
