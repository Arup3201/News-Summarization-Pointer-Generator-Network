Hours after signing for Chelsea, Cesc Fabregas was back down to World Cup business with Spain as they trained ahead of their game against Holland on Friday.

Fabregas left Barcelona in a £30million move which will net him £150,000 a week but before he begins life in West London he has the small matter of a World Cup to defend.

And the 27-year-old former Arsenal captain appeared to take the move in his stride smiling and joking as he trained alongside Chelsea striker Fernando Torres and Diego Costa who could follow him in swapping La Liga for Stamford Bridge this summer.

Ahead of 
the game against the side they beat in the 2010 World Cup final, Spain 
coach Vicente Del Bosque has dismissed the suggestion that his side have
 peaked.

In fact he talked up their chances of getting better with stars continuing to emerge from the Under-21 set-up all the time.

He
 said: 'The World Cup starts now. If we can concentrate throughout 21 
days then hopefully we will live up to the standards required of a world
 champion.

'I won't reveal tomorrow's line-up. We will use the players who we think are the best - but we do have 23 very good players.

'I
 don't think this is a team of veterans, I'd say we're mature. We're 
simply not afraid of anything and that's not just because of our past 
successes.

'I'm not worried about the future either. Looking at the Under-21 team I think we can have high expectations.

'Holland have changed a lot over the last four years, but we have not.

'Holland have a great school of football and have always had good World Cups. They are worthy rivals.

'I hold (coach Louis) Van Gaal in high esteem and I'm sure he's prepared well for the game.'

Spain
 must later face Chile and Australia in Group B and Barcelona midfielder
 Xavi admitted he would have readily coped without dancing around the 
physicality of the Dutch in the opening fixture.

'We arrived here with a lot of enthusiasm even though we know the group will be very difficult,' he said.

'Starting off against the previous runners-up is not easy.

'But
 we got here by remaining faithful to our style and so it will continue.
 Hopefully our style of play will bring us more success."

Meanwhile,
 goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who is preparing to play in his third World 
Cup with Spain, has identified Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben as 
Holland's main threat.

The
 pair played together at Real Madrid for three years and were most 
recently pitted against each other as the Spaniards met Bayern in the 
semi-finals of the Champions League.

'Robben
 is a great winger,' Casillas said. 'I've known him since we were 
team-mates and I've come up against him several times since. He's great.

'If we show the humility and enthusiasm we have over recent years then we'll be able to do well.'
