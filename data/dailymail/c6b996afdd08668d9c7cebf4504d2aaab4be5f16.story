Up to four serving MPs could be questioned by detectives investigating claims of an Establishment sex ring cover-up.

Their names have been handed to officers probing an alleged conspiracy of silence that protected senior figures for decades.

The MPs are suspected of holding important details about the handling of previous criminal inquiries.

Four MPs could be questioned by detectives investigating claims of an Establishment sex ring cover-up and Steve Rodhouse, Scotland Yard, said they will go ‘where the evidence takes us'

Scotland Yard’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse said officers will go ‘where the evidence takes us, without fear or favour’. 

He was speaking after the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed it is looking at Met corruption claims from the 1970s to 2005. 

As questions continued to emerge yesterday about whether other powerful men escaped justice, it was claimed that:

Allegations: It has been claimed that the late Cyril Smith was held and freed seven times over 30 years by police investigating claims he was a paedophile

Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced it is investigating a raft of cover-up allegations against the Met.

The 14 separate referrals, which span four decades, indicate the scale of the task police face in getting to the bottom of historic child abuse cases.

The allegations include suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations and covering up offences because of the involvement of MPs and police officers.

Documents seen by the Daily Mail indicate that up to four serving MPs could be questioned as part of their work.

None of the public figures has previously been named publicly in connection with the scandal.

It is understood that victims believe they could hold highly sensitive information about their abusers which could help further their inquiries.

It was also claimed yesterday that a member of the Queen’s family and an MP were identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry.

But the Sunday Mirror claimed the operation was shut down by the Crown Prosecution Service for national security reasons.

One former Met officer told the newspaper: ‘I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed.

‘The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP.

‘He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public’s interest because it ‘could destabilise national security’.’

Separately, further inquiries are being carried out into whether detectives were told to limit a child abuse investigation centred on the former MP Lord Janner.

A home belonging to the 86-year-old peer, who was a Labour MP in Leicester for 27 years, was searched in 2013.

Last year it was reported that in 1989 a detective sergeant had been told not to arrest Janner or search his home.

Earlier this month Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Justice Lowell Goddard to head a public inquiry into historic child sex abuse.

The senior New Zealand judge will investigate whether public bodies and other institutions have ‘taken seriously their duty of care to protect children’.

The reformed independent inquiry into child abuse will be able to ‘compel witnesses’ in a bid to get to the bottom of many difficult and complex claims.

On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed how Met deputy commissioner Albert Laugharne claimed he was part of one cover-up.

He said that, while head of Lancashire police, he was asked to lie about allegations involving Smith, later unmasked as a paedophile.

Sarah Green, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said: ‘I would like to reassure people our investigations will be thorough and robust.’
