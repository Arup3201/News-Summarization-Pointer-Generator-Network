Speaking in October, dog walker Roger Wilday said at first he thought German Shepherd Jade had found a bag of dumped kittens.

'I was just coming back (out of the park) and Jade went to some bushes and she wouldnâ€™t come back to me.

'I went to look and saw a carrier bag in the bushes and it moved.

'I thought, "whatâ€™s that?" and heard a cry and so I looked in the bag and it was a baby in there.

'Jade has grown up with children around her, she loves babies and when she found the baby in the bushes she wouldn't leave until she knew I had seen it,' the retired engineer said.

'She is a hero dog. There was no-one else in the park at the time and it was very cold.

West midlands police launched and investigation into finding the mother or guardian of the child, making house-to-house enquiries in the neighborhood near where she was found.

Birmingham East Police Chief Inspector Ian Green, said: 'It is fantastic news that the baby is recovering well.'

The baby is now in local authority foster care.

Vicarage has been charged with one count of child abandonment and has been bailed to appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 29 January.
