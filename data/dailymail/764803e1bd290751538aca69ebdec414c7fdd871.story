Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has revealed he wants to sign for Liverpool.

Begovic claimed in an interview in his native Bosnia that he would be moving to Anfield in July for pre-season training.

The 25-year-old said: 'I want to start preparing on July 10, with all the players of Liverpool.'

Anfield move? Asmir Begovic has claimed he wants to begin pre-season training with Liverpool in July

Stoke, who have already signed England keeper Jack Butland from Birmingham, are weighing up a move for FC Twente stopper Timo Plattel as they prepare for Begovic's departure.

Plattel, 19, would be seen as competition for Butland, who agreed to this summer's move in January, if a deal was concluded.

Begovic has been linked with a move to a number of Premier League rivals, including Manchester United, but with reports of Barcelona's interest in Pepe Reina, Begovic clearly believes he is on his way to Anfield.

The Bosnian, who was pictured this 
week taking in a NBA match in America, said earlier this month: ‘We 
haven’t spoken at all yet, but I think we will sit down this week and 
formulate plans from there.

‘All
 the speculation is flattering and nice, but as long as Stoke want me, I
 am contracted here. I am happy here and desperate to help the club push
 forward, as long as they are moving in the right direction.

‘I have ambition to play at the highest level and test myself at that standard, if the opportunity arises.’

Meanwhile, Stoke chairman Peter Coates has revealed that the club has received a transfer request from midfielder Steven Nzonzi.

He
 said: 'I can confirm that we have received a written transfer request 
from Steven Nzonzi. We are not unduly worried about the situation as he 
is our player and has three years remaining on his contract.'

Begovic is set to follow Tony Pulis out of the Britannia after the manager was sacked earlier this week by Coates.

Pulis, 55, issued a statement 
through the League Managers Association, who stressed the split was 
amicable, saying he was disappointed but accepted Coates wanted to go in
 a different direction.

The Welshman was well aware of the 
disaffection growing among a section of fans but felt his record over 
the previous seven years was worth something.

'At times the minority make the 
noise,' he told BBC Midlands in an interview conducted before his 
departure. 'You have to accept criticism. I've taken it before and you 
have to take it again,

'The fact we've had such a wonderful 
five seasons (in the Premier League) gets lost in the wash, especially 
if you have a bad run.

'When things go wrong it is magnified 10 times more in the Premier League.

'I'm
 not dismissing them (the fans) because some are genuine supporters who 
want the club to do well, others do it for different reasons.

'I don't think answering my critics is the answer, the answer is to try to do your best.'

Pulis also felt the period of stability in the Premier League had raised expectations unrealistically.

'It gets harder because expectations become more demanding. That is life,' he added.

'If you keep giving people things they keep taking it and in the end they want a little bit more.

'We are never going to be in a position to compete with the top five or six clubs unless you have the budget they use.

'I think we've done well at the club with what we've got.'
