Joe Hart appeared to be the target of an object thrown from the crowd during Manchester City’s game with Roma on Wednesday night.

The City keeper was seen picking up the object before throwing it off the pitch during the first half of the Champions League clash in Italy.

It is unclear whether Hart – captain for the night in the absence of Vincent Kompany – was struck by the object.

City will have expected a hostile reception at the Stadio Olimpico and the Roma fans were only too keen to oblige. Early in the match several City players appeared to be targeted by fans with laser pens before Hart's incident

Hart was seen looking at the object before disposing of it during the first-half, with City scoring twice after the break through Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta to ensure progress to the last 16.
