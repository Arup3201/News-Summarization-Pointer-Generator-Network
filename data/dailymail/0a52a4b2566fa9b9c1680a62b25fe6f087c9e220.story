Williams driver Valtteri Bottas has been warned by the FIA he must stop driving the moment he suffers a repeat of the back pain that forced him out of the Australian Grand Prix.

Bottas sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying, leading to severe pain.

Although the Finn made himself available to drive on Sunday morning ahead of the race, the FIA ultimately declared him unfit.

Ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia, Bottas has now been given the all clear, albeit with the proviso from the FIA that 'in case of a recurrence of pain, or any abnormal feeling, he must stop at the earliest opportunity'.

Bottas has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said: 'The back is good, no pain, which is nice.

'At the end of last week I could do something without any pain, and during the weekend I could swim, cross-train without any pain, so the recovery was really good.

'We've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so I feel confident of getting back in the car.'

Bottas has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car, which have since been corrected.

'The back is now in a more neutral position, less pressure on the discs. We are confident that should be it,' added Bottas.

'I've never had any problems before with the lower back. That kind of thing normally takes a bit of time to build up.

'But there was no warning, it went suddenly under maximum braking. It was like someone putting a knife in there, with the pain ramping up through to midnight.

'During the night it started to ease off. In the morning I would have been ready to race.

'I did pass the tests, but the FIA had access to all the material from the hospital, from the MRI and that stuff.

'Maybe they thought it was better (not to race) in the longer term, which could have been true.

'It was very disappointing, but I also respect the FIA's decision, with the support great from the team.'

As a precaution, Williams on Thursday announced Adrian Sutil as their reserve driver, with the German back in Formula One after being axed by Sauber at the end of last year.

Although Susie Wolff is test driver and young Briton Alex Lynn the development driver, Williams believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required.

Sir Frank Williams said: 'The fight for a top constructors' championship position will be intense this season.

'Therefore we have selected a driver with recent race experience and are confident if the need arose, he would be a solid pair of hands to race the FW37 and assist our 2015 campaign.'
