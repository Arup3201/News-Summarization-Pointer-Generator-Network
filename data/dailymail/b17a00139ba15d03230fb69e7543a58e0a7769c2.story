Fruit will soon be ‘tattooed’ with barcodes, sell-by dates and logos as supermarkets phase out the sticky labels that customers find annoying.

Marks & Spencer is to become the first British store to use the new laser technology, with a trial on oranges expected in the next few weeks.

The technology uses a laser and  a coloured liquid to etch images and text directly on to the skin of the fruit without damaging the inside.

Coming soon: Marks and Spencer will begin by inking information onto oranges, right, but will extend it to softer fruit such as tomatoes, left, is the initial steps prove successful

The technique even works on soft fruit such as tomatoes, so if the orange trial proves successful, it will be extended to other foods.

Andrew Mellonie from M&S said: ‘It is an interesting concept because often fresh produce is stickered, which can be difficult to remove, plus there can be design changes, so growers can be left with stockpiles of stickers they can’t use.’

There had been concerns about possible effects on human health, but earlier this year the EU approved the use of the chemicals involved. The process is already in use in other nations.
