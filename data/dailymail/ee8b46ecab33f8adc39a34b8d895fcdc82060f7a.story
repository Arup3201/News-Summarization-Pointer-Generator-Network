Kelly Osbourne told her personal story of hardships and battles with self image and why she now wants to 'help us all to lose weight' on the Lorraine show this morning.

Speaking about what it was like growing up in the public eye Kelly, who struggled with her weight from a young age, said she was 'very insecure' and 'fed into what the media was saying'.

But while she was unhappy with her appearance, she says mother Sharon told her: 'You are who you are, if you want to change something then change it.'

'It's just that i didn't want to change because I cocooned myself in this little bubble of self medicating and numbing myself,' she says.

'And I can't lie. I thought, "if I just take a couple more of these I might not wake up tomorrow, it will all be done, who cares,"' she said.

'I woke up the next day and was like "You actually thought that about yourself. You need to sort that".

'And I told my mum and that day I was in rehab.'

'Once I got my head together everything just started to fall into place. Dancing With the Stars came up, I met Louis. He changed my life,' she said.

'I didn't think I'd make it to 28.' said Kelly.

'All the things that have gone on in the last couple of years... it's been insane.

'A lot of it sucked but I'm telling you, hard work pays off,' she said.

Mum Sharon said 'You are who you are, if you want to change something then change it'

'I never thought I'd be the girl that gets up every day and goes to the gym - I'd wake up and eat crisps for breakfast!'

'There is no secret. It's working out and eating right. It's become a part of my everyday life'

'I had to learn to love myself.

'I started to realise I should look after myself a bit better.

'One pound started to drop, then five pounds, and I thought "This is addicting!"

'I never thought I'd be the girl that gets up every day and goes to the gym - I'd wake up and eat crisps for breakfast!'

'It's not about being skinny, it's about being healthy.

'There is no secret. It's working out and eating right. It's become a part of my everyday life,' she said.
