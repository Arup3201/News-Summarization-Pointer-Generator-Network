Egypts' army generals made a last minute grab for power yesterday as Islamists claimed to have won the presidential election.

The country’s military rulers have issued a constitutional decree to limit the influence of the new president at the same time as granting the army sweeping legislative authority – even permitting generals to control the budget.

The move threatens to undermine the election battle between Islamist Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood and Ahmed Shafiq, who served as prime minister under Mubarak.

Victory: Presidential candidate Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood waves to a crowd

Morsi, 60, declared victory as votes 
were still being counted, with his campaign team saying he had won 52 
per cent of the vote and Shafiq had 48 per cent.

If confirmed, the results would see the leader of an Islamist group become the first democratically-elected president of Egypt.

A spokesman for the Shafiq campaign 
instead said the former air force commander was ahead with around 51 per
cent of the vote. No results are expected to be announced until 
Thursday.

Looking: Israel is still hunting for four gunmen who infiltrated the Egyptian border and staged a deadly ambush

Unclear: There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip

Worries: The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011

Last night, the US government voiced its concern over the military powers.

State Department spokesman Victoria 
Nuland said: ‘This is a critical moment in Egypt, and the world is 
watching closely. We are particularly concerned by decisions that appear
to prolong the military’s hold on power.’

Pentagon press secretary George 
Little said the US would urge military leaders ‘to relinquish power to 
civilian elected authorities and to respect the universal rights of the 
Egyptian people and the rule of law’.

Many have described the actions of 
the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since the 
fall of President Hosni Mubarak, as a military coup.

Last week, a constitutional court 
believed to favour the generals ruled that the country’s 
Islamist-dominated parliament – which was democratically elected into 
office – must be dissolved.

The justice ministry also imposed a 
de facto martial law granting the military police extensive powers to 
arrest civilians for non-military crimes.

As well as handing the military 
legislative power until a new parliament is elected, the decree also 
ensures the army remains unaccountable and grants it the right to 
oversee the writing of a new constitution.

Protest: Egyptians gathered to demonstrate in Tahrir Square last week in the run up to the election

Egyptian stocks opened lower today after the election brought the country no closer to the stable democracy promised by its interim military rulers.

The uncertain outcome of the vote, billed as the last step in an army-managed transition to democracy, is the latest in a series of false starts.

It has left investors swinging between optimism and despondency since the overthrow of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February last year.

Sixteen months since Mubarak's departure, the country lacks a functioning government with popular backing to replace a hapless, unpopular interim cabinet and embark on reforms to prop up a struggling economy.

After posting the world's best stock market performance between January and March following a smooth parliamentary vote, Egypt's benchmark share index has dropped 20 per cent.

Major General Mohammed al-Assar, a 
senior member of the ruling council, told a press conference yesterday 
that the army would hand over power to a civil state by June 30.

Meanwhile three were killed in a gunfight on the Israeli/Egyptian border today.

Militants 
fired on an Israeli crew building a border barrier on the frontier, 
killing one of the workers - while Israeli soldiers shot dead two of the
infiltrators.

The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert.

'We
can see a disturbing deterioration in Egypt's control of the Sinai's 
security,' Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said, commenting on the 
attack.

He added, in reference to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel: 'We are waiting for the election results.

'Whoever wins, we expect him to take responsibility over all of Egypt's international commitments.'

Israeli
military spokesman Yoav Mordechai said: 'A terrorist squad opened fire 
and possibly also fired an anti-tank rocket at an area where (Israel) is
constructing the border fence.'

An Israeli military source said one of the workmen, an Arab citizen of Israel, was killed by the gunmen.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip.

Soldiers who rushed to the scene 
killed two of the militants and searched the Israeli side of the border 
for more gunmen, the source said.

To
curb an influx of African migrants and boost security, Israel is 
building a fence along the frontier with Egypt that it hopes to complete
by the end of the year.

The barrier will run most of the 165 miles from Eilat, on the Red Sea, up to the Gaza Strip.  

In
the most serious attack in the area since the Egyptian popular 
uprising, militants crossed over the Egyptian border and killed eight 
Israelis in August 2011.

On 
Saturday, at least two rockets were fired deep into southern Israel, 
causing no damage or casualties. It was not clear whether they were 
launched from Gaza or Sinai.

Palestinian
militants in the Gaza Strip, ruled by Islamist Hamas, have launched 
Grad rockets at Israel from the coastal territory in the past.

Israel also says militants have also crossed into Sinai to launch similar attacks on its territory.

Protests held in Cairo's Tahrir Square have become commonplace since the uprising last year
