A frustrated customer went totally postal after his parcel didn't arrive with the courier - and trashed a widescreen TV before taking a hockey stick to the delivery van's mirror and windows. 

And the clip, shot in Zlin, a town in the eastern Czech Republic, has become a viral hit across eastern Europe.

The footage shows a customer named as Miroslav Starek, 43, hitting the roof apparently over a lost missing parcel.

Before delivery van driver Radek Tesar, 47, can stop him, the customer leaps into the back of the van and kicks a television into the street.

He then grabs a hockey stick from the van and lays into the telly with the stick before smashing the van's mirrors and windows and chasing the driver.

Finally, he apparently notices the person filming the footage and runs at them screaming until the clip ends.

The video has become one of the most viewed clips across the Czech Republic and the rest of eastern Europe after it was broadcast by TV stations. 

One viewer, Petr Sivok, said: 'It's great because we've all been there with a courier company and this is what we'd all like to do.'

But some commentators think the whole film could be a viral ad spoof.

Tomas Dockal said: 'Sometimes it looks a little too good to be true.'

And Jana Novotna Grossertova said on Facebook: 'Would like to know if this is only a good performance with expensive props, or really a lunatic losing it.'

But another - former courier Jiri Vasina - said the video is genuine.

He wrote: 'Some customers in the Czech Republic are just like this. My personal experience proves it. I've seen it all first hand.'

He chases after the driver, who disappears out of sight and then destroy the van's mirrors and windows
