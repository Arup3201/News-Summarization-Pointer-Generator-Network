A young woman was lucky not to be blinded after being glassed in the face by a gang of girls in an horrific nightclub attack.

Police have released images of three blonde women they want to question over the incident that left Amy Steel with permanent scarring.

The 22-year-old and 14 friends had paid more than £1,000 to celebrate a birthday in the VIP lounge at Tup Tup Palace in Newcastle.

They had travelled from Cheshire for the night out on Bank Holiday Monday, August 29, but scenes of celebration turned to horror when Amy was smashed in the face with a bottle, missing her eye by millimetres.

Northumbria Police have now released CCTV images of three women they are seeking to speak to in connection with the attack.

Amy said: ‘It was just so scary. It's one thing hitting someone in the face. 

‘But to use a bottle on someone you don't know is just outrageous.

‘It just scares me that girls are capable of doing that.’

Sometime between 1.30am and 2.30am, Amy and two other friends decided to leave the VIP area and head to the main dance floor and ran into the trio of attack suspects.

Amy said: ‘Some girls started pushing into us but we just ignored them at first.

‘We were still dancing and then one of my friends got a drink poured on her.

‘She said something to the girls and then it all kicked off. 

‘I felt something hit the back of my head, and when I turned around I was hit twice in the face with a bottle and I was dragged to the floor.’ 

The second blow caused the glass to break and club doormen came to help her as blood ran from the wound on her face.

Amy said: ‘I grabbed my face and realised it was bleeding. I was covered in blood and I was hysterical and panicking.

‘It was just horrendous.’

Amy was taken to hospital and had five stitches to close a deep cut above her eye.

She also suffered cuts to her mouth and bruising to her face.

‘I was so lucky,’ she said. ‘If the glass had hit one centimetre lower it would have been in my eye.’

Det Cons Andy Kelsall, of Northumbria Police's Newcastle Central CID, is now urging the public to help trace the violent clubbers.

He said: ‘We're continuing to investigate this assault, which left a woman with an injury to her face which required hospital treatment.’

Anyone who recognises the girls pictured should call Northumbria police on 0345 604 3043 ext 69191.
