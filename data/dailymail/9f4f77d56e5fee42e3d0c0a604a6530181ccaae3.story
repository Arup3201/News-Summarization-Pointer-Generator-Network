Record dealer Michael Craig claimed his business would suffer and he would have to move his six-year-old daughter from Dundee High School if he was given the usual totting-up ban

A businessman with 16 points on his licence has been allowed to carry on driving so his daughter can stay in private school.

Record dealer Michael Craig claimed his business would suffer and he would have to move his six-year-old daughter from Dundee High School if he was given the usual totting-up ban.

Craig – who boasted three months ago about how well his business was doing – claimed it would struggle to survive if he was hit with the six-month disqualification.

Perth’s Justice of the Peace Court was told that Craig was already on 12 points when he was clocked speeding on the A9 near the Perthshire village of Greenloaning.

The court heard he had escaped a previous ban for hitting the 12-point mark due to an ‘oversight’ by the English court where his previous case was dealt with.

Yesterday, Craig, 50, of Longforgan, near Dundee, admitted speeding at 73mph in a van with a limit of 60mph on the A9 Perth to Stirling road on April 24, 2013.

Pleading exceptional hardship, Craig said: ‘My daughter is at Dundee High School. My father wanted to pay for her first two years at the High School.

‘She is six. She is in her second year now. The third year intention was we would take over the payments.

‘If my income is cut, it would be difficult for her to continue attending the school and we would have to move her.

‘Or we would need to employ Dundee High School after-school care, which costs more money. I am very worried that my daughter would have to move school.

‘She seems very happy and settled. Financially things would be very difficult. It would almost certainly be impossible.’

Craig said he and his wife Carol, 46, had separated nearly a year ago and he told the court he did not want to add any more disruption to his daughter’s life by moving school.

Mrs Craig, who part-owns a chain of day nurseries, said: ‘It would impact on his ability to pay school fees, which would put the burden of that onto me.

‘It would be an extra £400 a month. I am committed to my daughter’s schooling. If that’s what I had to do, that would be what I had to do.’

Craig, who runs vinyl record store Unknown Pleasures in Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and an online business, also claimed he would be forced to pay off staff if he was banned.

He said: ‘I can’t see any way we could survive a six-month period. The staff would have to be made redundant.

‘Within three months the shop would probably be taking a half to two-thirds of the revenue it’s taking currently.’

He said he was the only person capable of touring the country picking up second-hand vinyl as stock for his business.

Store manager William Carroll, 60, told the hearing that he was not prepared to travel on his boss’s behalf if Craig had his licence taken away. He said he would expect the shop to fold if Craig was unable to drive.

But in November last year, Craig boasted about how well his business was doing after being bombarded by a new wave of vinyl collectors from Russia.

He said then: ‘Everyone is talking about the music industry being in turmoil but we’ve had our best-ever year.’

Justice of the Peace Keith Parkes told him: ‘You will not be disqualified from driving but will remain on an excess number of points. You will have to be very careful.’

Craig had four points put on his licence, bringing his total to 16, and was fined £270.

Last month a court heard unemployed Keith Baldock, 34, racked up a record 54 penalty points on his licence but was allowed to carry on driving.

He begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter.

A mistake by the court meant the judge was unaware of Baldock’s previous offences – and that he should already have been banned.

Ordinarily, just 12 points are enough for disqualification, but Baldock persuaded the court he was a special case.

In a similar case, takeaway driver Ala Udin - who had 29 penalty points on his licence - was  allowed to carry on driving so he could keep his job.

Magistrates in Aberystwyth heard he had 11 points on his licence, and was handed another 18 after admitting driving with a defective tyre, speeding and two counts of having no insurance.

But they decided not to disqualify him after he told the court his family would not be able to meet mortgage payments if he lost his job.
