Queensland Police have released a tongue-in-cheek video of seal who was stranded on a beach near Halifax in the state's far north.

Combining seal-related puns and cute footage of the furry creature, the video attracted more than 2,000 likes on the Queensland Police Service's social media page on Facebook, and almost 200 comments.

For its first trick, the one-minute long video kicks off with the title 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered' over a simple black background and then cuts to footage of a seal curled up on the beach next to a group of seagulls.

Halifax police in Queensland's north were called to a beach near the town to make sure this furry friend was safe

A video posted on the Queensland Police Service's Facebook page is a tongue-in-cheek ode to the seal

According to the video, Halifax police officers had to cordon off the beach from visitors to keep them at a safe distance until the seal decided to move on.

The short clip was posted as part of the police service's ongoing social media series 'What the Friday?' where officers from across the state share the more unusual jobs they are called to handle.

Continuing with the puns, the video goes on to say: 'This two-officer station saw one of the sealiest things they've ever seen when this G.I. Joe went barking mad and marooned himself.

'Police had to secure the scene because while furry and cute, his bite can be much worse than his bark. 

It uses seal-related puns, including: 'Rumour has it he was searching for Heidi Klum but our lips are sealed'

The video attracted more than 2,000 likes on the Queensland Police Service social media page on Facebook

The last pun is in reference to the German model's former husband, British singer Seal

'Rumour has it he was searching for Heidi Klum but our lips are sealed.'

The last pun is in reference to the German model's former husband, British singer Seal.

This latest incident comes after Halifax police were called to a beach at Lucinda when locals spotted a New Zealand Fur Seal on August 31.

That seal took the opportunity to take a dip under the jetty giving a rapidly growing crowd and allowed keen photographers to take some unique photographs.
