Lean on me: Mr Fox, has travelled with owner Jessica Johnson for the last 30 years, including to the Tower of Pisa, Italy

From Las Vegas and New York to London, Paris and Rome, one much-loved cuddly toy is also one of the most well-travelled, after accompanying its owner on holiday for the past 30 years.

Mr Fox was given to Jessica Johnson when she was just 3-years-old and the pair have been inseparable ever since.

The globe-trotting toy has visited some of the world's top tourist attractions including the Vatican, Buckingham Palace, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

He has accompanied Jessica, now 35, to New York, Hawaii, Las Vegas and even had a brush with gun-toting border officials in Colombia.

Mr Fox even has his own website at www.thetravelingmrfox.com dedicated to his travels and Jessica now hopes to turn their exploits into a book to raise money for the man who originally gave her the teddy.

Family friend Gary Moore was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she hopes to raise enough money to send him on a 'bucket list' round-the-world trip.

She said: 'I've carried Mr Fox with me since I was a baby, and he's the only physical memento I have from my childhood.

'The pictures started out as a lark. But I wanted to show Mr Fox having his own adventures.

'Mr Fox seemed a really appropriate way to try and get some attention, because Gary was the one who bought him for me.'

During three decades of travel, Mr Fox has enjoyed strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, been on the London Eye and toured the canals of Venice.

He has visited the Eiffel Tower, been to the graves of dead Popes, and has even been inside one of the Nuremberg court trial rooms.

And everywhere she goes Jessica takes a picture for the album - which often prompts confused stares from passers-by.

Jessica, who is originally from Missouri, USA, but now lives in Miami, said: 'I would tote him around and take pictures and avoid the half-smiles and stares.

'In Florida he was even taken to one side for chemical testing. They must have thought I was smuggling drugs inside him.

'I would send the pictures to Gary and he would get such a kick out of it - seeing a stuffed animal he bought all those years ago travelling around the world.

'His diagnosis was heart-breaking. He's been in and out of chemo for a year now and I just want to give him the same joy he's given me.'
