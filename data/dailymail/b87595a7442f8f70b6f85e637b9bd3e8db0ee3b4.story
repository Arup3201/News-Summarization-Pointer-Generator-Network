As a famous actor, Juliet Stevenson may be used to walking past crowds of adoring fans and the paparazzi on the red carpet. 

But she was unprepared for the adulation she received while filming a biopic about Mother Teresa in the slums of India. 

As she passed through the slums, locals dropped to the ground believing the Nobel Peace Prize winner had been brought back to life to care for the poor.

Juliet Stevenson was treated like a saint while filming a biopic on the Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa

Stevenson, who is not a Christian, was wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge'

Stevenson told The Observer: 'I was filming in her iconic white sari with the blue stripes. 

'People would come up to me, drop and touch my hem...in India, she's still revered. She lifted tens of thousands of people off the streets and into her care.' 

Stevenson, who starred in films such as Truly, Madly, Deeply, The Politician's Wife and Accused, is heading the cast of the forthcoming feature film about Mother Teresa, The Letters. 

The biopic explores the life of the saint through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem over a nearly 50-year period.

The letters, published in 2007, revealed her crisis of faith and the torment of feeling Jesus had abandoned her.   

Mother Teresa, who died in 1997 aged 87, became one of the 20th century's most influential religious figures. 

She founded an international order - the Missionaries of Charity - in the slums of Calcutta dedicated to the poor, disabled and dying. 

She won the Noble Peace Prize in 1979 for her role in founding the order and by the time of her death, it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages, hospices and charity centres in 133 countries. 

The film partly draws on Mother Teresa's secret letters, published in 2007 revealing her crisis of faith 

The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation

Stevenson, who is not religious, was initially wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge'. 

To perfect the role, Stevenson watched and listened 'endlessly' to historic recordings of Mother Teresa. 

She told The Observer: 'It was very daunting, because I'm so wrong for her. I'm 5ft 8in, quite strongly built. I'm not in any way miniature (Mother Teresa was only 5ft).

'I don't have a religious faith and she believed so ardently in God. I also couldn't differ from her more when it comes to her views on women's rights, birth control and abortion...but it was a wonderful challenge.'   

There was an early screening  of The Letters at the Vatican, at the International Catholic film festival last year.

Its cast also includes 85-year-old Swedish actor Max von Sydow and Rutger Hauer, who won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in Escape from Sobibor. 

It is directed by William Riead who was inspired by Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning film Gandhi.  

The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation.
