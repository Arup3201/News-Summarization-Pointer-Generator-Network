Harry Redknapp has advised Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling to sign a new deal at Anfield and bide his time before raking in the inevitable rewards.

The young England international is still stalling on an improved contract, reported to be in the region of £100,000-per-week, and will not make any decision until the summer, Reds manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed.

'Not between now and the end of the season,' said Rodgers. 'It has been made clear by Raheem's agent. I repeat that this is the best place for his development and it is clear.'

Speaking on talkSPORT's Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, Redknapp's advice to the talented winger was: 'Sign your contract. You are at a great club, you are playing regularly, you have become an England international, you're learning the game.

'Have another two or three years of playing as you are now, keep taking your game on and you will get the rewards. 

'The money is there anyway, but you will be up there with the top earners in the world in another two or three years if you keep progressing.

'You are at a fantastic club, one of the best football clubs in the world. You are lucky to be playing at a club like Liverpool. Get your nut down, do your job, and the rewards will keep coming.'
