British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK under a new immigration clampdown.

The planned changes mean lower-paid Britons would be forced to emigrate if they wanted to live with a loved one from overseas.

And if the foreign-born spouse had children, their British partner would have to earn £30,000 or more, depending on how many children they had.

Clampdown: British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK. Home Secretary Theresa May is pictured talking about the new policy on The Andrew Marr Show today

They will also have to pass a strict new 'combined attachment test' to prove they share a genuine loyalty to Britain, not another country, and they will remain on probation for five years instead of the current two.

The proposals, to be announced by Home Secretary Theresa May, are expected to cut immigration, currently standing at 250,000 a year, by 25,000.

They are designed primarily to combat claims that some foreigners are marrying Britons to take advantage of the UK's generous welfare system.

Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show today, Mrs May said: 'I think it is important that if 
people are bringing people into the UK to create a family here in the UK
that we say that you should be able to support yourselves and not be 
reliant on the state.'

Tory MPs last night welcomed the move but Labour spokesman Chris Bryant said: 'These new measures have more to do with Theresa May's abject failure to live up to her promise to cut immigration than fairness.'

He claimed the idea was 'poorly thought out', adding: 'It seems very unfair that a poor British man or woman can fall in love with someone from America or Thailand and be prevented from getting married and making a home here, while a rich person can.'

Labour MP Chris Bryant called the plans 'poorly thought-out'

He said a better way to deal with the 
problem would be to insist that Britons who marry foreigners and settle 
here provide a bond worth 'a substantial sum'. If the immigrant went on 
to claim benefits, the money would be deducted from the bond.

And immigration campaigners are expected to denounce the measures, claiming the new curbs would effectively give low-earning Britons who fall in love with foreigners the choice of indefinite 'exile' – or  breaking up their family if they want to stay in the UK.

The Home Secretary also issued a
warning to judges today  that their powers to block the deportation of foreign
criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed.

Mrs May said she would be seeking the
backing of Parliament for new guidelines for the courts spelling out 
how the courts should apply the European Convention on Human Rights in 
such cases.

In particular, she said she would be 
making clear that the right to a family life enshrined in Article 8 of 
the convention - used by some foreign criminals to appeal against 
removal from the country - was not absolute.

She complained the judges were not taking account of the wider public interest in the way the convention enabled them to.

And she warned that if they ignored the will of Parliament, she would bring in new legislation to ensure that it was enforced.

'This is not an absolute right. So in
the interests of the economy or of controlling migration or of public 
order - those sort of issues - the state has a right to qualify this 
right to a family life,' she said.

'What I am going to do is actually 
set out the rules that say this is what Parliament, this is what the 
public believe is how you balance the public interest against the 
individual's interest.

'We are going to ask Parliament to vote on this to say very clearly what constitutes the right to a family life.

'I would expect that judges will look
at what Parliament will say and that they will take into account what 
Parliament has said. If they don't then we will have to look at other 
measures and that could include primary legislation.'

Mrs May said that the Home Office was
also looking at contingency arrangements in case the the eurozone 
crisis triggered a flood of immigrants into Britain.

'So far we are not seeing any trends 
in any increased movements, despite obviously significant problems 
already economically in a number of eurozone countries,' she said.

'But I think that it is right that, as
a Government, across the board we look at the contingency arrangements 
that might be needed.'

A senior Government source said last night: 'The welfare system has abused for years under Labour by people who marry Britons and within a short period are living off benefits.

'There is little we can do to stop them claiming benefits but we can implement better controls on people who come here to marry in the first place. We are confident these moves will command widespread support from the public.

'Labour's lamentable record on immigration is one of the main reasons they lost the election. We are going to put the system right.'

Ms May said earlier this year that it was obvious that British citizens and those settled here should be able to marry or enter into a civil partnership with whomever they choose.

But she added: 'If they want to establish their family life in the UK, rather than overseas, then their spouse or partner must have a genuine attachment to the UK, be able to speak English, and integrate into our society, and they must not be a burden on the taxpayer.

'Families should be able to manage their own lives. If a British citizen or a person settled here cannot support their foreign spouse or partner they cannot expect the taxpayer to do it for them.'

The Joint Council for the Welfare of 
Immigrants says an extension of the probationary period for foreign 
spouses could trap more women in violent marriages because of the fear 
of being deported if they complain.

Mr
Bryant added: 'At a time when our national finances are hard-stretched 
it is only fair that anyone wanting to bring someone new to this country
should be able to prove that they will not be a burden on the State.

'But I worry that the Government will not achieve what it hopes with this
measure, and that they have rejected options that could provide better 
protection for the taxpayer and be fairer too.

'In today's climate, someone on £20,000 today could all too easily be earning nothing tomorrow.

'So simply relying on income as a measure may lead to the taxpayer still being exposed.'

In April, a vicar was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed £30,000 in proceeds.

Jailed: The Rev Brian Shipsides, 56, was jailed for four and a half years for arranging bogus ceremonies for African nationals to marry European citizens so they could stay in Britain.

The Rev Brian Shipsides, 56, was jailed for four and a half years for 
arranging bogus  ceremonies for African nationals to marry European 
citizens so they could stay in Britain.

The vicar, whose motivation was described as financial, travelled around the world on the money.

Most of the bogus couples, who were being married at a rate of seven a 
day at one point, had already been refused leave to remain in Britain.

The sham marriages at All Saints Church in Forest Gate, East London, were ‘meticulously planned’.

Shipsides, who lives with his male partner in Dagenham, Essex, presided over almost all of the marriages.

He charged £140 a time and, instead of handing the money to the diocese and the Parish Church Council, he pocketed it.

The conspiracy, which the prosecution called a ‘massive and systematic 
immigration fraud’, was brought to a halt in July 2010.
