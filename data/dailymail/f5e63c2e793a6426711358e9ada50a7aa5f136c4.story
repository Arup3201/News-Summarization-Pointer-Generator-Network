The mansion is being sold by real estate entrepreneur Jeff Greene, who owns properties in Florida, New York and California, the LA Times reported.  

 Mr Greene, 59, who refers to the Mediterranean-style California property as 'a palace for the modern era', bought it in 2007 for $35million.

He then spent eight years and $25million expanding the residence to its current size. Now, its master suite alone sits at a whopping 5,000 square feet.

The villa was developed by Mohamed Hadid, who specializes in large estates, with the aid of architect Bob Ray Offenhauser and designer Alberto Pint.

Mr Hadid was married to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster, 50,  from 1994 until 2000. The couple have three children together.

Inside the entertainment complex, up to 250 guests can make use of a 50-seat theater, a bowling alley and a game room under hand-painted ceilings.

They can exit the complex via a floating-style, glass-floor pathway, which sits over several swimming pools lined by 70-year-old olive trees.

Once outside, residents can swim in a 128-foot reflecting pool, relax in a Turkish-style spa, walk through formal gardens and play on a tennis court.

They can also visit the beautiful vineyard, which produces 400 to 500 cases of wine a year under its own private label, Beverly Hills Vineyards. 

Fit for royalty: The property has been put on the market for $195million - making it the most expensive property for sale in America

The mansion, which boasts spectacular views of the West Side of Los Angeles, Century City and the sea, can host up to 1,000 people, with on-site parking for as many as 150 vehicles, according to KTLA 5. Guests are greeted at the front doors by an Italian-made fountain carved of Carrara marble.

The property is listed as the priciest home for sale in the U.S. under agents Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula, of Coldwell Banker Previews International.

Mr Greene, who has been renting the villa out for $475,000 a month and married his wife, Mei Sze Greene, there in 2007 with Mike Tyson as the best man, said he had always intended to sell it, but construction was not completed 'until literally a month ago', according to the Wall Street Journal.

'Honestly, I didn’t think it was going to be this much work,' he said, adding that the mansion has been mostly rented out to members of Saudi royalty.

In March, a similarly-sized mansion in nearby Holmby Hills sold for $102million, according to official records. However, it had just five acres of land. 

'This property is five times the size of that,' said Gottula. Other mansions have recently sold in Los Angeles - but none for more than $100million. 

 

While Jeff Greene's sprawling 25-acre estate is on the market for $195million, this property will not even set you back $200.

Flint, which has a population of less than 100,000, was one of the hardest hit cities before and during the recession, USA Today reported.

The house is located at 2518 Dakota Avenue, just off Michigan's Route 59 and not far from I-475.
