Qantas flights which travel over the Iraqi airspace have been re-routed to avoid another MH17-like disaster as tensions in the Middle East intensify.

The change took effect on Thursday night - two weeks after the Ukrainian tragedy - and will add up to 10 minutes to the seven-hour-long London to Dubai flight, which is scheduled for four times a day.

It is understood that instead of flying over Iraq, planes will take a path further east over Iran.

A Qantas spokesman said the airline has closely monitored flight paths over conflict zones since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago.

The tragedy claimed the lives of all 298 people on board, including 38 Australians.

He said Qantas flights from London to Dubai travel over Iraq at an altitude of 38,000 feet and 41,000 feet, well above the minimum altitude for commercial flights over Iraq.

But the US Federal Aviation Administration had just increased the minimum altitude from 20,000 feet to 30,000 feet, prompting a review of Qantas' London-Dubai route.

'Qantas has closely monitored the issue of flight paths over conflict zones, particularly in light of the MH17 tragedy, with safety our first priority,' the Qantas spokesman said.

'We have no new information that alters our safety assessment of flying over Iraq, especially given the altitudes we maintain over this region.

'However given the various restrictions imposed by different governments in the past 24 hours, including by the United States FAA, Qantas has temporarily rerouted its flights within the Middle East to avoid Iraqi airspace. This change will apply until further information becomes available.'

The airlines' decision comes after alliance partner Emirates announced its plans to stop flying above the area 10 days after the attack, Daily Mail Australia reported on Monday.
