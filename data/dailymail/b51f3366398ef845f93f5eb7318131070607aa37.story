A majority of people in every country in Europe think Brussels should negotiate with Britain to keep it in the EU – except the French.

Just four in 10 people in France think David Cameron’s demands for renegotiation should be met. More than half would rather see the UK ejected from the EU, according to a new European-wide poll.

It is the first time EU citizens have been asked whether Brussels should accommodate British demands for reform.

In each European country apart from France a majority think Britain's concerns should be accommodated

A majority in nine other European countries, including Germany, Poland and the Netherlands, all agreed that it would be better to negotiate with the UK than risk it walking away.

Six in 10 Britons said the EU should take their concerns into account, with only 35 percent saying that the UK should leave instead.

David Cameron has pledged to overhaul Britain’s relationship with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum on membership by 2017.

But the Europe-wide polling suggests the French will be the biggest roadblock to Mr Cameron’s demands for reform.

The polling was undertaken by think tank The German Marshall Fund of the United States, as part of a wide-ranging annual report on global opinions to major issues.

The Dutch were almost evenly split on the question, with just 45 percent saying Britain should be able to renegotiate, but fewer, 40 percent, thought that a UK exit was preferable.

Earlier this year, former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who served under François Mitterand, called for Britain to leave the Union saying that Britain was the cause of all of the EU’s problems.

He said: ‘Britain is a great country that has always refused to allow Europe to interfere in its affairs. It has blocked any further integration.

‘If they go, it becomes possible to respond to the needs of governing in Europe. Even Germany realises this and demands it. I hope for it a lot because they have prevented it from developing, they killed it.’

The French government has previously made it clear that it is in favour of Britain staying within the EU – but not at any cost.

Speaking in early 2013, the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius told JDD: ‘If you give in to the demands of the British Conservatives, the ball of wool will unravel, Europe will fray.

‘We will not resolve our problems by having a self-service or à la carte Europe. On the contrary.’

The GMF poll also asked whether people thought membership of the EU had been good for their country.

The Germans were most supportive of EU membership, with 76 per cent believing it to be good, against just 21 percent who did not agree.

Britons were the most sceptical, but a majority in the UK still thought that on balance membership was a good thing.

Just over half thought that membership had been beneficial, against 40 percent who thought that it had not.

None of the countries surveyed showed a majority for people believing that EU membership had not been beneficial.
