Simon Cowell was today under pressure to explain why several 'wannabe' stars on this year's Britain's Got Talent are already established professionals.

Some groups on the hit ITV show, which is watched by almost 10million viewers, have toured the world or had successful careers spanning at least 15 years, it has emerged.

Last Saturday's hit dance troupe, The 
CEO Dancers, have performed with star singer Rita Ora and the Pop'arrazi
Crew made the semi-finals of Holland's Got Talent and So You Think You 
Can Dance.

A source today said: 'The show is fast becoming Britain's Got Old Talent.'

Popular: Britain's Got Talent and its judges Simon Cowell, Amanda 
Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams attract millions of viewers each
week

Laugh-out-loud Impressionist Francine Lewis, has appeared on all five British Terrestrial channels since 1998.

This week the Mail also revealed that ‘sandwich makers’ Richard and Adam Johnson are a singing duo who have spent the past year performing 
at venues around the country and singing on P&O cruises.

The brothers also had talks with a Sony record label two years ago.

But a BGT spokesman told MailOnline: 'Anyone can apply for Britain's Got Talent whether they are professional or amateur, irrespective of their past experience and all contestants are auditioned on merit.'

Millions watch BGT every week as Simon Cowell, and judges including David Walliams, 41, and Amanda Holden, 42, search for the UK's most unique act to perform at The Royal Variety Show later this year.

In the latest show, last Saturday, London's CEO Dancers, Ezinne Asinugo, 22, Soliat Bada, 23, and Nqobilé Ntshangase, 24, were given rave reviews.

But it appears it was not mentioned that they have toured with Afrobeats artist D’Banj and supported Labrinth and Rita Ora.

The trio has also made a dance workout DVD together and won the best dance act award at BEFFTA  - the Black Entertainment Film Fashion TV and Arts.

Rivals Pop'arrazi Crew have built a successful career on TV in the Netherlands before appearing in ITV.

This week the Mail revealed that Richard and Adam Johnson had even released an album after being talent-spotted by legendary record producer Gordon Lorenz, who compared them to his former protégée Charlotte Church and branded them the ‘Panini Pavarottis’.

Business: Documents from Companies House show that the Johnson Brothers set up a PLC in March 2012

Humble: Richard and Adam Johnson said their day job was in a sandwich shop on Britain's Got Talent

And while they do still help out at their parents’ sandwich business, which includes two franchises of high-street chain Subway, their mother admitted: ‘To be frank, sandwiches are not their passion.’

It’s the second time in days that the ITV talent show has been hit by a row over ‘fakery’. Last week Alice Fredenham was accused of faking her stage fright to endear herself to the judges.

It is not clear whether tenor Richard, 22, and his 19-year-old baritone brother Adam told the show’s producers in advance  that they were more than just ‘sandwich makers’.

During their performance on Saturday’s show the jumper-wearing brothers were at pains to emphasise their family roots and humble credentials. Their grandmother Lorna Slack, 70, joined them briefly on stage and couldn’t contain her pride.

Interviewed beforehand, Richard explained: ‘We’ve been singing really for three years around the house, as you do. Anywhere and everywhere and really we always sing for Nan.’

Once they got on stage, judge Amanda Holden asked: ‘Have you got a day job?’ Richard replied: ‘Yes, we both work in sandwich shops, don’t we?’ Simon Cowell quipped: ‘So you’re classical sandwich makers. This I’m looking forward to.’

Cruising to stardom: Despite claiming that they work in a sandwich shop, Adam and Richard Johnson have sung on cruise ships and are seen here on the show Cruising with the Stars

Rising stars: Adam and Richard Johnson have a website, have sung on cruise ships and were billed as 'The Johnson Brothers' when they appeared on Loose Women

The pair received a standing ovation for their performance of musical hit The Impossible Dream.

But it later emerged the pair have spent more time polishing their act than they were willing to admit on television.

In
2011 they were talent-spotted by Lorenz after they began singing at 
Temptations, a cafe owned by their parents Paul and Julie near their 
home in Holywell, North Wales.

After
that they spent a season performing at the New Theatre in Bridlington, 
East Yorkshire. They also appeared alongside Ken Dodd at Liverpool’s 
Empire Theatre and performed with singer Joe Longthorne.

Last year they released their first 
album, which Ricky Tomlinson plugged during an appearance on Loose 
Women.

Four months 
ago, Richard wrote on the site: ‘Adam and I are now a duo singing around
the world, stay tuned!’ But they now seem less keen to boast about 
their professional experience. All references to their paid gigs have 
been removed from their official website.

They have worked on ten cruises since last August, and produced 1,000 copies of their self-made album to sell after those gigs.

They sang with Ken Dodd three times, and were paid ‘a couple of hundred pounds per performance’, the source said.
