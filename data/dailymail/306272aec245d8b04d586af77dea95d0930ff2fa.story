Cleveland kidnapping victim Michelle Knight was strung up with orange extension chords by her neck and feet 'like a fish' for days without food or water during her 11 years in captivity, it emerged today.

She made the revelations to Dr Phil McGraw in an exclusive interview which will offer the first glimpse into life inside the 'House of Horrors' at the hands of Ariel Castro.

Speaking of the unimaginable abuse she suffered, Michelle describes becoming Castro's prisoner: '[He used] one of those orange extension cords. I was tied up like a fish, an ornament on the wall. That's the only way I can describe it.

'I was hanging like this by my feet and i was tied by my neck and my arms with the extension cord going like that.'

She still has nerve damage on her hands and feet because of it.

Speaking ahead of the broadcast, Dr Phil said: 'When you listen to her describe the 
horrible living conditions and how she was treated, you wonder how 
anyone lasted a day let alone more than a decade.'

The only thing that gave her hope throughout her time in captivity was her two-year-old son.

'I'm fighting to stay alive for him,' she said in the excerpt, aired on the Today Show this morning.

Michelle will be the first of 
Castro's three victims to publicly speak out at length about the horrors
the women had to endure for more than a decade in the ramshackle 
Cleveland home before being rescued.

Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus escaped on May 6 when Berry pushed out a door and yelled for help.

Their kidnapper, Ariel Castro, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. He hanged himself on September 3, just weeks into his sentence.

During the exclusive interview with Dr Phil viewers will hear in great details about the antics and torture that occurred Castro's Cleveland house of horrors.

Michelle recalls the day-to-day details of her decade in captivity in a manner described as 'passionate, moving and poignant'.

'She
is the self-proclaimed, most hated victim in the house, and according 
to Knight, suffered the most abuse at the hands of Castro,' a statement 
read.

Dr Phil said of the interview: 'Michelle Knight's story of horror and 
courageous survival almost defies description and has changed me like no
other in 12 years of doing the show. Her dark journey 
from victim to victor is beyond compelling.'

Victims: Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have agreed to write a book about their terrible ordeal

The other victims, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, are collaborating with a Pulitzer Prize-winning team of Washington Post
reporters for a planned book about their ordeal. 

Michelle
was abducted on August 23, 2002 when she was 21 years old, a year 
before Amanda Berry in April 2003. A year later Gina deJesus joined 
them.

Berry and DeJesus said they will work with the Post's Mary Jordan, a
Cleveland native, and her husband and fellow reporter, Kevin Sullivan.

No meetings with publishers have been scheduled, although interest would
likely be based on the popularity of another kidnapping survivor's 
memoir, Jaycee Dugard's A Stolen Life.

Castro had been sentenced to life in prison, plus 1,000 years, but was found dead in his jail cell in September.

'Many
have told, and continue to tell, this story in ways that are both 
inaccurate and beyond the control of these young women,' said James 
Wooley, the attorney for Berry and DeJesus.

'Our clients have a strong 
desire for privacy, but it is a reality that confronts them every day. 
Gina, Amanda and their families have decided to take control and are now
interested in telling the story of what happened to them.'

Wooley
said in his statement that he had known Jordan for years and contacted 
her about the project.

Jordan said during a recent interview that
she was drawn to the 'resilience' of Berry and DeJesus and was eager to
help them tell an 'amazing story of overcoming adversity'.

In 2003, she
and Sullivan won a Pulitzer for their series about the Mexican criminal
justice system.

Investigators said the three victims were bound, repeatedly raped and deprived 
of food and bathroom facilities.

At
his sentencing, Knight told Castro: 'I spent 11 years in hell, now your
hell is just beginning'. She was the only one of the three girls to 
attend.
