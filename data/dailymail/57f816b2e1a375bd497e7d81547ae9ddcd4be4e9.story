A would-be marriage proposal turned into a fight of life and death for one New England pilot.

Mark Simmons had just taken off in his Piper with a banner proclaiming the words: ‘Will you marry me?’ But words of romance turned into words of terror as the plane went down, with Mr Simmons yelling out several ‘mayday’ radio alerts.

But thanks to a Good Samaritan, and the pilot’s brave son, the pilot was rescued unscathed from the water.

Mr Simmons was flying his Piper Pawnee plane, having taken off from the Westerly Airport yesterday afternoon.

Connecticut’s The Day reports that he lost power 10 minutes into his flight. The Coast Guard, hearing his call, sent out a helicopter and a response boat.

Mr Simmons’ son Ethan helped the Coast Guard quicken their search, telling them that his father had just taken off.

Meanwhile, Mr Simmons was preparing for the crash landing. He told The Westerly Sun that he removed his seat belt and grabbed a floating tire.

Even though he was calm and prepared, he told the paper: ‘Nothing prepares you for sitting in the ocean by yourself.’

By the time the Coast Guard arrived, Mr Simmons had already been rescued from the Block Island Sound by a civilian boater.

Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Bryan Swintek told the Day that the Good Samaritan pulled him from the water near Ninigret Pond, near Charlestown, Rhode Island.

Lt. Swintek said that Mr Simmons was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation, but was not seriously hurt. 

‘He was incredibly calm,’ Lt Swintek said. But Mr Simmons’ plane was not so lucky. The Coast Guard told MailOnline that the Piper Pawnee sunk to the bottom of the Sound.

No word on whether the couple for whom that banner was intended is currently engaged.
