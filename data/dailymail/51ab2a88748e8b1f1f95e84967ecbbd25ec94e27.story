A cruel dog owner has been jailed after beating his pet Staffordshire bull terrier so badly that it lost and eye and was left permanently disabled.

Sadistic Jack Carling, 19, 'tortured' dog Biggie at his home in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, never letting him or his other pet dog Sophie out for exercise.

Carling was jailed for three months at Hull Crown Court and banned from keeping animals for life.

Cruel: Jobless Jack Carling, left, has been jailed for three months and banned from keeping animals after abusing his pet Staffordshire bull terrier Biggie (right) and his other dog Sophie

Abused: Biggie lost an eye because of the injuries Carling inflicted and was found to have a number of healed fractures

Vets concluded all of Biggie's injuries were caused by 'malicious trauma.'

District Judge Frederick Rutherford said: 'this dog has been subjected to such torture almost beggars belief.'Â 

Witness Troy Allen, who lived with Carling said Biggie and his other dog Sophie lived in fear of their owner.

Prosecutor Philip Brown said: 'Troy said Jack would get angry with the dogs, he witnessed him beating the dogs. He said they would get into the smallest of spaces to hide from [Carling].

'He said he would beat them every day. He didn't let them out, they would just stay on the sofa, scared.'

Care: As well as being abused, Biggie and Carling's other dog, Sophie (right) were also found to have been kept in completely unsuitable conditions

Biggie and Sophie were seized by the RSPCA on January 7. Mr Brown said: 'Vets said there was evidence of a self-healed fracture to [Biggie's] leg and a fracture to the hip. There was also an injury to an eye, which required it to be removed.

'He was also suffering a nasal discharge, which was treated with antibiotics but kept returning. It was causing such concern that vets decided to carry out an invasive, intensive operation to open up the nasal cavity.'

During the operation, vets noticed part of Biggie's skull was ten times thicker than it should be. There was also damage to cartilage and tissue, which vets concluded was also the result of trauma.

Future: Biggie has made a good recovery following his horrifying ordeal. He and Sophie are now due to be rehomed

Mr Brown said: 'He was caused immense physical suffering by the repeated malicious trauma inflicted on him. He has experienced daily fear, wondering what would happen to him next. He is disabled for life.

'The vet says it is upsetting to think this lovely-natured dog could be subjected to this degree of treatment.'

The court heard the dogs were also kept in 'wholly unsuitable' living conditions, with the floor covered in urine and excrement.

When RSPCA inspector Hannah Bryer began investigating the case, Carling told her he 'didn't care' what she said and that she could not do anything about it.

Carling pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering, failing to prevent suffering from injury or disease and failing to provide a suitable living environment for the dogs.

He has several previous convictions for violence. In mitigation, Michael Robinson said: 'I have known Jack for many years and I am surprised at the extent of the suffering he accepts causing this animal.'

Carling had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, he said.

Judge Rutherford said: 'It is rare that I have seen a dog subjected to such acts over such a long period to of time to survive. The dog has been left disabled as a direct consequence.

'You have shown complete arrogance in the manner you have behaved towards the animal and those investigating this case.'

The RSPCA will now try to rehome Biggie and Sophie.
