The Prime Minister has accused Ed Miliband of ‘wriggling like an eel’ when pressed on whether he intended to use the NHS as a political weapon.

In November, the BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson revealed: ‘A phrase the Labour leader uses in private is that he wants to – and I quote – weaponise the NHS for politics.’

Yesterday it emerged that Mr Miliband made the comment almost two months ago, in a private meeting attended by up to 15 senior executives at the Corporation.   

His remark was brought up in the Commons last week by David Cameron, who said he thought that it was a ‘disgusting’ thing to say.

David Cameron this morning accused Ed Miliband of 'squirming like an eel' by refusing seven times to deny that he wanted to ‘weaponise’ the NHS

And pressure on Mr Miliband deepened over the weekend, as he was asked seven times on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether he had used the word, but only said that he did not recall it.

He failed to disown the phrase, saying: ‘I want to fight for the NHS. I don’t recall exactly what I said, but we are in a fight for the National Health Service, and I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that I’m really concerned about what’s happening to our NHS.’

Yesterday the Labour leader again avoided the issue at an event with voters, with his spokesman saying he would not comment on the contents of a private meeting. 

Appearing at the event with voters in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, he chose not take any questions from the press.

Asked about Mr Miliband’s comments as he unveiled his election priorities in Nottingham yesterday, David Cameron said: ‘Frankly I think it was an appalling thing to say. 

'The NHS is not a weapon, it is what we have for looking after our families, for caring for the elderly, the ill and the frail. It is the most vital public service in our country.’

He added: ‘Watching that exchange, where he was wriggling like an eel, made it absolutely clear to me that he did say those words and that is why he wouldn’t deny it, and I think in one moment we learned more about Labour’s attitude to the NHS than we’ve learned for five years, they see it as a political weapon. I think it’s disgraceful.’ 

Labour leader Ed Miliband clashed with  David Cameron last week over the NHS crisis  after the PM raised comments he had made to the BBC political editor Nick Robinson (right)

Last night Mr Miliband told LBC Radio: ‘This is a smokescreen from the Conservative Party. It’s not about the words people use, it’s about the commitments they make.’

And a Labour source said: ‘We’ve been really clear, this is a fight about the future of the Health Service, and we’re going to make sure we make it that fight. 

'We are not going to talk about what were the words used in a private conversation. What we won’t do is leave in any doubt that we intend to make this a fight about the NHS.’

But NHS campaigner Julie Bailey, whose mother died following blunders at Stafford Hospital, told the Mail: ‘What a disgraceful comment from Miliband, planning to weaponise the NHS.

‘Putting politics before patients was a mistake they made when they were last in government, and why they should not be trusted with the NHS again.’
