A furious Harvard Business School professor has gone to extreme measures to recuperate $4 from a Massachusetts restaurant he claims overcharged him.

Ben Edelman - an associate professor of business administration for the prestigious - ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from Sichuan Garden in Brookline on Friday, but was shocked when the pill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu.

He emailed the restaurant, who admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing Edelman to send a barrage of threatening emails that have now been made public by Boston.com

'Under Massachusetts law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price,' Edelman wrote.

'I urge you to cease this practice immediately.

'In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge.

'The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations.

'Please refund the $12 to my credit card. Or you could mail a check for $12 to my home.'

Edelman recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden.

'We are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic Sichuan cuisine,' Duan wrote.

'I will honor the website price and honor you the $3.00.'

However this only seemed to infuriate Edelman further.

'It strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred,' Edelman wrote back.

'To wit, your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout. 

'You did so knowingly, knowing that your website was out of date.

'You don't seem to recognise that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far-reaching resolution. 

'Nor do you recognise the principle, well established in applicable laws, that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer, the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge.'

Duan, who appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender', responded with an obvious question: 'You seem like a smart man. But is this really worth your time?'

Again, Edelman came back firing. 

'You're right that I have better things to do,' Edelman's replied. 

'If you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund I requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it.

'The more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault, the more determined I am to seek a greater sanction against you.'

Not happy: Edelman went to great lengths to get the restaurants to credit him $12 over the so-called mishap

Edelman 'passed the matter on to the authorities' in Brookline.

Duan wrote back: 'Once again thank you for bringing it to my attention, I will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation.

'Once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you, we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on..

'I will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill.

'I have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit.

'I hope you understand I want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly.

'I will keep you updated as soon as they contact me.'

According to Boston.com, besides Harvard, Edelman also operates a consulting practice that works at 'preventing and detecting online fraud (especially advertising fraud)'.

His clients include Microsoft, the NFL, the New York Times, and Universal Music.

Edelman sent a statement to Business Insider saying he believes how he handled the situation with Sichuan Garden was helping other people as well.

'We all rely on trust in our daily lives, that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant,' he told the website.

'We all take most of this for granted.'
