A signed photograph of Adolf Hitler that was salvaged from the ruins of his Berlin bunker in the final days of World War Two has emerged for sale for £18,000.

The portrait was found among the rubble by late British newspaperman William Forrest, the first war correspondent at the scene days after the Fuhrer and his mistress Eva Braun committed suicide in 1945.

The photo of Hitler was taken in 1929 after his release from prison where he served five years for high treason for an attempted government coup in Bavaria.

It is thought the 16ins tall picture was on display in the bunker as a reminder of his perceived struggle.

Hitler took up residency in the bunker built beneath the Reich Chancellery in January 1945 and married Braun there on April 29, 1945 as the Russian army rapidly closed in.

Mr Forrest, the chief war correspondent of the News Chronicle, was embedded with British troops when they arrived in Berlin at the end of the war.

He spotted the photograph on the floor and took it as a souvenir of the war.

In a letter from Mr Forrest that will be sold alongside the photo, he said: 'Throughout World War II, I was the chief war correspondent of the News Chronicle. In that capacity I went into Berlin at the end of the war with the first British troops.

'My reports from Berlin at that time can be seen in the files of the News Chronicle at the British Museum's Newspaper Library at Colindale, London.

'This signed photograph of Hitler was discovered by me in the ruins of the bunker and has been in my possession ever since.'

The items are tipped to fetch £18,000 when they go under the hammer at The Auction Centre in Runcorn, Cheshire.

The signed photograph was found by journalist William Forrest - who left this letter that will be sold alongside the photo at the auction on September 13

Auctioneer Michael Bain said: 'William Forrest was one of the most respected war correspondents of his time and arrived in Berlin with the first British troops after the Red Army had taken Berlin.

'Among the ruins of Hitler's bunker he spotted this photograph of Hitler which had been signed and dated 'Landsberg 1925'.

'It was taken the year after Hitler's release from Landsberg prison where he famously wrote Mein Kampf.

'It's likely that Hitler had kept the photo to remind himself of the struggle he felt he had gone through.

'The fact that Hitler had it with him in the bunker in the final days of the war suggests it was close to his heart.

'Before he died, William Forrest wrote a letter explaining how the photograph had come to be in his possession.

'He passed both on to our current vendor in the early 1990s and he has had it ever since.

'This is a hugely important historical item with a provenance as good as they come.

'Anything related to World War II is desirable to collectors and we are expecting a huge amount of interest in this photograph.'

William Forrest started his journalism career in 1917 aged 15 as a copy runner at the Glasgow Herald but due to a shortage of reporters he was quickly promoted to the sub-editors' desk.

He went on to become one of the greatest war correspondents of the 20th century, covering Guernica in the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, the Dunkirk evacuation and D-Day.

Mr Forrest was awarded an OBE for his journalism in 1946 and continued working right up until the 1980s. He died in 1996 aged 94.

The auction will take place on September 13.
