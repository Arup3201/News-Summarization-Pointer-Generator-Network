Jeremy Meeks, the ex-convict who made the Internet swoon with his criminally handsome mug, learned on Tuesday that he will be turned over to federal authorities to face a weapons charge.

Meeks was led into a courtroom in Stockton, California, wearing handcuffs and an orange jail garb for a brief appearance during which the state agreed to drop the charges against him.

Meeks was arrested on a slew of state felony counts June 18 as part of a gang bust in Stockton.

Strike a pose: Jeremy Meeks, 30, pouted in court Tuesday when he learned that his case has been taken over by federal prosecutors

Bad news: Instead of a slew of state charges, the 30-year-old accused gang member will face a single count of a felon in possession of a firearm; he could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted

Now, the 30-year-old viral sensation will
 be sent to Sacramento to face a single federal charge of felon in 
possession of a firearm, reported KXTV.

If convicted, Meeks could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The move also means that it will be a long time before Meeks' high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes grace another photo: in the federal court system, pictures and videos are not permitted. 

Meeks’ attorney, Tai Bogan, asked the judge to allow his client to appear in civilian clothing in court so he could get a fair trial, but the request was denied. 

Meeks’ smoldering booking photo was posted to the Stockton police Facebook page and has garnered international media attention and secured him a Hollywood agent thanks to his model-like features.

Last month, his lawyer told MailOnline that his client, a married father-of-one, was in talks with top fashion designers to dress him for his trial.

Tai Bogan said that it was important that his client looked as ‘good as possible’ before a jury and to that end the family were close to signing designers to cloth him during his court appearances.

Hollywood agent Gina Rodriguez, who represented 'Octomom' Nadya Suleman and V. Stiviano, the notorious ex-girlfriend of Clippers owner Donald Sterling, has taken Meeks on as a client.
