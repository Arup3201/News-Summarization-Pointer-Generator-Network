Tragic: David Bogenberger joined fraternity because he just 'wanted to fit in'

Twenty two university students are facing charges following the death of a freshman who died after downing vodka in an initiation ceremony.

In a two hour ritual David Bogenberger, 19, had to answer a series of questions at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity in Northern Illinois University in exchange for alcohol.

He was found dead the following day in his fraternity house bed with five times the legal driving limit of alcohol in his blood.

The attorney of David's family told theÂ Chicago Tribune the finance major just 'wanted to be liked'.

Five leaders of the fraternity were charged on Monday with felony hazing by DeKalb County authorities. A further 17 members face misdemeanor charges.

The fraternity stopped operating following David's death on November 2.

The initiation was part of an annual ritual dubbed 'parents night' where new recruits are assigned to senior members and encouraged to drink excessive quantities of alcohol.

David, from Palatine, Cook County, had made a pledge to the house so he could make friends.

The family attorney Peter R. Coladarci told the Tribune: 'He wanted to be accepted. It's a classic case of a kid who just wants to fit in with the group.'

Fraternity president Alexander M. Jandick, 21; vice president James P Harvey, 21; pledge adviser Omar Salameh, 21; secretary Patrick W Merrill, 19, and event planner Steven A Libert have all been charged with felony hazing.

If convicted they face up to three years in jail or probation.

In a statement released by police, David's family said they want to see 'significant change'.

It read: 'We have no desire for revenge. We must realize that young people can and do die in hazing rituals. Alcohol-involved hazing and initiation must end.'

Mr Coladarci said the family are not seeking an 'eye for an eye' but said such college campus hazing incidents are a 'national health epidemic'.

Police have accused the fraternity leaders had deliberately not told campus officials about the party so they would not be subject to inspections.

Lieutenant Jason Leverton, of the DeKalb Police Department, said the group 'knowingly' did not register the event because of the quantity of alcohol they planned to consume.

Mr Coladarci said one of the students, believed to be facing charges, call David's family to express his regret.

Temporary sanctions have been placed on the fraternity by the university.

The university has also announced disciplinary charges against 31 members, who are accused of breaking the student code of conduct.
