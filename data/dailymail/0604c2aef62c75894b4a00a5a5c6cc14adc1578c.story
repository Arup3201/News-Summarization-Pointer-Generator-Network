England team sponsor Vauxhall were forced to apologise after breaching security by tweeting team sheets with the players’ passport numbers.

The official FIFA team sheets always have the numbers alongside the names of the players, along with their date of birth, but the sensitive passport information is not for publication.

England’s team sheet, with the names of the starting line up and seven substitutes, was handed out 45 minutes before kick off against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium.

Security breach: Stan Collymore tweeted a picture of the England team sheet - but it contained the players' passport details and went viral on social media. Team sponsor Vauxhall apologised 

But Vauxhall didn’t spot the passport numbers and in their haste to publish the information, the England commercial partner tweeted the information.

It was then tweeted hundreds of times before Vauxhall deleted the tweet and issued an apology.

The Press Association also mistakenly tweeted a picture of the team sheet with the sensitive passport information.

A Vauxhall spokesman said: ‘We realised we made a mistake immediately and the tweet was deleted from our account within a minute. We have apologised to the FA for any embarrassment caused.’

Stateside: talkSPORT commentator Stan Collymore was one of those to Tweet the picture
