Writ: Physiotherapist Paul Edwards, pictured, is suing the firm behind Willows Farm Village and Park after breaking his back on a trampoline in May last year

The Bank of England's in-house physiotherapist has launched a £300,000 compensation claim against a children's theme park after breaking his back in a trampolining accident.

Paul Edwards, who provides physio for Sir Mervyn King and some of the nation's other top bankers, fractured his spine on a visit to Willows Farm Village and Park near St Albans, Hertfordshire.

The incident happened in May last year.

Mr Edwards, 40, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, claims that he struck his back while bouncing because the trampoline was 'positioned too close to the ground below it'.

He is suing park owners Bowmans Farms Ltd - who advertise that visitors to Willows Park will experience 'acres of fun' - for a minimum of £300,000 in damages.

In a High Court writ, Mr Edwards says he was 'using a trampoline which he was permitted to use and was using it in a normal manner' when he injured his back.

Mr Edwards, who runs his own physiotherapy clinic 
in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, with his wife Nicky, as well as working 
for the Bank of England since 2008,  had an annual membership to Willows Farm Village and the accident happened during a family visit to the park on a Sunday.

The writ says: 'Mr Edwards was using a trampoline...when, after jumping upwards and then landing on the stretched fabric of the trampoline, he struck the ground beneath the fabric and suffered a serious injury to his back.

'His injuries were caused by negligence or breach of an implied term of the contract that the trampolining facilities would be safe for him to use,' it is alleged.

Mr Edwards also claims that staff at the theme park had 'positioned the trampoline on a slope...so that it was too close to the ground below it, failed to place the trampoline on level ground (and) failed to ensure that there was sufficient distance between the stretched fabric component of the trampoline and the ground below it.'

According to the writ, Mr Edwards suffered 'a serious injury to his back including a wedge compression fracture of the 12th thoratic vertebra.'

In their defence to the action, Tanja Neuhof, for Bowmans Farms Ltd, said the company 'admits primary liability' for Mr Edwards' accident, but 'reserve the right to allege contributory negligence against him.'

Miss Neuhof added that the company makes no admission regarding Mr Edwards's injury or his current medical complaints.
