The trial of Russian media  magnate Alexander Lebedev got off to a farcical start yesterday when five witnesses refused to give evidence against him.

The tycoon – whose family own The Independent and London Evening Standard – pleaded not guilty to a charge of hooliganism and assault ‘based on political hatred’.

The allegation relates to a punch  Lebedev, 53, threw at businessman  Sergei Polonsky on a TV talk show.

Defiant: A witness told the court today that Mr Lebedev had been provoked before hitting Mr Polonsky. Five other witnesses refused to give evidence against him

Mr Lebedev, an outspoken critic of 
Russian president Vladimir Putin, owns Novaya Gazeta, Moscow’s leading 
investigative publication which regularly exposes state corruption.

He is the most high-profile Putin 
foe  to be dragged through the courts this year in what many see as a 
Kremlin-inspired prosecution.

If convicted, the former KGB agent faces up to five years in jail.

However, yesterday’s refusal by  witnesses to attend court is a major blow to the state’s case.

Even the lawyer for Mr Polonsky said his client would not give evidence and was out of the country.

Commenting on the bizarre legal situation, Mr Lebedev’s lawyer, Genri Reznik, said: ‘I have never heard anything like this.

Emotions: A witness in the audience during the show told a court today that Mr Polonsky had been acting 'emotionally' before Mr Lebedev hit him

‘Will the prosecutor’s office be so weak not even to bring their  witnesses? Is this how our people respect the system?’

Entering his not guilty plea on the 
first day of his trial, Mr Lebedev said: ‘The gist of the charges is not
clear for me, particularly the point of political hatred, given that I 
had never met Polonsky before, and had not actually spoken to him, apart
from a brief exchange.

‘My action had completely different reasons.’

Mr Lebedev has previously stated that
he hit out because he feared Mr Polonsky, a 40-year-old ex-paratrooper,
was poised to strike him. In another twist yesterday, a prosecution 
witness ended up supporting Mr Lebedev’s version of events and denied 
there was any political motive to the punch.

Mother-of-five Anna Slavina, a member
of the studio audience at the 2011 TV talk show, said: ‘There were no 
political discussions.’

Viral: Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral on the internet

‘It was an educational show, not entertaining, not political. I learned a lot,’ she said.

She added that she approved of Mr Lebedev’s response to his extreme provocation.

She said that before the punch was 
thrown, Polonsky behaved ‘in a strongly emotional way. He was jumping 
around’. Asked to clarify, she said: ‘He jumped, he waved. And Lebedev 
tried to calm him down, just like a parent would calm down a naughty 
child.

‘Strange, but Polonsky’s negative emotions for some reason were targeted at Lebedev.’

Mr Polonsky’s ‘quick and wide 
gestures could have been considered to be dangerous,’ she said. ‘They 
were talking, discussing, even shouting.’

Mr Lebedev ‘controlled himself’ she said. ‘Someone else in this situation would have acted more quickly and actively... 

Hooliganism: Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed Lebedev's behaviour 'hooliganism'

‘Maybe it was because of the age 
difference, Polonsky is young and active. Lebedev was in control of 
himself, he tried to answer in a polite way...’

She also confirmed that at one point 
Mr Polonsky threatened Mr Lebedev by saying: ‘I want to wipe your nose.’
‘Yes he did,’ she said. ‘The presenter said – sit down, calm down. 
Lebedev reacted like a proper man, he controlled himself.’

The only other witness to give  
evidence yesterday, cameraman Denis Kolozov, said he had been filming 
the audience and only saw the punch later when footage of it went viral 
on the internet.
Mr Polonsky was last night believed to be in Israel.

In March,  he was released on bail by a court in Cambodia over allegations that he kidnapped and assaulted six sailors.

Commenting on the likelihood of 
forcing Mr Polonsky to attend the trial, judge Andrei Bakhvalov said:  
‘Our bailiffs cannot search for him outside Russia, we are working only 
on our territory.’

The trial will resume on Thursday.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
