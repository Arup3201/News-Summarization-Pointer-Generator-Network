Almost two years ago, Neil Lennon masterminded Celtic's famous Champions League victory over Barcelona - now he's at the bottom of the Championship.

The former Northern Ireland midfielder was appointed manager of Bolton on Sunday and has one of the most difficult tasks in English football as he looks to arrest Wanderers' alarming slump.

Lennon concedes he has a 'big job on his hands' at a club who are £160million-plus in debt where losing has become a habit, and the fact he has taken the Bolton post highlights problems facing British and Irish bosses (although there are five managers in the Championship with experience as a Champions league boss).

He turned down more lucrative offers abroad and will hope to lead his new club up the Championship table. Here's his in-tray at the Macron Stadium...

BUILD FROM THE BACK

Bolton are too easy to beat and concede goals at an alarming rate. In their last two matches they shipped four at Fulham and let in two against 10-man Bournemouth - both matches were lost. In fact, Bolton have won the joint-fewest games in the Football League this season - their solitary victory coming over Rotherham. 

Lennon knows how to organise a defence - last season Celtic keeper Fraser Forster set a Scottish Premiership record for minutes without conceding a goal. Some of that solidity is needed at the Macron.

PICK A SETTLED TEAM

Lennon's predecessor Dougie Freedman seemingly made changes for the sake of it or to show how clever he was. Despite bemoaning in an interview that he was never able to have a settled side, the Scot would make three or four alterations to his line-up and often put square pegs in round holes.

Lennon also, as Mike Bassett might say, needs to play 'four-four-f****** two', especially at home - in that win over Rotherham, Bolton played with two up front and Joe Mason scored a hat-trick.

It is easy to forget there are some good players in this Bolton squad - Matt Mills was bought for £5million not so long ago, Jay Spearing has played in an FA Cup final, Lee Chung-yong has scored in two World Cups - but Mark Davies is the spark and one of the best players in the division when fit. He needs to be nurtured.

GET THE FANS ONSIDE

Bolton supporters do like a moan (name a club where fans don't grumble) but there is a huge disconnect at the moment between the club and their followers and home attendances are falling off a cliff.

Many were unimpressed by Freedman's apparent disdain for them, randomly-generated team selections and haughty air in press conferences, and some made their feelings known by invading the pitch in his last home match in charge against Derby.

Lennon says he wants to play in the style that will 'make the fans happy' and goals and victories should do the job.

SEE WHETHER THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT 

A club that is £160m-plus in debt cannot keep relying on loan players and Lennon must aim to bring through lads from the academy and give them a chance in the Championship.

The likes of midfielder Josh Vela, striker Conor Wilkinson and defender Joe Riley are rated by those who know but spend more time out on loan than around the Bolton first team.

If, as looks likely, there is another season outside the top flight, the money will dry up even further and the kids will make up more of the side. Lennon would be wise to introduce some of them gradually.

IT'S A COMPETITIVE DIVISION

OK, so maybe this is a bit of a cheap shot at the Scottish Premiership, but leading Bolton to survival after their horror start will be a tougher job than winning the title with Celtic.

The cliche about the Championship is that it is the hardest division to get out of and while Wanderers would prefer to stay in it, Lennon will have to adjust to his team not being favourites in virtually every match they play.

It seems he and his assistants Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker are up for the challenge. Lennon turned down a £2m-a-year offer to manage in Saudi Arabia.

It has to be assumed that Lennon, who has signed a three-year contract at Bolton, is looking to get a Premier League job by doing well at the Macron.

The fact he has to drop to the bottom of the Championship is a potential worry for other managers from these shores.

But at least Lennon knows the only way is up.
