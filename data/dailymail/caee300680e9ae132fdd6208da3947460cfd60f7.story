He may not yet be able to talk, but Prince George’s body language spoke volumes at his first royal ‘meet and greet’: and every movement revealed a baby destined to be King.

As an expert on body language – I’ve written 26 books on the subject – I’ve been following the royal family for over 30 years and I have been riveted by these images of George.

Clearly a calm, extremely sociable and very self-confident baby, he’s not just happy to be the centre of attention - he absolutely revels in it.

He may not yet be able to talk, but Prince George's body language spoke volumes at his first royal 'meet and greet'

It’s such a contrast to the images 31 years ago of the William’s first tour of Australia. Although he was a month older than his son is now, his body language betrayed an underlying shyness and anxiety.

He never wanted to stray far from his parents and kept checking back with them. While obviously an incredibly sweet little boy, there was an air of vulnerability and nervousness about him that you can still, at times, detect in him now.

Although George is so tiny, he is already showing a very powerful personality, ready smile and very mature body language for a baby.

His first duty, after the ravages of a 30 hour flight was to play nicely with a group of children he had never met before at a playgroup.

It would be a tall order for any baby, let alone one who - you might suppose - does not get many opportunities to mingle. None of us would have been surprised if George had bawled his eyes out or, at the very least, buried his head shyly in his mum’s neck. And who would blame Kate and William if they had looked riven with trepidation?

Instead, George took everything in his stride. Unlike most of the other children, who stayed rooted on the spot, fixated on the carpet or snuggled against their parents, George never gave his a backward glance as he threw himself into his new social whirl, proving delightfully curious and eager to engage.

And his relaxed, smiling parents were clearly expecting nothing less. It’s obvious from their open stance and beaming smiles that they knew he would be absolutely fine. Why? Because they have made him so – purely by being so happy and relaxed themselves

George The Bold

Despite the fact he’s among complete strangers, George is already holding court. Sitting right in the middle of the group with his feet pointing together and knees out like this implies a high degree of self-confidence and not the slightest flicker of social anxiety.

George the bold - he's happy as the centre of attention, particularly making sure he's at centre of Kate's

Curious George

This is an Alpha baby in motion. George has recognised the biggest toy in the room and is going straight for it. His very intense gaze, jutting lower lip and firmly set jaw are unexpected in such a young baby - signalling real focus and determination. With his eyes on the prize, he’s not concerned with checking back with his parents: he’s off on his own, propelling himself purposefully across the floor.

Curious George - he's honed in on the toy he wants and no one's going to stand in his way

Hands-on George 

Said toy secured, George is now showing it off as a trophy to the other babies. Tellingly though, he’s not grabbing it protectively - nor is he crowing - he’s just eager to engage his new friends’ attention, so they can appreciate his achievement. This is a little chap who’s going to grow up knowing exactly how to get his own way, in the most charming way possible.

Jigging George

This is such a genuinely joyful pose. Kate’s smiling, relaxed expression shows that she has absolutely no fears that George is about to get upset. She knows her boy well enough to know he will take being the centre of attention all in his stride.

Perfect Pouter

That bottom lip may be out again, but it’s George’s confident gaze and the relaxed way he’s sitting in his mother’s arms that are really telling here. Remember the way Diana habitually carried William protectively on her hip? Kate is relaxed enough to hold George in front of her - almost like she’s offering him a seat, allowing him to face the world.

Perfect pouter - jutting bottom lip suggests he's going to be good at getting what he wants

Mama’s Boy

Babies love to play with their mum’s hair, and George’s gesture shows they have a playful, tactile relationship. It’s also very interesting to see that Kate holds George at eye level, yet still allows a gap between their bodies. This is a gesture of equals – Diana was a great hugger, but the less confident William would have buried his face in his mum’s neck at this point.

Mama's boy - even at 8 months, he's already got an eye for Kate's mane attraction

Gorgeous George

You can’t tell who is enjoying this cuddle more. Although George is clearly content in his mother’s arms, he still has his eyes on the room, as though he is sizing up with toy he might play with next. It’s also clear that this wasn’t an emergency cuddle to soothe him: just an expression of love.

Gorgeous George - going in for a cuddle, although he's not overly clingy with Kate

Fearless George

George
 is after another child’s toy - typical of a budding Alpha male. At this
 moment many mothers would have worried their child would do something 
hideous, like whack the other child on the head with it. But Kate looks 
unfazed. She’s obviously not concerned George is going to be aggressive 
or start crying. He just wants to share the game.

Fearless George - happily making new friends (and a grab for their toys, too)
