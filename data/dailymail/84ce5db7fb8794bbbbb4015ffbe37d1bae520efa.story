A piece of street-art which appeared overnight in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, could be an original Banksy.

The stencil, painted in the style of the world-famous street artist, depicts classical composer Sir Edward Elgar using a smartphone.

The 6ft tall artwork is thought to have been painted in the early hours of the morning on a wall near a park in Sir Edward’s hometown.

Another masterpiece? A Banksy-style stencil painting depicting Sir Edward Elgar using a mobile phone has appeared overnight in Malvern, Worcestershire

This would be the first time Banksy has made his mark on Malvern, with his art more frequently seen in London and his hometown Bristol.

The image has been painted next to a red phone box and appears to bear all the classic Banksy characteristics, but could still be a talented copycat.

It shows Elgar nonchalantly standing with one hand in his pocket, wearing a bowler hat and clutching a bright green smartphone.

A spokesperson for Malvern Town Council said they were in discussions with Banksy and unable to comment further.

Today, excited residents living in the spa town said they were sure the work - painted by Rosebank Gardens park - was that of Banksy.

Just checking Twitter: Residents were thrilled when they discovered the artwork, which appears to have been painted during the early hours of Monday

Fingers crossed: Although Malvern Town Council were unable to confirm the authenticity of the artwork, they said they are in discussions with Banksy

Mother-of-two Sue Langley, 54, from Malvern, who was visiting the park yesterday, said: ‘It looks just like a Banksy. I'm sure it's him. I really hope it is because it would be a real honour.

UK-based street artist Banksy is known worldwide for his stencils which often carries political messages or questions society.

His most famous artworks include Naked Man - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and Balloon Girl, which he has created several of across London including Hackney and the South Bank, and rats can often be found in his stencils.

Despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for several hundred thousands, he has managed to keep his identity hidden.

It has been confirmed that he is originally from Bristol, thought in his 30s, and his name is believed to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham.

He has allegedly been photographed three times, in New York last year, In Santa Monica in 2011 and in Hackney in 2007.

‘It's definitely in Banksy's stencil-style that's for sure so there is a good chance it could be him.

'He has been known to pop up in big cities worldwide but to come to our little town is amazing.’

Retired mechanic Bob Smalling, 66, added: ‘It's brilliant. Fingers crossed the council don't decide to remove it.

'It looks lovely and really pays homage to our most famous son.’

However, others were not so keen with accountant Benjamin Lovell, 45, adding: ‘It is vandalism and it should be cleaned off.’

Malvern Town Council has yet to confirm whether the painting would be removed by cleaners.

Banksy’s artworks are highly sought after and often fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction.

Just last week, a Los Angeles man tried to steal an entire wall in New Orleans bearing a Banksy painting.
