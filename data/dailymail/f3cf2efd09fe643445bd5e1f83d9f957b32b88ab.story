When Boris Johnson was mistaken for German tennis ace Boris Becker in India last year, the London Mayor laughed it off.

But as the namesakes shared a joke at a party last night onlookers could be forgiven for seeing the resemblance.

As the pair of renowned Lotharios posed for the cameras, it was clear that they share more than just a name.

The bizarre scene emerged at a party last night to mark the launch of a book by Johnson's father Stanley.

They shared a joke at the Pasley-Tyler private members' club in Mayfair, to celebrate the book  UNEP The First 40 Years.

It became clear that to duo share more than just a first name. Former world number one Becker's blonde hair was swept back, in stark contrast to Johnson's trademark scruffy locks. Their rosy cheeks as they smiled for the cameras added to the likeness.

Confusion between the pair went global last year, when the London Mayor went on a six-day visit to India.

At an event in Mumbai which saw the handing over of petals from the 
Olympic Cauldron to Indian athletes, the Old Etonian was asked if he 
was the Wimbledon legend.

Akash Bharadia, an 18-year-old on a gap year volunteering at the temple,
said: 'One of the locals shouted out it was Boris Becker while some 
people asked whether he was the King of England. They know it's Boris, that's the main thing.'

Certainly if Johnson had picked up a tennis racket it would soon have become clear he was not the former world champion.

In 2011 he admitted defeat after facing several vollies from schoolchidren in London.

'You can be completely hopeless at sport, as indeed I am,' he said at the time. 'But you can still get something out of it, you can still enjoy it and you can learn about defeat which is a vital skill for everybody to learn.'

He also squared up to David Cameron in a game of wheelchair tennis ahead of the Paralympic Games, although Johnson has always preferred table tennis - or wiff-waff as he calls it.

They have also both made headlines for all the wrong reasons, after fathering secret love children.

Becker famously had sex with model Angela Ermakova in London's Nobu restaurant in 1999. He claims the romp was over in 'five seconds' but produced a daughter, Anna, and cost him his marriage.

It had long been thought that the pair had sex in a broom cupboard.

But in 2009 Becker revealed in a TV interview: 'I don't know if a bathroom is a better place but it actually happened on the stairs between the bathrooms so there was no broom cupboard.'

Meanwhile, earlier this month a court ruled that the public does have a right to know about Boris Johnson’s philandering past.

The Appeal Court rejected claims by Helen Macintyre, with whom the married Mayor of London had an affair, that the birth of their daughter Stephanie must remain secret.

Speculation over the paternity of Stephanie, who has a wild mop of flaxen hair and instantly recognisable features, surfaced the summer after her birth in November 2009.
