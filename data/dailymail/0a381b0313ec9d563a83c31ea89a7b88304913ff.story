While Real Madrid fans were celebrating their side's Super Cup victory, some may have been concerned by the the sight of Cristiano Ronaldo.

The 29-year-old winger was photographed on the treatment table with a large ice-pack strapped to his troublesome knee.

Ronaldo has suffered from tendinosis around his left kneecap for some time - it plagued his World Cup and was a contributing factor towards some below-par performances in Brazil.

Tendinosis is caused by the long-term wear and tear of tendons which are put under consistent pressure without enough recovery time between periods of activity.

The doctor for the Portuguese Football Federation said during the World Cup: 'Pain and difficulty moving are common and rest is the main treatment.

'Recovery times for tendinosis depend on the scale of the damage, but in the most severe cases could be several months.'

There has been no suggestion that Ronaldo is facing a time on the sidelines but Madrid fans may be worried that, after only their first competitive game of the season, their talisman is having to take such measures.

The Ballon d'Or winner played in 47 matches for Los Blancos last season. After a shorter than usual summer there may be concerns about how the winger's knee will hold up under the rigours of another arduous campaign.

Some optimism can at least be drawn from Ronaldo's performances. Portugal's captain was in imperious form last night, scoring a brace as Sevilla were beaten 2-0 in Cardiff.

Ronaldo has now scored 18 goals in his last eight games against Unai Emery's men.
