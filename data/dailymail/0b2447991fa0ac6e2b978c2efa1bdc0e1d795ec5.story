On-again off-again actress Ricki Noel Lander is getting help from high places to help her land a role.

New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, 71, who once described Ms Lander as simply a ‘pal,’ was inexplicably helping her audition for the role of ‘Mary Elena.’

Dressed in a very skimpy bathing suit, Ms Lander is apparently playing a teacher who has turned to teaching poll dancing classes to make ends meet.

The agony and the ecstasy: Lander shows off her acting ability in the screen test with Kraft reading lines

Mr Kraft bizarrely enters the audition after Ms Lander introduces herself with a wink, and reads lines alongside her.

‘Hi, you were really good up there,’ he begins. ‘I didn’t mean that in a sexual way, not that it wasn’t erotic.’

Ms Lander puts a hand up to her face, and says, ‘I am so embarrassed.’ All the while, she wears a half-smile and keeps her other hand firmly planted on her hips.

‘No offence,’ she says, ‘but I get guys like you in my classes all the time.’

The scene goes on, with varying degrees of acting prowess, until a change in scene in which Mr Kraft, in character, asks for a lap dance. ‘Sorry, not now,’ she says. 

‘Sweetheart, I don’t know who this loser is,’ Mr Kraft says, gesturing to the other man, ‘but I’ve dropped a lot of cash here. I’m a Yahoo exec.’ 

When the other man pretends not to know the business, Mr Kraft yells, ‘F*** you, p****!’ before throwing a fake punch.

The 32-year-old’s acting credits, which begin in 2006, include small, often unaccredited and typecast roles on shows like The Class and Ugly Betty, where she plays ‘Stunning Woman’ and ‘Model,’ respectively.

In 2008’s Iron Man, she plays a sassy flight attendant who offers Robert Downey Jr's character a drink of hot sake, and more recently, she was seen as a Servant Faerie on the HBO series True Blood.

Rest in peace: His wife, Myra, right, seen in 2007, was a prominent philanthropist. She died of cancer last year, aged 68

Ms Lauder, who graduated with a degree in dance, has been seen with MR Kraft at several public events, including the Spike TV Guy’s Choice Awards, and has accompanied him to his house on Cape Cod, according to the Boston Herald’s Inside Track.

As of March of this year, Forbes listed Mr Kraft as number 263 on the Forbes 400, with a net worth of around $1.7billion.

His late wife, Myra Kraft, was a well-known and much-loved philanthropist who spent much of her time working on the boards of organisations like the United Way of Massachusetts Bay, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the American Repertory Theatre, and the Boys & Girls Club of Boston, among others. 

She died in 2011 from cancer at the age of 68.
