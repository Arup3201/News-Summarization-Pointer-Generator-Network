A mother-of-two who was in rehab at the same time as Robin Williams has said he was 'weary to his bones' while his face reflected 'deep depression and unhappiness'. 

Teresa Cohen, 32, was receiving treatment at the Hazelden Addiction Treatment Centre near Lindstrom, Minnesota, in June when she met the film star.

Her stay overlapped Williams's by nine days and she described how it appeared there was 'something deeper going on inside him'.

Robin Williams, 63, who took this photo with a member of staff at a Dairy Queen in Lindstrom, Minnesota, was receiving treatment at the nearby Hazelton rehabilitation centre when he met Teresa Cohen, 32 (not pictured)

She told The Sunday Express: 'Even though he would goof around from time to time, just like he did on screen, there were many other occasions where his face reflected deep depression and unhappiness.

'He said he was weary to his bones and didn't believe he could really relax for a moment. 

Miss Cohen, who has separated from her husband, said that at one point the comedian told her: 'When I go, I want it to be quick and I want to be clean and sober. I don't want to die the slow agonising death of an addict who makes everyone around him suffer.'

Miss Cohen described how the star burst into tears when he opened up about his fears of relapsing and returning to drink

She also described how he burst into tears, fearing that he would relapse and return to drink when he left the centre  

Williams checked into the centere in Minnesota in the weeks before his apparent suicide.

At the time, his representative said, 'After working back-to-back projects, Robin is simply taking the opportunity to fine-tune and focus on his continued commitment, of which he remains extremely proud.' 

While he was at Hazeldon Addiction Treatment Center, the actor and comedian paid a visit to a Dairy Queen in Lindstrom nearby on June 29. 

Looking very slim, Williams posed for a photograph with server Abby Albers in one of the last pictures of his life. 

Williams is said to have asked for booze during a scene shot inside an LA restaurant in May 2013 as he begrudgingly returned to the small screen in The Crazy Ones. 

Teresa Cohen, 32, the wife of the TV executive, met Williams at the Hazleden rehabilitation centre in Minnesota 

Her stay at the treatment facility overlapped Williams by nine days. In that time she said it was obvious that something deeper was going on inside him

On Thursday it was revealed that Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease at the time of his death.

In a statement, Susan Schneider said that Williams, 63, was struggling with depression, anxiety and the Parkinson's diagnosis when he died Monday in his Northern California home. Authorities said he committed suicide.

'Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly,' Schneider said. 

Williams had often spoken about his problems with drugs and alcohol, and in recent years he admitted he was again struggling. On a recent tour, he even joked about it.

'I went to rehab in wine country,' he said, 'to keep my options open.' 

It has been revealed that Williams demanded real alcohol while on the set of The Crazy Ones
