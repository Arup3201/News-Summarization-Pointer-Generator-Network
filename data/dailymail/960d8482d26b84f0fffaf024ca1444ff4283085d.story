The Cheney family's public infighting over the issue of same-sex marriage heated up Sunday as Mary Cheney and her wife Heather Poe took to Facebook to air their grievances with Mary's Senate candidate sister Liz Cheney.

Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney is trying to unseat an incumbent Republican Senator in Wyoming and drew ire from her family after after reaffirming her opposition to same-sex marriage on Fox New Sunday.

'I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law),' Poe wrote after the interview. 'And was very disappointed to hear her say 'I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage.'

Liz Cheney's comment came after she addressed accusations that she is a 'flip-flopper' on the issue since she supports giving the choice to the states rather than an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

That bit of hedging was not enough for Poe.

'I can't help but wonder how Liz would feel if as she moved from state to state, she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other,' Poe wrote.

Poe said that her sister-in-law 'didn't hesitate' to congratulate she and Mary on their marriage and called Liz's comments 'offensive to say the least.'

'I always thought freedom meant freedom for EVERYONE,' Poe wrote.

It wasn't long before Mary Cheney picked up the story and gave her thoughts on Facebook.

'Couldn't have said it better myself,' Mary Cheney wrote after sharing her wife's post. 'Liz - this isn't just an issue on which we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history.'

This isn't the first time Cheney has made her feelings about her sister known publicly.

In September, Cheney called her candidate sister's stance on gay married 'dead wrong' in a Facebook post.

'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.'

Liz Cheney addressed the longstanding argument with her sister on Fox News, calling it an issue 'on which we disagree'.

Cheney's strong stance on the issue of
 gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in 
ultra-conservative Wyoming.

‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign.

Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi earlier this year.

‘I
 believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the 
statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and
 not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’

Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?'

This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family.

Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance.

‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004.

‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’
