Police had to rescue an Indian butler after he was allegedly kidnapped by wealthy politician Gajraj Singh Jadeja's family when they realised he had left the domestic help his entire £59 million fortune.

The butler, Vinu Bhai, who worked for Jadeja for 40 years, said he had no idea he was suddenly to become so rich.

He said: ‘When I heard he was ill and then that he had died I expected to be without a job and I was wondering how I might manage to pay to keep my family and children with a roof over their heads.

In the money: Vinu Bha and his wife, with a picture of their benefactor, politician Gajraj Singh Jadeja, whose generosity has transformed their lives

But according to the will he told me that he saw me as a son and my children as his. I always knew we were close but I am enormously honoured that he chose to do this for me.’

Jadeja was the Congress leader in India's western Gujarat state before he died last year on September 21. But when his will was read three months later his many relatives were in for a shock when it was revealed they were to get nothing.

Jadeja had no children and had decided instead to reward his loyal servant by giving him his property, including land and buildings, cash and shares.

The relatives allegedly kidnapped the butler to force him to admit the will was a fake, said police, but the man had been freed after he was spotted being bundled by force into a car by hired thugs.

Bhai's son Amit Jaipal said: ‘There were eight men, they forced their way into our home and took my father away. It took police a day to find him and free him but he didn't suffer from the ordeal thank goodness.’

A police spokesman said that the eight had been arrested and were facing charges of kidnapping, but declined to name them all or confirm their relationship with the dead man.
