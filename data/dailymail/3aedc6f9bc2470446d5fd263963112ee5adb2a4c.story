Thinking of a spot of spring cleaning this weekend? Always dreamed of  a cleaning method that will kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical?

And one which will require minimal elbow grease, and be suitable for ­everything from floors and carpets to windows, sofas, taps, tiles — even defrosting your freezer?

If so, steam cleaning is for you. All of a sudden it’s got the country hot and bothered, with John Lewis reporting sales of steam cleaning devices rocketing by 94 per cent over the last year.

Whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces, high-pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies, blasting away stubborn particles and killing everything from bacteria to mould, with nothing more than tap water. It doesn’t leave chemicals behind, binds with dust to stop it escaping into the air and, most importantly, decimates dust mites. Most even claim to clean Chesterfield sofas.

It all sounds too good to be true, so is there a catch? Critics complain it can take up to six minutes for the water to become steam and many steamers have a high ‘faff factor’, with complicated buttons, scant instructions and lots of bewildering attachments.

Then there’s the fact that you still need to wipe up afterwards to remove dislodged dirt and excess water.

So, is this the new golden age of steam, or just a load of hot air? JENNY WOOD put eight of the best-selling models to the test . . .

Jenny Wood tries out the latest models of steam cleaners to hit the market

FUN, FAST AND FURIOUSHoover SteamJet Handheld Steam Cleaner, £59.99, hoover.co.uk

This ‘seriously powerful’ handheld steamer weighs just over 1lb. It claims to have one of the fastest heat-up times going and a tool for every conceivable job.Jenny says: Wielding this in my bathroom like some kind of sci-fi stun gun was fun. The sensible curved design protected my hand from the steam, which is controlled by a slider switch on the handle. It’s fairly idiot-proof — for most tasks just waft the steamer over the area you want to clean. It’s quick to fill, and took just under 20 seconds to start steaming. The long cord also made moving around the room easy. Perfect for nooks and crannies, it made my loo shine, had a good bash at the limescale around the taps (no steamer removed it completely) and the brush attachment made my grouting look like new. The downsides? It fared less well with a greasy oven top and, on the maximum setting, it produces a LOT of excess water.  VERDICT: Great for tricky little jobs, particularly in the bathroom.4/5

BEST ALL-ROUNDERThane H20 X5 Steam Cleaner, £79.99, Thane.tvNamed Product of the Year, this ‘stylish’ steam mop converts to a handheld model in seconds and comes in red, green or white.Jenny says: Don’t be alarmed by the number of pieces when you open the box — the clear instructions include advice on which attachment to use for different tasks, from cleaning grouting to steaming clothes. It’s lightweight and simple to use, heating up in 15 seconds. The tank is easy to fill, and there’s just one on/off switch and a dial to control the amount of steam produced. It removed plenty of dirt from my kitchen floor, and the handle and mop head detached with one click to turn it into a handheld steamer. It got rid of scum from grouting with minimum effort, and left my windows streak-free thanks to a handy cloth that attaches to the squeegee. My favourite of those I tried.VERDICT: Easy to use, quick to heat up and tackles a range of jobs. 5/5

Whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces, high-pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies

QUICK AND COMPACTPolti Vaporettino Lux Steam Gun, £34.95, John LewisReady in minutes, this compact handheld is designed for surfaces that need regular refreshing and claims to reach the trickiest spots.Jenny says: Unlike some steamers, you don’t have to worry about where to put this down if the phone rings. A sensible kettle-like shape, it sits happily on your work surface. Just as well, really, as it took nearly three minutes to get up to steam. Once full of water, it’s fairly heavy and the cord is shorter than most. The lid to the tank was robust but difficult to unscrew; I had to wait over an hour — I assume until it had cooled — to be able to open it and empty the water afterwards. The steamer comes with lots of tools, but minimal instructions; still, it’s useful for little jobs such as sterilising children’s toys, and the spatula attachment was the best I tested at removing grease from my hob. VERDICT: Simple design but heavy and not particularly versatile. 2/5

FOR NON-STOP STEAMKarcher SC 5.800C, £349.99, karcher.co.ukThe Rolls-Royce of steamers, this vacuum-style model has two tanks for non-stop floor cleaning, while the hose turns into a handheld gun.Jenny says: Looking like a squat yellow ladybird, this fancy steamer needs a decent amount of cupboard space. The manual looks like War And Peace, but that’s mainly because it has a section for almost every language on Earth. More diagrams and tips would have helped, although one gem about pouring vinegar on limescale before steaming was ingenious. The large, easy-to-fill tank took about three minutes to heat up, and while it wasn’t very quiet, it was incredibly powerful — even with the dial only turned up halfway. The mop attachment made light work of my kitchen floor. Once finished, I simply unclipped it and used the hose and gun to blitz areas like my sink and the inside of a pedal bin (where chemical cleaners had failed). I’d have liked some smaller brushes for things such as grouting, but otherwise it’s impressive. VERDICT: Large but powerful, for those serious about steaming. 3/5

The models are said to kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical

FOR RETRO GOOD LOOKSHoover SteamJet Cylinder Steam Cleaner SCB1500, £79.99, ArgosThis retro-style cylinder steamer promises to be powerful yet compact, with accessories for more than 25 cleaning tasks stored on board.Jenny says: This clever gadget has all the tools you need — from brushes to a wire scrubber for barbecue grills — inside the base, meaning there’s no need to root around in the cupboard. A funky red design, it’s made to sit on the floor, but it’s not too heavy and has just an A4-sized footprint. There’s a long hose and while the steam gun looks basic, it delivers a powerful blast and has a handy lock to keep steam in when not in use. It cleaned floors thoroughly, and was good at smaller jobs, too, such as polishing work surfaces and refreshing sofas. It heated up in around three minutes (quicker than the five stated on the box), and my only gripes are the difficult-to-read steam control knob and the slightly faffy lid to the water tank. VERDICT: Good-looking, versatile, and great value for the price. 3/5

DEEP CLEAN STEAMMorphy Richards Power Steam Pro Pulsonic Steam Mop, £74.99, ebuyer.comDesigned to refresh carpets and leave hard floors sparkling, the pulsating floor head claims to agitate ground-in dirt for a deeper clean.Jenny says: Of all the steamers I tried, this was the quickest to assemble and fill, thanks to the removable tank. It stands up on its own when not in use, has an anti-limescale cartridge for hard water, and a fold-down handle for easy storage. The cord isn’t as long as some models, but the buttons were easy to understand, and it heated up in 30 seconds. It’s not light and took a bit of effort to mop my kitchen — I was so vigorous the cloth came off the head — but the amount of dirt it picked up was really noticeable. Having said that, I’m not sure the vibrate function made much difference — it seemed to lift one stubborn stain just as well without it. VERDICT: Put the effort in and you’ll be left with pristine floors. 3/5

Jenny found steam cleaners can even be used on furniture such as sofas

DRIES FLOORS AS IT GOESShark Lift-Away Steam Pocket 5-in-1, £149.99, jmldirect.comA mop-style model with ‘pocket technology’ to leave floors dry and streak-free. It also has a detachable handheld gun for smaller jobs.Jenny says: This steamer is so efficient at drying floors after cleaning, you wonder if it’s worked at all! Thankfully, the grubby mop cloth showed it must have done the job. A lot of thought has been put into the whole thing — from the decent-sized mop head, long cord and comprehensive instructions to the handy bag for attachments and the loops on the cloths to stop you from scalding yourself when you remove them. It took about 30 seconds to reach steam, and the middle section lifts out to become a handheld steamer. The attachments are a little on the large side — the brush was too big to get behind my bath taps — and it’s not that easy to tell if the machine’s on or off, but overall, it tackles a wide range of tasks well. VERDICT: A good all-rounder for most jobs in the home. 4/5

SMALL AND SIMPLELight’n’Easy Steam Mop, £39.99, LakelandCreated to clean large, flat areas such as windows and tiles, or for sanitising bedding, this handheld flat steamer is one of the smallest and cheapest on the market.Jenny says: On the plus side, getting started is a doddle. Simply stick a washable cleaning pad to the base, fill the tank and plug it in. However, rather than taking 30-60 seconds to heat up, as claimed on the box, I was still waiting three minutes later. Once it was working, though, it was simple enough to use, and perfect for running over mattresses and pillows like an iron to sanitise them (steam wipes out dust mites, which can exacerbate allergies). It fared reasonably on tiles too, but with a short flex, a gentle steam output and no attachments, it’s really only useful for flat surfaces.  VERDICT: Only good for mattresses and flat surfaces. 2/5
