Fleece: Eric Champ has accused the council of charging tenants more to sign a new lease

A defiant council tenant is living a desperate home-alone existence in a high-rise block after every other occupant moved out.

Eric Champ is involved in a tenant’s last stand battle with Renfrewshire Council who want to demolish the multi-storey Arkleston Court in Gallowhill, Paisley.

The local authority yesterday began a court move to have the property re-possessed in order to bring the bulldozers in.

The 53-year-old security officer is challenging their right to do that, claiming the local authority will be in breach of his tenancy agreement if the ruling goes against him.

A Sheriff has now been asked to give a judgement and after hearing evidence from both sides, a decision is to be given within 28 days.

Mr Champ is the only tenant remaining in the block at the centre of the dispute.

Paisley Sheriff Court was told that there are increasing concerns for his wellbeing and safety after the property was targeted by vandals and metal piping damaged, leading to both mains water gas supplies being disconnected.

Mrs Lesley Muirhead, the local authority’s housing strategy development manager, said that they were becoming increasingly concerned about Mr Champ’s living conditions.

She outlined various offers of alternative accommodation which had been made to him, each of which had been declined on various grounds.

She said that despite different financial incentives, the defiant tenant had turned down all that had been offered to him.

There were originally a total of 90 flats in the block with six families on each of the fifteen floors.

Mr Champ has been the sole occupant for several months as the deadlock deepened.

'It is very unsatisfactory,' she told the court, 'as there have been a number of break-ins and in January, the water pipes were vandalised which meant there was no supply to the block.

'We have had to put additional security measures in place.

'We were extremely concerned about the consequences if the gas pipes were tampered with as that could lead to a dangerous situation, so he has no gas to his house.'

Mr Champ says he came close to accepting the offer of an alternative home in Renfrew but was not prepared to sign a document terminating his existing lease as he felt that would compromise his rights.

Referring to documents which were sent to him by the local authority in which he was described as a 'housing applicant', he hit out: 'I am not a housing applicant, I am a tenant with rights.'

He maintains the council has a binding contract with him and that offers of alternative accommodation made have come as conditional and not unconditional, undermining his rights.

He questions the transfer of lease issues that have come to the fore and has argued that he should be able to retain his existing lease with the landlord with only an alteration inserted to provide details of any new property he might agree to accept.

He told Sheriff David Pender: 'They are negligent and as a result, I have suffered loss, compounded by their intransigence.

'They are unfit to do the job they are doing and that has adversely affected my life and done harm to me.

'People have been encouraged to terminate their old lease and sign a new one, leading to them paying higher rent and I consider that to be theft.

'That is a breach of trust.

'These people are supposed to be serving the public, not fleecing them.

'They are completely avoiding the liabilities of the contract by hiding behind their statutory obligations.'

The local authority has asked the Sheriff to grant a decree in their favour to allow them to recover the property.

They have stressed that even if that was granted by the Sheriff, Mr Champ would still be entitled to retain his full secure tenancy agreement, would be provided with suitable alternative accommodation and given financial assistance and support towards re-locating.
