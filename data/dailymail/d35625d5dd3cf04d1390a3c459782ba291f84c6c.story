After 63 matches, hours of top-class entertainment and views of Adrian Chiles sunning himself on the Copacabana, it's time for the final showdown.

The BBC usually outgun ITV by about the same viewer ratio as Germany buried Brazil. Historically, the nation sides overwhelmingly with BBC for big events.

Expect ITV's fanbase to be those who particularly enjoy adverts for online bookmakers - and Chiles's nearest and dearest.

Life's a beach: Adrian Chiles leads the ITV coverage of the World Cup in Brazil

Up front

BBC - Gary Lineker was once described by comedian Arthur Smith as 'the Queen Mother of football'. He commands this realm, demanding respect and affection, despite his penchant for bad puns. He has seen off any number of ITV rivals.   

ITV - Adrian Chiles has proved himself adept at filling airtime when the unexpected happens - such as the lightning in Miami during England's warm-up. But his matey style can grate.

Line up: The ITV team featured the likes of Gordon Strachan, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon but Roy Keane failed to go after taking a coaching job at Aston Villla

Playmakers  

BBC - This is Alan Hansen's swansong after more than 20 years. Rio Ferdinand comes out of this World Cup with his reputation greatly enhanced, relaxed yet commanding. Alan Shearer brings a familiarity, even if he's getting balder by the game.   

ITV - Fabio Cannavaro has been a revelation, the first pundit to highlight the crucial role of Javier Mascherano for Argentina. Some combative exchanges, too, with Martin O'Neill, who always entertains. Ian Wright's excitement level is sure to hit fever pitch and there's that lovable way he refers to Glenn Hoddle as 'gaffer'.

Red Cards

BBC - They have taken a team of 272 to Brazil compared with ITV's 120. They could cut pitchside reports, which add little value for the audience. 

ITV - Adverts are an obvious turn-off. Rather see full build-up than hear Ray Winstone harking on about first goalscorer bets.
