The vice-chairman of the FA David Gill has called on Sepp Blatter not to stand for re-election as president of FIFA.

Saying the FIFA president's decision to run for a fifth term in 2015 was 'disappointing' today, Mr Gill added: 'The very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years, that should have been the situation.

'To change his mind is disappointing.

He added: 'I think we need to move on. I think we need a full, frank and open debate about what Fifa needs going forward.'

Mr Gill
 also challenged Mr Blatter on his astonishing attack on the British media.
 'The statement from Mr Blatter yesterday was totally unacceptable and 
factually incorrect.

'To try to portray it as a racist or discriminatory 
attack is sheer ... totally unacceptable.'

Mr Gill
 agreed Mr Blatter's comments had left 'a stain' on FIFA.

The move came just hours after former UEFA president Lennart Johansson also called for Blatter not to stand again.

Following UEFA's Congress meeting in Sao Paulo, Johannson said: 'I think it is time he went.'

After Blatter spoke to UEFA's 
Congress to announce his intention to stand for a fifth term as 
president, both FA chairman Greg Dyke and Dutch football federation 
president Michael van Praag spoke out against the Swiss.

They said they had no confidence in Mr Blatter to oversee the change that FIFA needs in the light of these corruption scandals.

This followed Van Praag's earlier comments, in an interview with a Dutch newspaper, that Blatter had to shoulder much of the blame for the tarnished image of the world governing body in the light of corruption allegations around the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid.

'Mr Blatter, this is nothing personal but if you look at FIFA's reputation over the last seven or eight years, it is being linked to all kinds of corruption and all kinds of old boys' networks things," Van Praag said he had told Mr Blatter in the meeting from which reporters were barred.

'FIFA has an executive president and you are not making things easy for yourself and I do not think you are the man for the job any longer.

'I told him "I like you very much ... this is nothing personal. But you are now saying that Qatar was the wrong choice (for the 2022 World Cup), but you are not blaming yourself you are blaming your executive committee.

'Yesterday you said something about racism against Qatar and people are not taking you seriously any more. This is not good for FIFA and it is not good for the game.

'Yes you are leading the reforms at the moment, but all these problems occurred in the period before the reforms and you were still president and you responsible and I believe you should not run any more."'

Kicking up a storm: Dyke, pictured during a England promotional event last week, has spoken out against Blatter

FIFA
 has been rocked by allegations that Qatar bribed officials to secure 
votes for the 2022 World Cup and Blatter did nothing to ease the 
situation by accusing the British media responsible for the expose of 
‘racism and discrimination’ yesterday.

Even though FIFA’s main sponsors 
have now called for an investigation into the claims.

Blatter attended UEFA’s Congress on Tuesday morning ahead of FIFA Congress – he required the protection of Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion riot police officers to gain access to The Renaissance hotel where UEFA are staying – and Van Praag said he expected  members of Europe’s governing body to be united in opposing Blatter at next year’s presidential election.

‘The election for the FIFA presidency is only next year but it will be good if Europe is well prepared and ready to make its choice,’ he said.

‘If you are in a post for 16 years there comes a time when you have to ask whether you are still contributing.’

Not holding back: Jack Warner criticised Sepp Blatter during interview with ITV

The day began on Monday with a former Blatter ally – the now disgraced Jack Warner – claiming FIFA would not change until 78-year-old Blatter had gone.

After three decades on ExCo a corruption scandal forced Warner to quit in 2011, having been linked to payments made by the man at the centre of the current Qatar scandal, Mohamed Bin Hammam.

And while Blatter is expected to tell Congress this week that he intends to stand for a fifth term, Warner said: ‘If Blatter had one modicum of decency he wouldn’t even be at FIFA still.

‘I have been with FIFA for 30 years....I am still the longest serving elected officer of FIFA, and under Mr Blatter? I am saying to you under Mr Blatter, FIFA will never change.’
