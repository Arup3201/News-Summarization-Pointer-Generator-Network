After their ear and dental checks and fitness tests, it appeared the Brazil staff had done everything to ensure their squad is prepared for the World Cup.

But it would seem not. Luiz Felipe Scolari is continuing to put his players through their places, this time checking the body fat of each member of his 23-man squad and strapping them up with heart monitors.

Scolari has a huge amount of pressure on his shoulders to deliver a sixth Jules Rimet trophy on home soil this summer and is leaving nothing to chance in his quest to win it all on Sunday July 13.

Earlier this week it was revealed that Scolari has had dossiers compiled on 16 possible opponents.

The three other teams in Group A, Croatia, Mexico and Cameroon, have been scouted and analysed for strengths and weaknesses. All four Group B teams Australia, Chile, the Netherlands and Spain, one of whom could meet Brazil in the second round, have also been scouted by the team's two main scouts Alexandre Gallo and Roque Junior.

Potential quarter-final and semi-final opponents have also been looked at.

'Sixteen teams have been totally watched 
and scouted,' Scolari's assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira told reporters
 on Monday as Brazil's players gathered for their first day of training.

The
 stars had a medical check-up at the squad's Granja Comary complex in 
Teresopolis, 90 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro, dubbed the Brazil Lab.
