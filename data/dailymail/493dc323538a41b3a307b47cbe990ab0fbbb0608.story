Former NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell has announced he won't contest next year's state election.

He made the announcement in a statement posted to his Twitter page on Monday night, after informing the Liberal Party Ku-ring-gai branch members and his successor, Premier Mike Baird.

'I will not seek re-election at next year's March State election,' Mr O'Farrell's statement read.

'For almost 20 years, I've been honoured to serve my community and I thank local residents and branch members for their strong support over five campaigns.'

Mr O'Farrell went on to credit the work of his party's MPs and praised reforms including the introduction of the Opal Card and ServiceNSW.

The former Premier abruptly left his position in April this year after it was revealed he had personally received a rare $3,000 bottle of wine from Liberal party donor Nick Di Girolamo.

He was found to have misled the Independent Commission Against Corruption about the gift, which he claimed he could not remember receiving despite a 'thank you' note being found.

Earlier this month, Mr O'Farrell denied rumours that he was looking to take on a role in Federal politics.

He slammed the reports through a number of Tweets that read: 'more media BS. I've not had any discussions about a switch to Federal politics.'

'Everyone knows I'd view a shift to any upper house as 'cruel & unusual' punishment! #justsaying.' 

Mr O'Farrell, who headed the NSW Liberal party when it came to power in 2011, was responsible for a number of controversial new policies including the infamous lock-out laws and the firing of 15,000 public sector workers. However, he also led more popular decisions including signing up for the Gonski education reforms and expressing his support of same-sex marriage.

According to the previously publicised calculation of Greens MP John Kaye, Mr O'Farrell is entitled to a pension of $160,000 a year or a lump sum payment of $1.6 million.
