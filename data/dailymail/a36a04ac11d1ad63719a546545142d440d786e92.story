David Cameron and Theresa May are locked in a battle to curb police stop and search powers.

The Prime Minister and Home Secretary are split over plans to limit the use of the powers and impose heavier punishments on officers who break the law.

Mrs May has warned the excessive use of stop and search is a ‘dreadful waste of police time’ and fears young black men being disproportionately targeted risks undermining public confidence in the police.

Clash: David Cameron fears Theresa May's plans to rein in the use of stop and search powers will make the Tories appear soft on crime

In a damning report last year, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘unlawful’ and risk promoting ‘major disorder’.

In 27 per cent of cases, police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search.

It is the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules.

Official statistics show that, if someone is from a black or minority ethnic background, they are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if they are white.

Mrs May has warned: ‘If anybody thinks it is sustainable to allow that to continue, with all its consequences for public confidence in the police, they need to think again.’

Risks: Excessive use of the powers wastes 312,000 hours per year, Mrs May believes

She also believes a total of 312,000 hours per year—the equivalent of 145 full-time police officers – are taken up filling in forms recording searches.

‘At its best, stop and search is a vital power in the fight against crime; at its worst, it is a waste of police timeand serves to undermine public confidence in the police. It is time to get stop and search right,’ Mrs May said in July.

The government was due to respond to a consultation on reining in the powers by the end of the year.

But the Home Office is at loggerheads with Downing Street, which fears the Tories appearing soft on crime.

In a bid to play down talk of a Cabinet split, Mr Cameron insisted at Prime Minister's Questions that reforms to stop and search are needed.

But he stressed Government would only legislate if it was 'necessary'.

He told MPs: 'Stop and search does need reform because what the HMIC report shows is that in 27 per cent of cases the police have not been following their own guidance in terms of stop and search. So, we do need to reform stop and search. If it is necessary to legislate, legislate, if it is not, we won't.

'But what's really important is that stop and search is used properly but we don't add to the burdens of the police.'

Number 10 played down the suggestion it was blocking Mrs May’s flagship reforms, but insisted no final decision had been made.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ‘Nobody should ever be stopped just on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity.

‘The government supports the ability of police officers to stop and search suspects, but it must be applied fairly and in a way which builds community confidence.

‘This is why we consulted over the summer on the powers of stop and search – and we received a strong response. We will respond to the consultation in due course.’
