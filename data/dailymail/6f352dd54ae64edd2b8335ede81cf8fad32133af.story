The body of a man has been found in his car next to a busy road in New Zealand after lying undiscovered for five days.

Alvin Singh, 34, was found next to an intersection in Papatoetoe, Auckland, after a resident raised the alarm.

He was last seen leaving his home in Mangere on February 22 - but his body was not found until last Wednesday.

A 2006 transport survey showed an average of nearly 20,000 cars a day used the section of Puhinui Rd where Mr Singh died, the New Zealand Herald reports.

Detective Inspector Mark Gutry said a neighbour living nearby had reported the body to police after the car remained on the busy road for five days.

Det Insp Gutry said it was unusual for a body to lay undiscovered for such a long period of time, but that it was not easy to spot Mr Singh in the car because his body was in a lying position, reports Stuff.co.nz.

He said Mr Singh had been in the front of the car, which was reclined, and was 'rolled over' on the seat.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and there was nothing in the car to indicate how he died, Det Insp Gutry said. An autopsy was inconclusive.

It is understood Mr Singh likely died because of a medical condition - with police waiting for further test results to reveal a possible cause.

CCTV footage of the site where Mr Singh, a Fijian, was found, showed him walking around his car and then getting in again.

Mr Singh had been convicted of forgery and providing false information in relation to immigration fraud in December 2011 and sentenced to five months home detention.

His partner, Ravina Singh, was sentenced to 11 months home detention after admitting to 30 charges relating to an immigration scam. She was later jailed in November last year after admitting a charge of perverting the course of justice, according to the Herald.
