Alexandru Epureanu's header earned Moldova a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia in Moscow, paving the way for Austria to take the top spot in their European Championship qualifying group.

Russia struggled to break down a dogged Moldovan defence until the 73rd minute, when Artyom Dzyuba earned and converted a penalty following a foul by Victor Golovatenco. Moldova responded within seconds of the restart as Epureanu headed home from Alexander Dedov's corner.

Midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk scored on his full international debut to help Ukraine edge Macedonia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 Group C qualifier.

Sydorchuk, on target as a substitute in the 2-0 win away to neighbours Belarus on Thursday, finished off a swift counter-attack in added time at the end of the first half.

The speedy Evgeny Konoplyanka created the goal with a cross to the far post with Sydorchuk arriving to fire in from close range.

In Vienna, the Pakistan-born, half-Nigerian Rubin Okotie's 24th-minute goal won the game for Austria against a flat Montenegro side.

Montenegro went into the qualifying group with hopes of reaching Euro 2016, but had already been struggling after an opening win over Moldova was followed with a goalless draw against Liechtenstein last week.

Diego Costa fluffed his lines in the first half, but the Chelsea forward did eventually get on the scoresheet 

Diego Costa ended his long international scoring drought with the third goal in an uninspiring 4-0 win for Spain away to minnows Luxembourg in Euro 2016 qualifying Group C on Sunday.

Brazil-born Costa had failed to find the net for his adopted country in six previous appearances but broke a duck lasting more than 500 minutes when he netted from close range in the 69th minute in a rain-lashed Luxembourg City.

David Silva opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a fine long-range strike and set up Paco Alcacer to make it 2-0 three minutes before half time. Substitute Juan Bernat added the fourth two minute from the end.

Without captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a second straight game, Sweden struggled to convert their chances but still beat Liechtenstein 2-0 in their Group G Euro 2016 qualifier at the Friends Arena on Sunday.

Slovenia's players celebrate after scoring; Lithuania,though, remain second in the group

Erkan Zengin broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with his second goal in three qualifying games, his thumping shot taking a deflection off a defender and looping over the goalkeeper into the net.

Jimmy Durmaz doubled Sweden's advantage in the first minute of the second half, stabbing the ball home from close range after Bicer horribly sliced a left-footed clearance into his path.

Slovakia followed up their impressive victory over Spain with a 3-1 win over Belarus.

Napoli midfielder Marik Hamsik scored a brace for the visitors, while Stanislav Sestak added a third. Timofei Kalachev scored the hosts' only goal.

Milivoje Novakovic scored the winning goal on Thursday for Slovenia, and the veteran forward continued his impressive form by grabbing a brace to help the visitors beat Lithuania 2-0.

The win draws Slovenia level on points with Lithuania as they climb up to second in Group E.
