'Peaceful death': Lord McAlpine's family announced that he had died at home

Lord McAlpine, the former Tory deputy chairman who won libel damages from Sally Bercow over false allegations of child sex abuse, died yesterday – three months after settling with the Speaker’s wife.

The peer, who passed away aged 71 at his home in Italy, was instrumental in Baroness Thatcher’s Election successes, raising millions for the party as its treasurer.

But his final years were overshadowed by a BBC Newsnight report in 2012 that wrongly implicated him in allegations of sex abuse at  the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the 1970s and 1980s.

Although the programme did not name the politician, during widespread speculation about his identity Mrs Bercow wrote on Twitter: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’

The peer accepted £185,000 from the BBC and a six-figure sum from ITV for following up the story.

However, Mrs Bercow held out until last October, when she finally apologised for causing him ‘great distress and embarrassment’ and agreed to pay £15,000 damages.    

She also shut down her Twitter account, which had previously hosted dozens of messages a day – many of them politically partisan and embarrassing to her husband.

After the case, Lord McAlpine’s lawyer said the peer had tried to  settle the case earlier ‘to avoid the detrimental effect of litigation on his health’, but Mrs Bercow had refused. He complained that ‘political positioning’ had prevailed over ‘common sense’.   

The furore also forced the BBC’s 
director general at the time, George Entwistle, to quit less than two 
months after taking up the role, saying that as editor-in chief he had  
to take ‘ultimate responsibility’ for the bungled investigation.

Remembrance: David Cameron tweeted in response to the news

Lord
 McAlpine struggled with dyslexia at Stowe public school, leaving at 16 
to join the building company founded by his great grandfather, Sir 
Robert McAlpine. He showed such a flair for business that within five 
years he was appointed a director of the firm.

Mrs
 Thatcher named him as joint treasurer of the Conservative Party in 
1975, adding the deputy chairmanship in the wake of her 1979 General 
Election victory.

He was 
famed for throwing  ‘champagne and lobster’ parties, hosted in his 
trademark corduroy suits, and was credited with bringing in tens of 
millions in donations by the time he became Lord McAlpine of West Green 
in 1984.

A staunch 
Eurosceptic, he grew disenchanted with John Major –  at one stage 
accusing the former Prime Minister of ‘stuffing up a great party’ and 
being ‘distasteful’.

He 
defected to James Goldsmith’s Referendum Party in 1996, becoming its 
leader in 1997 before later rejoining the Conservatives.

The
 property developer, who was also an author, zookeeper and explorer, 
stood down from the House of Lords in 2010 for tax reasons and retreated
 to the converted  convent he ran as a bed and breakfast with his third 
wife, Athena, in Puglia.

He
 was previously married to Sarah Baron, with whom he had two daughters, 
and Romilly Hobbs, his former secretary with whom he had another 
daughter.

At one stage he 
said of his marriages: ‘I keep changing my life, houses and 
relationships. I reinvent myself every few years. My first marriage 
lasted 15 years and this one [to Ms Hobbs] 20.

‘It’s
 hardly into bed and out the other side. There was a great deal  of 
love. But there comes a point when life is just a habit, and I’m rather 
against habits.’

David 
Cameron paid tribute to him on Twitter yesterday, saying: ‘My thoughts 
are with Lord McAlpine’s family – he was a dedicated supporter of 
Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party.’

Former
 party chairman Lord Parkinson, who worked closely with Lord McAlpine, 
described him as an ‘outstanding’ treasurer. ‘He was a most unusual, 
intriguing, interesting character with a fantastic range of interests,’ 
he said.

Another ex-chairman, Lord Tebbit, said: ‘He was a joy to be with because he always had something interesting to say.’

Yesterday,
 one Twitter user posted on the social networking site: ‘Where’s 
#SallyBercow? The dreadful woman is strangely silent. RIP, Lord 
McAlpine.’

In his political days Lord McAlpine was famous for throwing lavish parties on behalf of the Conservative party, and bringing in as much as £100million in donations.

Inner circle Tories would be presented with champagne and lobster at grand events during party conferences during Margaret Thatcher’s time as leader.

He was remembered for appearing in shabby corduroy suits and a salmon-and-cucumber-coloured Garrick Club tie, welcoming his guests.

But the loyal former Thatcher aide changed his tune after she was ousted by her party, to be replaced with John Major. He accused the new Prime Minister of ‘stuffing up a great party’, of running away from every issue and living in a fantasy world. He also called him ‘distasteful’.

But Mr Major shrugged off the barbs, once pointedly telling the Commons: ‘I understand that Lord McAlpine is promoting a book which is a work of fiction.’

Lord McAlpine stunned Westminster in 1996 by defecting to the Referendum Party, although he later returned to the Tories. In 2010 he stood down from the House of Lords to preserve his non-dom tax status.

Robert Alistair McAlpine, who had three daughters, spent his final years living in Italy with third wife Athena, whether they ran a bed and breakfast in a converted convent near Puglia.

He was a member of the family controlling the giant McAlpine building company. He left Stowe public school at 16 with three O levels and worked for the family firm on building sites, spending his evenings drinking Guinness with Irish labourers.

He joined the board of McAlpine before leaving to earn money for himself from property deals in Australia and selling antiques. He was also, in his time, a zoo-keeper, ornithologist, explorer and jewellery maker.
