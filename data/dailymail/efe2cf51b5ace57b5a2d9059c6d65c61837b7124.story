Detectives investigating the horrific shooting which massacred a British family in the French countryside now believe more than one professional assassin was involved - after it emerged three of the four victims were shot twice.

The three Britons killed on the outskirts of the village of 
Chevaline, near Annecy, were hit by two bullets each – while the French cyclist who stumbled across the scene of the 
carnage was hit five times.

The fact that intense gunfire was heard for less than 30 seconds – and 
it was so brutally effective – strengthens the theory of experienced 
hit-men being responsible.

Killing: The three Britons killed on the outskirts of the village of Chevaline, near Annecy, were hit by two bullets each - while the French cyclist who stumbled across the scene of the carnage was hit five times

It also emerged today that police officers are hunting for a Peugeot 4x4, green or white, which was being driven by a man in a black shirt. It was spotted near the scene by a young woman and also an RAF veteran who stumbled across the bloodbath near the beauty spot.

The
 unidentified Briton has now been hailed as a hero for saving the life 
of seven-year-old Zainab  Al-Hilli in the moments after the forest 
murders. Her father Saad Al-Hilli, 50, mother Ikbal and her grandmother 
were all killed.

Her little sister Zeena, four, was 
unharmed and a French cyclist, father-of-three Sylvain Mollier, who is 
believed to have witnessed the bloodbath, was also shot dead.

Mr Al-Hilli, 50, was initially shot once in 
the forehead as he sat at the wheel of the BMW estate car he had used to
 drive his family to a caravan holiday to Lake Annecy, in eastern 
France.

Then a second ‘coup de grace’ bullet was apparently used to make sure that Mr Al-Hilli, of Clayton, Surrey, was indeed dead.

This is the classic modus operandi of gunmen the world over who are 
contracted to kill people, whether working for criminal gangs, terrorist
 groups, or security services.

Dead: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was ambushed with his family on Wednesday during a family outing in the French Alps

Mr Al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal, and her elderly mother were shot twice through the car’s windows, with not a single bullet wasted.

Mr Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three who arrived at the scene 
by bike, is likely to have disturbed the multiple killings, and thus 
would have made a more difficult target.

An investigating source confirmed to French media that all those in the 
car ‘received two bullets each’, while Mr Mollier ‘was hit five times’.

Witnesses have described hearing around 30 seconds of gunfire at the 
isolated beauty spot next to woods on the outskirts of Chevaline.

This suggests that more than one gunman is likely to have been involved,
 given the ruthlessness of the killings, and the treatment of other 
witnesses.

The Al-Hilli’s seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered a fractured skull and a bullet in the shoulder.

Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was the only member of the family to 
escape unscathed after hiding underneath her mother’s legs.

It was to be a full eight hours before police eventually found her 
following the murders, which took place just before 4pm on Wednesday, 
suggesting that the gunmen also had no idea that she was there.

Zainab and Zeena’s testaments are likely to be crucial as French 
examining magistrates and police try to establish exactly what happened.
 They will be assisted by the results of autopsies which will be carried
 out on all four bodies later today.

A source close to the enquiry said: ‘The elements emerging certainly 
point towards a professional assassination, with more than one gunman 
likely to have been involved.

‘Both girls are under armed police guard, but Zeena is starting to speak quiet fluently about her ordeal.’

Zainab is in an induced coma because of her skull injuries, but is otherwise ‘stable’ in intensive care.

Julian Stedman, Mr Al-Hilli's accountant, said: 'They were shot through 
the head so that sounds like a professional killing, which is really 
very worrying. A casual killer would not do that. The reason for that – I
 haven't a clue.'

Intelligence officers from the British Embassy in Paris are said to have
 been at the scene of the murder hours after it happened.

They were tipped off by contacts in the French Interior Ministry as soon
 as the identity of the car's owner was confirmed. According to the 
French TV station Demain, locals described embassy staff as being 
'military types' and numbering around 20.

The RAF veteran  who discovered the scene was following a popular cycling route
 around Lake Annecy and the surrounding countryside when he noticed the British-registered BMW estate in the forest car
 park and went to investigate.

Mystery: How the brutal slaying of the family in the French Alps unfolded

The cyclist, who has a holiday home 
in the area, discovered the engine was running 
before he spotted a girl near the front of the vehicle fall to the 
ground. He immediately put her in the recovery position and called the 
emergency services from his mobile phone at 3.48pm on Wednesday.

But he grasped the full extent of the horror only after he smashed the driver's side window to reach in and turn off the engine.

This was when he saw the bodies – the
 man at the steering wheel and two women in the back – two shot in the 
face. Then he saw a cyclist slumped on the ground near his bike, also 
shot dead.

This same man had overtaken him only 
moments earlier on his bike ride.

Lt Col Benoit Vinnemann of  the 
Chambery gendarmes, said: 'The main witness, a cyclist who discovered 
the grisly scene, said he was overtaken by another cyclist on the climb 
that leads to the parking lot where the shooting took place.

'Arriving there, he found the cyclist
 on the ground with gunshot wounds near a car. In the vehicle, a man and
 two women, has also been shot.

'On the other side of the car, a 
child of 6-8 years old was alive. He placed her in the recovery position
 until help arrived. She had been very badly beaten.'

Lt-Col Vinnemann said that the Briton 
had seen 'various cars leaving the scene including a 4x4'.

It has also emerged that he told police that -  before arriving at the murder 
scene - he saw a green 4x4 and a motorbike speeding towards it.

A detective said: 'He has a keen sense of observation. This could help us greatly,' the source told French channel M6. It is the first time that the possibility of the assassins using a motorbike has been raised.

Now a young woman who was also in the area has told police that she saw a
 ‘white Peugeot 206 or 306’ a few minutes later, along the same road and
 heading towards the village of Horses.

She said it was being driven extremely fast by ‘a man in a black shirt’ 
who had to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting her own car.

Peugeot makes 4x4s in both the 206 and 306 range, leading to the 
possibility that both witnesses saw the same Peugeot, and it was being 
used as a getaway car by a man involved in the killings. 

Prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the ordeal of what the RAF man had witnessed had left him 
in 'a great deal of shock'. He added: 'He should be 
congratulated on his swift actions.'

Mr Mollier, 45, was a father of three
 from nearby Ugine. He was on paternity leave from his job at a company 
producing stainless steel products.

His
 wife alerted police when he failed to return home from his bike ride. 
Prosecutor Maillaud said: 'It would appear he was in the wrong place at 
the wrong time.'

Following
 the attack, in which Zainab is believed to have been pistol-whipped, 
doctors induced a coma but she is believed to be out of danger and her 
condition has stabilised. Zeena is receiving psychiatric care.
