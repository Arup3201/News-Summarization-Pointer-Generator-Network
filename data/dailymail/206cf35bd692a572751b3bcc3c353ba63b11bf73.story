A 27-year-old Catholic charity worker has been killed after she was hit by a piece of scaffolding during a visit to the Philippines by Pope Francis.

Kristel Padasas was volunteering at a mass officiated by the Pope near Tacloban's airport today when a scaffolding reportedly holding huge speakers was blown over by strong winds.

She suffered a fractured skull and was taken to St Paul's Hospital in Tacloban City, shortly after the leader of the Catholic church departed, where she was pronounced dead, according to reports.

Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Pope was informed of the woman's death after returning to Manila.

He asked his aides 'to investigate how he could show his own suffering in solidarity with the (woman's) family', Mr Lombardi said.

Ms Padasas, from Manila, was based in the Samar province of the island where she was working on a recovery project for typhoon Haiyan with charity, Catholic Relief Services (CRS). 

A spokesperson from the charity said: 'Her dedication to the people affected by the typhoon extended beyond her official work with CRS. 

'She travelled a great distance to volunteer at today's papal mass and to remember the victims of Typhoon Haiyan.

'CRS Philippines mourns her loss along with her family, friends and loved ones. Her colleagues remember her as someone who loved to laugh and who was always ready to assist outside her normal duties.

'She found great joy in being able to contribute to the recovery effort by working directly with communities and families. Our deepest prayers are with Kristel's family and loved ones.'

The area has been lashed by strong winds and rain as tropical storm Mekkhala hit the region today, bringing with it  gusts of up to 80mph.

Three other faithfuls who attended the papal mass were rushed to hospital after they were pinned by a barricade, the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) reported.

Meanwhile a private jet carrying senior Philippine officials as part of the Pope's entourage veered off the runway at Tacloban airport as it prepared for take-off.

The front tyres blew, causing the aircraft to overshoot the track - although no one is believed to be injured in the accident. 

The storm caused Pope Francis to cut his visit to the city short. He had travelled there to offer comfort to the survivors of typhoon Haiyan, which his the area in November 2013.
