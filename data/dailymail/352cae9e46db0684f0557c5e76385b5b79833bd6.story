Meet the 'living doll' who spends up to four hours every day perfecting her look.

Lhouraii Li says her extraordinary appearance is inspired by a combination of Japanese fashion and pink princess Barbie style.

The 21-year-old nail technician from Bradford, West Yorkshire, uses special contact lenses and false eyelashes to made her eyes look huge and doll-like and has learned how to contour her face with clever make-up.

She explains: 'I put circle lenses in so 
it makes your eyes appear larger - then I put eyeliner on and I extend it 
out way past my actual eye line and I stick together about fourteen 
pairs of eyelashes.

'I've even shaved my eyebrows and draw them on higher, so it doesn't look too weird when my eyes are big.

She is so attached to her look that she admits she never leaves her home without a full-face of make-up - even when she's just popping to the local shops.

'It's not a chore to do,' she says. 'People get up and watch television, I get up and do my makeup and I find it just as entertaining.'

But the blonde-haired beauty, who cites 'unicorns', 'fairies' and Disney princesses as inspiration for her image, hasn't always been a pink-obsessed princess.

She said: 'I was a goth at one point. And then that got a lot of stares and more hate than this.

'I remember I actually tried to fit in at one point and I'd walk down the street and people would still stare at me and point at what I was wearing, so I was like screw it, I was going to dress even crazier.'

Now Lhouraii says the attention from the locals in her hometown don't bother her as much.

'Obviously some people say bad
 things but I kind of switch off from it a lot - I'll look around and 
everyone will just be staring at me.

'People sing I'm a Barbie girl and I'll finish it.'

Lhouraii's boyfriend of four years, Nathen Kent, 24, says he loves her unusual look

Lhouraii admits that she does attract a few stares from the locals in her hometown

Llhouraii's transformation from goth to barbie princess began four years ago, when she started experimenting with makeup and researching Japanese culture.

Now,
 she's even started uploading make-up tutorials on YouTube and has 
already attracted more than 6,000 followers and averages 20,000 views 
per video.

And her biggest fan is her boyfriend of four years, Nathan Kent, 24.

Nathan said: 'I really like the look. I think it would be better for her if she could go outside without so much makeup on every so often, but it makes her happy.

'I've known her for the past eight years. When we first met, she was dressed kind of gothic and so was I, but when we met up again after a few years, that's when she dressed like this and it has changed since we've been together.

'Most people are more positive about it than negative and just interested.

'It upsets me when it upsets her - it's irritating.'

But despite the stares and comments, Lhouraii is happy with her look and won't be changing it anytime soon.

'If I do want to look like this when I'm fifty or something then I'll still look like this because it won't matter.'

With her tiny waist, skeletal arms, 
enormous coloured contact lenses and vacant expression, Ukraine's 
Valeria Lukyanova, 23, believes she has become a living, breathing 
Barbie, something she sees as the embodiment of perfection.

She has turned herself into a human doll using plastic surgery 
and thick layers of dramatic make-up, confessing she wishes to be 
considered 'the most perfect woman on the internet'.

 VICE documentary-maker went behind the scenes with Valeria - who 
currently has 876,000 fans on her Facebook page - journeying to Ukraine 
to capture her life on film.

 believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't 
quite sure - and isn't really human like the rest of us.
