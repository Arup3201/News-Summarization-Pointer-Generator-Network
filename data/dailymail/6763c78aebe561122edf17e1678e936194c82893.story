A national fraternity group has shuttered its University of Mississippi chapter amid accusations three members tied a noose around the neck of a statue of the first black student to enroll at the school.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, based in Richmond, Va., has closed its Ole Miss chapter after several incidents, including the February noose tying. The names of the three students, all from Georgia, haven't been released.

The Southern school was all-white until the 1962 enrollment of eventual 
civil rights icon James Meredith broke down the walls of segregation and set off violent protests that left two dead and several injured.

Action taken: Sigma Phi Epsilon members who reportedly hung a noose around the James H. Meredith statue on the campus of the University of Mississippi earlier this year have caused the group to be shuttered

Fraternity members are also accused of draping of a pre-2003 Georgia state flag with a Confederate battle emblem in its design on the face of the statue in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 16.

The fraternity booted the students from it's ranks and had been suspended while under review by the national office, but its ultimate fate has now been decided.

'The decision is not a result of any individual incident, but a response to newly discovered, ongoing behavior that includes incidents of hazing, underage drinking, alcohol abuse, and failure to comply with the university and fraternity's codes of conduct,' the fraternity said in a statement released to CNN.

'Though the incident involving the James Meredith statue several months ago did not directly result in the chapter's closure, it did mark the beginning of an intensified period of review.'

Ole Miss student Adam Ganucheau told CNN that he believes 'Ole Miss has a race problem,' but it isn't just limited to his school.

'Universities across the Southeast are just more prone to these kind of incidents because of the past history at the [schools],' he said.

'The school has been dealing with race issues since Meredithâ€™s admission, and has been prone to isolated incidents because of its history.'

He insisted Ole Miss is taking steps to mitigate such future incidents, but could not say what is being done outside of sensitivity training to this fall's incoming freshmen.

A 2013 on-campus performance of 'The Laramie Project,' a play about the 1998 murder of openly gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Sheppard were met with football players shouting derogatory comments at the stage.

Students also openly chanted racial slurs to protest President Barack Obama's reelection in 2012.

Ole Miss only ditched its Colonel Reb mascot - which evoked strong imagery of the civil war - for a black bear in 2010. Confederate flags were only banned from football games in 2003.

University disciplinary proceedings against the three students are ongoing. according to a school spokesperson, the FBI is also investigating.

The Lafayette County district attorney has said state charges won't be brought because no state laws were broken.

Mississippi's hate crime law requires an underlying crime for those additional charges. Because the statue itself wasn't marred or broken, prosecutors say typical vandalism charges don't apply.

After the noose was found, the university asked the national headquarters to review the 130-member chapter, which had been on campus since 1987.

'The closure is not a result of what happened with the Meredith statue, but the Meredith statue precipitated the intensive review of how they conduct business,' the fraternity added.

University officials said the national office had previously intervened in 2010 to fix similar problems.

'We are disappointed that a pattern of bad behavior and serious, inexcusable hazing occurred within the chapter,' Dean of Students Sparky Reardon said in a statement. 'Periodic reports from and meetings with local alumni and national headquarters led us to believe that the chapter was improving.'

Sigma Phi Epsilon CEO Brian Warren said in a statement the organization had 'no choice' but to close the unit.

'Though it's always painful to close a chapter, these students' actions clearly illustrate a determination to perpetuate an experience based on risky and unconstructive behavior.'

Blanton said students currently living in the Sigma Phi Epsilon house on campus would be allowed to stay and eat meals there through the end of the semester, but would not be allowed to have any social activities. After that, the university, which owns the land under the house, and the fraternity would discuss uses for the structure.

Sigma Phi officials said they would discuss a return to campus with the university. It's not clear how long that might take. Blanton said that several years ago, the university did not reinstate the closed chapter of another fraternity until all the members at the time of the closure had graduated.
