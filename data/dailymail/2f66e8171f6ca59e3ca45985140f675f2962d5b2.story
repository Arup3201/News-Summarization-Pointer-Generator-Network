Natalie DuBose was pictured weeping outside her bakery on Monday after vandals broke her windows during the Ferguson protests

A mother-of-two whose cake shop in Ferguson, Missouri, was vandalized and looted during Monday night's protests has received almost $200,000 in donations to help rebuild her business.

Natalie DuBose, 32, opened Natalie's Cake's & More at 100 S. Florissant Road in June after finally raising enough money to open her own store.

During the violent protests that followed a Grand Jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson her small shop had its front windows smashed in and equipment damaged.

'Hurt is the only word I could really describe,' she told NBC News. 

'I was like, 'Wow, you guys really just didn't care, you didn't care, and this affects whether I can feed my children or not, and you just bust through the window with a chair.''

A friend suggested she start a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to clean up and repair her bakery.

The response has been beyond Natalie's wildest dreams and she has raised more than $190,000 in just 24 hours.

'I am so grateful and appreciate it. I just can't express it,' she said. 

The response on GoFundMe has been beyond Natalie's wildest dreams and she has already raised more than $190,000 in just one day

'People have been showing love through the phone, leaving prayers, leaving songs - it's been absolutely amazing.'

Donations have flooded in from thousands of people including Brandi Glanville from The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills and actress Patricia Heaton, best known for Everybody Loves Raymond.

Natalie also said that she was brought to tears by a 'sweet lady' who offered money from her social security check.

Baking has long been a passion of Natalie and closing her business was never an option after it had taken her so long to open it.

She began baking and selling cakes at local flea markets, slowly saving money and she was finally able to make it her full-time job earlier this year. Before that she had worked two jobs to raise the money.

Natalie writes on her GoFundMe page that she feels 'so humbly blessed' by people's generosity but she hasn't been able to stop as she has been inundated with orders for Thanksgiving.
