A Briton who fears they may have contracted the deadly Ebola virus while abroad has returned home and placed themselves in voluntary quarantine, it has emerged.

The potential victim, a Welsh national understood to be living in Cardiff, is being 'closely monitored,' health officials said today.

Doctors from Public Health Wales said the individual had been 'voluntarily' confined at home for the past week after returning from an infected country in West Africa.

The individual has been 'voluntarily' confined at home for the past week after returning from an infected country in West Africa and fearing they could have been exposed to the deadly disease

Medical experts are in daily telephone contact with the person in case they start to show symptoms of the deadly disease.

Ebola is a 
severe acute viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of 
fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. In its 
early stages its symptoms can often be confused with a cold or flu.

But
 with Ebola, other symptoms emerge which include vomiting, diarrhoea, 
rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both 
internal and external bleeding.

The maximum period the virus usually incubates before symptoms emerge is 21 days - and people cannot be tested before the onset of symptoms.

Anna Humphries, of Public Health Wales, said the individual told doctors they 'may have been exposed' to the deadly virus which has so far killed 826 people across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea.

She told MailOnline: 'We don't have a case of Ebola at the moment. We have an individual who has travelled in the West Africa region where the outbreak is.

'Upon returning to Wales a week ago, the individual realised they may have been in contact with people with Ebola, although the risk is minimal.

'The person is voluntarily staying at home and away from work for 21 days.'

Fears that Ebola may reach Britain intensified on Sunday night after a passenger from a flight which stopped in Sierra Leone died at Gatwick airport. The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country, but tests later revealed she did not have the disease

She added that Public Health England is in daily contact to monitor the individual, who is currently showing no symptoms and 'seems well'.

'As a result, there is no case - and no suspected case and 'no risk to the public' posed by the quarantined traveller,' she said.

'They don't have symptoms at the moment. This is someone who may have been exposed to Ebola and we are keeping an eye on them.

'The
 reason we haven't spoken about this before is the individual is not 
currently a case of Ebola. There are dozens of these suspected cases all
 over the UK at the moment.'

'We are in daily contact with them and at the moment they are feeling well. If symptoms arise then we will act.

British Airways has suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August over concerns about the Ebola outbreak.

The carrier normally operates a four-times-a-week service from Heathrow to Freetown in Sierra Leone, with a connection on to Monrovia in Liberia.

BA said: 'We have temporarily suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 2014 due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries.

'The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review in the coming weeks.

'Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a range of options including a full refund and the ability to rebook their flights to a later date.'

'The first symptom is usually a high temperature and they could get that for a number of reasons - with a cold or the flu - but as an absolute precaution they would be taken to their nearest hospital for tests.

'In the event that happens it would be the first case of Ebola in the UK - that would be a fairly big deal.'

Public Health Wales said good hygiene is the most effective way of stopping the virus spreading.

The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country, but tests later revealed she did not have the disease.

The British centre of excellence for treating the Ebola virus is the Royal Free Hospital in London and is where any infected person would eventually be taken in the event of an outbreak.

A statement released today by Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual resident in Wales is currently staying away from work and limiting contact with other people voluntarily following possible exposure to Ebola while visiting Western Africa.

'The individual does not have symptoms of Ebola and there are no cases of Ebola in Wales.

'We are alert to the possibility of Ebola cases in the UK given the outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have traveled from the area.

'Processes have been developed to protect public health in the event that we are notified of any individual who may have been exposed to Ebola.'

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola
 is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per 
cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, 
gorillas and chimpanzees.

How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In
 Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with 
chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and 
porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once
 a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a 
sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also 
become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled
 clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men
 who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to 
their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden
 onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore 
throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney 
and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If
 a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact
 with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek 
medical help immediately.

What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation
