BJP prime ministerial canddiate Narendra Modi appeared on course for a landslide win in the country's weeks-long general election, with his party easily driving out the long-dominant Congress party in the world's biggest democracy.

The party now has a commanding lead in 272 seats, the majority needed to move forward without forming a coalition in the lower house of Parliament.

Modi tweeted: 'India has won. Good days are coming.'

'There are no
enemies in
politics or in
democracy,
there are only
competitors,' said Narendra Modi

The Congress party conceded defeat several hours into the vote counting.

'We are accepting the people's verdict in all humility,' said party spokesman Shakil Ahmed.

'Trends of the counting are certainly not in our favor. The trends point out that the country has decided to vote against us.'

If the results are finalised, as expected
 it would be the first time a single party has won an outright majority 
since the 1984 national election.

Trends suggested that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party would earn enough parliamentary seats to create a government without forming a coalition with regional leaders.

At BJP headquarters in New Delhi, workers were handing out sweets, setting off firecrackers and dancing outside in the streets.Â 

BJP spokeswoman Nirmala Seetharaman said the results were even better than expected.

'That
 certainly is good news, which we will savor with great delight,' she 
said. 'It means that people of India found the (connection) with 
Narendra Modi.'

There was a
 record turnout in the election, with 66.38 per cent of 814 
million eligible voters casting ballots during the six-week contest.

Campaigning
 on promises of a revival in economic growth, Modi and the BJP were 
looking to take advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the 
Congress party.

The BJP's slick and well-financed campaign also promised better governance.

The glow of victory was unmistakable but there was also an emotion on his face when he promised the people of Vadodara that he would always be available to Gujarat.

"I am going with all your blessings but you would never miss me," Narendra Modi told a victory rally in Vadodara, to deafening cheers from the crowd.

Modi, who registered a sparkling victory with a margin of 5.70 lakh votes, said: "Good days are going to be here soon. The media wanted me to speak, but I wished to speak to the people of Vadodara first. Vadodara has the first right on me."

The crowd went into a frenzy during 
Modi's rally as he thanked the people of Gujarat for giving the BJP all 
the 26 Lok Sabha seats. For the first time, Congress could not win a 
single Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat. In 2009, the party had won 11 seats.

Three Union ministers, Dinsha Patel, Tushar Chaudhary and Bharat Solanki, were among those who lost, apart from the party's general secretary Madhusudan Mistry and leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, Shankarsinh Vaghela.

Sixty-three year old Modi, a former RSS pracharak, said that Gujarat is now giving the country its "first prime minister born in Independent India."

No political party in the country has won so many seats since 1984, when the Congress, under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi, swept the General Elections with a sympathy wave following Indira Gandhi's assassination.

The celebration was omnipresent.

In the BJP's Delhi headquarters, party president Rajnath Singh said: "It is a mandate for change and that time has come to rewrite India's success story."
