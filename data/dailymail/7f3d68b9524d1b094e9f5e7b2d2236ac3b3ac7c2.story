A small town in North Yorkshire, England, has gained notoriety in Asia after Taiwanese pop star, Jay Chou, held his wedding at Selby's 1,000-year-old abbey.

For his marriage to model Hannah Quinlivan, the star opted for Selby Abbey for the ceremony and the nearby home of Castle Howard for the reception.

Though he may be relatively unknown in Britain, Chou is one of the biggest stars that Taiwan has ever produced, even being nicknamed the 'New King of Asian Pop.'

Selby in North Yorkshire has gained considerably notoriety in Asia following Jay Chou's wedding

The Taiwanese popstar married his girlfriend earlier this month at the 1,000-year-old Selby Abbey

Since announcing his marriage last week, both venues have already been visited by hundreds of fans, inspiring tour operators to add the locations to their itineraries. 

In fact, Castle Howard is now translating its wedding brochure to respond to enquiries from Asia.

'We have also seen an increase in enquiries from Chinese outbound-tour operators, so hope to see an increase in groups visiting us over the summer and during our Christmas opening,' Hannah Cooke, a spokeswoman for Castle Howard, said.

The couple's luxurious reception was held at the nearby Castle Howard, a 4,050-hectare estate

Following news of their wedding venue hitting the media, the abbey and castle have seen many tourists

The 36-year-old singer, actor and director, unsurprisingly, chose a regal theme for his grand fairytale affair.

His 21-year-old bride, whose Chinese name is Wu Yi-Chen, wore a white Tudor-inspired gown and a diamond-encrusted tiara worth over £1.25 million. 

Weddings at the 4,050-hectare estate start at £8,000 with a rental of the main house coming in at about £15,000.

At Castle Howard, the team have also experienced an increase in enquiries about it as a wedding venue

Most of the fans who have visited over the past week are Asian visitors already studying overseas in Britain, according to the abbey's vicar.

Unlike York, Selby Abbey had not previously received many visitors from Asia, but this is expected to change following the recent festivities.

Chou, who is often credited with reviving the Mandarin music scene, is known for his blend of traditional Chinese instrument sounds and hip hop and R&B.

Recently, he also directed and starred in 2007's Secret and acted as Kato in The Green Hornet, alongside Seth Rogen.

Chou's wedding also comes on the heels of the UK trialling easing up on visa application requirements for Chinese citizens.

Destination weddings are also growing in popularity among mainland Chinese couples, the South China Morning Post reports.
