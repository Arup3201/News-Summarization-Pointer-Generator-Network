The Married at First Sight star who looked like she was about to become a runaway bride on the reality show's season two premiere has revealed that she did indeed marry the groom she initially refused to say ‘I do’ after deciding he wasn’t attractive enough.

Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, spoke with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Friday morning’s episode of the Today show about her look of displeasure when she first walked down the aisle – and confessed why she was really hesitant to say 'I do' to her now-husband Ryan Ranellone.

'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' the 30-year-old sales rep explained. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.'

All smiles: Jaclyn Methuen revealed on Friday's Today show that she did end up marrying Ryan Ranellone on season two of Married at First Sight - even though she said she was unimpressed by his physical appearance 

Full of delusion: The 30-year-old told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb that her look of displeasure when she saw her now-husband for the first time was the result of thinking it would be love at first sight 

On the last Tuesday's two-hour episode of the FYI-channel reality show, 29-year-old Ryan happily agreed to marry Jaclyn, but the episode ended in a cliffhanger when she admitted she had doubts about her arranged marriage.

'I first see Ryan, my gut just says: "Oh man, like this is him?"' she told the cameras. 'The initial physical attraction really isn't there right now.’ 

She continued: 'When I saw him face-to-face, I felt a little disappointed. It just doesn't feel like this is the man who is my husband. I don't know if I can do this.'

But Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, did not have to think twice when it came to his betrothed's appearance, and Jaclyn's Today show interview confirmed that she would eventually say 'I do'. 

Unhappy camper: The sales rep, who had been single for seven years, said she thought there were going to be sparks when she saw Ryan at the altar for the first time 

Not my fault! Jaclyn, who can be seen with Ryan on their wedding day, blamed her thinking on being single for so long and watching 'too many rom-coms'

Full house: Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar and Jessica Castro, as well as Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings

After watching the clip from the episode, Hoda said that Ryan looked like he had won the jackpot when he saw Jaclyn walk through the door but noted that her initial reaction was filled with a lot of expletives that had to be bleeped out during the episode.

Both she and Kathie Lee were stunned that Jaclyn thought that it would be love at first sight.

'Why would you think that?' they both asked her.

Jaclyn, who hadn't been serious with any man in the past seven years, said: 'Because I was single for so long. I watched too many rom-coms.’ 

Being honest: During her appearance on the morning show, Davina, 34, said she respected her mother's decision to skip her reality TV show wedding 

Hard work: Dr Cilona explained the scientific process behind the matchmaking on Married at First Sight, revealing that he had given each contestant five psychological personality tests

And while she knew it sounded silly, Jaclyn said she really thought her soul was going to recognize its counterpart in him.

'[I thought] we were just going to light it up and it was going to be perfect,' she said of her pre-conceived notions of their first meeting. 'The reality was that he was a stranger, and I didn't know anything about him.' 

Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar, 34, and Jessica Castro, 30, as well as the show's licensed clinical psychologist Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings. 

Unlike Jaclyn, Davina was pleased with her groom Sean Varricchio's physical appearance, but her reality show nuptials were missing her mother, who disapproved of her doing the show.

Big step: Jessica, 30, spoke about being able to trust her new husband after her former fiance cheated on her 

High hopes: Jessica, who can be seen with her husband Ryan DeNiro on their wedding day, told Kathie Lee and Hoda and she won't let her past define her

'In my family, I have always been the risk taker...' the 34-year-old sales rep explained. 'I took the risk. Another piece of this is that my family is from the West Coast and I wasn't able to sit down and look them in the eye and tell them [about the wedding].'

Davina maintained that she respected her family's decision and noted that she was still speaking to her mom throughout the process.

'She was still there in the way that she could be,' she said of her mother.  

I don’t? Jaclyn couldn’t bring herself to say 'I do' to Ryan, whom she met for the first time at the altar on Tuesday's season two premiere of Married at First Sight

Seconds thoughts: Jaclyn began to have doubts about marrying a perfect stranger after seeing him for the first time. Meanwhile, Ryan said he was a 'happy camper' when he saw his bride walk down the aisle

Awkward: The bride-to-be couldn’t look Ryan in the eye during their wedding. She noted that she was 'disappointed' by his physical appearance

Tick tock: After Ryan said 'I do', he was left awkwardly waiting while Jaclyn had second thoughts

As to whether or not her mom has come around to her new husband, Davina said viewers will have to 'stay tuned'. 

Kathie Lee and Hoda were also curious to see if Jessica, 30, was afraid of trusting a stranger after her former fiance cheated on her. 

'I wasn't going to let my past define me,' she told them. 'I wasn't going to just assume that I couldn't trust this person.

The receptionist said she is optimistic about her future with 29-year-old Ryan DeNino because two of the three couples from season one of the show are still happily married. 

Unlucky in love: Jaclyn, a sales rep for Tito’s Handmade Vodka from Union, New Jersey, had been single for past seven years and hadn't had sex in two years

Confident: Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he finally felt ready to settle down

Agreeing to marry a complete stranger may seem strange, but Dr Cilona told Kathie Lee and Hoda that during the matchmaking process he administered five psychological personality tests, as well as an in-depth questionnaire that he created.

Dr Cilona explained that the amount of compiled research this past season alone resulted in 3,800 pages. 

In addition to Dr Cilona, three other specialists – sexologist, Dr Logan Levkoff; sociologist, Dr Pepper Schwartz; and spiritual advisor, Greg Epstein – took the three women's needs and created what they believe are three perfect couples, based on scientific matchmaking. 

Helping hand: Davina, a biopharmaceutical sales rep from Manhattan's Upper East Side, is one of the show's 'singles'

Over the course of several weeks, viewers will be able to watch as the couples go from wedding, to honeymoon, to 'early nesting', and then to the daily struggle of marriage. 

But before they walked down the aisle, the show's participants shared what they were looking for in an ideal match. 

Jaclyn admitted that she hadn't had sex in two years and confessed that she hoped her new husband would be 'personable, secure and confident', while her new husband Ryan said his perfect wife was loyal, dedicated and family-oriented.

He had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he explained that he finally felt ready to settle down. 

Great expectations: Sean Varricchio, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey said he was looking for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values'

Davina, who is from Manhattan's Upper East Side, said she wanted to get married at first sight because she has 'dated so many different types of men' that she 'started to doubt whether I was even looking for the right qualities’. 

Meanwhile, her new husband Sean, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey was on the lookout for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values'.

'I have a science background, I'm very analytical and I thought there's got to be something to this,' he said. 

And Jessica, who also lives in Manhattan, confessed that she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after learning that her former fiance was unfaithful. 

Moving on: Jessica, a receptionist at a law firm in Manhattan, said she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after her fiance cheated on her

Searching for his soulmate: Ryan DeNino, 29, from Staten Island. Mr DeNino owns his own consulting business said he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up

She had been single for two years and explained that she wants a husband who is 'close with family (especially his mother), independent, strong work ethic, loving and affectionate'.

On this week's season premiere she married Ryan, from Staten Island, who owns his own consulting business.

He explained to the cameras that he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up.

Why did he want to get married at first sight? 'Knowing there were experts that would… get to know who I am, hopefully find me a match that would be compatible for me,' he said.
