Pictures of Renee Zellweger walking the red carpet at the 2014 Elle Style Awards have amazed films fans over the last 48 hours. 

The actress's facial features appeared dramatically different from her earlier acting days, with many commenting that they could barely recognise the star. 

Renee isn't alone - many of Hollywood's young talent are going to great lengths in order to maintain their good looks, often drastically altering the features that made them famous. 

But there still are those actors and actresses who are ageing gracefully, stars like Helen Mirren, George Clooney and Annette Bening who look almost identical to when they first started out.

Femail takes a look at the stars who have kept time standing still:
