Wallaby back Kurtley Beale has been fined $45,000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), but has avoided suspension and having his contract terminated following a marathon code of conduct hearing on Friday.

The hearing at ARU headquarters in Sydney lasted almost four hours, but it was another two hours before the results were announced.

An independent tribunal found Beale guilty of a serious violation of the ARU code of conduct, and imposed the fine for sending an offensive photograph to an ARU employee. Beale admitted to sending the photo on June 9.

Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina

But, the tribunal ruled evidence did not establish a second more offensive text and photo had been sent by the playmaker.

The tribunal found while a serious violation had occurred, mitigating factors were taken into account to determine an appropriate sanction.

These included Beale's contrition, the unpleasant consequences the matter had created for the ARU employee and Beale, and the fact Beale had already effectively been suspended from recent matches.

ARU CEO Bill Pulver said the tribunal's findings and sanction would be accepted.

'This was a serious allegation and, like any business, when we received that complaint, we were compelled to investigate it and give Kurtley Beale an opportunity to present his case in relation to the matter in an independent forum,' Pulver said.

'We have obligations to our fans and the broader community and we are committed to ensuring any behaviour that has the potential to breach our code of conduct or values is investigated and taken seriously.

'This was deemed a serious violation by the tribunal and, as such, we intend to donate the $45,000 collected through this fine to a suitable organisation that promotes the empowerment of women.

 'Negotiations regarding Kurtley's contract beyond this year have been on hold in recent weeks. As a result of the independent tribunal's decision, we will re-open those contract discussions.'

Rugby Union Players' Association CEO Greg Harris said it was a positive outcome that the tribunal found the more offensive text and photo had not been sent by Beale.

'We are pleased that Kurtley, having shown remorse and incurring the penalty, will now be in a position to continue his rugby career.'

Following the decision, Beale apologised for breaching the code of conduct.

'I am satisfied with tonight's outcome. There was conjecture about my contract being terminated, however the tribunal agreed that - on the basis of the evidence - that a fine was appropriate.

'I'm relieved there is no termination and no suspension and I can now continue playing rugby.

'I'm also happy the evidence presented to the tribunal did not establish that I sent the second text and photograph. This is why I fought so hard to prove my innocence regarding that text.

'I'd like to apologise to (former Wallabies business and logistics manager) Di Patston and the broader community for my behaviour, particularly to rugby fans.

'I have had a fair hearing tonight and will work to regain the respect of my teammates, fans and the general Australian community.

'I am extremely proud to represent my country, and I will work hard to ensure my behaviour reflects the honour and privilege of playing for Australia at all times, on and off the field.'

The decision means Beale will be eligible for selection for the Wallabies, effective immediately.

 The emotional anguish felt by a female former Wallabies staffer after she was accidentally sent a crude text message about her by star player Kurtley Bealewas recently ervealed.

Di Patston quit her role as the Australian rugby team's business manager  after weeks of controversy following a mid-air row with Beale last month.

 In the messages, reported in The Daily Telegraph, Ms Patston tells of the hurt she feels at being the subject of the texts and asked Beale why she has been targeted. 

'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale, according to The Daily Telegraph.

'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?'   

Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she has done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'.

Ms Patston fires back that she wants the player to leave him alone. 

The emotional string of texts were exchanged in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France. 

The contents of Beale's offensive text messages about Ms Patston were revealed when a letter from the Australian Rugby Union to Beale was leaked.

The letter referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?'The Sunday Telegraph reports.  

Ms Patston contacted Beale after she received the images, telling him, 'I can't stop crying.'

'I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female at this level,' she wrote.

'If I complain then I make it hard for women in rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.

'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.'

After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. 

Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. 

Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. 

After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 

'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting.

'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 

'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).'

'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.'

BEALE (1.12pm)

'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.'

PATSTON (1.15pm)

'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.'

PATSTON (3.44pm)

'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).'

BEALE (3.48pm) 

'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.'

The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.'

'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied.

'I have learned my lesson I promise you.'

'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.'

However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress.

The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town.

Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange.
