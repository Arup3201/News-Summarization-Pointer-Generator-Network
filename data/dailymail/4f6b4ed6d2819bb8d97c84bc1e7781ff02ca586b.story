Twirling through bright blue water and smiling with joy, these heart-warming photos show children indulging their playful side - albeit underwater.

The work of photographer Adam Opris, 31, each of the real-life water babies poses with an item that reveals an element of their personality, whether a love of gymnastics or an ambition to become a mermaid.

One little boy even braved an underwater pose while wearing full-scale knightly armour and brandishing a sword at the camera.

The children clearly love the shoot, which was done in their own swimming pools 

For one sporty boy, only a baseball will do, while one cheeky youngster shows off his sartorial know-how in a pair of red sunglasses. 

Another betrays ambitions to become a musician and risks his much-prized saxophone to get the perfect underwater shot.

Speaking about the series, Mr Opris said the point was to capture a wonderful childhood memory - and to have some fun at the same time.

 'My photography is all about capturing memories. It's about catching the moments and bringing them back to life,' he explained.

The boys take to the shoot like ducks to water, pulling faces and even donning a full suit of armour complete with sword 

'I love to see my models having fun - I just want them to feel natural,' he continued. 'I want my clients to look back on these photos and remember the time they spent, instead of just looking at a beautiful photo.'

Mr Opris, of Miami, takes pictures of his clients' children playing around underwater as part of a set of photos which he then presents to the family.

'I started taking underwater pictures of pregnant women two years ago and it all just went from there,' he added. 'Now I take pictures of wedding couples, pregnant women and children underwater.'

Part of the beauty of the dramatic shots, alongside the children, is the sunbeams streaming through the water
