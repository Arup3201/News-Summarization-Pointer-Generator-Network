Hearing: The Commons Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Margaret Hodge, will hold a one-day hearing into severance and pension payments made by the SFO at a one-day hearing

The Commons Public Accounts Committee is set to launch an investigation into severance deals worth more than £1million paid by the Serious Fraud Office.

The watchdog will hold a one-day hearing into the payments next month after the National Audit Office (NAO) previously refused to approve the SFO's accounts.

An 'irregular' pension and severance payment of £422,000 was made to Philippa Williamson, the SFO's former chief executive officer, last year.

The Cabinet Office had not approved the payments made by the SFO - the independent body that investigates corruption.

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has also asked that the NAO carries out a broader investigation into the payments, according to The Times.

Two other SFO members of staff are also understood to have received large payments.

Current SFO director David Green and former director Richard Alderman are expected to be called to give evidence at the hearing.

Shadow Attorney-General Emily Thornberry told The Times: 'These payout deals have damaged not only 
the SFO's already limited finances, but its reputation as well.

'It's clear that we still have not got to the bottom of what 
has been going on.'

Miss Thornberry also accused Attorney General Dominic Grieve of 'sitting on at least two reports 
into alleged impropriety at the SFO', adding that she had 'dragged
such information as I have been able from a very tight-lipped 
Attorney-General'.

She also said that current SFO chief David Green had asked for an independent investigation but that its findings were not released.

Damage: Shadow Attorney-General Emily Thornberry (left) said the payments, including a pension and severance payment of £422,000 paid to former chief executive officer Philippa Williamson (right), had damaged the SFO's reputation 

Mr Green sought legal advice when entering office about the deals that concluded the payments  were binding and that the money could not be recovered.

Another payment of between £450,000 and £475,000 was paid the SFO's former chief operating officer Christian Bailes, which had been agreed by Mr Alderman.

A spokesman for the SFO said: 'The payments were agreed before David Green became director. He had no prior knowledge of them.'
