Mario Gotze and Andre Schurrle are still reaping the rewards that come with winning the World Cup.

The Germany internationals both played important roles for Joachim Low's side as they claimed glory in Brazil, Schurrle with goals in the second round and semi-final and Gotze with the winner in the final.

Bayern Munich attacker Gotze's travels have taken him to Formentera in Spain where he enjoyed a mud bath with lingerie model girlfriend Ann-Kathrin Brommel.

Gotze is more renowned for his silky skills on the pitch but Pep Guardiola will be encouraged to see he is willing to get dirty too.

The 22-year-old sported a black Nike cap while Brommel carried a football.

He had previously been spotted celebrating in Ibiza after rounding off a memorable summer of international duty at Germany's homecoming in Berlin.

Schurrle, meanwhile, aped his Germany colleague by holidaying on a private yacht in Ibiza.

The Chelsea attacker has not returned to domestic duty with the Blues yet due to his involvement in Brazil but looks certain to play a big part as Jose Mourinho continues moulding a side he feels are capable of challenging for the Premier League.
