We all need reminders for everyday tasks and events... birthdays, meetings or perhaps an appointment at the doctor’s.

But Ricky Dean’s memory problems are so severe he has to be told to do just about everything, from eating to brushing his teeth.

And just like Guy Pearce’s character in the film Memento, he is constantly surrounded by lists and boards to remind him what to do.

Until three years ago Ricky Dean, from Taunton in Somerset, rarely left his family home, because he could never remember where he was going

His iPhone is also invaluable in making sure he meets up with his friends at arranged times.

Not only are future events a problem, he also struggles to recall the past as he has no concept of time.

Ricky,  19, was starved of oxygen when he was born and later diagnosed 
with autism.

Doctors say there is no name for his condition and despite 
his problems he has still gained five GCSEs.

‘It can be very difficult at times, but my family and friends are so supportive,’ he said.

Ricky Dean has almost no short-term memory so must remind himself with notes and alarms to carry out the simplest tasks. His blackboard (pictured) outlines his morning routine - consisting of a shower and shave, walking the dog and then having lunch

Ricky Dean has notices all over his home (such as the pictured left) and even carries a card in his walet (right) to advise  him how to cope if he doesn't remember where he is

‘My mates are constantly having a joke about it, which is good, telling 
me I borrowed a tenner from them the week before. I can never remember 
if I have or not, so I make a list and if they’re just winding me up I 
get my own back.

‘My condition can be so frustrating for people, especially if they don’t
understand that I just don’t remember anything to do with time.

‘If I didn’t have my lists, telling me to brush my teeth or have lunch, I would be lost.

‘The worst thing is missing appointments with friends and forgetting 
good things. I can’t look forward to anything, because I have no concept
of time.’

Ricky Dean, 19, (pictured with mother Nicky and Gary) was starved of oxygen when he was born and now needs constant help with everyday tasks. Doctors say there is no name for his condition and despite his problems he has still gained five GCSEs

When Ricky, of Taunton, Somerset, was 11 his parents took him for a 
full memory scan which revealed the full extent of his memory loss.

Until three years ago, Ricky rarely left his family home, because he 
could never remember where he was going, but now relies on his iPhone.

Mother Nicki, 46, said: ‘We knew something was wrong when he was seven. 
To get a diagnosis was a relief because we had been saying all this time
that he wasn’t doing all these things because he wanted to.

As a child, Ricky (-ictured left, aged 18 months
and right, age 12) was diagnosed with autism, but when he was 11 his 
parents took him for a full memory scan which revealed the full extent 
of his memory loss

‘We try to promote independence but tasks such as cooking or running a 
bath present too much risk, because he wouldn’t know whether the oven or
bath had been on for five hours or five minutes. He has come so far and
is an inspiration to others.’

Now Ricky, who took five years of one-on-one tuition to complete his GCSEs, is studying agriculture and horticulture.

Father Gary, 40, said: ‘Ricky is one in a million million as far as his brain injury is concerned.

Ricky Dean uses his iphone to set alarms and help him remember what he is doing when he is out and about

‘It is a mixture of symptoms of autism and memory issues that make him unique.

‘For a time we thought he was suffering from food allergies, but we got him diagnosed with autism.

‘It takes absolutely nothing to distract him from a task. Even a thought
will stop him dead in his tracks but he has empathy for others and will
help old ladies.’
