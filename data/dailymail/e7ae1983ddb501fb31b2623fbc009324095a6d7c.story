Sam Allardyce was told he must excite West Ham fans next season after keeping his job. And the arrival of Mauro Zarate is sure to set pulses racing in the East End… or at least his wife will.

The former Lazio and Birmingham hitman is understood to be closing in on a move to Upton Park for an undisclosed fee from Argentine club Velez Sarsfield.

The Hammers face competition from a host of other suitors including Sunderland but the 27-year-old star, who has scored 19 goals in 29 league games in his second spell at boyhood club Sarsfield, is believed to be heading for talks in the capital this week with his model wife Natalie Weber in tow.

‘We have almost everything sorted out with West Ham,’ his brother and agent Rolando Zarate told Argentine radio station, Velez y su Mundo.

‘They asked him not to play against San Lorenzo but he wanted to play.

‘Mauro wanted to play because his love for Velez is very intense. But the club receive a good financial compensation.’

Zarate was signed by West Ham’s owners David Sullivan and David Gold when they were at the helm at St Andrew’s with Birmingham back in 2008.

He scored four goals in 14 outings but a permanent deal failed to materialise after Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League.

He went on to move to Serie A where he had spells with Lazio and Inter Milan. It was in Italy he met wife Natalie and they married in Buenos Aires in 2011 before his return to Velez two years later.

Zarate, who plays best in an attacking left-sided role, is among a host of targets for West Ham this summer with manager Allardyce having a budget of £20million to spend.

Free agents Joleon Lescott and Martin Olsson are wanted by the 59-year-old boss, as he looks to beef up his defence for next season.
