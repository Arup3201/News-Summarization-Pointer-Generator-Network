Their civil servant father brought them to Britain from Eritrea to give them the best chance in life.

Abdu Karrar, 78, chose Oxford in the hope his sons might one day win a place at its prestigious university.

Instead, Mohammed and Bassam are facing long jail sentences after being found guilty of raping and trafficking young vulnerable girls.

Mohammed, who has four children by two different women, was arguably the most sadistic member of the sex gang.

The 38-year-old groomed one of the girls from the age of 11, forced her to have an abortion and even branded her as his property.

Known as ‘Egyptian Mo’, he claimed to be outraged by the allegations against him and tried to claim he had been victimised by the girls. He would admit only to receiving a sex act from one victim, once.

Bassam, a 33-year-old security guard and university drop-out, was given the nickname ‘Sam The Rapist’ by one of the victims after he forced himself on her at a down-at-heel Oxford guest house in 2006.

During the trial it emerged that, like his brother, Bassam relished beating and humiliating girls.

Their father, an interpreter for the Home Office working with asylum seekers, said he wished he had been stricter with his sons when they were teenagers.

Speaking to the Mail from his semi-detached home in Oxford, he said: ‘I wanted to give my children the chance to get a good education.

When I was in school my teachers always spoke to me about Oxford and Cambridge universities.

‘That’s why I decided to come to Oxford, even though I had family in London and I knew no one in Oxford.

‘I had high hopes for my sons and thought that they might one day go to Oxford. They never had a strict or religious upbringing, I regret that now. This is all very hard for us.’

Bassam’s father celebrated when he won a place at De Montfort University in Leicester to study media.

However, after two years he dropped out and started work on security at football matches.

He was married to an Indian woman for four years but the relationship broke down because she was unable to provide him with children.

Bassam went on to have a relationship with a woman called Paula Pitson, 28, with whom he has two children. Before he was found guilty, his father admitted Bassam was a ladies’ man.

He said: ‘Even when he was younger he would have lots of young girls coming to the house asking for him. He’s a good looking boy and girls have always liked him.’

Mohammed has been married for seven years to a woman he met on holiday in Morocco. They have three children and he has a fourth child with an unknown English woman.
