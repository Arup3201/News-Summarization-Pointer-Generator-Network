When going out for a gourmet meal, you might expect to dine on caviar, fillet steak or succulent sea bass.

Now, however, you could turn up to a restaurant with two Michelin stars to be served that beloved British classic, bangers and mash - priced at a staggering £75.

Olivier Limousin, head chef at L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, has produced the world’s most expensive sausages and mash, featuring ‘deconstructed’ gourmet sausages served on a bed of pureed Desiree potatoes and butter, mixed with 10 grams of black truffle.

Gourmet grub: Chef Olivier Limousin shows off the world's most expensive version of the classic pub dish

Expensive tastes? The Michelin-starred L'Atelier de JoÎl Robuchon, in London, is serving up 'deconstructed' Iberico pork sausages braised in a 16-year-old vintage Bordeaux

The sausages are made with pork from Iberico pigs fed on a diet of acorns, wild thyme, rosemary and mushrooms.

They are gently braised in a 16-year-old vintage Bordeaux, worth more than £75 a bottle, to bring out the meat’s sweetness.

The pricetag for the dish, named ‘Ivre de genereux Bordeaux, mousseline de pomme de terre avec truffe', may be hard for some to swallow, however.

It’s an eyewatering 839 per cent more expensive than the average £7.99 meal.

The dish - which is devoured more than 10million times a week across the UK - has been placed on the menu to celebrate Potato Week, led by the Potato Council.

But Chef Limousin is one of only 20 protegees in the world trained to make Mr Robuchon’s signature mash.

Mr Limousin said: 'It’s a dream come true for any chef to simply have the opportunity to work with ingredients of such sublime quality.

'Putting my own stamp on sausage and mash was an added delight.

'You can only make our signature of mouselline de pommes de terre by selecting the right potato variety. Texture is key to getting results.

'Our tasting menu shows just a fraction of the ways you can cook with potatoes, and for most of them you don’t need a professional kitchen.'

A smaller version of the dish will be available as part of a £152 tasting menu at L’Atelier until Sunday, October 7.

To celebrate Potato Week, each of the eight courses will be made with potatoes.

terre avec truffe' is a world away from the more common, low-budget 
version of the dish

Delights include a salt and vinegar martini, vichyssoise, caramelised potato picolini in orange liqueur and almond and potato petit fours.

The menu, created with www.manyfacesofpotatoes.co.uk, is designed to showcase a new potato classification system.

Varieties will be grouped together in three classifications - Fluffy, Salad and Smooth - in a bid to make cooking the root vegetable easier for people.

Caroline Evans, of the Potato Council, said: 'This dish is a true taste sensation and gives a gastronomic twist on a meal most of us enjoy once a fortnight at home.

'As a nation, mash is one of our favourite ways to cook with potatoes but, of course, you don’t need to add expensive truffle to enjoy this classic.'

A smooth variety of potato, like the Desiree, produces the best, lump-free mash, she added.
