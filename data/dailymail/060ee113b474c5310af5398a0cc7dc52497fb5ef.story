Immediately: The NFL Players Association urged the NFL in a letter on Friday to immediately reinstate Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson

The NFL Players Association urged the NFL in a letter on Friday to immediately reinstate Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, officials say.

ESPN reports that the NFL should immediately reinstate Peterson as per the agreement the two sides made in September when the player was placed on the commissioner's exempt list.

The agreement allegedly states that Peterson would be removed from the list when his legal matters were resolved.

And on Tuesday they were, with the 29-year-old pleading no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault, down from a felony charge of child abuse for disciplining his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch.

'I'm just glad this is over,' Peterson said after the plea deal was announced in Texas. 'I can put this behind me, and me and my family can move forward.'

But Peterson, who has missed the past eight games under the list's terms, may not be able to return to the field just yet.

ESPN reported that the NFL said Peterson will remain on the commissioner's exempt list pending completion of the NFL's review process. 

This may be in violation of the initial agreement to place Peterson on the list.

A few hours after the NFL released its update, the NFLPA issued a statement demanding efficiency and consistency.

Those traits have often been missing from the disciplinary process. 

'Our union worked with the NFL, the Minnesota Vikings and Adrian's representatives on a mutual agreement pending the adjudication of his legal case,' the NFLPA said.

'Now that his legal matter is resolved, we believe it is Adrian's right to be treated in a manner that is consistent with similar cases under our collective bargaining agreement. 

'We will pursue any and all remedies if those rights are breached.'

If the NFL fails to comply with the agreement by not removing Peterson from the list, the NFLPA can then file an expedited non-injury grievance to have him reinstated immediately.

There are no indications that the NFLPA will do so, but sources told ESPN that the NFL is trying to move as quickly as possible in its disciplinary review process of Peterson which is taking place now.

The NFL formally began a review of the star running back's case for potential punishment under the league's personal conduct policy, informing Peterson on Thursday that his status on paid leave from the Vikings will not change until completion of the process.

'The NFL has requested that Peterson submit relevant information regarding his case and meet with designated experts who will make recommendations for the commissioner's consideration,' spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 'Peterson also will have the opportunity to have a hearing prior to the issuance of any discipline.'

Peterson received what's essentially two years of probation, plus a $4,000 fine and requirement to complete parenting classes and 80 hours of community service.

'Adrian wants to get on with his life and have his relationship with his son and get back to playing football,' Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said after the plea agreement was reached to avoid a trial or any jail time for Peterson.

Suffered: As a result of the beating, the boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles

Just how fast Peterson gets back to playing football is a complicated and potentially contentious matter.  

The Vikings (4-5) are in their bye week, scheduled to reconvene for practice Monday. They play next at Chicago on Nov. 16.

Quiet: The Vikings have been quiet since Peterson's plea agreement, stating only that they will speak about his situation 'at the appropriate time'

With only seven games left on the schedule, the timeline is tight for a return. Commissioner Roger Goodell was excoriated for his initial leniency in the caught-on-camera knockout punch Baltimore running back Ray Rice threw at his now-wife. The league boss will be under intense scrutiny for how he handles any punishment for Peterson.

Weeks after handing Rice a two-game suspension, Goodell announced in August he was toughening the league's policy on domestic violence that now calls for a six-game suspension without pay for a first domestic violence offense.

That's not a cut-and-dry guideline in this case with Peterson, though, because he has maintained he intended no harm in seeking to discipline his son the way he was as a child growing up in Texas. His plea was not an admission of guilt, and the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor.

On the other hand, there's the firestorm to consider when the Vikings first declared on Sept. 15 that Peterson, after sitting out the home opener the day before, would remain with the team to give him his due process in the legal system.

The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records, and backlash from the public was strong. One major Vikings sponsor suspended its partnership, other corporations expressed concerns to the team and the league, and Peterson was dropped as an endorser of several brands.

The Vikings then reversed course about 36 hours later, announcing that Goodell agreed to issue his special roster exemption. Peterson continued to draw his weekly in-season salary of more than $690,000, and the team was sheltered from the proverbial pitchforks that came out after their initial decision.
