Police, bouncers and hospital workers are gearing up for one of the busiest weekends of the year as the office Christmas party season reaches its climax.

The final weekend before December 25th will be marked by a spike in corporate festive gatherings, with pubs, bars and clubs preparing for bumper sales.

Friday December 19th is considered by police to be the busiest night for Christmas parties, with many forces already tweeting words of advice for would-be revellers.

Thousands of revellers will head out across the UK this Friday for work and social drinking events 

Police are on high alert for disturbances and fights to cope with the fallout from Christmas parties

Party planners have said firms are beginning to splash the cash again this year, having emerged from the shadows of the economic slump which has blighted recent shindigs.

However, social media experts believe the potential for long-term damage to their reputation is causing some people to tone down their antics - or forgo the festivities altogether - through fear that their drunken exploits will be the talk of the Twitter feed.

Digital communications expert Warren Knight said: 'People are 100 per cent being more sensible than ever before because of social media - reputations can be lost in one night.

'Staff are behaving better, reducing their alcohol consumption or even deciding against going to their party because they don't want to end up doing something silly they later regret.

Admissions to hospital due to alcohol misuse will likely rise on Friday 

'Instant communication, Instagram posts and checking-in facilities mean it is very difficult to delete something once it is online.

'People I speak to say the office Christmas party is getting more and more tame.'

Street pastors are already turning to social media in an effort to use it as a force for good during party season.

Christian Nightlife Initiatives have launched a #StaySafe campaign reminding revellers of responsible drinking and appropriate behaviour.

A spokesman said: 'This Friday is one of the busiest nights within the night-time economy - the last Friday before Christmas. 

'Generally it is also one of the busiest nights for police, ambulance, Accident & Emergency and street patrol projects such as Street Angels.'

Their tips include drinking plenty of water, staying in groups of friends, and keeping money back to afford transport home at the end of the evening.

Georgina Coleman, from bespoke venue operator Late Night London, said the Christmas party is enjoying a bumper year.

She said: 'There are more cranes around London this year, more buildings going up, and that is a useful indicator of a change in the economy.

'We have seen a marked increase in the number of inquiries about Christmas parties, budgets have increased too, and the spend per head.

'People are also looking for something different - they don't necessarily want to hit the bar, they want something civilised and often with a sit-down meal or some sort of activity such as cocktail-making.

'This is only the first year after the economic slump so it's hard to draw too many conclusions but the signs are encouraging.'

Whether you’re the host or a guest, be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink

Alcohol Concern’s Workplace Programme Manager, Lauren Booker, gives you some top tips…

1. Designated Driver

Not only will having a designated driver (DD) ensure a safe end to the night, it will also avoid those lengthy late night taxi queues. Do a deal with the drinkers so they pay for the DDs soft drinks all night. Take the DD role in turn so everyone can have a drink if they want to and everyone gets a night off the booze, too.

2. Set the Pace

It can be hard to keep track of your drinking if you all get a round in. It also tempts you to drink more than you intended – after all, when it’s your round you don’t want to opt for the diet cola and when it’s someone else’s shout, it’d be a shame to miss out. Sticking to one type of drink throughout the night will help you keep a tally of how much you’ve had. Make sure to drink plenty of water, too. The Drink Coach mobile app can even send you a text to remind you to take it easy or let you know it’s time to go home, as well as keeping track of your units.

3. The Morning After…

Pounding head, dry mouth, sensitive stomach, never drinking again? Forget all the novelty hangover cures – the only thing that really works is time. It takes one hour for your liver to process each unit of alcohol so in the meantime, get plenty of fluids, plenty of rest and take at least one night off (preferably more) before drinking again.

4. The Night Before

There are things that you can do while you’re out to lessen the effects of tomorrow’s hangover. Firstly, drink less by alternating one alcoholic and one soft drink throughout the night. It will keep you hydrated and you’ll feel better in the morning. Secondly, don’t mix your drinks, the different tannins, sulphites and other additives can upset your stomach. Thirdly, don’t drink on an empty stomach, you’re more likely to feel ill. Finally, put a bottle of water by your bed before you go out so that it’s within easy reach when you wake up at 6am feeling queasy.

5. Behind the Wheel

A good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast may make you feel better the next day but it doesn’t mean you’ll be safe to drive. Allow one hour for every unit consumed (a can of lager or a glass of wine can be about 3 units) and don’t drive until you’re sure all the alcohol is out of your system. A Chube breath test will help you workout whether you’re still under the influence.

6. Show me the way to go home

Make your plan for getting home before you go out. If you intend to stay out overnight, check with your host that this is a definite arrangement or book yourself into a nearby hotel. Keep a stash of cash and/or condoms somewhere about your person, too. Just in case.

7. Host with the Most

Try making a fruit punch or experiment with mocktails so that your non-drinking guests have the option of more than just cola or orange juice. Serve snacks at regular intervals, and don’t insist on refilling glasses if guests have had enough. If a guest does have a few too many, call them a taxi or let them sleep it off in your spare room.

8. The Best Guest

Few things are more embarrassing than having to phone up the party host to apologise for your drunken behaviour the night before. If you have a tendency to go overboard when celebrating, set yourself a limit and stick to it. Slow down your drinking and pace yourself throughout the night. Make sure you have mixers with spirits and eat something before you go out.

9. The One-Too-Many mate

Whether you’re the host or a guest, be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink. Encourage them to switch to water, lead them to the smallest room if they feel sick and sit them down somewhere quiet to recover. Check on them regularly and put them in the recovery position if they fall asleep. People are very vulnerable when drunk – violence, accidents, alcohol poisoning – so make sure your friend gets home safely.

10. Free now, pay later

If ‘Christmas Party’ means ‘free booze’ to you – beware! It can be very tempting to over indulge when the drinks are on the house. Not only can drinking too much too quickly be dangerous (the equivalent of a bottle of vodka in an hour can easily kill an adult male) but drunken behaviour in front of colleagues and loved ones can have repercussions long after the hangover has worn off.
