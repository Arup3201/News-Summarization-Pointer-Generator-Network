Deportivo La Coruna are taking hard measures against their own fans by banning hardcore members of their ultras for the next two games.

The move to ban the 'Riazor Blues' comes after the death of a fan prior to their game with Atletico Madrid on Sunday.

Francisco Javier Romero Taboada died after trouble erupted between rival groups in the streets surrounding the Vicente Calderon stadium ahead of Atletico Madrid's midday Primera Division match against visiting Deportivo. 

Some Deportivo fans will not be allowed in to the games for the next two weeks 

The 43-year-old died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after firefighters pulled him out of the Manzanares river near Atletico's home ground, while 12 more people were reported injured - some including stab wounds - during the fighting which was said to have involved around 200 people.

Club president Tino Fernandez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: 'I am certain that we will not have any more 'Riazor Blues' at the Riazor (stadium).

'The first step we have taken is to close the 'Riazor Blues' section of the stadium for our next two home games. 

'This is the first measure as there is still an investigation going on.

'We don't have to act against an organisation because the Riazor Blues are not registered as a fan club.

'We have to act against people and we are not sure who those are just yet.'

The Galician club will hold a minute's silence in honour of Taboada, known as 'Jimmy', and have reduced tickets to Saturday's league game with Malaga to a euro.

'We want Saturday's game to be a demonstration against violence,' Fernandez said. 'We want many of our citizens, who are against violence, to attend.

'We want to show everyone that we are united against violence and prove what is the true spirit of our supporters.

'What happened on Sunday was tragic.'
