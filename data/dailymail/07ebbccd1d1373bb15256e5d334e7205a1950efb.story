They were armed and brutal men who would fight to the death in front of baying crowds of thousands.

Yet despite the horrific nature of being a Gladiator, their tales have inspired many budding warriors.

And now, despite Gladatorial contests being banned in 325AD, men can train to fight like  Spartacus in an ancient Roman amphitheater - at the world's only Gladiator School.

Tough: Men who fancy their chances as a Roman Gladiator can train to fight like Spartacus at the world's only Gladiator school

Battle: The Scuola Gladiatori Roma, in Rome, is the only school of its kind, teaching brave participants ancient Roman combat techniques

Difficult: Students at the school are put through their paces with a series of grueling agility, co-ordination, speed and strength tests

The Scuola Gladiatori Roma, in Rome, is the only school of its kind, teaching brave participants ancient Roman combat techniques.

Students are put through their paces with a series of gruelling agility, co-ordination, speed and strength tests.

They are then taught basic weapon skills before they are thrust into the arena in full metal armour to put their new skills to the test in a battle with their instructor.

Ben Ince, from Men's Fitness magazine, was brave enough to take on the challenge at the school in Rome, where he was trained by head trainer Marcus Valerius.

Speaking about the unique experience, he said: 'There haven't been any gladiatorial contests in Rome since Emperor Constantine outlawed them in 325AD, so I was unsure what exactly I'd be learning.

'First up was an assault course, consisting of ropes, benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam.

Warrior: Students at the school are also taught basic weapon skills

Difficult: This student learns some of the basic skills which Gladiators needed to know in order to survive

Preparations: The student hones his agility skills during his training

'I do plyometric work during my usual gym sessions, so the rope and bench jumps weren't too challenging but navigating through the sandbags required plenty of agility and co-ordination.'

As part of his training Mr Ince was introduced to The Carousel, a device with a rotating blade at ankle length and another at shoulder length. The aim is to duck and jump to avoid being hit by the blade.

This device is similar to techniques used by gladiators to test strength but Mr Ince  said avoiding getting hit by one of the blades was no easy task.

He said: 'All you had to do was duck and jump which sounded straightforward but it took all my strength to avoid getting tripped or hit in the face.

'I established a rhythm of jumping the low pole and ducking the high one, when Valerius suddenly changed direction.

'In the split second it took me to adjust, the low pole caught my heel and sent me crashing to the floor.'

After the strength, co-ordination and agility drills, Mr Ince  was taken to the armoury for the second phase of Gladiator training - weapon skills.

Banned: There have not been any gladiatorial contests in Rome since Emperor Constantine outlawed them in 325AD. But that doesn't stop people from still wanting to learn the basic fighting techniques

Impressive: This is the ampitheatre where the gladiators sometimes train

Trainer Valerius said it was during this part of the training where students were taught basic fighting techniques including how to use a sword and shield.

He said: 'Gladiators mostly trained with a wooden sword called a Rudus, it's lighter and safer than a metal sword and it teaches you how to judge distance.

'You have to think about it like boxing, you have a variety of strikes or punches that you can use in different combinations to attack your opponent.

'Gladiators would spend hours a day training on it to refine their technique.'

Having mastered basic fighting techniques, it was time for Mr Ince  to try the armour before going head-to-head with Valerius in the arena.

Ben was dressed in full Gladiator armoury which included a wide rimmed helmet with the traditional long fin on top, a protective metal sheath for his sword, a short wooden sword and a large rectangular metal shield.

Tricky: Students are put through an assault course which consists of ropes, benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam

He said: 'I returned to the courtyard to find Valerius holding the net in one hand and the trident in the other. 'Now try to attack me' he said.

'I shuffled awkwardly, wondering how on earth people fought like this at all, let alone for five minutes.

'Valerius struck my shield with the trident, knocking me down. I scrambled back to my feet but before I could fully recover he struck again, jabbing with the trident to stay out of range of my sword.

'He began to rotate the net slowly until, accompanied by a final thrust of the trident, he aimed for the top of my head.

Hold: This shows weapons and armour used in the gladiator training

'Before I knew what was happening I was skidding face-first into the sand as he dragged me down in one swift motion. He said if this were an actual fight, I'd be dead.

'It was an eye opening experience. Trying to use the moves I'd been taught while wearing all the armour and weaponry was difficult.

'It wasn't so much the weight, more having to carry it on specific parts of your body at strange angles.

'After only a few hours training, I was exhausted from the heat, aching from all the reps and sore from the all the cuts and bruises I'd picked up.

'I now have a newfound respect for gladiators who, despite their diet and living conditions - not to mention the constant fear of death - were able to train relentlessly day after day.'
