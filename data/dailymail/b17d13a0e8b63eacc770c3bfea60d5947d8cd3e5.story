Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's FA Cup giant killing against Sunderland live on TV.

The Bantams knocked out another Premier League club following their 4-2 win over Chelsea in the fourth round to book their place in the last eight of the competition.

But the BBC came in for criticism because the 2-0 win against Gus Poyet's side was one of only three fifth-round ties not to feature on live TV, either on the BBC or BT Sport.

Mark Chapman confirmed on Match of the Day Two that Bradford was not selected for TV because the BBC had to choose the live games before their opponents were known

Bradford goalscorer Jon Stead joked during his post-match interview that the fifth-round tie against Sunderland should have been shown on TV

Bradford striker Jon Stead joked during his post-match interview for BBC that the game at Valley Parade was 'a great cup tie' and that it 'should have been on the TV', a comment that left the interviewer lost for words.

Back in the studio Chapman revealed the reason why Chelsea's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live, despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards.

'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: "They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldn’t be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it".'

Sunderland needed a replay to beat Championship side Fulham in the fourth round and the BBC had to select the live games before the tie was decided, with the corporation instead opting to show the all Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Leicester. 

Gary Lineker had earlier claimed the BBC would have screened Bradford's  fifth-round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays.

And the League One side didn't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at Lineker and  Chapham following the Sunderland win. 

The presenter tweeted: 'The BBC can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays. If they could've waited Bradford would obviously have been chosen.'

Bradford fans made their feelings known during the match, causing embarrassment for one veteran BBC presenter. 

Look North stalwart Harry Gration tweeted: 'I am in trouble. Filmed singing are you watching BBC. Sorry'.

Lineker led the BBC's coverage from Villa Park as the home side held on for a 2-1 victory in a match that only came to life in the final stages.

The poor fare on offer prompted Match of the Day presenter Mark Chapman to write on Twitter: 'We're debating whether this goes last on tonight's £Motd or whether we leave it off altogether.'
