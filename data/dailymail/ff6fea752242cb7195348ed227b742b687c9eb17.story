Britain is preparing for a total withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year amid a security stand-off with President Hamid Karzai.

Nato has been planning to keep a slimmed-down force – including 500 UK personnel – in the warzone after 2014 to train and assist Afghan forces.

But the Afghan leader, who will step down after elections in April, is stubbornly refusing to sign an agreement that would allow 10,000 US troops to remain.

Britain is preparing for a total withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year amid a security stand-off with President Hamid Karzai

Yesterday ministers at the Western military alliance – including Britain’s Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – agreed to draw up plans for a complete pull-out unless a deal is thrashed out. 

Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: ‘We agreed the need to plan for all possible outcomes including the possibility that we may not be able to deploy to Afghanistan after 2014 due to the persistent delays we have seen.

‘It is not the outcome we think is in the interest of the Afghan people.

There are fears that a total withdrawal would spark a security crisis in Afghanistan, which could raise the prospect of the Taliban re-seizing power

‘However, it might be the unfortunate outcome if there is no security agreement in due time. This is what is at stake.’

Mr Rasmussen said he hoped plans to keep troops in Afghanistan beyond this year could be salvaged.

But US President Barack Obama has told the Pentagon to prepare for the possibility that no US troops will be left because of President Karzai’s refusal.

The Nato-led force in Afghanistan has a current strength of more than 52,000 soldiers, including 5,300 British personnel

Beyond the zero troops option, Nato could also look at scaling back its current plan, which calls for a training mission headquartered  in Kabul and four regional bases, instead focusing solely on the capital.
