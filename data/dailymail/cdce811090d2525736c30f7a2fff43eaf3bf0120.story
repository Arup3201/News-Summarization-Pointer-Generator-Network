The unclaimed bodies of 13 military veterans were finally laid to rest in side-by-side plots following a poignant 60-mile funeral procession yesterday.

The dead soldiers, seven of whom served in Vietnam, were driven from a morgue in Detroit to Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly Township, Michigan - their hearses flanked by state troopers on motorbikes.

All of the men died alone in the last three years, but tragically, their remains were left unclaimed at the Wayne County medical examiner's office.

While some fought in Vietnam, others served as far back as the 1950s - with at least one going to fight in the Korean War.

The veterans were identified by the Missing in America Project, who 'locate and inter the unclaimed remains of American veterans through the joint efforts of private, state and federal organizations'.  

Sadly, they were among 200 unclaimed bodies from the same morgue, which have all now been buried - as the county could not bear the cost of holding on to them.

Of the 13 who were laid to rest with full military honors, only one - Vietnam-era veteran Roland Dukes - had a family member present who received a flag from the casket.

Shimeca Jackson, Mr Dukes' niece, said: 'We appreciate them honoring him. A lot of time has passed by. It was a beautiful ceremony.'

David Techner, funeral director of the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield and a member of the coalition responsible for the burials, said having 'hundreds of bodies stacked up in the morgue' will never happen again

David Techner, funeral director of the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield and a member of the coalition responsible for the burials, said having 'hundreds of bodies stacked up in the morgue' will never happen again. 

He stated that the group have come up with 'Initiative 91', which calls for the coalition to step in and either bury or cremate a body that is not claimed within 90 days.

Major Carl Livingston, a chaplain with the Army National Guard, said during the service that 'all service members just want to return home'. 

The men were identified by the Missing in America Project, which also organised yesterday's funeral

He added: 'These men did just that. Rest in peace, dear brothers-in-arms.' 

He then offered a moving salute to the 13 flag-draped caskets behind him.

The Jewish Fund played a key role in coordinating the burials. Their chairman, Dr. Richard Krugel, said: 'This brings to an end a very tragic time in our community,'
