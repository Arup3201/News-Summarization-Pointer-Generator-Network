A woman using an ATM at a Chase bank branch in Paterson, New Jersey kindly opened the door for a stranger on December 28

The female victim's terror was caught on surveillance camera as she was bitten by the attacker who then robbed her in New Jersey late last year

The man, who was dressed in black shoes, grey sweatpants, a dark-patterned jacket with white hoodie and a dark beanie hat, entered the vestibule on his cell phone. 

The woman and another man were using cash machines at the time. 

When the other man left, the attacker can be seen on camera approaching the woman at the machine while her back is turned. 

He then grabs her around the neck and drags her backwards before leaning in close to her face. 

It was then that the man bit the victim's right hand, drawing blood, police said and she released the cash she was holding. 

The suspect then fled the scene.
