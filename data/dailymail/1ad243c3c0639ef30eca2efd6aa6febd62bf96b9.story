Ethereal washes of green, inky blues and a shining white moon. Not many worldly sights equal that of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, captured at night. 

This dramatic series of photographs, taken by Norwegian photographer Tor-Ivar Naess, shows the phenomenon in all its glory. 

The 31-year-old from Nordreisa, Norway, became fascinated by the colour range of the lights that extend from 50 miles (80km)  to as high as 400 miles (640km) above the earth's surface.

Ethereal: Areas that are not subject to 'light pollution' are the best places to watch for the lights from like this image taken in Storslett

Tor-Ivar says: 'The Aurora Borealis is a very special phenomenon in itself.

'I began watching these lights for hours and it ignited something inside of me.

'Due to the fact that I have them available to me from the beginning of autumn until the beginning of spring I have the opportunity to perfect my photos.

Tor-Ivar says the lights 'ignited something' inside him and he wanted to produce the perfect picture of them, like this taken in Djupvik, Norway

Bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere

'My Aurora Borealis photos show the diversity in this spectacle, from the normal green veil to fast moving 'curtains' of light.'

The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. 

The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south.

Straumfjorden in Norway: It takes a lot of patience and luck with the weather and behaviour of the lights to create the ideal image

For Tor-Ivar, the perfect shot takes patience and luck with both the weather and the behaviour of the auroras. Areas that are not subject to 'light pollution' are the best places to watch for the lights.

Luckily, he doesn't have to stray far from his home town of Nordreisa in the county of Troms to produce these beautiful shots, all of which were shot in Norway. 

For two years he has scoured the area looking for the best possible locations and, once in the right spot, he can spend up to eight hours a time photographing the light display.  

Tor-Ivar: 'I still hope that no one hears me scream like a teenage girl at a boy band concert when these lights put on a show'

Tor Ivar wants to show the beauty that northern Norway can conjure so that people from around the world will be tempted to visit themselves

'Photographing the aurora borealis is very exciting, especially when the normal green veil bursts into curtains moving extremely fast over the night sky,' says Tor-Ivar.

'I still hope that no one hears me scream like a teenage girl at a boy band concert when these lights put on a show.

'It's important to remember that photographing the night sky requires the camera to record light for a long time in comparison to what you see with your naked eye.

'I want to show the beauty that northern Norway can provide, so that people from around the globe will be tempted to visit.'
