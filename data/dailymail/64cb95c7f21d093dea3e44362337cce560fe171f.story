She may have been a wife for only 18 months, but actress Anne Hathaway thinks she has found the secret of a happy marriage.

So sure is she of her relationship rules that she’s had them laminated and stuck on the wall of the home she shares with husband Adam Shulman.

One is to have a regular ‘digital detox’ day, away from the constant demands of the outside world.

Anne Hathaway's to a happy marriage - keep the phones at bay for at least 24 hours and don't spend more than two weeks apart

‘We try to have a period of at least 24 hours when we’re off our phones, unplugged from technology and concentrating on being together,’ she says.

‘It is surprising how hard it is, because if you’re doing business in the modern world you have to be accessible.

‘But I do try not to be available to absolutely everybody 24/7, and those times when it’s just Adam and me are the times I treasure.’

Then there is the two-week rule which means she and Adam – also an actor – never spend longer than a fortnight apart.

‘We have a laminated contract on the wall,’ she explains.  ‘I can’t say we work very hard at it, but we prioritise each other.

‘And if I have to travel we have the rule which means we can’t go more than two weeks without seeing each other.

The Les Miserables actress also revealed that children are next on the agenda. She said: 'Now I’ve met the person  I want to spend
 the rest of my life with, motherhood  is the next challenge.  It’s 
definitely my No 1  goal'

'Because then you start picking on each other – I think you get so annoyed about not having the person you love there,  that you end up fighting about silly things.’

The Oscar-winning star of Les Miserables says that,  at 31, children are next on her agenda. ‘I’ve known since I was 16 that I wanted to have children,’ she says.

‘Now I’ve met the person  I want to spend the rest of my life with, motherhood  is the next challenge.  It’s definitely my No 1  goal. I would like to raise beautiful human beings.’

The actress said: 'But I do try not to be available to absolutely everybody 24/7, and those times when it's just Adam and me are the times I treasure'
