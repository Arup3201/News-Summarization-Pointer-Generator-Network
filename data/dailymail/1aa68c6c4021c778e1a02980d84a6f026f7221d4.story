A 10-year-old girl has died after being pinned beneath a branch that fell on her family's tent while they camped during a thunderstorm.

Allison Spahr, from Cary, Illinois, had urged her father to let them stay at the Ice Age Campground at Devils Lake State Park in Wisconsin despite the impending bad weather.

He agreed and settled down to sleep beneath some trees with his daughter and his son, 13-year-old Kyle Spahr, on Saturday night.

But just before 4am on Sunday, Mr Spahr said he awoke to the sound of creaking.

Loss: Allison Spahr, 10, was killed on Sunday morning when a branch landed on her chest as she slept in a tent with her father and brother during a storm in Wisconsin. The other two escaped

'I can hear that sound over and over - that creaking, cracking sound,' Spahr told NBC5.

Within 30 seconds, it was chaos.

'This loud crash, boom on the 
ground,' he told CBS. 'My legs were immediately pinned and it hurt. I had this shooting
 pain in my legs. And my tent was flattened across my face.'

But as he cried out in pain, Allison was silent.

'It landed across my 
daughter's chest,' he said. 'The coroner doesn't think she even woke up.'

His daughter was pronounced dead at the scene.

Kyle was able to wriggle to safety and Mr Spahr had to be cut free with a chainsaw.

The father and son were taken to St. Clare Hospital and have now returned home to Illinois, where they are nursing cuts and bruises.

Park officials said that the tree appeared to be healthy during routine checks but that it might have been weakened by the passing thunderstorm.

Spahr said he believed that the ground had been saturated by rain, which he thinks caused the tree to completely uproot.

In a statement released Sunday, the Department of Natural Resources passed on their condolences.

'Visitor safety is the number one priority on all properties the department manages, and we do our very best to provide a safe environment for our visitors,' the statement said.

Sadness: Her father said that his faith was comforting him as he struggled to deal with the loss of Allison

Injuries: He showed off the scrapes on his legs, which were inflicted when the branches fell on their tent

Scene: Park officials said the trees were regularly inspected but they think they fell in the bad weather

'Campgrounds are inspected regularly, and action is taken to eliminate potential hazards whenever possible. Unfortunately, not all possible events can be foreseen.'

Mr Spahr, a Christian who believes that his daughter's death is part of a larger plan, said she would be remembered as a happy child who loved the outdoors.

'Sweet, charming, energetic, delightful,' he said. 'In her 10-year-old kind of way, she would smile and she would laugh, and say "Just keep living life, Dad".'

Her mother, Barb, who home-schooled her daughter, added to the Chicago Tribune: 'We spent a lot of time together. We did a lot of things together. (Now) there's a huge hole.'

The family attends Harvest Bible Chapel in Crystal Lake, where her funeral will be held on Saturday.
