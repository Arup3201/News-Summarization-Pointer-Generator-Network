Families with children will save hundreds of pounds on the cost of their holidays after George Osborne axed taxes on flights today.

The Chancellor abolished air passenger duty on all flights for children under the age of 12.

Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement announcement is a major boost for families who are hit by higher holiday costs during term time.

At the moment a family of four pays £52 in flight taxes for a ticket to Europe - of which £26 is for children

The £50million tax break cuts £138 from the price of a family of four's holiday to North America – and almost £200 for a family of four travelling to Australia.

It will also reduce the cost of a family holiday to Spain  by £26.

The tax currently adds between £13 and £97 to the cost of a flight, depending on how far the final destination is from London.

A campaign in Parliament calling for the measure to be included in the Autumn Statement has widespread support.

Mr Osborne said: 'We're going to require airlines to list the charges separately from taxes on tickets.

'But I also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly.

'From May 1 next year, Air Passenger Duty for children under 12 will be abolished. And I'll go further. From the following year, we'll get rid of Air Passenger Duty for children under 16 altogether.' 

David Cameron reportedly lent his support to the idea at a meeting of Conservative MPs in October. He is quoted as having said: ‘I really like this one. I have three children under 10 myself.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has led the campaign to scrap the tax, said scrapping air passenger duty on children's flights was a ‘no brainer’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has led the campaign to scrap the tax, said the tax cut was a ‘no brainer’.

He added: ‘It’s got cross-party support and it’s not expensive. I do have a habit of getting what I want from the Government.’

Around three millions flights are taken by under 12s every year, Mr Bridgen said.

But he said the Treasury will lose just 1.6 per cent of the £3.2billion it rakes in from air passenger duty every year.

Mr Osborne’s announcement will ease the pressure on families stung by exorbitant travel costs during school holidays.

At the moment a family of four pays £52 in flight taxes for a ticket to Europe - of which £26 is for children.

The duty adds £138 for two children’s tickets to North America, £170 to the Caribbean and £194 for flights to Australia or New Zealand.

Mr Osborne last year announced that the two higher air duty tax bands would be scrapped in April 2015 – with all flights over 2,000 miles charged at the same rate.

It meant that flights to the West Indies, South America, India, China and Australia will all be charged the same tax as a flight to New York.

All long haul flights will, from next year, will be charged £71 extra per ticket.

But the system could be scrapped in Scotland after the Government handed Holyrood complete control over air passenger duty.

The announcement has infuriated Labour MPs in northern England who fear regional airports will lose business to Scotland.

Labour politicians said the move was a ‘kick in the teeth’ for northern constituencies, which would have a ‘crippling’ impact on airports in the region as airlines divert flights to Scottish locations to take advantage of lower taxes.

The SNP made the abolition of the duty part of their business pitch for independence.

Ed Balls and fellow frontbenchers admitted the change would cause ‘uncertainty and risk’ for regional airports. The airports themselves called for the Treasury to commit to fresh protections.

Frank Field, the Birkenhead MP and former welfare minister, said fellow Labour MPs would join forces with southern Tory rebels to bring down the Smith proposals unless the devolution of APD was dropped.

‘The idea is we are trying to build up northern airports not cripple them. This proposal cripples them. This will reinforce the London bias,’ Mr Field said.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways's parent company IAG, said people would be ‘rushing across the border’ as a zero rate would make it £276 cheaper for a family of four to fly to the US.

Search and Rescue and air ambulance charities are to get VAT refunds and more government cash following lobbying by Prince William. In today’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will announce VAT breaks for the sector from April, alongside £7.5million extra support for air ambulances. The tax refunds will be worth £25million over five years.

The Duke of Cambridge is said to have been angry at pressure on air-sea rescue services. As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey, he has helped out with mountain rescue, Coastguard and air ambulance services.

David Cameron revealed at Prime Minister’s Questions in 2011 that the Prince had urged him to do more to support the services, many of which are run by charities. Today’s measure will mean all 150 search and rescue and air ambulance charities will be able to apply for VAT refunds on all their search and rescue activities as of April 1.

Hospices are to get VAT refunds worth millions of pounds a year. After a long campaign by the hospice movement, George Osborne will agree today that they should receive an annual grant to cover their VAT costs.

Currently, NHS organisations are able to recover VAT on non-business supplies such as catering, laundry, staff training and vehicle and maintenance costs.

But hospices do not enjoy the same advantages – meaning they are unfairly disadvantaged and face large VAT bills.

Mr Osborne will say today that the VAT refund is expected to be worth £4million a year to the sector, though if it is more the bill will still covered.

‘Hospice charities provide vital support services for the NHS and its patients and we want to support their work,’ said a government source.
