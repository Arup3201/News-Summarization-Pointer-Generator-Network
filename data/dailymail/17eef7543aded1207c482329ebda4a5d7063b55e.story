Police are questioning the man they believe is responsible for the murder of Kelli O'Laughlin, the 14-year-old stabbed to death after she walked into her home and interrupted a burglary.

Investigators found signs of forced entry at the $500,000 Chicago house and said that the suspect in custody is a stranger to the O'Laughlin family.

Authorities believe popular high school freshman Kelli was killed as she entered her home after finishing school on Thursday to discover a robbery in progress. She was discovered by her mother, Brenda.

Investigators yesterday released a sketch of a man wanted in connection with the killing but it now appears he is the man police arrested late on Thursday.

No charges have been filed, but prosecutors are in contact with investigators, a law enforcement source told the Chicago Tribune.

The drawing depicts a black man, 
25 to 30 years old, 5'8" to 5'9" inches tall, with a medium build. He 
was was seen in the area at the time wearing a dark, hooded sweatshirt 
and had a backpack.

Kelli was discovered at around 5.30pm on Thursday by her mother Brenda O'Laughlin in their 
suburban Indian Head Park home with multiple stab wounds.

The
 Lyons Township High School student was rushed to nearby Adventist 
LaGrange Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 5.39pm 
yesterday.

Police said that Kelli arrived home between 4.45pm and 5.30pm, and interrupted a
 burglar.

'We
 believe there was a burglary going on in the home,' Indian Head Park 
police Chief Frank Alonzo said at a news conference yesterday. 'They 
confronted her, and, sadly, they killed her.'

'We're going to work our hardest to bring this person to justice,' Mr Alonzo added. 'We're giving it everything we have.

'Our sympathy goes out to the family. This is a tragedy for a young person to walk into their home and have this happen.'

Investigators
 were able to draw up a sketch based on a description from a witness.

Mr
 Alonzo said there had been six or seven burglaries in the town about a 
month ago, but that those cases have been closed with three arrests.

One
 burglar, 33 year-old Samuel Watson, told police how he Googled 
'Expensive homes along highways' and then used 'Street View' to plan the
 break-ins.

Kelli died of 'multiple stab and incised wounds,' according to her 
preliminary autopsy report, said an official with the Cook County 
Medical Examiner's Office.

Tributes: More than 1,000 people have contributed to Facebook groups, with one suggesting students at her school wear black on Monday in remembrance

Popular: Friends and fellow students flocked to Facebook to express their grief over the death of Kelli, centre

Plans: Kelli had spoken of growing up in that day's Spanish class, friends said

Suburban home: Kelli was discovered by her mother in the 6300 block of Keokuk Road, Indian head Park, a suburb of Chicago

Homicide: Kelli O'Laughlin,was remembered by school friends as a happy, fun girl who always wore a smile

Her death at the $500,000 property 
owned by parents John and Brenda is being investigated as homicide, 
said Orland Park Police Chief Tim McCarthy, chairman of the South 
Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, which is heading up the investigation.

Investigators have only been letting residents with identification into the 
area around 6309 Keokuk Road in Indian Head Park, the address where Miss O'Laughlin 
was killed. Police have cordoned off the block and brought in a K-9 unit.

Lyons
 Township High School District 204 Superintendent Thomas Kilrea sent an 
email to parents, which read: 'It is with deep regret that I must inform you of the tragic loss of an LTHS freshman student.'

More than 500 friends, fellow students and members of the community came out for candlelight vigil at the school last night.

Soon after news of Kelli's death emerged thousands of friends and fellow pupils took to Facebook to express their sadness at her death. Others went to the house and tied white ribbons and plastic bags around lampposts and and trees.

Mr Alonzo's remarks yesterday were the first extended public comments from police about the case and some neighbouring parents had earlier told of their upset at the lack of information.

Donna Yelnick, 44, who has a daughter at Lyons Township High School, told the Chicago Tribune: 'We're starting to get a little upset that police aren't telling us what's going on. It's got to be hard for kids to process.'

'We have the right to know what's happening in our neighbourhood,' 45-year-old Carmen Lopez, who lives two blocks from the O'Laughlins, told the Tribune.

Pat Sector, 45, told the paper her 11-year-old daughter 'went to school in tears this morning.'

A nearby neighbour, Kate Brodlo, who has four children aged seven to 13, said there had been 'fear here for a while,' after eight burglaries since March.

Investigation: The South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force have cordoned off the area and are only allowing in residents with ID

'I wish they'd tell us more, but when
 you think about what the family is going through, I think we can all be
 patient and allow them some privacy, she told La Grange Suburban Life.

Paris Hale, a sophomore at Lyons 
Township, told La Grange Suburban Life that Kelli had been 
planning for the future the morning she died.

'The day it happened, she was in 
Spanish class,' Miss Hale told the paper. '(She and her friends) were 
talking about life and how you could do anything you want with it, how 
you could be anything you wanted to be growing up, and she died that 
day.'

Online groups titled 'R.I.P Kelli 
O'Laughlin. You will always be deeply in our hearts.' and 'Kelli 
O'Laughlin~~~You Will Be Missed' have been created, describing the girl 
as an 'angel' who always 'knew right from wrong'.

In
 one, Kelly Roemer wrote: 'Kelli i cant even tell you how much i am 
going to miss you. we have been through so much together and i hate that
 i didnt even get to say goodbye.

'You
 were always my friend kelli. we were the kellis. i remember all kinds 
of memories we had together. from crummy mummy jokes to me spilling nail
 polish on your carpet.'

Ashley Leann Dean posted: 'Dear Kelli, Ive known you since mid 6th grade. And will continue on knowing you.

Grief-stricken: Students at Lyons Township High School, pictured, will wear black on Monday in respect

'You're a beautiful person inside and out. You always knew how to put a smile on someones face. You were the kind of girl who looked on the bright side of everything.'

Stephanie Morgan said: 'I remember in Gym, and it was the last day of flagfootball, and she brought in the black paint stuff, and she put it all iver her face. ahha. She was such a sweet and happy girl. RIP Beautiful girlâ™¥'

'This is just modern day proof that bad things can happen to even the kindest people,' said Colin Daly.

The high school is not scheduled to hold classes today, but grief counsellors have been made available to students.

One Facebook group urged students to wear black when school resumed on Monday to 'show you care'.

The Tribune reported that the murder brought to mind a series of summer burglaries in Indian Head Park, in which a suspect said he used Google maps 'street view' to target expensive homes.

Melinda Hensel, who lives near where the girl died and was one of the victims of the burglaries, told the Tribune that while there was no information linking the incident to a break-in, 'That's what people are thinking.'
