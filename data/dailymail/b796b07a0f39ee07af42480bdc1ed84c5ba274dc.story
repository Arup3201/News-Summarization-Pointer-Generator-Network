With its unusual shape and faded paintwork, this vehicle could be an old-fashioned toy car.

But in fact, it is one of the first electric cars ever made - and is being put up for auction for more than £20,000.

The rare Pierre Faure was discovered abandoned at a car museum in Chatellerault near Poitiers, France.

Launched in 1940, the striking car was created by experts in an attempt to overcome fuel shortages during World War Two.

Powered by six batteries, it has a capacity
 of 100 amps at 72 volts - reaching a top speed of just 24mph, with a 
range of 50 miles.

It also features a tubular chassis, an electric motor, front hydraulic brakes and a chain on the rear wheel axis.

Despite being put into production, only 25 models were created due to the limited supply of materials during the war.

Meanwhile, the car itself turned out to be a commercial failure as it proved difficult to sell during the lean wartime period. .

Astonishingly, the surviving model, along with its maintenance book, was discovered in its original state - albeit, with new brakes and replaced tyres.

It is due to be sold at auction on February 7 - with a pre-sale estimate of a staggering £21,000.

Antoine Mahe, a junior specialist for Artcurial Motorcars in France, described the vehicle as 'really rare'.

'This car is really rare because of the 
small number of examples produced during World War Two,' she said. 
'There were probably only around 25 and few of them are survivors today.

'It is the car’s absolute original condition which makes it so exceptional because it is a genuine witness of the way these cars were built during this period of restriction.'

She added: 'It went through the years without being cannibalised and deserves a nice restoration.'

Despite its initial popularity, the Pierre Faure was later overshadowed by the Peugeot VLV electric car - of which nearly 400 were made before the vehicle was banned by Germany.
