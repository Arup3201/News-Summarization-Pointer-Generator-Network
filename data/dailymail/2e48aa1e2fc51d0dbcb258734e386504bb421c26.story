The 50-year-old told police he was cleaning his gun in the kitchen when it fired, on October 28.

His finacee, swimwear model Leila Knight, first revealed details of the accident when she posted news that surgeons were battling to save his finger.

'This is Leila. Thank you all for the kind words and prayers', she said. 'Jose is in still surgery and will be ok. Please pray for his finger!!'

Canseco since posted images of his heavily bandaged hand and news of his recuperation following the successful operation.

But has now revealed the finger has fallen off again. And announced what he plans to do with it next.

'OK well I might as well tell you. I was playing in a poker tournament last night and my finger fell off. Someone took a video of it,' he announced on Twitter.

He also revealed some rather gory details: '(It's) very loose with no bone to connect it,' and it's 'smelling really bad.'

Now after conceding the finger will not be making a permanent return to his hand, he's decided to flog it on eBay.

'I will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on eBay for sale.

'The eBay ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks.'
