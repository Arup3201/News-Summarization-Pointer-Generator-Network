Prince Harry has been wowing the crowds as part of an Army attack helicopter display team.

Harry, known as Captain Wales in the Army, was part of the Apache Attack Helicopter Display Team  among the aircraft at yesterday's popular RAF Cosford Air Show, in Shropshire.

Thrilled spectators had no idea the 28-year-old Prince would be part of the display team until his presence was casually announced over the tannoy.

It was Harry’s first ever role in an 
aerial-acrobatic helicopter show team as the pilot appeared to cheat 
gravity with a series of heart-stopping barrel rolls.

Spectator Stuart Morris, 37, from Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'It was incredible. At first I thought the announcer was having a joke when he said Prince Harry would be performing.

'Soon word got round that yes, Harry was in the cockpit and everyone was stunned. I just thought to myself "wow, I’ll remember this day forever".

'The display was jaw-dropping, the helicopter was almost completely inverted with its rotors roaring down so much so that it was almost on its back.

'I have to admit I was quite scared for Harry but I think he was probably loving it – the crowd certainly was.

'Everyone left the air show with a buzz. Prince Harry’s display was just great and proved what a great patriot and professional he is.'

The prince, a co-pilot gunner, serves
with the Army Air Corps (AAC) from which the display crew-members have 
been selected this year.

The Cosford Air Show attracts thousands of people annually with aerial demonstrations. This year it featured the Red Arrows, RAF Chinook transport helicopters, and the RAF Falcons parachute display team.

Harry was among crew selected given his experience in the deadly Apache helicopter, which has seen combat most recently in Libya and Afghanistan.

Lieutenant Colonel Tom de la Rue, commanding officer of 3 Regiment AAC - part of helicopter attack force in 16 Air Assault Brigade - with responsibility for the display team, said Harry had been 'delighted' to have been selected as part of the display team for the summer. 

The display team is drawn from a pool of qualified and experienced Apache aircrew and ground crew

'The display team, unlike some other display teams, is not a permanent assignment; rather it is drawn from a pool of suitably qualified and experienced, operationally ready, Apache aircrew and ground crew, and uses aircraft drawn from the operational Apache Squadrons,' added Lt Col de la Rue.

Harry returned to the UK in January, following a five-month tour in Afghanistan co-piloting an Apache.

In an interview he confirmed that he had killed at least one insurgent on the battlefield in the war-ravaged country.

Unrepentant, he said soldiers sometimes had to ‘take a life to save a life’.

Lt Col de la Rue said: 'This year the pool of display aircrew has been drawn from 662 Squadron AAC which has recently returned from a very successful operational tour of Afghanistan.

'Today's aerial display crew was Staff Sergeant Jamie Boakes, as pilot, and Captain Phil Wilson and Captain Wales as the two front seat co-pilot gunners; all of whom are delighted to have been selected for their respective roles this summer.'

The Apache team performs manoeuvres in the helicopter, rather than aerobatics like the Red Arrows team.

Also scheduled to appear at today's air show were some more venerable aircraft, including a Spitfire, a restored Cold War-era Vulcan bomber and a B-17 Flying Fortress of the type flown by U.S. airmen in the Second World War and made famous in the Hollywood film Memphis Belle.
