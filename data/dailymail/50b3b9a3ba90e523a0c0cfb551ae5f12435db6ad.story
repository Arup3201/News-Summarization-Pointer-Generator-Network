Sheffield Wednesday supporter Mark Ablett has been banned from football matches for three years after he threw a tangerine at Fulham fans during his side's 4-0 defeat at Craven Cottage last year

A Sheffield Wednesday fan who threw a tangerine at Fulham supporters as his team crashed to a 4-0 defeat has been banned from attending football matches for three years.

Mark Ablett, 29, hurled the citrus fruit into the home crowd during the fixture on December 20 last year and was removed from Craven Cottage by stewards.

Ablett, who was spotted throwing the ‘missile’ by CCTV, said after he was pulled from the stands: ‘I may have been stupid and thrown a tangerine or whatever’.

A judge handed the charity financial officer a three-year football banning order and £360 in fines and costs after he admitted throwing a missile under the Football Offences Act.

Prosecutor Malachy Packenham said Ablett could not give a proper reason for throwing the fruit into Fulham's Riverside Stand.

Mr Packenham told Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court: ‘The home team Fulham were playing Sheffield Wednesday at Craven Cottage when Ablett was seen to throw this item at the Fulham fans.

‘He was identified by stewards and ejected from the stadium for the offence, which was captured on CCTV.'

The prosecutor added: ‘It probably does not matter but it’s very difficult to get tangerines at this time of year, so this was possibly an orange.'

Jyothi Somavarapu, defending, called for Ablett to be given a conditional discharge instead of an ‘unreasonable’ football banning order.

Ablett earns £16,000-a-year working for a local government funded charitable organisation which trains school leavers in ‘employability skills’ and has no previous convictions, the court heard.

Ms Somavarapu said: ‘My client’s explanation was it was silly behaviour and he threw a tangerine, which he said landed on the pitch.

‘His only explanation is that the game was not going that well and that’s the only reason he can think of.

Ms Somavarapu added: ‘He says it was a silly thing to do and he would not do again - otherwise he is a sensible person and is remorseful for what he did.

‘He is somebody who actually gives a lot to the community in his organisation’s projects and all he needs is a warning to him not to get into trouble again.’

But Deputy District Judge Kate Tulk said she had no other option but to ban Ablett from matches nationwide and abroad for three years.

Judge Tulk told Ablett: ‘You said this was a silly thing but I do not take that view - it had incredibly serious consequences.

‘If that fruit had landed amongst opposing fans it had potential for them to respond badly and react and a whole load of consequences could have occurred.

‘The throwing of a missile is a very serious offence.'

Ablett, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was also ordered to pay £360, made up of a £250 fine, £85 prosecution costs and a £25 victim surcharge.
