That was a big wake-up call for England but I wouldn’t panic or over-react to a defeat against a very good Ireland team in Dublin. They won’t be the first or last England team to experience that. I would largely stick with this England group and trust that they will learn — and learn quickly — from such a painful defeat.

And make no mistake, this will hurt because England went into the game with high hopes. I predicted England would win by five points based on two simple points, England would dominate at the scrums and England’s discipline would keep the penalty count to single figures — neither remotely happened and the scoreline flattered England in the end.

It’s not a setback on the scale of Cardiff two years ago, nowhere near. England were competitive against what I believe is an Ireland team capable of winning a World Cup but there were some major disappointments and areas which quickly need working on.

The discipline was very poor, especially in the first half when they gave eight of their 13 penalties away and went down the tunnel 9-3 down. In fact, it should have been 12-3 because Jonny Sexton missed a penalty he would usually have popped over.

I’ve said it countless times before but nine is the absolute maximum number of penalties a Test side should be conceding, preferably less. You are always going to be under pressure in Dublin but England compounded that massively yesterday. It revealed that under intense pressure the mental strength is still missing at crucial times.

The decision-making was flawed in a number of key areas. When England were 6-3 down midway through the first half Chris Robshaw opted for the corner when England had won a very kickable penalty. OK, the ref might have indicated that he was thinking about a yellow if Ireland offended again but that was still a huge call when you are playing away to Ireland early in such a big game. You take the points on offer, surely?

It was also important to get George Ford ticking over as a goal-kicker. He had landed a nice dropped goal — and it was great to see that back on the menu — but it would have been good for his confidence to slot over a relatively simple penalty shot. If you do go for the bold option, and I accept that very occasionally it can be an inspired call, you must execute.

That was a very high-risk throw England called to the back of the line-out, where Devin Toner was guarding against just that possibility. England duly got turned over. It felt hugely important at the time and it nagged away at me throughout the game, it was a real momentum changer. These decisions, by the way, are not just a matter of experience, it is more a case of being properly organised and knowing exactly what you want to achieve.

Again, in terms of decision- making, England got it wrong with their use of the bench. Tom Croft and Nick Easter made a decent impact but I would certainly have brought Danny Cipriani on after an hour in place of Luther Burrell. If you are chasing a game, Cipriani is your trump card. If you need two tries in the last 15 minutes the priority is to get your creative players on and also leave the ‘gas’ players like Jonathan Joseph on. You have about only a 20 per cent chance of pulling the game out of the fire anyway, so defence is not your priority. 

Johnny Sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for Ireland's win

Instead at that crucial stage we had Burrell, who wasn’t enjoying one of his best games, and Billy Twelvetrees at centre, which is the England midfield line-up Ireland would have felt most at home defending against. England were not asking enough questions when they finally started to get on top territorially.

Another thing which England must continue to work on is their kicking game and exit strategies, which were again very much second best to Ireland’s.

I have spoken before about this. My preference is for a footballing 12, but if that is not the way England are going they need to ask their full back to step in as an extra 10 more often.

Alex Goode had a very decent, busy game at full back, he was one of England’s best players, but at times he needed to step in and provide an extra kicking option.

Elsewhere, the Ireland half-backs, who are truly world class, were at their best and exerted much more influence than their England counterparts.

George Ford is developing and learning but yesterday was one of those games when I wondered again if it shouldn’t be Cipriani starting and Ford contributing from the bench.

The England scrum was disappointing. I was convinced they would dominate the set-piece but actually Ireland did a fantastic job and you have to give praise to them and especially the veteran Mike Ross who was being written off by some a while back. I’m hoping that’s a one-off because the England scrum has been outstanding prior to this.

With a little more than six months to the World Cup, England have a stack of work to do. There will be no Grand Slam this year and possibly no Championship so, for me, the final two Six Nations games are all about the World Cup now and England need to make those games against Scotland and France count.
