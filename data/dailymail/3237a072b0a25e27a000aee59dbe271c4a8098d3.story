An increase to medical research funding by the Cancer Council means that research into the causes of cancer using vinegar flies can be sped up.

The research looks in to cell growth using the insects, and the findings will later be tested on mice and eventually implemented in human treatment.

According to news.com.au The University of Melbourne is working with teams from the National Institute of Health in America and the Peter MacCallum Centre to examine a gene which plays a key role in allowing the formation of cancers.

Vinegar flies are being used in research which hopes to discover more about a certain gene which can affect cancer growth

The MYC gene has been identified as one which drives cell growth and allows cells to overgrow and cancer to take over if it's turned up too high.

In cancer cells the gene is often too present, and Dr Leonie Quinn told the website vinegar flies are ideal to use to work out of to turn the gene on and off.

They are suitable because they present the same MYC gene as in mice and humans, and understanding the function of the gene could later lead to the development of new cancer drugs.

The MYC gene present in flies are also present in mice and humans and may help researches develop new cancer drugs

'Cell growth is the first step in a cancer taking off in a person. If we can stop that, then thatâ€™s how we are going to save lives,' said Dr Quinn.

The vinegar flies also offer an inexpensive and quick insight into how the gene functions.

This project is one of 11 studies which have been funded by a $3million grant in the form of the Cancer Council's Grants-in-Aid program.

CEO Todd Harper said the grants are all from donors, the website reported.
