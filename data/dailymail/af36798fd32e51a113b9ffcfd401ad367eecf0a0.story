A charity worker drowned in a 3ft deep lake when a policeman and a paramedic were ordered not to try to rescue him.

Simon Burgess, 41, was left to float face down as emergency crews watched.

Health and safety rules stopped them going more than ankle deep into the lake, an inquest was told yesterday.

Tragedy: Simon Burgess, right, feeds the swans at the lake in Gosport, Hampshire, where he drowned a few months after this picture was taken

'Too deep': Emergency services are pictured here just after they recovered the body from the lake. They had refused to get into the water until specialists arrived because it was 'too deep'

According to a doctor, Mr Burgess’s life could have been saved had he been removed from the water quickly.

The constable and the ambulance 
worker   who volunteered to jump into the lake were given strict orders 
not to do so by fire station watch manager Tony Nicholls.

PC Tony Jones arrived at the scene on foot shortly after Mr Burgess fell into the water while feeding swans.

He told the inquest: ‘When I spoke to 
witnesses and found out the body hadn’t been there long I told my 
sergeant I was willing to go into the water.

‘He authorised me to do so and I took off my body armour but Mr Nicholls advised me strongly not to go in.

‘I said I would go in anyway and asked
 if I could borrow his life jacket but he said “No”, but I was going to 
do it regardless. It didn’t sit right with me that no one was going to 
get the body or assist the person in the water.

‘The control room was informed I was going in and they sent a message that under no circumstances could I go in the water.’

Wading out: Following the delay, a pair of firefighters make their way into the centre of the waist-deep lake to attempt to rescue Mr Burgess

Probe: Police cordon off the scene following the tragedy. The inquest heard today there was a 28 minute delay before Mr Burgess was pulled from the water after the first phone call was made

Paramedic Robert Wallace told the 
hearing he also offered to attempt to retrieve the body from the water 
at Walpole Park in Gosport, Hampshire.

‘I’m trained to swim in currents you go white water rafting in, but Mr Nicholls told me he didn’t want my help,’ he said.

Mr Nicholls, who is based at Gosport 
fire station, told the inquest that he understood the body had been in 
the water for five to ten minutes.

‘There were no obvious signs of life so from that I made an assessment it was a body retrieval and not a rescue,’ he said.

‘The officers were trained to go into 
ankle deep water, which is level one, so we waited for level two 
officers, who can go into chest high.

‘One of the police officers told me he
 would like to go in the water and I advised him in the strongest terms 
not to. A paramedic told me he was level two water trained, but when I 
asked him if he had protective equipment he said “No”, so that was the 
end of that.

Delay: Control room manager Deborah Coles, left, took the 999 call from 
Gillian Hughes, right, at 12.17pm - but it was 28 minutes before Mr 
Burgess was pulled from the water

‘I was under immense pressure from the three witnesses to go into the water but I gave them a short answer.

‘The specialist team arrived and three officers went in and removed the body.’

A witness told of her frustration at seeing 999 workers stand and wait.

Although fire crews were sent almost immediately it was 35 minutes before Simon Burgess was recovered from the water.

Registrar Dr Bret Lockyer said if he had been pulled out sooner there was a 'slim chance' he could have been saved.

The timeline on March 10 was as follows:

12.17pm: Gillian Hughes rings the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service control room and speaks to Deborah Coles, the control room manager.

12.18pm: Fire engine, water rescue trained crew and a water support unit are sent. Police, ambulance and coastguard are also dispatched.

12.20pm: Fire crews arrive.

12.25pm: They
 report to their control room a male is floating down in the water. 
Around this time, Gillian Hughes says they refused to go into the water.

12.31pm: The water support unit arrive.

12.46pm: They request that the press officer attends the scene.

12.52pm: Firefighters report to their control room that Simon Burgess is recovered from the water.

12.58pm: He is taken to hospital.

1.42pm: He is formally pronounced dead.

Gillian Hughes said the specialist  
team measured the depth of the water with a pole and even called for a 
press officer before recovering Mr Burgess’s lifeless body. This was 
almost 30 minutes after the earlier teams arrived.

Mrs Hughes, 53, said Mr Burgess fell in while trying to retrieve a plastic bag from the water.

‘He looked like he was swimming and had a smile on his face,’ she said.

‘The next minute he had stopped and 
was lying face down. The firemen arrived with the police and I said 
“He’s only been there five or ten minutes so if you hurry you might save
 him”.

‘He just said “We’re not allowed’ and I
 said “But that’s your job”. Mr Burgess was only 20ft away. I thought 
they would get him straight away.

‘I believe one of the police went in 
to get him but was told he was not allowed. I said to one of the firemen
 “Why don’t you go in?” and he said they couldn’t if the water was 
higher than ankle deep.

‘I said “You’re having a laugh”. He said “No, that’s health and safety”.

‘After the incident I was unable to 
sleep because I kept blaming myself and now I have to live with it.’ 
Hampshire Fire and Rescue control room manager Deborah Coles answered 
Mrs Hughes’s 999 call at 12.17pm on March 10 last year.

She told the inquest that a number of rescue teams, including specialists, were sent immediately.

Brett Lockyer, a registrar of 
histopathology, told the inquest there were signs Mr Burgess had fallen 
into the lake because of an epileptic seizure, following unsuccessful 
brain surgery to ease his condition.

‘If he had been taken out of the water after ten minutes there is a slim chance he could have been resuscitated,’ he said.

‘The seizure would’ve made it look like he was swimming and explains why he had a grin on his face.’

Mr Burgess, from Gosport, was declared dead at hospital.

The hearing, at Portsmouth Coroners’ Court, continues.

Firefighters need to be trained to water rescue level two if they want to save someone from drowning in a three foot deep lake, the inquest heard today.

The rules are set down in the firefighters own health and safety policy document LSO 34.

Under the wording of the rules, rescuers trained to level one can only go into water that is ankle deep - even if someone is in difficulty.

During the two-day level two training session firefighters have to go to lectures, conduct exercises and take part in practical demonstrations.

Although one of the first responders was 'level two' trained he did not have appropriate equipment with him - so Mr Burgess had to be left dying in the water, the inquest was told.

The Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service website sets out the full details of the level two course - as set out below:
