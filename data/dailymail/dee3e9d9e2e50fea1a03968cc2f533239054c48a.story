Shy Keenan is devastated after her 14-year-old son Ayden Olson was found dead at their Colchester home

A leading campaigner against child abuse claims her teenage son was ‘bullied to death’ after he was found dead at their family home.

Ayden Olson, described as a ‘beautiful, kind-hearted’ boy, had apparently killed himself.

His heartbroken mother Shy Keenan, who fights alongside Sara Payne for tougher controls on paedophiles, revealed the news on Twitter. She posted: ‘Shy and Tim’s beloved son Ayden died today age 14 – no further update at this time...’

Repeated pictures of him, with his 
name and dates of birth and death, were used as a backdrop to her site 
with the words ‘bullied to death’ written under each photograph.

Along with the many messages of 
condolence she received, Miss Keenan also posted links to the website of
the charity Bullying UK. Police and paramedics were called early on 
Thursday to the family home near Colchester, where Ayden was declared 
dead.

Stunned pupils and staff at Philip 
Morant School in Colchester, which Ayden’s twin brother Jarrad also 
attends, were told of his death and offered counselling.

Well-wishers posted dozens of tributes to the teenager and messages of support for Miss Keenan.

Mrs Payne, whose eight-year-old 
daughter Sarah was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000, wrote on 
Twitter: ‘ My darling our hearts break with yours,’ and ‘beautiful kind 
hearted boy with a wonderful soul’.

Actress Brooke Kinsella, who has 
campaigned for a clampdown on knife crime after the murder of her 
brother Ben, tweeted: ‘I am so sorry Shy. I don’t know what to say apart
from I am thinking of you and my heart breaks for you XXXX.’ 

School friend Megan Grinham posted: 
‘RIP to the most wonderful boy Ayden. At dancing, he always made us 
laugh. Praying for his family.’

Ayden’s friends condemned bullying in
tributes on Twitter. One, Jessica Manning posted: ‘RIP Ayden’ and 
retweeted a message from Millie Bentley, which said: ‘Maybe now all the 
fowl mouthed [sic] children in lower school will realise that everything
you say to someone will stick with them & impact them.’

A pupil’s mother posted a message to 
Miss Keenan, saying: ‘My daughter was friends with your son and came 
home devastated yesterday. He used to make her laugh every day, xx.’

Yesterday neighbours visited the 
family’s large detached home in Birch, Essex, to pay their respects. 
Miss Keenan, 49, exposed her own stepfather as a child abuser. She was 
repeatedly raped by him from the age of four and sold to gangs of other 
paedophiles for just £15.

Shy Keenan told a Sunday newspaper that she 'couldn't win' against Ayden's bullies

But, after suffering years of torment
which drove her to attempt suicide, she recorded Stanley Claridge 
incriminating himself on a hidden camera.

It led to him being jailed for 15 
years in 2002 for a string of sex attacks on her, other girls and a boy 
dating back to the 1970s.

She has since campaigned to keep 
Britain’s streets safe for children, dedicated herself to helping 
victims of child abuse and spoken out on child protection issues.

In her autobiography, Broken, she 
told how she sometimes almost died from the violence of the sexual abuse
she suffered. As a teenager, she was talked down from a Liverpool tower
block clutching a suicide note.

She went on to launch the sex abuse 
victims’ support group Phoenix Survivors, named after the police 
operation which led to her stepfather’s imprisonment.

She has criticised soft sentences for
child abusers and called for more information about where paedophiles 
live to be available to the public.

A spokesman for Philip Morant School 
and Essex County Council said: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with 
[Ayden’s] family during this difficult time. Ayden was a much-loved, 
talented pupil who bought joy to the school.

A flurry of tributes were sent to the grieving mother, who is a high profile child abuse campaigner, and posted a picture of him on her Twitter page

‘The school community is incredibly 
saddened by his loss and we ask that people respect the privacy of his 
family and friends during these devastating circumstances.

‘Essex County Council is working with
the school to provide counselling to students and staff. We would urge 
any student who feels overwhelmed, confused or upset to talk to someone 
about their feelings and seek support.

‘It is a statutory requirement for 
all schools to have an anti-bullying policy and pupils are aware of 
where they can go for support and advice.

‘If any pupil is being bullied, or is
aware of bullying taking place, we would urge them to tell a friend, 
trusted adult or family member so that appropriate action can be 
taken.’ 

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed 
that the teenager’s death was not being treated as suspicious. The 
coroner has been informed.
