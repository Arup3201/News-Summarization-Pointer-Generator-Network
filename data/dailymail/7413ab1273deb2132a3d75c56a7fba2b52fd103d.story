A 17-year-old  girl shot dead her stepfather, fatally stabbed her mother and locked her three younger sisters in a room with some food before fleeing the state with her boyfriend, police said on Tuesday.

Ashlee Martinson allegedly gunned down her stepfather, Thomas Ayers, in an upstairs room of their Wisconsin home on Sunday morning while her mother, Jennifer Ayers, was in the living room below.

Mrs Ayers, 40, who is thought to have been with Martinson's two stepsisters, aged nine and eight, and her two-year-old half-sister at the time, reportedly ran upstairs as soon as she heard gunshots.

She was followed by the eldest of Martinson's three siblings. The young girl then witnessed her older sister and her mother fighting, which resulted in the latter being stabbed to death, officials said.

Following the killings, Martinson reportedly told her siblings they were going to play a game. She locked the terrified girls in a room and tied the door shut so they could not leave, it is alleged.

Her nine-year-old sister later told police that Martinson - who had described similar murder scenes in a blog she wrote under the pseudonym Vampchick -  had placed food and juice in the room.

The suspect then fled Wisconsin with her 22-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Sisco, it is alleged. Police arrived at her family's home in Piehl, Rhinelander, after receiving a 911 call at around 10.40am.

Once there, they discovered the bodies of Mr Ayer, 37, and his wife. Both were declared dead at the scene in the 1600 block of County Highway C south. Officials then found the three 'imprisoned' girls. 

Police subsequently launched a manhunt for Martinson and Sisco, whom they believed had left the state. The pair were arrested in Boone County, Indiana, 500 miles away, at around 7:50pm Sunday.

Now, Martinson has been charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, as well as three counts of false imprisonment, for allegedly killing her parents and imprisoning her sisters.

She and Sisco - who is reportedly not currently wanted in connection with the homicides - remained in the Boone County Jail on Tuesday morning. They are both facing extradition proceedings.

During an interview with police, the nine-year-old girl apparently told officers that her sister had killed their parents. She said she had heard two gunshots while Martinson and her father were upstairs.

Investigators have not released a possible motive for the slayings. Following her arrest, Martinson was evaluated at a hospital for several injuries, possibly acquired during her 'fight' with her mother. 

None of her three siblings were injured in the homicide. It is believed that one of the girls was the 911 caller who alerted authorities to the alleged attack. However, this has not been confirmed.

The youngest of the three girls was the Ayers' biological child. The other two were Mr Ayers's  from a previous relationship, the victim's sister, Barbara Curtis, told the Mulwaukee Journal Sentinel.

In Martinson's Vampchick posts, written on a blog titled Nightmare, the teenager posted short stories and poems about graphic murders, autopsies, suicides, Hell and the Devil, and even cannibalism.

She also posted chilling images of flayed skulls, demons and characters such as the Slender Man.

In one poem, called Insanity Love, the teenager wrote: 'They say one of us is to blame, You’re holding that knife, covered in blood, I’m laughing off the pain, Wondering which one of us is guilty, If we’re both totally insane?' And only last week, she spoke of murder in a short story, titled Unworthy.

Love and murder: These pictures show extracts from two of Martinson's poems on her Nightmare blog

In it, she wrote: 'Rushing through the woods late at night. Deep into the darkest corner where the agonizing screams can not be heard. Walking into a small cabin. Marveling at the sweet horrors of blood that I thirst for. I then take the next victim who is unconscious. I tightly bind them to a low table.

'Awaiting them to wake once more. I clean the dry blood off my tools from a previous session. The last body has been disposed of just hours before, yet I have not been satisfied with the pain, agony and blood. I bend down as they start to wake. "Welcome to hell." I whisper in her ear.'

One particularly disturbing image on the blog is a drawing of a monster, which Martison has named 'The Beast Within'. The teenager wrote: 'The beast is a fearful creature that lives within us all, and if you’re not careful, the beast will consume you whole, leaving you alone in your own miserable hell.'

Mr and Mrs Ayers had been married for around a year when they were  killed on Sunday, according to Ms Curtis. A future court date for Martinson has not yet been arranged, WSAW reported.

Below are several quotes from her poems and stories from Martinson's Nightmare blog:

'They say one of us is to blame, You’re holding that knife, covered in blood, I’m laughing off the pain, Wondering which one of us is guilty, If we’re both totally insane?, Could it be we’re broken in just all the right places?' (Infinity Love, January 2015)

One look, one look is all it took, For obsession to begin, Making you want to kill yourself, To him, killing is no sin, Brutally snatches mortals at night, They scream, they flail, But he takes off in flight, To him you can’t be faithful, He is a fallen angel.' (Angels In The Mirrors, January 2015)

'Bloodstains in my fingerprints, Screams inside my head, Memories of imagination, I’m dancing with the dead, Whispers in the shadows, Death waits upon the eve, I’ve come to love the darkness, The night is when I feed.' (My Shadow, January 2015) 

'I’m sitting in this empty room all alone, I can hear nothing, but their screaming souls, Souls of madness but, not like me, I can see their innocence, Unlike the monster I am, That no one can see, And what I have become, What I have done to some, Someone like me, That no one can see, A psychopath in the dark, My mind is full of twisted things, But my eyes are full of sparkles, Hoping that these walls will fall apart, So that my killing can start.' (Murder Maddness, January 2015)

'Rushing through the woods late at night. Deep into the darkest corner where the agonizing screams can not be heard. Walking into a small cabin. Marveling at the sweet horrors of blood that I thirst for. I then take the next victim who is unconscious. I tightly bind them to a low table.' (Unworthy, March 2015)  

'I need to hurt somebody. Make someone feel how I do. The river is beautiful, my gun is loaded, my tools are cleaned, and my toy is all tied up and ready. She looks at me in fear, she can’t very well scream with the gag in her mouth. So I take it out, I want to hear how she asks. "What did I ever do to you? Why me?” She looks at me terrified as I take out my first tool, just an ordinary pair of scissors.' (My First, January 2015)
