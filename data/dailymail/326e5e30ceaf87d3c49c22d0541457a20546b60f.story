A Toronto man was bitten on the head by a 400lb black bear - and survived.

Joe Azougar, 30, was having breakfast on the porch of his cabin at about 10am on Saturday when a bear suddenly charged at him.

'I could hear this thud, this vibration on the ground. Then there was this bear coming towards me,' Mr Azougar, who had recently moved to the remote cabin from Toronto, said.

Azougar needed more than 300 stitches to his scalp and shoulder after being attacked. His dog was killed

As the internet entrepreneur ran for cover, his faithful German Shepherd dog ran at the bear.

After the bear killed his dog, it charged at the cabin about 10 miles outside of Cochrane, Canada, which Mr Azougar moved about a month ago.

'He started rushing the window, breaking the window and chipping off wood beside the window,' Mr Azougar said.

Mr Azougar fled the cabin, but the bear followed.

'He knocked me down and I covered my head. He took my shoulder apart, then he peeled the skin off my head and started biting my skull,' Mr Azougar said.

"I could feel his teeth rubbing against my skull ... I was just screaming. I could feel my flesh being pulled by his teeth,' he told The Sudbury Star.

Thankfully, two women driving near his cabin heard Mr Azougar's screams.

Relief: Joe Azougar is comforted by his girlfriend Brooke Bowerman as he recovers from the savage attack

They used the car horn to scare the bear away, before driving Mr Azougar to the Lady Minto Hospital in Cochrane.

The businessman, who moved to the remote Ontario region to start his own internet company, needed more than 300 stitches and will be kept in hospital for several days.

When the women, who have not been identified, first arrived at the cabin they could only see the bear.

The woman have not been identified but Mr Azougar is keen to thank them.

'They are my angels. Without them, I wouldn't be alive,' he said.

'If it wasn’t for them, my family would be attending my funeral,' he told CTV News.

Mr Azougar is being comforted at the hospital by his girlfriend, Brooke Bowerman,and mother, Itto Bentayed, who drove from Toronto to be at his bedside.

Ontario Provincial Police and the Ministry of Natural Resources killed the bear after the attack was reported.

In a study of bear attacks between 1900 and 2009 it was found that most happened in Canada.

'From a public safety standpoint, black bears are an unpredictable, wild animal," John Kaplanis, of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance, told The Globe and Mail.

Bear aware: Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears like the 400lb one that attacked Mr Azougar

'They're not the cuddly little teddy bears we see on television.'

Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears, but its Ministry of Natural Resources has resisted calls for the spring bear hunting season to be reinstated.

Hikers and residents are offered advice on how to be 'bear aware' to prevent attacks and what to do if they come face-to-face with a bear.
