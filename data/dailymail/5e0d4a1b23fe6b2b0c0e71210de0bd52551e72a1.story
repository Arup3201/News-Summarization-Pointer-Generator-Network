Traumatised: Michelle Goodhall, 35, who has just 12 months to live, was targeted by teenage home-raiders twice in three days

A terminally-ill mother has been targeted twice in three days by teenage burglars - who stole £7,000 cash she had been saving to pay for her funeral.  

Michelle Goodhall, 35, was left traumatised after the two boys stormed into her home and took the money, which was hidden in her bedroom.

Less than 48 hours later, the thugs broke into the property again, slamming Mrs Goodall's head against a wall during the raid before fleeing when she called for her daughter Laura, 14, who was upstairs.

The wheelchair-bound mother-of-two, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, has just 12 months left to live as her respiratory system is shutting down.

She was given the dire prognosis six months ago after an unsuccessful double lung transplant to treat her emphysema. 

On hearing the the news from doctors, she decided she would keep some money away so that she could be given a proper send-off. 

She said: 'My husband John had just popped out to pick up a takeaway and I thought it was my daughter and a friend. 

'Suddenly I heard this tremendous crashing and banging.

'I was scared it was a burglar and I heard them come back down and head to the kitchen, then I heard plates being smashed on the floor. 

'I was terrified as I was home alone. 

'Later we found out that £7,000 we've saved for my funeral was taken - I haven't got longer than 12 months.'

Her husband John said that since his wife's operation went wrong - her airways have been slowly shutting down - leaving her almost entirely wheelchair-bound and in need of an oxygen supply.

Mr Goodall, 61, who is her full-time carer, added: 'On Thursday night I went out to pick some food up from a local takaway. 

'Michelle had been in the toilet under the stairs when she heard people come in. She heard banging before they came downstairs and threw plates and a bowl of fruit in the kitchen before leaving. 

'They were in and out within a few minutes but it was a terrifying ordeal. She rang me and my daughter and we alerted the police straight away.

'I later noticed that a case I kept on top of my wardrobe in our room had been opened and the cash we kept inside was gone. 

'We were saving it for future arrangements - Michelle has just 12 months to live and has to be on oxygen when we go out.' 

A camcorder was also taken in the raid on the Goodhalls' family home. 

The couple, who also have a daughter called Nicola, 16, were still recovering from the shock of the first break-in when they were targeted again by the two teenagers on Saturday morning. 

Mrs Gooddall said they grabbed her head and slammed it against the wall before leaving empty- handed.

Her husband added: 'We couldn't say if it was the same people, but if it was I presume they were returning to take more of our possessions. 

'It all happened so quickly but she was left shocked and terrified.' 

The thieves have been described as male and wearing black hooded-tops. The first was described as 16-17 years, of chubby build and wearing black tracksuit bottoms and white trainers. 

The second was described as 14, slim and wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and white trainers. 

Detective Sergeant Paul Keitch, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is clearly concerning that this vulnerable woman's home has been targeted twice in a short period of time, with the intruders in this latest incident also using violence against her. 

'Thankfully she was not seriously hurt but nonetheless this was a frightening experience for her and it is vitally important that we identify those involved. 

'We are supporting the victim and her family, which includes advising on how the property can be made more secure. 

'Additional patrols are also being put in place to provide reassurance and deter any further offending.' 

Anyone who knows anyone about the two attacks is urged to contact the force.
