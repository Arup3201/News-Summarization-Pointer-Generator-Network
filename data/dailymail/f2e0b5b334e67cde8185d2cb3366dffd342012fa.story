The Equatorial Guinea football federation has been fined £65,573 and ordered to pay for the treatment of Ghana supporters who were injured by flying missiles during Thursday's African Nations Cup semi-final at the Estadio de Malabo.

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) imposed the punishment on Friday, and announced a one-match suspended ground closure on Equatorial Guinea, the tournament hosts who lost the semi-final 3-0.

The ground closure will only be enforced should there be further trouble during Saturday's third-place play-off match between Equatorial Guinea and DR Congo, which also takes place at the Malabo stadium.

Announcing the sanctions on its website, CAF said 36 Ghana supporters were hurt after coming under attack from home supporters, with 14 taken to hospital. It said one of those hospitalised was under close observation. 

CAF said in a statement: 'The disciplinary committee of CAF has examined the reports from officials following the incidents which occurred in match 30 of the African Nations Cup, between Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.'

Outlining its punishments, it said: 'The disciplinary committee decides:

'To demand from Equatorial Guinea to take charge of the cost of treating all the injured people from the match in question.

'To impose on the Equatorial Guinea federation a fine of 100,000 US dollars for the aggressive and recidivist behaviour of its supporters.

'To force Equatorial Guinea to play its next match behind closed doors. However, to promote the spirit of Fair Play and friendship during the 2015 African Nations Cup, the committee has decided to suspend the closed doors match on the condition that supporters are not guilty of such an infraction in the third-place match.

'In the event that identical incidents occur in the third-place match on February 7, the disciplinary committee of the CAF will automatically impose the behind-closed-doors sanction on the Equatorial Guinea team who will have to play their next official international match without spectators.'

Equatorial Guinea may have had a lighter punishment had their supporters behaved until Thursday's incident, but the CAF pointed out it was a third offence, after trouble involving the home fans in previous tournament games against Gabon and Tunisia.
