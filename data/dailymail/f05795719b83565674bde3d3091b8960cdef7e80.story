An international day of action
on climate change brought tens of thousands onto the streets of
New York on Sunday, with organizers predicting the biggest
protest on the issue for five years.

Some 100,000 people, including United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, New York City Mayor Bill de
Blasio and U.S. senators were expected to join the People's
Climate March in midtown Manhattan, ahead of Tuesday's United
Nations hosted summit in the city to discuss reducing carbon
emissions that threaten the environment.

Organizers said some 550 busloads had arrived for the rally,
which followed similar events in 166 countries including
Britain, France, Afghanistan and Bulgaria.

in Copenhagen in a sometime raucous demonstration that resulted
in the detention of 2,000 protesters.

De Blasio on Sunday unveiled a new plan for the city to
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005
levels by 2050.

All 3,000 major city-owned buildings would be retrofitted
with energy saving heating, cooling and light systems by then,
he said, though meeting the commitment will also require
significant investments by private landlords.

'Climate change is an existential threat to New Yorkers and
our planet,' de Blasio said. 'Acting now is nothing short of a
moral imperative.'

Protests were also taking place in 
Brussels, Belgium; New Delhi, India; Istanbul, Turkey; and Sydney and 
Melbourne, Australia.
