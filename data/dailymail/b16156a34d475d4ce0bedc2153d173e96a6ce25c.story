A payday loans firm sent more than 1,000 text messages demanding cash to a heavily indebted customer  after he had killed himself, it emerged today.

Ian Jordan, 60, of Botley, Hampshire, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms over a year before he committed suicide.

In one case he was being charged more than 5,000 per cent a year in interest for the cash he had borrowed.

His daughter, Samantha Carr, and her family have now posted a video online in memory of him, which includes a heartfelt call on the Government to clamp down on payday loan firms. 

She said: 'Ian received 1,000 texts after his death. Some of them were demands for money. They pursued the family too.'

Relatives were so tormented by the aggressive texts, they ripped the SIM card out of Ian's phone to make them stop.

Suicide: Ian Jordan, 60, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms

The video features photos from Mr Jordan's life cut alongside the heartbreaking story of the events which led to his death.

The poignant messages read: 'My daddy's rubbish at maths. That's why he trusted those payday loan companies. But soon he was really worried and embarrassed.

'He didn't talk to anybody about his debts, but I wish he had, because then I wouldn't have to go to his funeral two weeks before Christmas.'

It ends with a call on the Prime Minister to tackle the companies which the family say brought about Mr Jordan's early death.

The video concludes: 'Get rid of these stupid high interest rates Mr Cameron... now. So that no other person feels alone and desperate like my daddy.'

Football fan and darts player Mr Jordan was found dead at his £130,000 semi-detached home one week after he was last seen. The alarm was raised by his doctor when he missed several appointments.

He had written a note on his laptop which officers found when they entered his home. And today his family urged the authorities to do more to halt the number of people falling into the debt trap.

Mr Jordan had been unemployed for years due to poor health and suffered with a hiatus hernia. He was then taken off Jobseeker's Allowance but the loan firms still continued to take the cash.

Ms Carr told the Daily Mirror that the firms sent him more than 1,000 text messages after his death, demanding repayments be made. 

After hearing how Mr Jordan had overdosed on prescription drugs, Grahame Short, Coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, recorded a verdict of suicide last week. 

Mr Short said: ‘The note makes it clear that he wanted to end his life. I was not aware of the level of his debt until today.’

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Carr said: ‘He was borrowing money to pay off debts [which was] to pay off debts.

'The interest rate is one thing, the fact that you have already got this debt was another. It just spiralled out of control.'

Ms Carr added: 'They were just taking it out of his bank account. He had no money in the last few days of his life.’

Paying tribute to her father, Ms Carr described him as the ‘life and soul of the party’.

But she said that her father’s tragic case showed how vital it was to clamp down on payday firms, adding: ‘Why do they still lend money to people when you have got debt? My main concern is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.’ 

The inquest came as the Financial Conduct Authority revealed plans for a cap on the amount that payday lenders can charge their customers.

It said rates should be capped at 0.8 per cent a day and added that no one will have to pay more than twice what they borrowed.
