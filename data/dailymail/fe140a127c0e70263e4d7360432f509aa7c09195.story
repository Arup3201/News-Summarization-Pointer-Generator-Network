Aspirations: Steven Grisales, who wanted to study architecture, was stabbed to death in Edmonton

An aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a teenage gang after he asked them to stop throwing conkers at him.

Steven Grisales, 21, was due to start a course this month as part of a Westminster College scholarship.

He was walking to a station in Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked.

Youths threw conkers at Mr Grisales and when he stood up to them, one produced a knife.

He was stabbed in the chest in the attack on Wednesday evening and died the following day.

Steven had moved from London to Argentina to live with his father, but came back to London in July this year to start the three-year architecture course.

A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder and has appeared in court, while another boy, also 15, has been questioned.

A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl have already been arrested and released on bail.

Speaking from the scene, Steven's mother Jasmid wept as her husband Andres told of their heartbreak.

Mr Grisales said his son was a 'great boy' whose brothers and sisters were 'devastated' by his death.

The couple appeared near the murder scene in College Close to pay tribute to their eldest child and appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Mr Grisales, who was in Argentina on business when his son was killed, said Steven had been visiting his grandmother and shopping for her before he was attacked.

He added: 'It is devastating for all of us, the whole family, aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles, back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at 
the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station.Â 

'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.'

Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male.

A local resident heard Mr Grisales' screams and ran outside to try and help.

Mary Stokes, 27, told the Enfield Independent: 'I was in the house and heard shouting, as I walked out he was holding his chest.

'I
tried to speak to him but he wasn't saying much. We tried to help him 
but there was not much we could do, he had been stabbed in the heart.'

Floral tributes were left on College Close, near to the murder scene.

The Enfield Independent reported a friend named Courtney left a message 
which read: 'I can't say how much I miss you, I wish you didn't have to 
go.
You will always be in our hearts. Gone but never forgotten.'

Another, from Marie, said: 'A young man with a smile like sunshine, it could light up a room.'

A post-mortem examination revealed cause of death to be a single stab wound to the heart.

Detectives believe up to three young black males, possibly in their late teens or early 20s, attacked Mr Grisales.

Officers said the incident was not gang-related and the young man did not know his attackers.

Detective
Inspector Richard Beadle, of Scotland Yard's murder command, said: 'I 
urge anyone with any information about this incident, or anyone that 
witnessed it, to come forward.

'It happened in a busy residential area and we know there would have been a number of people in the area at the time of the attack.

'I would ask those people to please come forward and assist us with our inquiries.'

Witnesses are urged to call the incident room on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
