Police have launched a bigamy investigation over claims a married businessman had a second family living in Thailand.

Peter Leonard, 54, vigorously denied the claims as Facebook photos emerged of him with a woman calling herself Jaija Leonard.

The businessman, who shares a £400,000 home in rural Bedfordshire with Fiona Leonard, 49, told The Sun he was not married in Thailand and said it was a case of 'a businessman with a girlfriend and baby, pure and simple.'

He told the newspaper: 'I've been assisting police with their enquiries in order to quash these vicious, vile and untrue rumours that I am a bigamist, which I am not. I'm not married in Thailand.'

When asked how his English wife felt about the situation, he said 'as long as she's looked after, I don't think she cares', The Sun reported.

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A complaint has been received of bigamy.

'One person came into the police station voluntarily. They have not been arrested at this stage and enquiries are ongoing.'

Mr Leonard reportedly met his wife while working at a country club, but started dating former air stewardess Jaija seven years ago and had a daughter with her.

Photos on the Facebook profile of 
Jaija, believed to be in her 20s, include shots of her walking on the 
beach and blowing out candles on a cake with a young girl.

Meanwhile Mr Leonard and Fiona - who he reportedly married in 1984 - bought their detached home in a rural Bedfordshire village last July, according to Land Registry records.

A man who answered the door yesterday said no one was available to comment.

Having more than one husband or wife is illegal in the UK, but prosecutions are rare.

Between 1998 and 2009, police in England and Wales investigated almost 1,000 bigamy cases but just 200 people were convicted by the courts.

Last week a couple who met online were spared jail for bigamy - after both of them failed to reveal they were already married.

Former
 police officer Caroline Baker, 43, met 47-year-old factory worker David
 Bradley through an internet dating site in July 2012.

They fell into a whirlwind romance and decided to wed at a register office, where both declared they were single. But the marriage fell apart when Baker found documents referring to her new husband's previous life.

Baker, of Brandon, County Durham, said she had been divorced as far as she was concerned but not received the right paperwork.

She and Bradley, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to bigamy and perjury. Each were handed a suspended prison term and ordered to pay £380 in costs and charges.
