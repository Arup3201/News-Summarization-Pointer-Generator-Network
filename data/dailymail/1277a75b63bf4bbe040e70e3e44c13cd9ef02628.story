Top secret: The British Spy Manual was a compulsory read for members of the Special Operations Executive

From the cyanide cigarette to the deadly briefcase, the gadgets that Q presents James Bond with in each of the spy films are crucial to his operations.

But according to a real-life spy manual, World War Two agents were using gadgets and devices which would give Bond a run for his money.

The British Spy Manual – read and memorised by agents in 1944 and 1945 - reveals the secrets of how explosive rats, microfilm coded stilettos and exploding bottles of Chianti were all used to defeat the enemy.

Members of the Special Operations Executive (SEO) could choose from explosives hidden in fruit, wine bottles, coal, handbags and even rats, according to The Sunday Times.

Disguises were also extensive and included make-up, customised women’s clothing studied for accuracy from periodicals, and an early spray-tan that ‘sprayed through a glass nozzle will…produce a brown stain that would last approximately three days in Far East Climates’.

In the ‘permanent removal’ section the manual also boasts how tattoo removal and dental work was available to SOE agents and that ‘an eminent plastic surgeon and his staff are at our disposal’.

Collar-studs, buttons and high-heels could be tailored to carry codes or microfilm, and radio equipment was hidden in bundles of kindling, gramophone players and German clocks.

In the introduction to The British Spy Manual, published later this month, Sinclair McKay writes: ‘In the Bond films the visits to the gadget laboratory was always a moment of light relief.

Covert communications: One technique that was used by British spies was the camouflaged wireless radio, hidden among a bundle of kindling (as seen above) 

The idea for the 'exploding rat' was first developed in 1941. 

The objective was to blow up the enemy's boilers by lying the dead rat near German boiler rooms.

Enemy soldiers were expected to shovel the carcass into the flames to avoid disease - the the hidden bomb's fuse would then be lit.

But they were never used, as the first consignment was seized by the Germans, blowing the secret. 

‘Yet in the real world of the SOE, the ingenious contraptions were deadly serious. 

'These were not toys, but super-serious means of helping to ensure survival.’ 

The SOE was created in 1940 on the order of Winston Churchill and kept secret from parliament, and by the end of the Second World War it had led to the destruction of Hitler’s nuclear programme and the capturing of Nazis.

The real life equivalent of Q, the head of the fictional Q development Branch in the James Bond films, was Charles Bovill, who also played a key role in the creation and employment of Eureka and the S-phone radio equipment for communications between SOE agents and troops on the ground.

Exploding rat: One suggested technique for enhancing explosive capabilities was to hide a bomb in a rat carcass - the idea was that German soldiers would burn the rodent in their boiler rooms causing an explosion 

Real life Q: Charles Bovill, who died in 2001 aged 90, was responsible for inventing many devices used by British spies
