The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a  propaganda film, leading to speculation that she has been purged - or even executed.

Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is the widow of Jang Song-taek, who was recently executed, and while it was believed she would always remain 'safe' under her nephew's brutal regime, analysts say that her disappearance from the documentary is ominous.

Ms Kim was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until January this year, when her last public appearance was in the documentary shown on North Korean Central TV.

In that footage, aired in January, she was seen walking with the leader and his wife towards the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in the capital, Pyongyang, to pay tribute to the embalmed bodies of former leaders Kil Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.

Ms Kim's safety from purging or execution had always been assumed because she is the daughter of North Korean founder Kim Il-sun and the sister of the late leader, Kim Jong-il.

Her role in recent times has been as Secretary for Organization of the Workers' Party of Korea.

While she has been frequently seen close to Kim Jong-un at a number of public events, her apparent deliberate disappearance from a run-run of the original documentary suggests to observers that she might never be seen again.

South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which has good sources among North Korean watchers, reported that since the original screening featuring Ms Kim, a re-run shown on Tuesday depicts a scene in which only Kim Jong-un, his wife, and male military officials are visible.

'It seems that Kim Kyong-hui stepped down from major positions in the party, but we need additional verification to see whether she was ousted,' the paper quoted a Unification Ministry in Seoul as saying.

Ms Kim was seen 'in the flesh' at a public concert in September last year and, while her name was later among top officials at a committee organizing the state funeral of a senior Workers' Party official, she did not make an appearance.

That led to rumors that she had died or was seriously ill, but then she appeared in the first showing of the TV documentary in January.

Despite her perceived protection as a direct descendant of nation founder Kim Il-sung, Ms Kim is still associated with a husband who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed in December.

After his execution, direct family members were said to have been shot dead and other relatives were sentenced to labor camps.

Among those killed, reportedly on Kim Jong-un's orders, were North Korea's ambassadors to Cuba and Malaysia.

The apparent 'disappearance' of Miss Kim has led to speculation that her place in high positions in the Workers' Party has been taken by Kim Jong-un's younger sister, Yo-jong.
