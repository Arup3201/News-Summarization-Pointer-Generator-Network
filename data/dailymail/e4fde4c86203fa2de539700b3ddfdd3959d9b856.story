The 'Rice Portrait': Exciting new evidence suggests the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author

A portrait of a pretty 13-year-old girl claimed to be Jane Austen has divided art experts for years.

But exciting new evidence has now emerged that the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author, on a visit to Kent in 1789.

An analysis of the oil painting using digital photographic tools has revealed writing that seems to back up the case for it being a genuine likeness of the 19th century novelist.

No other professional portrait of the writer has ever been verified - with only two artworks drawn by amateur hands confirmed as having been produced from life.

But now, analysts have discovered the name Jane Austen in the top-right corner of a 
reproduction of a photograph of the portrait of the teenager, taken before the painting 
was restored, according to The Guardian.

Beside it, in
 two places, is the name Ozias Humphry. Mr Humphry was an established portrait painter of 
the period, a member of the Royal Academy and a friend of several popular artists of the day, including Gainsborough and Romney.

The words have been digitally enhanced usingÂ 
methods that were independently 
validated by Stephen Cole of Acume Forensics in 
Leeds, who has spent more than 20 years analysing photographic evidence 
in criminal cases.

Of the two verified amateur artworks, one is a watercolour and pencil sketch by Miss Austen's sister Cassandra, said to make the young woman look a little cross.

The other is an 'idealised' portrait used as the frontispiece to the Austen memoir written by her nephew in 1870.

Art critic Angus Stewart, a former 
curator of an exhibition dedicated to the author, said: 'To have all these words revealed on the canvas is 
very, very strong.

'I think you'd be flying in the face of reason to deny
 this.'

There have been various other claims to have found likenesses of the author taken before her death in 1817 aged 41, but all have been the subject of furious dispute.

In December, Austen biographer Dr Paula Byrne claimed in BBC documentary Jane Austen: The Unseen Portrait? that she had found a sketch at auction that was the much-loved author, but she has not yet proved her case to universal satisfaction.

The painting of the young girl is owned by the Rice family, direct descendants of one of Jane's brothers.

It came to light in the late 19th century and the family say it was composed while the Austens were visiting Jane's great uncle Francis in Kent in 1789, when the girl was 13.

According to the recorded family history, having commissioned the portrait Francis kept it in Sevenoaks with the rest of his family collection.

It was then given by his grandson, Colonel Thomas Austen, to a close friend as a wedding present, the year after the author died in 1817, because the bride was reported to be a keen admirer of Austen's books.

But since the, art experts, led by the National Portrait Gallery, have raised objections - mainly that the style of the girl's dress and the general composition date the painting to after 1800, when Jane would have been in her 20s.

But the new evidence could contradict that view. Artist Mr Humphry went blind in 1797 and stopped painting. The photo even seems to reveal the date 1789.

The writing could have been put on the canvas by Mr Humphry himself or a later owner. But as the painting was believed to be by a more prestigious artist, Johann Zoffany, experts believe the words must have been put there during or shortly after Jane's lifetime.

Professor Claudia Johnson of Princeton University said: 'Whether Humphry's name was signed by himself in the 18th century and/or by some other hand later, the attribution must be contemporaneous with Austen's lifetime or by people who knew Austen when she was alive.'

If the portrait is confirmed as being Austen, it may be an embarrassment to the National Portrait Gallery, which granted the picture a licence for sale abroad on the basis that it could not be the writer.

The gallery chose not to comment.
