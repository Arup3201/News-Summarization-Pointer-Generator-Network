A school is having food delivered by taxi to comply with Nick Clegg's free meals policy.

Under the £1billion Coalition scheme introduced last month, all pupils aged four to seven must be given lunch.

Lacking adequate facilities, Sheepscombe Primary is paying a driver to bring in cold meals such as bagels from a nearby secondary.

Sara Bennion, headmistress of the 33-pupil school near Stroud in Gloucestershire, said: 'We have tried lots and lots of ways to provide the hot meals. It has become quite problematic because obviously we want to be working towards hot food.'

She said the meals policy was proving a strain on the school's finances. The Government provides £2.30 per child for a daily hot meal but Sheepscombe must pay £2.95 for the cold meal option – not including the £15 a day taxi charge.

The school is making up the deficit with cash from the Small Schools Transitional Funding pot. Other schools have been reported ordering takeaway pizzas, giving pupils fruit and biscuits until late food arrives, shipping sandwiches in from pubs and seating children in classrooms and music rooms.

Miss Bennion said: 'It is a great initiative but the kinks haven't been ironed out. We're hoping that negotiations with the local authority can help us find a solution.'

The Liberal Democrat policy means 1.9million children can now access a free meal in reception, year one and year two.

David Laws, who is the party's schools minister, has already declared the scheme a 'massive success'.

Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg says giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons.

But critics dispute these benefits and say many schools are struggling to cope. In August, the Local Government Association revealed that councils are being forced to raid other funds because they have been left more than £25million out of pocket.

Last month, it emerged that children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each at a school in Birmingham. They were rationed according to their age. The city council said it was investigating the incident at the unnamed school.

The Government expects pupils to be routinely offered a hot meal option. Schools not in a position to do this straight away should be working towards it 'as soon as possible'.

Mr Laws yesterday denied the policy had been implemented too quickly.
