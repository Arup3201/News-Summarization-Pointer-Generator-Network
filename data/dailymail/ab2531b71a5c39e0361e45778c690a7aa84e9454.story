Pompeii has been brought back to life only to be destroyed again in a £60million epic film focussing on the last hours of the ancient Roman city.

Director Paul WS Anderson toiled to make a historically accurate replica of the settlement for his recreation of the 79 A.D. Mount Vesuvius eruption which killed thousands, and buried Pompeii under layers of volcanic ash.

The British filmmaker, 49, also studied volcanic eruptions and other disasters, including tsunamis, to ensure his new film, Pompeii - starring Keifer Sutherland and Game Of Thrones star Kit Harington - was a faithful rendering of the city's final hours.

Accurate: Film director Paul WS Anderson hired a team of craftsmen to recreate Pompeii, only to destroy it again in his £60 million movie

Recreation: The filmaker used historical documents and archeological evidence as well as the latest scientific knowledge to inform his disaster movie

Inspiration: The director said he was particularly proud to have included a tsunami as part of the film as this was documented in an account of the disaster by Pliny

Under the instructions of Mr Anderson, with the help of an advising Roman historical expert, craftsmen faithfully recreated the city - right down to the details of the mosaics, wall paintings and hand-shaped cobblestones.

Time was also taken to ensure that loaves of bread eaten by the characters were just like those preserved among the ruined city by the ash, and a fish stall in the film only sold the types eaten at the time of the eruption.

Mr Anderson also hired a volcanologist to help with the film, studying active volcanoes and more recent natural disasters such as tsunamito ensure that his vision was not only entertaining, but also accurate.

According to historical records, including an account by Pliny The Younger written 25 years after the event, Pompeii was not only subjected to the volcano but also an earthquake and a tsunami.

Ruins: The ancient city of Pompeii as it looks today. Two-thirds of the 165-acre settlement has been uncovered by archaeologists

Findings: More than 1,000 casts made from impressions left by bodies as they were coated by ash have been recovered, giving historians a glimpse into life in Pompeii, and how the victims met their deaths

Pliny, who provided the first known account of the disaster, having seen the eruption from a distance, had described water being drawn out of the Bay of Naples, and Mr Anderson said this had led him to include the tidal wave in his film.

'I think what really fascinated me is that Pompeii was the greatest historical disaster of the ancient world and it had never really been put on a film correctly,' the director told I Am Rogue.

'There were three threats that hit Pompeii. There was the earthquake, the tsunami and then the pyroclastic surge when the volcano blew its top and Pompeii was buried for almost 2,00 years. I wanted to tell the true story of the disaster, a spectacular story.

'The fictitious part of the story is about the characters. But many of the characters are based on plaster casts of the people who were left. One of the most famous images is the two entwined lovers. I was facinated by that.'

Precise: Filmmakers used laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago

He
 said that new computer technology, as well as his research, has enabled him to bring an authenticity to the disaster that 
was not possible for earlier directors.

Despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that Pompeii will be wiped out, Mr Anderson said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing.

The director, who was born in Wallsend, Tyneside, the home of the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall, said some characters survived the disaster despite the widespread destruction.

When the volcano erupted, a cloud of ash and stones was thrown into the air, some 20 miles high, as well as molten rock and pumice spewed out over the course of two days.

It is thought the blast released one hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and an estimated 16,000 people were killed.

More than 1,000 casts made from impressions left by bodies as they were coated by ash have been recovered, giving historians a glimpse into life in Pompeii, and how the victims met their deaths - including the 'lovers' who inspired Mr Anderson. 

'A lot of what you see is real.
 The actors are in there with the flames and ash. Unpleasant for them, 
but very realistic,' he told The Observer.

Mr Anderson, who is married to model and actress Milla Jovovich, said that one thing he was particularly proud of was the inclusion of the tsunami as part of the disaster as this had been documented in the ancient texts.

Lovers: One of the inspiration behind the film was a pair of casts left by the bodies of two entwined lovers

Performance: Actor Kiefer Sutherland stars in the historical epic which is a joint UK Canadian production

Doomed: Despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that Pompeii will be wiped out, Mr Anderson said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing

Rising star: The film also features Kit Harington, pictured, who plays Jon Snow in Game of Thrones

His team spent six years researching the doomed city, using laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago.

Mr Anderson said that he also wanted to show how sophisticated life in Pompeii had been prior to the explosion, pointing to the fact that many Roman buildings enjoyed underfloor heating and fresh water plumbed into peoples' homes.

'They really were an incredibly technologically advanced society, and yet, in the face of Mother Nature, it just didn't mean anything,' he said.

According to the IMDB database the movie had a £60 million budget and made £6 million during its opening weekend in the US.
