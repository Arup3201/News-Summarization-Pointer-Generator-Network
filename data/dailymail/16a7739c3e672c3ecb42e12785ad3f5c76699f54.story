Budget supermarket chain Aldi is stepping it up a notch by launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear.

The company reckons its £80 jacket and £60 trousers, made from 'high-standard' textile designed to protect against abrasion, are the cheapest in Britain.

And they are certainly a bargain compared to the prices of brand leader Weise Avance, whose motorcycle jacket and jeans retail for £1,219.98 altogether - the jacket for £639.99 and trousers for £579.99.

Aldi is launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear, with this whole outfit costing just £180

The range of clothes that includes a trousers, boots for £29.99, motorcycle tank bags at a bargain £12.99 and gloves at £19.99,  is sure to be snapped up in minutes when it's released on March 8.

The store will also sell thermal under layers including a long-sleeved top and long johns. 

And not only are the clothes a much more affordable option for motorbiking enthusiasts, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours.

The pass zone for the Level 2 impact abrasion test is seven seconds of abrasion resistance in body zones 1 and 2, which include the shoulders and elbows. 

Aldi's jacket and trousers exceed these requirements, achieving over 13 seconds of abrasion resistance across all four zones of the garment.

John Chatterton-Ross, of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), the governing body for motorcycle racing, said: 'This is the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices.

'The protection offered by Aldi's products exceeds the requirements for impact abrasion and impact cut resistance demanded by the European standard for zones 1 and 2 in all zones. 

'Few products on the market can match this. Often, even in premium brands, it is only the protectors that are certified, not the rest of the garment.

'It is great to see that with Aldi's motorcycling jacket and trousers, safety does not have to come with a high price tag.'

The motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from Equestrian and fishing gear, to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories.

And just last June, the chain even brought the world's most expensive beef, Wagyu, to its aisles at £6.99 for a sirloin steak.

Tony Baines of Aldi said of the new range: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone'. Pictured: Touring boots, £29.99

Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo - putting it out of reach for most families.

The move to offer luxury food and clothing at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the 'big four' - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.

Tony Baines of Aldi said: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone - giving our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality.

'The motorcycling range is of no exception and we're proud of the level of safety we've achieved at this unbeatable price point.'
