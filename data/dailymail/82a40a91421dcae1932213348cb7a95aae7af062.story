IF your home can’t actually be a castle, it’s surely the next best thing to have one in your garden.

And this beautiful manor house comes with one that dates from the 11th century.

For £850,000 – the price of a one-bedroom flat in central London – the buyer will get the eight-bedroom house and the castle, which has sea views from the turrets.

Home: The lavish eight-bedroomed Georgian home, built in 1808, is at the heart of the property. It has welcomed figures as diverse as the Queen and former Labour leader Michael Foot

Garden: The package, available to lease from the Duchy of Cornwall, also boasts remains of a Norman castle, seen left, and spectacular views over the Plymouth sound

Remains: The circular keep, pictured above, has no roof and has been reimagined as a romantic walled garden

Grand design: The Georgian house was designed by Benjamin Tucker, a naval man and surveyor general of Cornwall

There is one drawback: It will be yours for only 20 years before the lease expires.

Trematon Castle was built shortly after the Norman Conquest by Robert, Count of Mortain. It was sold to Richard, Earl of Cornwall in 1270 and is now owned by Prince Charles’s Duchy of Cornwall.

Standing in nine acres of landscaped gardens, the manor house features a dining room, drawing room, library, study, pantry, larder, boot room, kitchen, cellar and four bathrooms.

Also in the grounds is a keep or tower that stands on a hill, a two-bedroom lodge and an ‘Indian influenced’ outdoor heated swimming pool.

Forever England: The home, which is currently leased by landscape gardeners Julian and Isabel Bannerman, is richly appointed inside as well as boasting impressive history and spectacular views

Rooms with a view: Breathtaking vistas over the Plymouth Sound, praised by poet laureate John Betjemen, can be seen from some of the property's eight bedrooms

Knockdown deal: Estate agents Knight Frank say the property - on the market for an £850,000 leasehold - would be worth £3million if put on the market outright

Stylish: The dining room is decked out with china pieces and sketches of a viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel - which is visible from the windows

Picturesque: A glimpse of Plymouth, which lies across the water from the castle, can be seen from the window of the substantial kitchen

Entertaining: There would be plenty of room for guests in the huge house, which featured traditional fireplaces and extensive gardens for summer

Extensive: The large manor house even features a 'boot room', which is pictured here

While the leasehold on the property near Saltash, Cornwall, is only 20 years, it is expected that it will be renewed.

Richard Speedy, of Knight Frank estate agents, said: ‘The keep is currently not being used for anything and if you were living there it could be turned into whatever you like. There is no roof on it so it might make a very nice garden.’

Trematon Castle was built by the Count of Mortain to strengthen the hold of William the Conqueror in England after his triumph against King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

Warlike heritage: The castle, currently owned by the Prince of Wales's estate, has outlived its defensive purpose. The rustic-looking wooden cannon which 'guard' the property were installed by the current tenants

Vista: The castle can be seen, below centre, nestled in the dramatic Cornish landscape

Grounds: In the shadow of the keep is an outdoor pool, built in the 19th Century to commemorate an 1812 visit by George IV, then Prince Regent

Imperial: The architecture of the pool reflects designs common in areas of India colonised by the British Empire

Inside the keep: Currently the circular walls of the open keep contain a romantic, thriving garden

In Elizabethan times it was used by Sir Francis Drake to house Spanish treasure, the fruits of his piracy in the Pacific.

More recent tenants include diplomat Hugh Foot, Lord Caradon, brother of the late Labour leader Michael Foot.

It was also spoken warmly of by poet laureate John Betjeman, who called the vista from the property ‘one of the most superb views of Cornwall’.

Bonus: The package for sale also includes this two-bedroom lodge, which is currently rented out for around £420 per month

The grand estate of Trematon castle had a vibrant history extending far beyond its beginnings in the wake of the Norman conquest.

The fortification was built by the Count of Mortain to strengthen the hold of William the Conqueror in England after his triumph at the Battle of Hastings.

Historical: Sir Francis Drake spent time at Trematon before returning in triumph to London with Spanish treasure

But, since Britain has never been invaded since, the fort has never seen battle. Nonetheless it has played host to a variety of historical figures across the centuries.

The property’s Grade-I listed gatehouse was built as a Cornish home for Edward the Black Prince, who won dramatic victories in France and founded the chivalrous Knights of the Garter.

In Elizabethan times it was used by Sir Francis Drake to house Spanish treasure, the fruits of his piracy in the Pacific Ocean.

He lay low at Trematon Castle before parading the hoard, including emeralds and gold, up the Thames in his ship the Golden Hind.

The ornate swimming pool in the lower reaches of the gardens was built by 19th-Century tenants of the castle to commemorate an 1812 visit by the Prince Regent, who was later crowned George IV.

Trematon eventually passed into the possession of Hugh Foot, Lord Carodan, who was a top British diplomat in Cyprus, Nigeria and Jamaica while they still belonged to the empire.

His young brother, Michael Foot, was Labour leader for part of Margaret Thatcher’s time in office, and would often stay at the family seat.

There are reports of him being soaked in one of the bedrooms when a pipe burst above his head.

It was also spoken warmly of by poet laureate John Betjemen, who called the view: 'one of the most superb views of 
  Cornwall, a Brunel stone viaduct crossing a foreground creek, the Lynher and 
  Tamar estuaries beyond, and the wooded slopes of Anthony'.

In more recent Royal history, Queen Elizabeth made a visit to Trematon in 1962.
