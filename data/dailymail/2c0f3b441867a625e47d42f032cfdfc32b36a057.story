A privately-owned sightseeing helicopter went down in the Hudson River on Sunday but the young pilot's skilled emergency landing left no one injured.

Michael Campbell, 22, had only been on the job for a year when he made the miraculous emergency landing, The New York Daily News reported. None of the copter's four passengers, including two children, were hurt.

'I was just doing my job. I did what I had to do,' Campbell said.

Rescue: A helicopter rests on a pontoon at the 79th Street Boat Basin after an emergency landing over the Hudson river in New York on June 30

Massive operation: As it descended, Campbell released the helicopter's yellow floaters

Campbell took off just before noon Sunday with four Swedish tourists on board. The helicopter's engine lost power, forcing Campbell to act quickly.

'The pilot did a terrific job, considering he lost his engine power,' FDNY Deputy Fire Chief Thomas McKavanagh told reporters.

Campbell brought the copter down near the 79th Street Boat basin.

 'He had some kind of control—a very skilled pilot,' McKavanagh said.

Stefan Capan, who was riding his bike along the river path at the time, told the Gothamist: 'We were sitting north of the Boat Basin 
Marina when I saw the helicopter approaching north, going very fast and 
losing altitude very quickly.'

Close to disaster: The helicopter made the emergency landing around noon on Sunday

Omar Vidal, 22, a waiter at the Boat Basin Cafe near where the emergency landing occurred, told the Daily News he heard the copter 'going down really fast'. He said the pilot 'popped out the floaters' as before crashing into the river with a huge splash.

'We couldn’t see it for two seconds because of the splash. Everybody was looking, like, "What just happened?"' he said.  'The helicopter vanished into the splash.'

After the copter popped back up, several bystanders assisted in the rescue.

Hero: Sebastien Berthelet, from Montreal, right, helped bring to shore the pilot who made an emergency landing of his helicopter, as well as four passengers

Sebastian Berthelet 38, and stepson Lambert De Monte, 16, or Montreal, took a dingy from their nearby sailboat to help.

'In the beginning we thought it was an exercise, just a helicopter trying to land in the water,' Berthelet told the New York Post. 'When we saw the floaters we thought maybe that's just practice. But when it hit the water, it hit hard.'

'Let's go, let's go, let's see if we can help,' Berthelet said his stepson said.

They brought the pilot into their dingy and Berthelet said Campbell was 'in shock'. After complimenting Campbell on his landing, the pilot responded: 'It could have been smoother.'

Berthelet said the pilot was the real hero.

'We are not,'he said. 'He's the guy who saved the lives.'

Dramatic landing: The privately-owned helicopter was pulled into a marina following its emergency landing in the Hudson on Sunday

There were no injuries reported but all of those on board were being checked out at the 79th Street Boat Basin. The helicopter was towed in and removed by authorities.

'I would say it sustained some kind of impact onto the water,' McKavanagh told the Daily News. 'They would have to look at it to see if the helicopter needs any kind of repairs. I'm sure it needs at least an engine.'

Campbell's uncle told the Daily News he has always wanted to be a helicopter pilot and that he 'loves' flying.

His grandmother said was 'proud' of his landing.

'Somebody was watching over him to keep him safe and the tourists with him safe,' Mary Ann Campbell, 68, told the Daily News.
