It might make you feel cleaner than plain old toilet paper, but think twice before you flush that wet wipe.

While many celebrities are busily endorsing the daily use of the pre-moisturised paper, sewer utilities are struggling to cope with their clogged-up pipes and pumps.

This growing menace to society has cost the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission more than $1 million to install machinery that can shred the wipes before they reach the pumps on the way to the treatment plants.

Officials in the area blame wipes on a
35 per cent increase in broken pumps and clogged sewer pipe lines over 
the past few years, according to the Washington Post.

The
wet wipes – mostly used for babies and people seeking a thorough 
cleanse – are also said to contribute to blockages that cause sewage to 
overflow into streams and back up into basements.

According to officials in Washington, the issue is that wet wipe products are being marketed as flushable.

‘Just
because you can flush it doesn’t mean you should,’ said I.J. Hudson, a 
spokesman for the WSSC, which handles sewage for 1.8 million residents 
of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.

More
than 500 man hours have been devoted over the past 12 months to 
removing stuck wipes and repairing broken equipment, say officials with 
DC Water, the District’s water and sewer agency.

Menace to society: Wet wipes are clogging up the sewer pipes causing millions in damages

Utility workers are fighting to keep the pipes clean from wet wipes before the damage is too great

In July, British sewerage workers discovered a 15-tonne ball of congealed fat and wet wipes the size of a bus.

Nicknamed
Fatberg, the toxic lump was clogging up 95 per cent of a 2.4-metre 
diameter London sewer pipe and took sewer workers three weeks to defeat.

Just one week ago, giant lumps of lard and baby wipes were discovered clogging Denver's sewers, including one giant grease ball in pipes underneath the home of one resident who complained his drains were backing up.

Workers discovered the Warren Ave, Denver, resident had been regularly pouring grease down his sink, causing it to harden in a lump in the sewer and block the line.

So much grease had oozed into the main pipe, workers had to clean it several times.

According to the Post, wipe manufacturers say they are trying to reduce wear and tear on sewer systems and septic tanks.

A trade group, the Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, is forming a technical work group with utility officials to sort through differences over how wipes should be tested for flushability.

This summer the trade association released a list of updated guidelines for wipes manufacturers, which spell out seven tests that a product should pass before being marketed as flushable.

They also suggest making Do Not Flush logos more prominent on those that do not pass but are commonly used in bathrooms.

Dave Rousse, president of the fabrics group, said consumers want baby wipes to be durable enough to withstand finger ‘poke-through’.

‘We all agree the solution to the problem is to reduce the burden on wastewater treatment systems,’ Rousse said. ‘We agree we need to label products 
appropriately and educate the public to flush responsibly — to look for 
and obey disposal instructions.’

However, the industry is booming and consumer wipes sales are predicted to grow by about 6 per cent annually for the next five years, according to Rousse.

Even celebrities are busy endorsing the daily use of the wet wipe, including actor Terrence Howard, who said in an interview with Elle Magazine that women who do not use wipes are ‘not completely clean’.

Singer Bruno Mars says he always brings wet wipes with him on tour

‘If they’re using dry paper, they aren’t washing all of themselves. It’s just unclean. So if I go in a woman’s house and see the toilet paper there, I’ll explain this.’

Hip hop singer and producer Will.i.am has also echoed this sentiment to Elle Magazine.

‘Here's proof on why people should have baby wipes. Get some chocolate, wipe it on a wooden floor, and then try to get it up with some dry towels. You're going to get chocolate in the cracks. That's why you gotta get them baby wipes.’

The most recent celebrity to pipe up about the importance of wipes is singer Bruno Mars, who told TMZ.com that he always brings wipes and wine when he’s on tour.

Even Hollywood actor and director Will Smith has joined the baby wipes campaign.

‘I'm the type of person that it's important for me to share. When I experience something that's special and incredible, I like to share it with people. Anyone who's using dry toilet paper, you're really not doing yourself the true service,’ he told BBC’s Radio 1.
