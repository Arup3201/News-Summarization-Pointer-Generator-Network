Lucky: Jack Russells, Daisy and Molly, had to be resuscitated by firefighters

Firefighters have rescued a bizarre collection of animals after tackling a blaze at a home with more than 100 pets including cats, dogs, rabbits, ferrets, chickens and even an iguana. 

They had to resuscitate two dogs moments from death after responding to the call from worried neighbours in Southampton, Hampshire, at 9am yesterday morning.

The crew fought to put out the kitchen fire and get the animals to safety, with the help of owners Derek and Jacqui Rankin, but sadly a cat, a dog, a ferret and a bird died of smoke inhalation. 

One person was also treated by the South Central Ambulance Service for smoke inhalation.

Officer in charge, watch manager Jason Brattle, said: 'Crews worked extremely hard to control the fire whilst being faced with an unusual situation involving so many animals.

'As crews gained entry they were exposed to six dogs who would naturally protect their property and were scared.

'Firefighters dealt with the situation extremely well to knock down the fire and save so many animals.'

The crews used four sets of breathing apparatus, two jets and two hose reels to tackle the blaze. 

A Hampshire Fire Service spokesman said: 'We believe these were all domestic pets. They may have bred some animals but as far as we are aware they are domestic pets. No animals are missing.'

Firefighers also worked together with the RSPCA to formulate a plan going forward to protect the animals.

It is believed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault.

Owners, Mr and Mrs Rankin, confirmed their nine-year-old chihuahua, named Olly, died of smoke inhalation along with a cat that they had been looking after for around a month.    

The blaze comes just a week after 20 Staffordshire bull terriers were killed in a fire at a breeder's home in East Yorkshire.

At least 53 dogs were killed in a large fire which tore through Manchester Dogs' Home two weeks ago (above)

It is understood that the dogs were being kept in cages, and the fire tore through the wood-structured property while the owners were out 

And two weeks ago at least 53 dogs were killed in a large fire at Manchester Dogs' Home. 

A 15-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of arson remains on police bail pending further investigations into the incident.
