Police are hunting for the thugs that gunned down a five-year-old girl when a stray bullet from a drive by shooting struck her while she ate breakfast.

Payton Benson was the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting Thursday morning around 9:45 a.m. that saw three men unload at least 20 shots into a residential block in Omaha. She died at a local hospital.

The young girl is the nephew of Omaha City Councilman Ben Gray, according to WOWT. Her family had recently moved to Omaha from Illinois.

‘It makes me so mad right now,’ uncle Massey Allen told WOWT. ‘I’m going to keep it real with you, I want to go kill somebody my damn self, that’s how mad I am. She didn’t even start school yet.’

Ms Benson was finishing breakfast when the thugs began shooting at a man on the street only a block away, according to police.

Witnesses told WOWT they heard at least 20 shots fired from multiple high-powered rifles.

‘What I heard was just massive amounts of gunfire, both guns had to be completely unloaded,’ Nick Todd told WOWT.  ‘Both guns were very large guns. They weren't small guns.’

Even worse, the family’s van had a flat tire after being struck by a separate stray bullet – Ms Benson’s mother could not get her to the hospital in time to possibly save her life.

Footage from the scene showed several evidence markers scattered around the street where investigators found dozens of shell casings.

Surveillance footage released from nearby showed three men exiting a black SUV police believe are the gunmen.

‘Your loss is our community's loss,’ Mayor Jean Stothert said during a Thursday news conference, according to KETV.

Police then urged the gunmen to turn themselves in.

‘You know who you are and law enforcement will find out who you are,’ Chief Todd Schmaderer said. ‘It may not have been your bullet that struck this is girl, so do the right thing and do yourself a favor in the process.’

Callous: the stray bullets even flattened the tires of the family van, making it impossible to rush the dying girl to the hospital

The Chief also vowed to make finding young Payton’s killers the department’s top priority.

‘I promise the family, this community, that my homicide investigators, my gang investigators will work around the clock leaving no stone unturned,’ he added.

Mr Schmaderer also said there are several leads in the case, that it’s solvable and that his team will ‘work it extremely hard.’

The Fontenelle Park neighborhood, where the shootings occurred, is not a particularly violent area. There are only 4 violent crimes per 1,000 residents, according to the Omaha World-Herald.
