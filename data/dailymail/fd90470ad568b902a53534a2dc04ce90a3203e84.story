It was shaping up to be the perfect Christmas for a young couple who were very much in love.

But yesterday heartbroken teenager Lauren White was left with only the gift of a ring and memories of the boyfriend cruelly taken from her in a fatal car crash on Christmas Eve.

Louis Kefferty, aged 20, died after his red Vauxhall Astra hit a roadside tree only half-a-mile from his home in Seafield, West Lothian.

Apprentice stonemason Mr Kefferty and passenger Miss White, 18, were taken to hospital in Edinburgh, where he later died of severe head injuries sustained in the crash.

Yesterday, his girlfriend poured out her feelings on Facebook in an emotional tribute to the man she credits with saving her life.

The seriously injured teenager, who is expected to remain in hospital for some time, wrote: ‘Yesterday I lost the most precious person in my life. He has been there for me no matter what, and it has left a hole in my heart that will never mend.

‘He saved my life and made sure I was protected before attending to himself, and I am so grateful, but just wish he was here to tell me “Everything is going to be OK”, to hug me and comfort me.

‘He will always be in my heart and I will never move on from the loss that we all have lost.

‘He was the rock to everyone and he is the type of person that will be there for anyone he cares about.’

Miss White told how the pair had 'the best relationship' and how Mr Kefferty made her smile every day

Miss White also posted a picture of herself and her boyfriend together, along with a picture of the ring Mr Kefferty had given to her as a Christmas gift.

In a heartbreaking message to her dead boyfriend, she wrote: ‘I have opened my Christmas present and the ring you had got for me is absolutely gorgeous, and I will wear it and cherish it, and that will make me aware that you are always with me.’

Miss White told how the pair had ‘the best relationship’ and how Mr Kefferty made her smile every day.

She added: ‘I will never be able to mend the pain I’m feeling. I love you more than anything, babe, and I will never forget you, you will always be in my heart. I love you more than words can say, baby!’

The fatal crash happened at 11.05am on Tuesday on the A705 near Seafield.

The road was closed for five hours following the accident and police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.

Friends of Mr Kefferty paid tribute to him on Twitter yesterday. Charlene Marshall said she had ‘never met a happier boy’, while Claire Todd described the news as ‘so sad’.

Mr Kefferty bought a new car in August, and is understood to have passed his test two years ago.Miss White’s father, Paul White, wrote online: ‘My beautiful girl. We all know how much he meant to you and everyone saw it. He will always be in our hearts.’

Her sister Becca said: ‘He was some character, and we will always love him. He had the best of friends and we all know that you had made him an even better person than he already was, and that he loved you so dearly.

‘We all love you and your friends have been so supportive. I know a few that are eager to get through and see you.’

Miss White’s father and sister both travelled to the hospital in Edinburgh yesterday to visit the grief-stricken teenager.

Mr Kefferty’s cousin, Holly Thompson, was stunned to hear the news of the accident, writing on her Facebook page: ‘So hoping I wake up tomorrow and today has just been one big nightmare.’

Miss White was intending to start a new job with budget airline Jet 2 next month.

Last night, Sergeant Brian Jones, who is leading the investigation into the crash, said: ‘This tragic collision appears to have involved only one car.

‘However, I am appealing to anyone who saw the collision or was driving on this road around this time and has any information which can assist us, to call Police Scotland on 101 or provide the information through Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.’
