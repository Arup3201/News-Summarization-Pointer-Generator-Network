Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under scrutiny over its safety record yet again - after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine mid-air and turn back three hours into a flight.

The double-decker plane, which was carrying 430 passengers to Frankfurt, Germany, yesterday was in the air for three hours when crew reported a surge in one of its four Rolls-Royce engines.

Pilots shut down the engine, turned flight SQ26 around and landed safely back in Singapore using the three other engines, the airline said.

The passengers were transferred to another plane which later took off to Frankfurt.

'The aircraft is capable of flying safely on three engines and at no time was the safety of our customers and crew compromised,' Singapore Airlines said in a statement.

It did not specify the model of the engine involved, but the airline and Rolls-Royce said they would thoroughly inspect it and investigate what happened.

A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'We are aware of the situation and working with our customer to investigate.'

It is the latest safety incident to hit the world's biggest passenger plane, which cost a staggering £250million each.

Earlier this month Airbus said it would need years to get past problems with wing cracks, which were traced to a small component engineered in its design centre in Filton, Bristol.

The manufacturer was forced to order
a global recall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the
wing’s skin to the structure, affecting the entire fleet of 69 
planes currently flying.

The minor cracks - no more than two 
centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide 
inspection.

It came following the explosion of a Rolls-Royce engine during a 
flight over Indonesia in late 2010 and saw Australia's leading carrier grounding its superjumbo fleet for nearly a month.

Airbus feared the issue could cost it more than £80million in compensation, but insisted there was no threat
to safety posed by the flaw.

It also added that safety agencies on both sides of the 
Atlantic had given the planes the all clear to continue flights.

But it said it would bring in the aircraft
for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of 
hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem.

It also said that these kind of problems were common in the first few years of a new aircraft, but they would eventually be ironed out.

The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of 
European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next 
generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry.

It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before.

The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern.

SIA, Singapore's flagship carrier, has 16 in service and three more scheduled for delivery this year.  It was the first airline to take delivery, with the debut passenger
flight taking place in October 2007.

The planes have been in service for five years. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide. British Airways is due to take 
delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin’s eight 
superjumbos will arrive in 2015.

Superjumbo services to Heathrow began in March 2008, with Manchester airport services starting in September 2010. Shares in Airbus parent EADS were up 0.3 per cent at 30.9550 euros at 0820am, while Rolls-Royce shares were 0.2 per cent higher.
