A lorry driver has suffocated under an eight tonne 'avalanche' of animal feed after it accidentally poured on top of him as he worked inside a giant dockside silo.

The haulier, who has not been named but is said to have been in his 60s, was attempting to open the back of his truck in the Port of Liverpool, Merseyside, when the soyabean meal he had just loaded tumbled out and buried him.

The driver was freed by work colleagues from the mountain of grain - described as having the texture of biscuit crumbs - and resuscitated but died later in hospital from asphyixia and the effects of a heart attack.

A man died after being buried under eight tonnes of grain at the Cargill plant in Bootle, Merseyside (pictured). He is said to have died from the effects of suffocation and a subsequent heart attack.

The health and safety executive are now investigating the tragedy which happened at 11am yesterday morning at the Cargill terminal at Seaforth docks.

A worker at the docks, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He had loaded a trailer and then went to the weigh bridge but it was overweight.

'He reversed back into the building, to the soya pile, and went to the back of the trailer to open the door only for the mountain of soya in the container to collapse on him like an avalanche, burying him.'

The driver worked for haulage firm Reid Atkinson based in Kellbrook, Lancashire.

The soybean was being held in a silo - a large suspended container widely used in agriculture to store grain.

Cargill, a company which produces high protein soyabean meal and crude soya oil for use in animal feed said in a statement: 'Cargill can confirm that an accident involving a driver, employed by a third-party haulage company, occurred at our Seaforth site.

'The driver was taken to hospital and sadly died while there. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.

'We are currently investigating the accident and we are working fully with the authorities.'

The North West ambulance service confirmed the man had been suffocated and suffered a heart attack after the meal had fallen on him in the storage shed.

He was resuscitated at the scene but died a short time later at Fazakerley Hospital.

A hospital spokesman said: 'The feed fell on top of the man. He has suffered extensive asphyxiation in the grain silo and gone into cardiac arrest.

'He was resuscitated and the paramedic who was first on scene travelled with him to hospital. But he died later from his injuries.'

A spokesman for Peel Ports Liverpool, which operates the docklands area of the city, added: 'An HGV driver was hurt on one of our tenants’ premises. He was alive when he left the premises and was taken to hospital. We understand he has sadly since died.

'The incident is being investigated by the ports police and the HSE who are on site. It’s a terribly sad incident.'

The Health and Safety Executive confirmed that an investigation into the man's death has now been launched.
