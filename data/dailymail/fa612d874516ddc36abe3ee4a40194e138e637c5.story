A Swiss designer has created a silk scarf which very closely resembles a meaty rasher of bacon.

Entitled, the Fou Lard, its name plays on the French term for a thin scarf or handkerchief, 'Foulard', and also the French for bacon, which is simply: 'Lard'.

Digitally printed on delicate silk, the hyper-realistic bacon scarf - not cheap at $165 - is admittedly a mouth-watering thing to behold, with detail all the way down to its 'crispy' black rolled hem.

Introducing the Fou Lard: Swiss designer Natalie Luder designed this unusual silk scarf, which is digitally printed and costs $165

The scarf's designer, Natalie Luder, writes on her website: 'My work is often inspired by topics of the realm of food culture.

The comparison of appearance and reality, nature and culture, as well as the discussion about good and bad taste are fascinating aspects to me.'

A quick glance through some of her other projects reveals a rather morbid fixation with dead animals. A necklace hung with moths, another made from 'horse teeth' and the ceramic recreation of an edible organ for example.

Almost edible: Even the blackened 'crispy' edges of the rolled hem closely resembles a delicious rasher of bacon

Swanky: Ms Luder released a limited number of the scarves in 2011, but they are yet to sell out

Describing her unusual fares, Ms Luder writes: 'The wearer overtakes the qualities of the slaid animal and blazons himself with the heroic hunting story[sic].'

You might assume the Fou Lard to be a fast-food fashion anomaly, but there appears to exist something of a bacon-themed clothing sub-culture in today's America.

BaconFreak.com sells an entire line of bacon-inspired clothing.

And supermodel of the moment Cara Delevingne regularly sings the praises of her favorite meaty snack, even joyously acquiring a pair of bacon-decorated socks for herself not too long ago.

The Fou Lard was first issued by Ms Luder as a limited edition item in 2011, however, they are yet to sell out.
