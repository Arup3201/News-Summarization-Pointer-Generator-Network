The Dutch FA claim Arjen Robben's confession to diving in the World Cup has been misinterpreted, and say the Holland winger admitted he was 'falling too easily'.

Robben could face retrospective disciplinary action from FIFA if he did admit diving during the first half of Holland’s 2-1 win over Mexico, and will make a statement on Monday afternoon after training.

The Dutch FA said: 'KNVB is unpleasantly surprised by publications in the media about the Dutch penalty in the match versus Mexico.

'Media have interpreted statements from Robben in a Dutch post match interview completely wrong.

'In a studio interview with Dutch broadcaster NOS, the forward stated that the decision of the referee to give a penalty in the second half of the game was perfectly right.

'However, in the same interview Robben referred to two situations earlier in the match (first half), when he was brought down.

'The 
striker stated that in one of those situations he should have been 
granted a penalty, but that in the other case he was falling too easily.

'Later today Arjen Robben will make a statement in a press conference after the training of the Netherlands team in Rio.'

Training at Estadio Gavea started at 11.30am, and Wesley Sneijder will join Robben in the media conference.

Robben remains adamant his 93rd-minute penalty was genuine, but admitted going to ground too easily earlier in the match during an interview.

'I
 must apologise,' said Robben. 'The one (at the end) was a penalty, but 
the other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn't be doing that. 
That’s awful.’

FIFA’s 
disciplinary code states that ‘anyone who violates the principles of 
fair play’ could face sanction, while article 96 says that audio and 
video recordings are permissible as forms of evidence.

This means Robben’s 
words and footage of his dive could be reviewed.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter, speaking in February, called for retrospective action to be taken against divers.

‘Video
 evidence can be used for serious breaches of the principle of fair play
 such as brawling, spitting at opponents, verbal insults and racist 
slurs, or for incorrectly awarded red or yellow cards,’ he said.

'In cases such as these we must make use of the avenues already open to us and intervene after the event if necessary.

‘In this context, we should include the faking of injury, intentional diving or time wasting in our considerations.’

Meanwhile,
 Mexico boss Miguel Herrera branded Robben a cheat and criticised 
Portuguese referee Pedro Proenca.

'Out of four matches we had three where the refereeing was disastrous and this was the worst,' said Herrerra.

'Robben
 did three dives for penalties that didn’t exist. He had to be 
cautioned. If you do that to the guy who tries to cheat, then he can’t 
cheat again.

'Robben
 should have got a second card. If you don’t do anything as a referee, 
the player carries on. He knows he won’t be expelled from the pitch so 
he carries on.

'But then when they send a referee from the same confederation where they have a team, this is what happens.

'The referee gave a penalty that was invented by him. The least we can hope is that this gentleman goes home just like us.’
