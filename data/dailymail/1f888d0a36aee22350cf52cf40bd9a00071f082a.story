All the pimps busted in a huge sex-trafficking ring in New York are from the same impoverished town in Mexico.

The latest alleged pimps to be indicted are brothers Isaias and Bonifacio Flores-Mendez who are from Tenancingo, the ‘world capital of sex trafficking,’ according by U.S. government officials.

Since October last year, immigration officials have made 33 sex trafficking arrests in New York - all from the town of 10,000 people about 80 miles from Mexico City.

Sex trafficking ring raided: Immigration officials raided brothels in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie and Yonkers on April 30 and since October last year have made 33 sex trafficking arrests - all from impoverished town Tenancingo in Mexico

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided brothels in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie and Yonkers, all in the wider-New York area, on April 30, arresting 13 indicating that the Queens-based gangs may have expanded their sex trafficking ring. Dozens of women, mostly from Mexico, had been exploited, many forced to engage in prostitution with 20 to 30 customers a day.

ICE Special agent in charge James Hayes said on the day of the arrests: 'The arrests today move the United States closer to blockading the repugnant sex trafficking corridor that organisations like the one allegedly operated by Isaias Flores-Mendez and his cohorts use to smuggle innocent victims between Tenancingo, Mexico and New York City.

He told The Daily News: ‘We see here that they have moved (farther) out.

‘It seems like the word is getting out that we’re cracking down in the New York City area.’

The town has been notorious for pimps 
who dupe women, some only teenagers, into trafficking by promising love, marriage and employment or by using threats and abuse.

Driven to the brothels: Women are often driven from Queens to spend a week at a time in the brothels so customers have 'variety' (file photo)

The April 30 raid at a house in Poughkeepsie revealed a secret second-floor brothel while in Yonkers, a brothel operating in a dilapidated apartment building was exposed.

Women are driven from Queens to spend a week at a time in the brothels so customers have ‘variety’. The doormen, also called ‘steerers,’ charge $30 for 15 minutes.

Lori Cohen, a lawyer with charity 
Sanctuary for Families, which represents trafficking survivors, said: 
‘It is dangerous when they are trafficked out of town — we’ve had 
clients beaten up by buyers, raped by buyers — and they are in an 
unknown location. So they are isolated.’

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said of the April 30 arrests: 'With promises of a better life, the members of this alleged sex trafficking and prostitution ring lured their unsuspecting victims to the United States and then consigned them to a living hell – forcing them to become sex slaves living in abhorrent conditions, and using threats, verbal abuse, and violence – sexual and otherwise – when they resisted and even sometimes when they didn’t.

'With their arrests today, the barbaric conduct in which these defendants allegedly engaged in order to make a profit has now been put to a stop, and they will be prosecuted for their alleged crimes and the women they enslaved will be able to put their lives back together.'

One woman who was trafficked by her husband from Tenancingo said at the trips to residential brothels, she was regularly beaten and insulted. Her husband would send her to farms and brothels in Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and even as far as Maryland.

‘Sometimes on a weekend it would be 30, 40 a night,’ the woman said.

‘I would say, “I can’t anymore, it hurts,” but they’d say, “Oh this is the last one.” But after that last one, there’d be another. And you would just have to take it, find the strength. They don’t know what it is to suffer.’
