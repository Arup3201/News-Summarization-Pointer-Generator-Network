The warden of the prison where Ohio puts inmates to death says the state's execution table can easily hold a condemned 480-pound inmate who has argued he is so big it might collapse.

The table was tested by placing a prison employee who weighs the same amount as inmate Ronald Post on it as well as extra weights and it remained standing.

Post argues his weight, vein access, scar tissue, depression and other medical problems raise the likelihood his executioners would encounter severe problems.

'The execution table held firmly and showed no signs of instability,' wrote Donald Morgan, warden at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, in a court filing.

Big problem: Death row inmate Ronald Post, 53, who weights 480lbs with a scheduled date for execution set for January of 2013 claims he's too big to be easily and humanely killed

Judging by the two tests, Mr Morgan 
said he is confident the table 'can and will accommodate the weight of 
inmate Post for his scheduled execution.'

There is also the question of how much
Post actually weighs, since his lawyers reported that he weighs 480 
pounds but the state reports that he weighed 396 pounds just last week.

Post, 53, is scheduled to die January 16 for the 1983 shooting death of Helen Vantz in Elyria.

The victimâ€™s son, Bill Vantz, has called Post's arguments 'laughable.'

Post's attorneys also want more time 
to pursue arguments that claims of a full confession by the inmate to 
several people have been falsely exaggerated.

'Indeed, given his unique physical and
medical condition, there is a substantial risk that any attempt to 
execute him will result in serious physical and psychological pain to 
him, as well as an execution involving a torturous and lingering death,'
a court filing said last month.

Breakable: A gurney is seen at a Virginia Correctional Facility, similar to one in Ohio which Posts claims he could also break if placed on due to his size

Mr Morgan said he successfully tested 
the strength of the table with an employee who weighed 420 pounds, and 
later by piling 540 pounds of weight on the table. The table straps 
easily fit around the employee, Morgan said.

The state is also questioning the 
validity of arguments in favor of sparing Post made by a doctor who did 
not examine him. The state says Post hasn't presented evidence he can't 
be put to death 'in a humane and dignified manner.'

Ohio is also challenging Post's 
arguments on technical grounds, saying he has exhausted his claims 
before federal courts and shouldn't be allowed to make this new 
argument.

Ohio executes inmates with a single dose of pentobarbital, usually injected through the arms.

Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation

Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible

Medical personnel have had a hard time
inserting IVs into Post's arms, according to a court filing. Four years
ago, an Ohio State University medical center nurse needed three 
attempts to insert an IV into his left arm, the lawyers wrote.

Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, according to his court filing.

Post's request for gastric bypass 
surgery has been denied, he has been encouraged not to walk because he's
at risk for falling, and severe depression has contributed to his 
inability to limit how much he eats, his filing said.

While at the Mansfield Correctional 
Institution, Post 'used that prison's exercise bike until it broke under
his weight,' according to the filing.
