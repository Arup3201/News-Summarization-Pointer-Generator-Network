The nation hasn't reached a major tournament since 1976, but the Welsh finally have something to shout about with countryman Gareth Bale reaching the Champions League final on Tuesday night.

Barring injury, Bale will become only the fifth Welshman to play on the grandest stage of European football after Real Madrid came through 5-0 on aggregate against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena.

Madrid can win their 10th European Cup in Lisbon, but will the Welshman shine? Here's how the others fared...

Terry Yorath - Leeds United, 1975

The Cardiff-born midfielder was in Jimmy Armfield's XI for the defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris in 1975, and it didn't take long for him to make his stamp on the game.

With the sort of challenge which would have you sent off four times over these days, Yorath's fourth-minute attack on Bjorn Andersson was described by Uli Hoeness as 'the most brutal foul I think I have ever seen. His leg was a mess, and it was eight or nine months before he could play again.'

Leeds lost 2-0 despite dominating the match, thanks to late goals from Franz Roth and Gerd Muller.

Ian Rush - Liverpool, 1984, 1985

The deadly finisher was a winner in 1984 as Liverpool beat Roma on their own turf on penalties, with Rush slotting home Liverpool's third spot kick in a 4-2 shoot-out win.

He was part of the team that won the 1981 final against Real Madrid in Paris, but never made it into the match-day squad.

He played in the 1985 final in Heysel against Juventus, remembered for the 39 people killed by a collapsed concrete wall after trouble in the ground.

He went to Juve in search of more of the same with English clubs banned from European competition after Heysel, but returned after just a season.

Ryan Giggs - Manchester United, 1999, 2008, 2009 and 2011

The most decorated Welsh player of all time, the legend played a big part in both of Manchester United's Champions League final wins, and both were as dramatic as they come.

The wing wizard helped United get to the final with goals against Juventus in the semi-final and three goals in the group stage, but it was his mishit in the final minutes at the Nou Camp against Bayern Munich that lives longest in the memory.

His hashed effort fell to Teddy Sheringham, who equalised for United before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's winner.

In 2008, he scored United's sixth penalty in a 6-5 shoot-out win over Chelsea in Moscow, coming on as a substitute in the 87th minute. He lifted the trophy alongside Rio Ferdinand.

Barcelona became his nemesis, losing in the final in Rome in 2009 and then Wembley in 2011.

Joey Jones - Liverpool, 1977

A two-time winner alongside Ryan Giggs, Jones was victorious in consecutive years with Liverpool in the late 70s.

Jones started at left-back in the Reds' 3-1 win over Borussia Monchengladbach in 1977 in Rome, but was on the bench for the 1-0 win over Club Brugge the following year at Wembley.

A memorable banner was unfurled by Liverpool supporters in Rome read 'Joey Ate The Frogs Legs, Made The Swiss Roll, Now He's Munching Gladbach' in reference to beating St Etienne and Zurich on their way to the final.

Gareth Bale - Real Madrid

Could he be the best? He has a long way to go to catch up with Giggs in terms of medals, but Bale could easily surpass his Champions League haul if this becomes the Real Madrid side that finally lives up to expectations in Europe.

He's scored five goals in Europe this term, and having scored the winner in the Copa del Rey earlier this month, the next step up is to grab the all-important goal in Lisbon.

The stage is set for the most expensive player on earth.
