Former Wimbledon tennis champion Boris Becker arrived at tonight's Champions League fixture at Stamford Bridge inadvertently wearing a scarf celebrating the Chelsea Headhunter hooligan firm.

The tennis star was in a VIP box at the match with his wife Lilly, sporting a blue and white scarf with the words 'Chelsea Headhunter' and a pair of skulls which are acknowledged as the emblem of the hooligan mob.

There is no indication that the German celebrity had any knowledge of the significance of the 'Headhunter' legend on his scarf or the pair of skulls featured on the garment.

Mr Becker and his wife witnessed Chelsea's exit from this season's Champions League on away goals after a 3-3 draw on aggregate.  

The Chelsea Headhunters are one of the most notorious football hooligan firms of the 1970s and 1980s.

The thugs have links with a wide range of racist organisations such as Combat 18 as well as northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisations. 

In April 2014, about 300 Chelsea hooligans, including members of the Headhunters went on the rampage in Paris.  

In 1999, undercover journalist Donal McIntyre posed as a drug-dealing Ulster loyalist in a bid to infiltrate the hooligan gang. 

His work led to the prosecution of Jason Mariner, a senior member of the hooligan gang. 

A decade after his expose, Mr McIntyre was attacked by supporters of the hooligan firm outside a Surrey wine bar and knocked unconscious. 

Boris Becker's representatives did not return a call at the time of publication. 

Also, Chelsea FC did not respond to questions relating to the scarf, which was quite visible in the VIP box.
