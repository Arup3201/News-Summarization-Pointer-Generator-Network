Crowded trains, congested roads and signal failures often causes commuter journeys to take far longer than they should.

But some parts of the US are far more willing to put up with a long commute than others, and this fascinating interactive map reveals the divide.

It shows how the eastern states have some of the longest journey times to work, while parts of the south west and mid-west boast the shortest commuter times.

The average commute time of workers in Monroe County, Florida is 18.8 minutes. The map shows how this compares to the rest of the United States. Most places, particularly in the east, have a longer commute, as indicated by the brown and darker brown shades

Created by Nathan Yau at Flowing Data, you can click on each county on the map - which can be viewed here - to see the average commute times for workers.

Counties coloured green have a lower average commute time, and brown means a longer average commute time.

Grey, meanwhile, shows commute times that are about the same.

'My wife grew up where hour-long commutes are normal. Her dad used to leave at 4:00am to beat the morning rush and then nap in the parking lot until work started,' California-based Mr Yau wrote on his site.

It seems much of the US has a much shorter commute (in green and dark green) than the  185,000 residents of Hawaii County (shown in black) who take an average of 25 minutes and four seconds to get to work each day

Thomas county in Nebraska, which has a population of around 650 people, has an average commute time of 16 minutes and 30 seconds. This is equal large areas of the rest of the US (shown in grey), however, the eastern states seem to be willing to put up with longer journeys

Your commute is likely costing you much more than you realise, according to recent research. 

This in driving-related expenses, in number of hours on the road and in negative health outcomes, scientist claim.

In fact, 10.8 million Americans travel more than an hour each way to work. And 600,000 endure 'megacommutes' of at least 90 minutes and 50 miles each way.

The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index has found that the longer the commute, the higher the levels of one's obesity, cholesterol, pain, fatigue and anxiety.

The costs of commuting disproportionately hit those with modest incomes. For the working poor, commuting took up roughly 6 perc ent of income - double the percentage of those bringing home higher salaries.

'On the other hand, I thought my dad's 15-minute drive to work was a long time. My mum's work was only five minutes away. It's all about point of reference.'
