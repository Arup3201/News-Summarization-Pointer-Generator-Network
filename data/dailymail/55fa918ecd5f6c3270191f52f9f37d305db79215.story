When a couple are considering their honeymoon destination - an escape to the Caribbean or a romantic weekend in Paris normally come to mind.

But this Texas pair have shunned tradition of luxury and will instead spend seven months living out of an RV visiting every American state.

Alyssa and Heath Padgett, both 23, got married on May 24, and embarked on a seven-month, 50-state road trip - including plane rides to Alaska and Hawaii. 

Trip of a lifetime: Alyssa and Heath Padgett who have lived in Texas all of their lives decided to go on the 50-state, seven-month road trip starting at their wedding in May. They take selfies at every state line 

Happily married: The pair have been travelling for five months and living out of a RV. They hope to have their journey completed by Christmas 

The pair, who have lived in Texas all of their lives  have packed up everything into the 29-foot vehicle have named Franklin and will live out of it until Christmas. So far they have visited 35 states and are five months into their journey.  

Every time the couple passes a state line, they stop and take what has become an obligatory selfie in front of each sign. 

To fund their trip, they asked their wedding guests to donate on their GoFundMe page.

After quitting their jobs, they then reached out to Snagajob.com, proposing they would film a documentary and blog about hourly workers they met along the way.

Now in each state, Mr Padgett  spends a day in a part-time job. So far he has been a yoga instructor in Connecticut, a baker in Wyoming and an apple-picker in Vermont.

All of the videos of the experience are showcased on Hourly America. 

Alyssa told Mail Online: 'We've covered about 16,000 miles in five months. That's probably been the hardest part. We are always on the move.  

Pure Michigan: To fund their trip, the couple ask guests at their wedding to donate to their GoFundMe page and then received sponsorship from a job site 

Day out: One of their stops in Illinois included a visit to Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs 

'Fortunately, we travel with our home, so we rarely feel homesick or like we don't have a home base. Unfortunately, our home is a 20 year old RV. Something breaks every week (at least) and we are constantly needing to make a trip to a mechanic or learning how to fix things ourselves.

'The best part is that we experience every moment of life together. Perhaps some people say that they would get tired of another person by then--and certainly we get tired of each other sometimes--but we love being together. 

'We experience every break down and every tough work day together because we are a team. 

'We're just two kids who are madly in love and crazy enough to jump into the world's most stressful honeymoon together. 

One of the lastest Tweets he uploaded was: 'My last job at an Apple Orchard in Vermont. It was beautiful, and I ate 12 apple cider donuts.'

Next stop: The pair took one of their obligatory selfies when they reached the state - The Land of Lincoln 

Causing a splash: One of their selfies was taken with Niagara Falls in the background 

Fields of opportunities: Mr and Mrs Padgett donned sunglasses as they made their way into Iowa 

The pair's blog reads: 'We quit our full time gigs in order to seek out adventure and pursue a career in writing and creative endeavors. My current adventure is a quest to work a different hourly wage job in all 50 states.

'We are pretty young compared to your average RVers. At 23 years old, we get a lot of strange looks from other full-timers. They look at us with questioning glances as we hide away in the back of RV parks and try to find decent wifi. However, it’s part of the lifestyle we chose to live.

'Our mission is to live a life that always challenges the status quo. While all of our friends are gathering mortgages and settling down, we bought a used RV off Craigslist and hit the road.

View of the ocean: Heath looks out over the Pacific Ocean during a stop in Big Sur, California 

Hitting the links: While parked up in Rawlins, Wyoming, they decided to play pitch and putt as they geared up for the next leg of the journey 

Family ties: They met up with Heath's long lost sister (middle) at a diner in Nashville, Tennessee
