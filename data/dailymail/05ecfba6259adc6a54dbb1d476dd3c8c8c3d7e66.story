They might be famous for their buttoned-up approach to romance and reluctance to express their true feelings but it seems that British women are naughtier than previously thought.

A new survey has found that almost 70 per cent of British women like to experiment in the bedroom, with popular diversions including sex toys, doing the deed in public and using food to make time between the sheets more memorable.

Sexual behaviour was also found to vary across the UK, with those living in the south-east most open to experimenting while women based in the East Midlands were most likely to keep details of their exploits under wraps.

What's your fantasy? More than 70 per cent of British women have admitted to experimenting in the bedroom

73 per cent of women living in the south-east said they had experimented with bondage, role play and even threesomes - five per cent above the national average.

Those living in the West Midlands were the busiest between the bed covers, while those in East Anglia were the least likely to try something new with just under half saying that they always did the same thing.

Welsh women, meanwhile, were found to be the most comfortable with discussing their bedroom exploits with friends, unlike discreet north-easterners who were found to be the most keen to keep their time between the sheets between them and their partner.

Although the Welsh were more likely to reveal all, the majority of British women do live up to the national stereotype in one respect with 67 per cent saying they were reluctant to talk to their partner about sex.

Britain's bedroom secrets revealed: Are you a Bond-loving Scot or a garrulous Welsh woman?

And despite the best efforts of erotic novellists such as E.L James, it seems the missionary position is still the nation's favourite, with just over a third saying they preferred it to any other.

Less surprisingly, the survey, which 
compared women's real sex lives to their fantasy ones, also found that 
the younger generation were most likely to be adventurous while the 
over-55's tended to be the most conservative.

Equally
 unsurprising was the finding that George Clooney was the majority of 
British women's dream sexual partner, although in Scotland, the American
 silver fox was pipped to the post by the rugged Hugh Jackman.

Mr
 Darcy proved to be the favourite fictional hero,  although Scottish 
women once again bucked the trend, plumping for James Bond instead.

Popular: Hugh Jackman and George Clooney appear in more sexual fantasies than any other A-list men

Whether with Darcy or Clooney, nearly half of the 2,000 
women questioned (45 per cent) admitted that they fantasise about sex 
more than they actually have sex, with the dream sexual scenarios revealed to be dominance and submission role plays, sex with a fireman or 
sex on a beach.

These 
findings suggest that despite the Fifty Shades phenomenon, as well as 
the surge in explicit television shows such as Channel 4’s Sex Box, British women still prefer to cultivate an air of mystery around their real and 
fantasy sex lives.

A spokesperson for Totally Bound, the erotic publisher which conducted the survey, said: 'We’ve conducted
 extensive research to thoroughly understand what UK women want when it 
comes to real and imagined sex. 

'We discovered that there’s a real 
appetite for provocative and well-written stories about sex, love, 
empowerment and relationships.

BUSIEST IN THE BEDROOM: THE WEST MIDLANDS

More than half of women in the West Midlands (58 per cent) say they have sex at least once a week, making them Britain's busiest in the bedroom.

Women in this region also frequently fantasise about sex, with 15 per cent admitting to having daily fantasies - just above the 
national average of 13 per cent.

Their ultimate sexy scenarios are 
dominance and submission role plays, sex with a fireman or sex on a 
beach.MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIMENT: THE SOUTH EAST

The
 nation’s naughtiest women reside in the South East with 73 per cent 
having tried everything from bondage to threesomes, more than anywhere 
else in the country and five per cent above the national 
average.

At the top of the list of sexploits was using toys (51 per cent), 
closely followed by having sex in public (40 per cent) and bringing food into 
the bedroom (35 per cent).MOST LIKELY TO SHARE FANTASIES WITH FRIENDS: THE SOUTH WEST

Although the majority of British women prefer to discuss sexual matters directly with their partner, those based in Devon, Cornwall and Dorset were most likely to reveal their fantasies to their girlfriends instead.

33 per cent 
said they were more likely to trust their friends with the intimate details of their sexual fantasies - the highest percentage
 in the country and six per cent above the national average.  MOST LIKELY TO SWAP MR DARCY FOR JAMES BOND: SCOTLAND

To no-one's great surprise (least of all Colin Firth), the nation’s favourite fictional hero is the 
quintessentially British Mr Darcy.

But not in Scotland, where women prefer a more daring man in the shape of James Bond, currently played by Daniel Craig.

Scottish women also chose to go their own way when asked to pick their ideal A-list date, with the majority plumping for Hugh Jackman instead of the national favourite, George Clooney.

MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIMENT IN SECRET: THE EAST MIDLANDS

Women
 in the East Midlands are more adventurous than you think but you would 
never know it because they are the most reluctant to divulge details of 
their secret sex lives.

72 per cent of women have experimented 
with adventurous sex activities but 87 per cent of these would
 rather keep it a secret.

Top sexy activities included using sex toys, bringing food into the bedroom, having sex in 
public, bondage and role play. MOST LIKELY TO REVEAL BEDROOM SECRETS: WALESThere’s
 no holding back in Wales - women from this region are the most 
comfortable discussing their secret sex lives. 

31 per cent would share 
details of their sexploits, compared to the national average of just 23 
per cent.

And when Welsh women aren't talking about sex, they’re fantasising about it, 
with 64 per cent having sexual fantasies once a week or more - five per cent
 more than women from the rest of the UK. MOST LIKELY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE: EAST ANGLIAWomen
 in East Anglia revealed themselves to be the coyest when it comes to 
sex, with almost half (43 per cent) saying they hadn’t experimented with
 their partner - more than 10 per cent below the national average.

36 per cent of respondents said they won't even 
discuss their sex lives with their partner, although that doesn't prevent them from fantasising about it - 59 per cent said they fantasise 
about sex once a week or more.  MOST LIKELY TO  KEEP BEDROOM EXPLOITS A SECRET: THE NORTH EAST

Forget
 discussing undercover sex lives, for those in Newcastle, Durham, Sunderland and the rest of the North East, talking 
about regular sex habits is considered taboo.

Despite 
being one of the most sexually active regions with 56 per cent of women 
having sex once a week or more, the North East is the UK’s region most 
reluctant to discuss their daily sex lives.

38 per cent won’t share the 
details of their regular sex lives with anyone - well above the national 
average of 30 per cent.
