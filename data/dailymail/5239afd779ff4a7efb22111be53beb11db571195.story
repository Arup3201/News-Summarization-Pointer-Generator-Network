Imagine being a young 28-year-old woman, a mother to two children, but instead looking like their grandmother.

This is the reality for Hu Juan of Zhengzhou, of Henan province in north-central China.

Hu is the only person in China, and only one of ten people worldwide who suffer from a rare condition called Cutis laxa, which has caused her to age prematurely.

Hu Juan (pictured left earlier in her twenties and right at 28) suffers from a rare disease called Cutis laxa which has made her face age dramatically

The 28-year-old - who looks more like someone in her 60s or 70s - first noticed the changes after she gave birth to her first child 11 years ago, Shanghaiist reported. 

The condition means the skin on her face and neck has lost its elasticity, causing it to become loose and sag.

It does not affect any other areas of her body, and there is no known treatment or cause for the rare disease.

The disorder has previously plunged her into a deep depression and she once attempted to take her own life. Hu will not look in the mirror and often refuses to leave the house. 

Having a second child did nothing to change the condition of her face, as she hoped it may. 

The woman first developed the disorder after the birth of her first child 11 years ago, and is now seeking cosmetic surgery to try and reverse the effects

The mother of two also said Cutis laxa has caused a rift between her and her eldest son, as he is ashamed she looks so old. Despite this, the woman's husband has reportedly stuck by her side throughout the ordeal.

Last week Hu arrived in Shanghai seeking cosmetic surgery to help alter her appearance to resemble her true age. 

Here an expert team has been assembled to help the woman, which includes a ppsychologist

Though optimistic about regaining her youthful looks, doctors said it's too early to say how successful any surgery could be.
