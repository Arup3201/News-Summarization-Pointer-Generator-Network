New father Danny Care celebrated as Harlequins launched the inaugural Champions Cup with a 25-9 victory over French Top 14 runners-up Castres.

Care darted over in the 66th minute for the only try at Twickenham Stoop just seven days after his partner had given birth to their first child, Blake.

The England scrum-half toasted the highlight of an otherwise lifeless game with a rocking motion of the arms, evoking memories of the goal celebration performed by Bebeto and Romario at the 1994 World Cup.

'I asked Danny before the game if he was going to do what Romario did many years ago when he was playing for Brazil and he duly delivered,' Quins director of rugby Conor O'Shea said.

'Danny is looking forward to four weeks sleeping at Pennyhill Park with England... that's why he wanted to play so well against Castres!

'He's loving it and you can see that. I've said to him the first few weeks are pretty easy though!'

Quins posted an attritional victory over Castres that was far harder than the 25-9 scoreline suggests.

Fly-half Nick Evans was magnificent, setting up the try for Care with an audacious double chip, and kicking 20 points in a flawless evening.

O'Shea was delighted Quins had opened their European campaign with a victory and paid tribute to Joe Marler, who replaced Chris Robshaw as club captain at the start of the season. 

'Joe is an outstanding scrummager and an outstanding leader who I feel has been unfairly questioned,' said O'Shea, who confirmed that Marler left the pitch with a stinger injury.

'That's the world we live in now - people like to comment for the sake of commenting without knowing what's happening behind the scenes.

'I know where he is as a 24-year-old with over 100 games for this club. He has the respect of everyone.'

There is Aviva Premiership representation in each of Saturday's four Champions Cup fixtures.

Sale begin with a home match against Munster, Saracens host Clermont in a repeat of last season's semi-final, Bath travel to Glasgow and Racing Metro clash with Northampton in Paris.
