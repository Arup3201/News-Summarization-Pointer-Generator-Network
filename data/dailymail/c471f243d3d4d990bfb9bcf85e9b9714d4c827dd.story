Danny Care cried on the phone to his mum the last time his World Cup dream was taken away from him by a freak foot injury sustained in a warm-up match against Wales a week before the 2011 tournament.

The tears flowed again the following year when Stuart Lancaster omitted the scrum-half from his first Six Nations squad after a string of alcohol-related offences led to a 16-month driving ban, £10,000 fine and one too many lurid headlines.

For very different reasons, the 27-year-old starts Harlequins European Cup clash with Leinster on Sunday once again on the outside of Lancaster’s match-day squad, after being dropped for England’s final two QBE series matches as the result of indifferent displays against New Zealand and South Africa.

But with less than 10 months until the start of England’s World Cup campaign, the 50-cap Quin has no intention of staying out in the cold for long again and facing another tearful call home.

‘I was devastated when I missed out on the last World Cup,’ he said. ‘I’d been in the squad for three years previously with the main goal of wanting to play in a World Cup. Then to have that taken away a week before we were due to leave was incredibly hard to take.

‘I’d got mum and dad their plane tickets as a present. I rang my mum on the Monday after I’d had the scan and said, “I think you’ll be the only ones going”. There were some tears. I was pretty devastated.’

If he thought that phone call was tough, the one he had to make the following season — after two drunken nights that landed him in hot water with Lancaster and the police — was even tougher. ‘The hardest thing was calling my mum and saying, “Sorry mum, I’ve messed up here”,’ he said.

‘My mum and dad were dead upset. It wasn’t just that people were writing stuff about me but it involved my whole family. For my grandad to be picking up the paper and having to read that about his grandson wasn’t nice.

‘I don’t think I had a drink problem but my problem was that, on nights out, I’d just get too excited. I loved being with the lads. Typical rugby lads just going out and having too much of a good time. My mum always said from the day I could walk I was always the one near the trouble. I knew I had to change something. When it started affecting people apart from me, that’s when it really hit home.’

Three years later, Care is a dad to eight-week old son Blake and an altogether calmer figure, despite suddenly finding himself third in England’s pecking order behind Ben Youngs and Richard Wigglesworth.

It was a decision that prompted indignation at Quins, with Nick Evans claiming his half-back partner had been made a ‘scapegoat’ for England’s failings while director of rugby Conor O’Shea was only slightly less vociferous in making clear what he thought of Care’s omission.

‘It’s not a nice feeling to be high as a kite one week, going from playing against the best teams in the world, winning your 50th cap at Twickenham, to being on the bench against Sale at home a week later,’ said Care.

‘It’s hard to take but that is what any professional sportsman has to go through. It’s how you react in adversity and the bad times that makes the good times even better.

Care hopes to impress with Harlequins in European clashes

‘It’s up to me to get that shirt back. I’ve been in this position before and it just fuels the fire. As a professional sportsman you learn to deal with it. You just have to get back on the horse and show people what you can do.

‘A home World Cup is going to be massive and I’m unbelievably determined not to miss out on another big tournament.’

For some of Quins’ England contingent, back-to-back European clashes against Ireland’s strongest province may not appear the perfect antedote to what was a gruelling autumn international series.

For Care, the timing could not be better. ‘Stuart said before I left camp that he’d pick whoever was playing the best ahead of the next Six Nations game against Wales in February,’ he said.

‘That’s perfect for me and the other lads. I have two high-profile games to show what I can do and prove people wrong.’
