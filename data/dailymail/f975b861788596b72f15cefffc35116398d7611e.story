Rory McIlroy has ended his relationship with Caroline Wozniacki, according to reports.

Sources close to the pair claim the Irish golfer broke off from the Danish tennis star days after she posted a 'mean' picture on Twitter showing him fast asleep and open-mouthed with his glasses on.

Friends say there was no way back as McIlroy attempts to recapture the form that took him to world No 1.

Wozniacki, 23, is said to be 'absolutely devastated'.

End of the line? Friends say Rory McIlroy and his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki have split after two years together

'Pretty mean thing to do': Friends say the golfer's decision came last month days after Wozniacki posted this embarrassing picture on Twitter of McIlroy fast asleep with the message: 'Jetlag? Lol!!'

A source told the Sunday Independent: 'Yes they are over. It's a difficult time for them both but it is for the best in the long run.'

The paper said the split came days after Wozniacki last month posted an embarrassing picture online of the two-time major winner asleep with the message: 'Jetlag? Lol!!'.

One source said: 'Rory was very upset by it and even Serena Williams pointed out – albeit in a joking way – it was a pretty mean thing to do.'

The source added: 'There were a lot of 
tears. Rory 
has a lot of respect for Caroline and their time together was good, but 
he feels it's time to move on now. And he wishes her nothing but the 
best.'

McIlroy recently confirmed his split with Horizon Sports Management and a legal battle gets underway today.

When contacted by MailOnline, his new PR team said: 'The Communications Clinic does not comment on Rory's private life.'

A spokesman for Wozniacki has not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.

The 24-year-old is now heading to Asia where he will earn around £3million in appearances fees over the next month.

Earlier this year, McIlroy was warned by Britain's greatest-ever golfer Nick Faldo to 'concentrate on golf' after a dramatic slump in form.

Over the last year, the 24-year-old has changed his clubs and his management company while his relationship with Wozniacki is also considered by some as a factor.

Faldo said at the time: 'You have a 
window of opportunity. You have a 20-year window as an athlete. 
Concentrate on golf, nothing else.

'Hopefully,
 when you retire, 40s, 50s, you will have another 40 years to enjoy it.
 So just concentrate on golf. I think there’s a lot going on in his 
mind.'

Last December, the pair were forced to deny rumours they were engaged after Wozniacki was spotted wearing a huge diamond ring on her wedding ring finger.

Speculation first began when the tennis star was seen flashing the diamond and sapphire jewel as she arrived at Brisbane International Airport.

However, it's also tradition for Danish women to wear their engagement and wedding rings on the right hands, indicating that the jewel may have just been a recent Christmas present.
