Autism is mainly caused by a child’s genes, a major study of British twins has found.

Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness.

The research, by King’s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. 

Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution.

With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles.

Estimates suggest that as many as one in 100 people in the UK now has autism.

But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics.

The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common.

They found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones.  

The study, in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, concluded that rogue DNA explains between 74 and 98 per cent of the cause of the average case of autism.  

If genes are key, the recent rise in cases could be explained by more people being correctly diagnosed with the condition.

Dr Francesca Happe told the BBC: ‘Our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism. The main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition.’

Dr Judith Brown, of the National Autistic Society, said: ‘Autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes, but with non-genetic factors too.

‘This large population-based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share.’ But she added: ‘We are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism.

‘What people with the condition, their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives.’

The study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis, between the ages of 12 and 14.

Lead researcher Beata Tick said: ‘This study shows that the genes are very important and the increased rate of autism is more down to awareness than environmental factors.’

Latest figures suggest more than one in 100 people in Britain has autism, including related conditions such as Asperger’s syndrome. This is a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago.

Symptoms vary, but usually revolve around difficulty with social interaction, communication problems and a need for a strict routine.

Many patients are treated with speech and behavioural therapy. Although drugs can be prescribed to control symptoms such as aggression or hyperactivity, there is no cure.
