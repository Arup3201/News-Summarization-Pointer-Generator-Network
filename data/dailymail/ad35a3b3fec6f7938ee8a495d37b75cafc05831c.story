Hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' during Bill Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour on Friday night.

The hecklers then marched out of the theater in Hamilton as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react.

Cosby is facing growing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. 

He has denied the allegations through his lawyer, has never been charged and has never publicly spoken of them publicly.

The walk-out during Friday's show came a day after a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian 'a rapist'.

It also took place just minutes after Cosby acknowledged the controversy that has followed him on the tour, with protesters camping outside the venues with sandwich boards.

'Whatever happens here tonight if there's some sort of outburst, we just have to remain calm and things will be taken care of. It oughtn't last that long,' he told the audience.

'I want to thank all of you here tonight because you stayed with what you believed in.'

An announcement at the start of the show warned the audience there might be attempts to disrupt the show and urged ticket holders to remain calm until the matter 'is resolved'.

Security at the venue was tight — bags were searched and police officers and private security guards were posted along the aisles of the theatre.

The three shows in Canada were Cosby's first since November when he had a string of performances canceled over the accusations.

Many protesters took aim at the venues that agreed to let Cosby perform in light of the scandal plaguing him.

During a rare moment in Thursday night's show at the same venue, Cosby alluded to his sexual assault scandal. 

As he saw a woman getting up from the front row of the theater, Cosby asked where she was going.

She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him,  according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event.

He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.'   

The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. 

Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. 

Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'.  

Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night 

Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. 

The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. 

One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. 

Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. 

Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. 

Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. 

He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row.
