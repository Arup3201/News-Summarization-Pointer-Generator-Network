Former Buffalo Bills quarter back Kevin Kolb was held in jail for almost 12 hours after being arrested for boating while intoxicated over the weekend.

The 29-year-old, who is not currently playing in the NFL, was arrested on Saturday morning in Willacy County, Texas, by Parks & Wildlife officials and was locked up at 2.44am.

Kolb was released by a Justice of the Peace at 1.11pm after paying a £1750 bond, according to TMZ.

Kolb signed a two-year deal with the Buffalo Bills in 2013, but was released by the team in March this year after suffering a concussion during a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins

Despite signing a £7million two-year contract with the Buffalo Bills in 2013, Kolb didn't play a game last season after suffering a concussion during a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins.

He was initially put in injury reserve, but was released by the team in March this year.

It has been speculated that the injury may have ended Kolb's career, but he has denied this.

Before playing for the Bills, the father-of-two, played for the Arizona Cardinals and the Philadelphia Eagles.

After earning Conference USA Offensive Most Valuable Player of the Year honors in 2006 while playing for the University of Houston, Kolb was drafted to the Eagles in 2007.
