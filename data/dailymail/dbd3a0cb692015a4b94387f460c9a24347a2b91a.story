The Chancellor is expected to announce the Treasury's funding of the investigation into six major banks 

George Osborne will today offer a blank cheque to fraud investigators seeking to bring bankers accused of rigging currency markets to justice.

The Chancellor will write to the Serious Fraud Office urging it to pursue a ‘blockbuster case’ against traders who clubbed together to fix foreign exchange (forex) rates.

Six banks were this week fined after it emerged City workers were making what they called ‘free money’ by fixing currency rates in the 60 seconds before the close of trading and then making huge cash transfers.

Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and Bank of America were handed a total of £2.6billion in fines from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for the latest scam.

Regulators discovered that some of the manipulation of the £3trillion-a-day forex market was taking place even as the banks were being probed over a previous scandal over interbank lending rate Libor.

The SFO is in the early stages of a major forex investigation. Funding for such probes – so-called ‘blockbuster cases’ – is provided with agreement with the Treasury. 

It provided more than £10million to pursue criminal wrongdoing in the Libor scandal – and is expected to make a similar sum available for the latest probe. 

Mr Osborne is expected to say: ‘We must continue to pursue criminal wrong-doing at the highest level; I have always made sure that the SFO has the funds it requires for its investigations.

‘I understand that the SFO is in the early stages of a major investigation into Forex trading. Given the importance of this work, the Treasury will provide the required funding for this investigation.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the public was ‘seething’ at the latest scandal.

‘I hope [the SFO] will bring people to book,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘People are seething with anger that they’re having to endure cuts and savings for year after year after year because of not only irresponsible, in some cases possibly criminal, behaviour by bankers.’

Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market 

Mr Clegg said it had not yet been decided what the Government would do with the £1.1billion of fines levied by the UK regulator. Fines over the Libor rate scandal have been used to support military charities and other good causes.

In the latest scam, investigators found traders formed groups to help them manipulate currency exchange rates that would profit the banks at the expense of clients. 

Transcripts of conversations show how the traders referred to ‘free money’ and not wanting other ‘numpties’ in the market to know what they were doing.

As well as inflating profits for their banks, traders are suspected of using the scam to boost their bonuses. 

Martin Mallett was fired this week for 'serious misconduct' 

The Bank of England last night faced calls from MPs to reveal why it sacked a senior official criticised for his role in the forex rigging scandal.

Mystery surrounds the dismissal of chief currency dealer Martin Mallett, fired this week for ‘serious misconduct’ after 28 years at the central bank, just 24 hours before six of the world’s biggest banks were fined £2.6billion over the scam.

The Bank said Mr Mallett’s dismissal ‘was not at all related’ to the scandal, but to a breach of the Bank’s ‘internal policies’.

Last night two MPs on the Treasury Committee called on the Bank to explain precisely why he had been sacked. 

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘The Bank clearly has a duty to give that information – preferably publicly.’ 

Tory MP Mark Garnier added: ‘We need to find out what happened.’ The committee can exercise Parliamentary privilege to ask for confidential information.

An independent investigation led by Lord Grabiner QC found no evidence any Bank official was aware of the actions of the traders.

But it also found Mr Mallett was ‘uncomfortable’ with traders’ practices but ‘did not escalate the matter’. 

The Bank of England declined to comment.
