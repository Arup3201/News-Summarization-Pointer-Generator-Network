At least three people have died in flooding that is causing havoc across the Midwest.

In all three deaths - two at the same spot in Indiana and one in Missouri - vehicles were swept off the road in flash floods.

The flooding was started by torrential rain last week which caused the Mississippi and many other rivers to surge in Missouri, 
Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana.

And the misery is not over as forecasters say more rain is expected tonight and tomorrow in many places.

Flood waters claimed the life of 
an Indiana man and Missouri woman after their vehicles were submerged as
the Midwest braces for potentially record-level flooding and torrential
downpour.

Robert Morgan, 64, of Arcadia, Indiana, died Friday attempting to drive his car through the rising water.

He was carried 100 yards 
downstream in Hamilton County, according to a 
statement from the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office.

Police responded to a 911 call from a 
motorist who said his vehicle was sinking in the same spot  where Morgan's car was submerged.

Upon arrival, rescuers found an unoccupied truck 200 feet from the 
roadway. The phone that called 911 belonged to an Arcadia resident, but 
the owner had not been found, police said.

Also killed was a still unidentified 80-year-old woman in De Soto, Missouri. The woman's car was washed off Veteran's Drive on Thursday afternoon, Fox St. Louis reported.

Spots south of St. Louis are not
expected to crest until late this week, and significant flooding is 
possible in many places.

Adding to concern is the forecast. 
National Weather Service meteorologist Julie Phillipson said an inch of 
rain is likely in many places tonight and into Tuesday, some places 
could receive more than that.

Torrential rains over the last few days have led to flooding in parts
of Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, resulting
in blocked roads, closed schools and rescues by boat from homes 
surrounded by flood waters.

An all-too-familiar springtime ritual played out around the nation’s 
heartland this weekend as volunteers, National Guardsmen and even prison
inmates joined together in an effort to ward off fast-rising 
floodwaters.

Dangerously high waters 
dotted at least six Midwestern states following torrential rains this 
past week that dumped up to 7 inches in some locations. Record flooding 
was possible in some places as dozens of rivers overflowed their banks.

Homes and businesses have been evacuated across several states as waters continue rising

River towns are not yet in the clear:
An inch or more of rain is in the forecast as well as continuing 
accumulation of snow to the north, especially in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas.

Flood watchers along both the 
Missouri and Mississippi rivers know that once that snow - record levels
in some cases - melts, a lot of it ends up in the big rivers.

In scenic Grafton, a small tourist 
town 40 miles north of St. Louis, floodwater 3 inches deep seeped into 
the basement of Pam and Dennis Bick's home where they've lived for four 
decades.

'We have time to figure out what to 
do, where we would go and where we would put everything,' Pam Bick, 57, 
said. 'I don't want it to come up any more. But I can't stop it.'

The
water levels forced evacuations, closed roads, swamped hundreds of 
thousands of acres of farmland and shut down much of the upper 
Mississippi River to barge traffic.

Two
Mississippi River bridges were closed and a third was shut down for a 
few hours after 114 barges broke loose Saturday night south of St. Louis
and floated down the fast-moving river toward Jefferson Barracks Bridge
in St. Louis County.

The Missouri Department of Transportation shut 
down the bridge at 2 a.m. Sunday for an inspection; it reopened at 8 
a.m.

Because of 
the danger posed by the runaway barges, the U.S. Coast Guard shut down a
15-mile stretch of the river, much of which was already effectively 
closed between the Quad Cities and north of St. Louis after the Army 
Corps of Engineers shut down most locks in that stretch or river.

Coast
Guard Petty Officer Michael Weelmaa said the barges had been moored 
along the side of the river when they broke free, and it wasn’t clear 
how that happened.

By midmorning Sunday, all of the barges had been 
corralled with help from several St. Louis-area tow operators, Weelmaa 
said.

Several Mississippi River towns north of St. Louis were expected to see crests sometime Sunday, including Clarksville, Mo.

Volunteers
in the tiny community have worked endlessly since Wednesday to build a 
makeshift sandbag levee that seemed to be holding as the crest— expected
to be 11 feet above flood stage — approached. Even prisoners from 
far-away Jefferson City were brought in to help.

Richard
Cottrell, 64, emerged from his two-story brick home — dating to 1845, 
the oldest dwelling in town — around breakfast Sunday to walk his beagle
and survey Mississippi’s persistent rise.

A sandbag wall just in front 
of his house was holding the river at bay as workers a half a block away
hustled to fortify it.

After two days of endless sandbagging, Cottrell thought he could rest
Saturday night, but the constant beeping of heavy equipment outside and
flood worries kept him up.

'I had a rough night last night. I had an anxiety attack,' said Cottrell, who also owns a downtown antique store.

Trish
Connelly, 57, was optimistic the town would beat back the river. Her 
plan to open a new fine arts gallery downtown this weekend were on hold 
“until we know what the river is going to do,” she said.

'This is frustrating for people,' Connelly said. 'This isn’t as bad as 2008, but thank God it stopped raining.'

Gov.
Jay Nixon on Saturday toured the unprotected-by-choice town that was 
also flooded in 2008, 2001, 1998, 1995 and many times before that.

'The
water is continuing to rise but it is our full hope and expectation 
that these walls will hold,' Nixon said of the sandbag levees. 
Clarksville has a flood protection system in which a temporary levee — 
aluminum slats filled with sand — can be built if the river rises, but 
the Mississippi was too quick this time.

Recreational
traffic on the river has been halted, too, including the Mark Twain 
Riverboat that offers excursions at scenic Hannibal, Mo. Owner and pilot
Steve Terry has moored the ship since Thursday, with no end in sight.

Even
crossing the river was difficult. One of two bridges at Quincy, Ill., 
closed Friday, and the narrow two-lane bridge at the Missouri town of 
Louisiana was shut down Saturday. To get across, people in the 
Louisiana, Mo., area either had to drive 35 miles north or 50-plus miles
south.

Louisiana,
Mo., resident Erica Campbell, whose rented home in a low-lying area of 
town was flooded for the second time in three years, and she said she’s 
had enough. Campbell, her husband and their eight kids are packing up.

'We’re planning to move to the country — as far away from water as I can get,' Campbell, 35, said.

Smaller
rivers across the Midwest were swelling, too. In Illinois, heavy 
equipment manufacturer Caterpillar will shut down its East Peoria, Ill.,
factory Sunday as the Illinois River approaches an expected 30-foot 
crest early next week.

Several
Indiana towns were threatened by high water, forcing hundreds of 
evacuations.

The Wabash River in Tippecanoe County reached more than 14 
feet above flood stage on Saturday, the highest level since 1958. 
Indiana Gov. Mitch Pence took a helicopter tour Saturday of damage in 
Kokomo, Tipton and Elwood.

The
mayor of Grand Rapids, Mich., declared a state of emergency Saturday, 
the same day high water forced the evacuation of the Courtyard Marriott 
Hotel and an apartment building.
