A big cat sanctuary has been branded 'dangerous and irresponsible' after allowing a glamour model stage a raunchy photoshoot in its cheetah enclosure.

Tattoo model Lusy Logan, who has a cheetah inked on across her temple, posed for a series of pictures with animals at the Wildlife Heritage Foundation in Smarden, Kent.

The Captive Animals’ Protection Society branded the shoot 'unethical', but the sanctuary said neither the safety of the animals or model was at risk.

Courting controversy: The Captive Animals’ Protection Society branded Miss Logan's shoot with the cheetah's 'unethical', but the sanctuary said neither the safety of the animals or model was at risk

Passionate: Miss Logan describes herself as an 'internationally published tattoo model and animal lover'

A provocatively dressed Miss Logan is seen posing with the cats in a video set to slow-motion electronic music that was posted to her YouTube Channel.

The 24-year-old strikes various poses while wearing a leopard-print halterneck dress, at one point even stroking one of the leopards.

Miss Logan describes herself as an 'internationally published tattoo model and animal lover'.

She said on YouTube: 'This photoshoot was in aid of the decreasing number of big cats, the people trying to save them and my passion for these beautiful creatures.

'Please donate, follow and support this sanctuary they do an amazing job!'

'Please donate, follow and support this sanctuary they do an amazing job!' Defending the decision to allow her to do the photoshoot, WHF spokesman Tanith Brown hailed Miss Logan's work to raise awareness of them

The Wildlife Heritage Foundation (WHF) does not open to the public but says it offers paid-for 'experiences' with animals.

But Captive Animals’ Protection Society director Liz Tyson said it was 'shocking' to find that 'animals are now being rented out for photoshoots.'

'Allowing close interactions between members of the public and dangerous wild animals is unethical, irresponsible and extremely dangerous,' she said.

She added: 'To call the continued use of animals in this way an accident waiting to happen is perhaps an understatement.

'We have numerous examples of people either deliberately or innocently coming into contact with wild animals with tragic results.

'It is time we all seriously question the keeping of these animals in captivity; not just for their sake, but for ours too.'

Opposition: Captive Animals¿ Protection Society director Liz Tyson said it was 'shocking' to find that 'animals are now being rented out for photoshoots' and questioned whether they should be in captivity at all

Safety: Ms Tyson also warned that using animals for such frivolous ends was 'an accident waiting to happen'

'Our cats come first every time': Foundation spokesman Ms Brown said that she couldn't see anything negative about the photoshoot, adding that they would 'never jeopardise' the cats they care for

WHF spokesman Tanith Brown said: 'We do up-close experiences with our smaller cats so they are used to having close contact with people.

'The animals aren’t being rented out and we certainly wouldn’t do anything to put them or the animals at risk.'

She added: 'Lusy does a lot of good publicity to raise awareness and good conservation work.

'All she did was stand and pose for photographs. I can’t see anything negative about what she’s done. Our cats come first every time and we would never jeopardise their welfare.'

The WHF posted on its Facebook page: 'Lusy Logan is a great model who spent a few hours at WHF to help promote the work we are doing and have a photoshoot in with some of the cats.

'Lusy has a real passion in helping wildlife as you can see she is not worried about how close the cats get.'
