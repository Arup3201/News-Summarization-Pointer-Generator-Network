Greig Laidlaw sent a strong message to coach Vern Cotter that he is the man to inspire Scotland with arguably his best performance in an international jersey.

However, the diminutive Borderer insisted that his inspiration for steering his side to a thrilling 41-31 win over Argentina at BT Murrayfield had come from the new head coach.

‘I just think it was great for this group of players to have someone like Vern coming in from a team like Clermont, who were pushing the standards in Europe,’ he said.

‘He just really gives us confidence to go and try things. He understands that mistakes happen, that nobody wants to make mistakes, and I made a mistake for the first play of the game. It wasn’t a great pass but I maybe should have just held it and then we were seven points down.

‘But I just thought “park that, mistakes are made and we have a game-plan to go out and play” and, on the whole, we executed that.

‘Vern gives you confidence to do that, I think. He gives you confidence in training to try different things, to express yourself and try to beat players one-on-one, and doesn’t bollock players unless it’s ridiculous — and I think that’s been the key change.’

Laidlaw had found himself switching from scrum-half to stand-off to cover Scottish weaknesses in recent years and, while he was delighted to answer Scotland’s call wherever needed, there is little doubt that it asked a lot of the relatively new international to flit between two different roles and the mental complexities that each position brings.

Add on the responsibility for goal-kicking, while striving to lead a struggling Edinburgh side, and there is perhaps no surprise that his own form wavered at times.

He took the decision to leave Edinburgh this year and has found a new lease of life at Gloucester, where his quality of service has quickened, his speed over the ground has improved and his confidence is bubbling up again.

The result is that, installed back in the No 9 jersey and asked to captain the side when first choice Grant Gilchrist was injured, Laidlaw stepped up to the plate last night and guided the team to one of the most convincing wins witnessed against a top-10 nation at Murrayfield.

‘I have got the spring back in my step,’ he said. ‘Going down to Gloucester, it’ s a very hard competition and you get to understand pretty quickly there that they are hard games week in, week out and you have to win games. So they are all pressure games and that has helped me.

‘But just going to a new club helped me where you want to prove yourself again, and so you have to work hard. But also coming back up here I knew that Chris Cusiter and Henry (Pyrgos) were also playing well and that was pushing me too for today’s performance.

‘I enjoyed the game out there but, as Vern said, one to 15 the boys put their bodies on the line so we were all ‘man of the match’ in my eyes.

‘Scoring 41 points… I’ve not done that too many times in a Scotland jersey, and Scotland haven’t done that for a while.

‘But we will keep our feet on the ground because we gave away a couple of soft tries. There are always things to work on, especially with the best team in the world coming to play next week. We’ll need to turn up for that big style.’

Looking ahead to the visit of his native Kiwis, Cotter added that the final quarter where Scotland conceded 21 points would figure prominently in analysis as would the scrums that started to struggle late on.

‘We’ll be very honest about the end of the game and how we conceded penalties,’ he said.

‘We want to be consistent and resilient all over the park and I think sometimes we scrummaged very well and sometimes perhaps didn’t.’
