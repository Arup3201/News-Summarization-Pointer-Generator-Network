A pen hiding a secret pistol that was once given to Lord Mountbatten for his protection is going under the hammer.

The gold-plated pen was given to Lord Mountbatten by his friend The Maharaja of Jodhpur in case he ever got into trouble.

It remained with his family until recently when it was bought by an unknown collector in Yorkshire.

But now the handmade pen - worthy of a James Bond-style scene - is due to be auctioned once again in March and is estimated to fetch between £5,000 and £7,000.

Nicholas Holt, founder of Holt’s Auctioneers which is selling the item, said: 'The Maharaja of Jodhpur built it for his friend in case he got himself in a position where he had to sign something which he did not wish to sign - either to kill himself or the enemy.'

The weapon was this week on display at Holt’s Auctioneers gun valuation day at Orvis, in West Park, Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Mr Holt said the deadly pen pistol would have been specially built for Mountbatten.

The pen, also referred to as a pencil pistol, was built in 1948 and features a 2 3/4in smooth-bore barrel containing a removable propelling pencil mechanism with a concealed trigger.

The outer body is inscribed with the words ‘Gun Shop Jodphur, 1948’.

The gun will be sold by Norfolk-based Holt’s Auctioneers to be included in the sale of Fine Modern and Antique Guns at Princess Louise House, Hammersmith Road, London, on March 21.

Mr Holt said any sale would be subject to strict laws governing the sale of arms and said he hoped that a museum might be interested in buying the item that has played such an important role in the nation’s history.

When the item was last up for sale it was one of a number of military items that belonged to Lord Mountbatten, some of which he used during the Second World War. They reputedly helped to preserve his life.

The collection had been at the Imperial War Museum after legislation following the Dunblane massacre in 1996 banned the ownership of handguns. 

But Lord Mountbatten’s family later decided to sell the items.

James Doyle, store manager at The Orvis Harrogate Store, said: 'It really is a fascinating little thing.

'This item I believe was a part of the mystique which went through that community which led to stories like the Bond stories.'

Lord Mountbatten was a British statesman and naval officer, an uncle of the Duke of Edinburgh, and the last Viceroy of India.

He was killed by a bomb blast on his boat off the coast of Ireland.

One of the earl's twin grandsons, Nicholas, 14, and Paul Maxwell, 15, a local employed as a boat boy, also died in the explosion.

The IRA admitted carrying out the attack.

Lord Mountbatten, who was 79 when he died, and his family had traditionally spent their summer holiday at their castle in County Sligo, north west of Ireland.

They were aboard his boat, Shadow V, which had just set off from the fishing village of Mullaghmore, when the bomb detonated.
