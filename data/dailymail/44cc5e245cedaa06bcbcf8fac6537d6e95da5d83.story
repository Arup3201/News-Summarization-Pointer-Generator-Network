Motorists have been asked to avoid a section of the motorway linking London with Cambridge after the accident, which happened at around 3.30pm

Officers initially believed the crash had involved several vehicles, due to the amount of debris on a stretch of the M11 near Epping in Essex.

But they have now said only a heavy goods vehicle and a car were involved.

An eyewitness told Heart Essex radio station: 'It's the first time I've ever seen them [emergency services] put screens up to shield an accident and throw cloth over the top of cars to cover up what's happened inside.

'There were just cars everywhere - pretty bad.'

Specialist officers are currently at the scene, on the southbound carriageway between junctions six and seven.

The police spokesman said: 'It is a serious collision, and there have been serious injuries. 

'A woman who was a passenger in the car has died. Two other people who were in the vehicle have been taken to hospital with serious injuries.'

The northbound carriageway was also briefly closed to allow an air ambulance to land.

Drivers are being advised to avoid the area, with the road expected to be at least partially closed this evening. 

The southbound carriageway will be closed for several hours while vehicles are recovered and police carry out investigations.

Traffic is being diverted using the A414 towards Chelmsford and the A12 south to the M25 junction 28. 

A police spokesman said any witnesses who have not contacted police or anyone with information about events leading to the collision should call the Essex Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 101 or email collisionappeal@essex.pnn.police.uk.
