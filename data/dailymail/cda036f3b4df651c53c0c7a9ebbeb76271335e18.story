Senior Tory MP Tim Yeo has been cleared of accusations that he abused his position to help green companies lobby ministers.

Mr Yeo, who stepped down as chair of the influential Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee in June, was reinstated yesterday after an inquiry by the sleaze watchdog.

The parliamentary standards committee ruled that his actions - exposed by a newspaper sting operation - had broken no rules.

Undercover reporters, posing as representatives of a fake solar technology company, approached Mr Yeo offering a £7,000-a-day consultancy contract with the firm.

He was filmed saying: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections’.

Asked if that included government minister he said ‘yes’. House of Commons rules prohibit MPs from acting as paid advocates to lobby ministers.

Mr Yeo was also asked about his committee’s questioning of John Smith, managing director of GB Railfreight. The MP did not ask him any questions, after declaring he was a paid director and shareholder of Eurotunnel - its parent company. But he was filmed telling the reporters: ‘I told him [Mr Smith] what to say. Ha ha.’

The standards committee, which is made up from MPs of all parties, concluded he did not expect a financial interest in the company or offer to approach ministers or civil servants on their behalf.

They said it was the undercover reporters who were guilty of ‘subterfuge, misrepresentation and selective quotation’, and went on: ‘Media investigations can have a role to play in ensuring high standards of public conduct but we note that in this case Mr Yeo has broken no rules and the only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves.’

Standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson found there was no evidence he had coached the business associate but did urge Mr Yeo to ‘consider more carefully the impact of his comments’.

But she did called for a wider review into whether committee chairmen’s outside interests should be restricted, saying while these positions could help their work on specialist committees, ‘there is equally a reasonable concern that that Member is then placed in a privileged position which he or she may be able to exploit for their own interests with few checks and balances’.

Mr Yeo, she said, had made clear he could not be a ‘public advocate’ and any ministers would have to judge the merits of the product adding that ‘the integrity of the system here is pretty high’.

A former environment minister under John Major, Mr Yeo’s job as chairman of the committee is to ask tough questions of ministers and firms about Britain’s energy policy.

But the MP for South Suffolk has attracted criticism for earned £400,000 in the past three years from commercial work, much of it linked to the business of green energy. He has also clashed with George Osborne about plans to cut green taxes.

Mr Yeo said in a statement yesterday: ‘I welcome this report. After a full investigation, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner accepted, as I have always maintained, that I did not break the rules of the House.

‘This investigation included a thorough examination of the full video-recording produced - after a six-week delay - to the commissioner by the Sunday Times.

‘Based on what I actually said, rather than what I was reported by the newspaper to have said, the commissioner found and the committee confirms that I have not acted in breach of the code of conduct.’
