A forced kiss will no longer be considered rape in the Netherlands, a court ruled today.

The Dutch Supreme Court narrowed its definition of rape, saying that a ‘forced tongue kiss’ should no longer be regarded among the worst forms of sexual assault.

The ruling came as the court 
overturned a rape conviction of a 36-year-old Dutchman who
forced his tongue into a woman's mouth in a hospital toilet.

Overturned: A 'forced tongue kiss' will no longer be considered rape in the Netherlands

While still illegal, a 'forced kiss' is not as 
serious as forced sexual intercourse, and should be considered indecent 
assault, the court ruled.

It reversed a 1998 Supreme Court decision that broadly defined rape as any form of unwanted sexual penetration.

The
judges ruled that a forced kiss should be considered an indecent 
assault, a crime which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in the Netherlands, as 
opposed to rape, which has a maximum 12-year sentence.

Lawyers for the 36-year-old welcomed the 
ruling, saying that defining a forced kiss as rape could have serious 
consequences if a person is convicted.

‘If
a person has to judge whether somebody is eligible to work in health 
care, for example, and sees that the person has a rape conviction, then 
nine times out of ten he won't be considered suitable,’ lawyer Tjalling 
van der Goot said.

‘The effects (of a conviction) can be much more severe than they should be.’

New rule: Although previously broadly defined as any form of unwanted sexual penetration, the definition of rape as a crime in the Netherlands will no longer include 'forced kiss'

The case will now be sent back to a lower court for reconsideration. The man involved denies he forcibly kissed the victim.

Legally defining rape has been open to interpretation in several European courts.

Neither
British not German courts would qualify a forced tongue kiss as rape. 
In France, it qualifies as rape, although is rarely prosecuted as such.

Dutch groups dealing with victims of sexual abuse have yet to comment on the ruling.
