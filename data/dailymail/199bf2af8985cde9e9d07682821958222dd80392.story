Ambulance officers are kitting themselves out with 'homemade Ebola suits' as they and other health professionals say Australia is 'wide open' for an Ebola crisis and could not contain the virus from becoming an outbreak here.

Paramedics say their gear is so inadequate if they treated a suspected Ebola case tomorrow, they wouldn't be able to go home for fear of infecting their families. 

A source at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs says medical authorities covered up Australia's first Ebola scare on August 10, when a man who had recently flown in from Nigeria was kept in the emergency ward car park for four hours while authorities argued over where he would be treated.

Inadequate: Despite assurances by Australian health authorities that the regular protective gear worn by paramedics (pictured) is sufficient to prevent  'contact and droplet' contamination in Ebola cases, many health care workers are fearful and are making their own "Ebola suits' to wear at work

Homemade: The white jumpsuit and face visor are not provided to ambulance officers and some other health care workers in Australia who are having to scrounge around for gear to keep them safe from Ebola infection.

The real thing: A worker in a full Hazmat suit removes material while cleaning an apartment of a Texas health care worker. Australian health workers have warned that unless they get proper protection, they feel they won't be able to go home to their families after treating a suspected Ebola case

Flimsy: THis small face mask is all health workers like paramedics in NSW are supplied with and they say if someone is vomiting from the Ebola virus, they could be infected by splashes of the fluid from the Ebola victim

Making do: This breathing mask is one of the extra pieces of equipment some health care workers are gathering to make their own kit, should a case of Ebola come to Australia any time soon

An assurance by New South Wales Health's director of communicable diseases, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, last week that 'we're very well equipped and ready' for Ebola cases has angered frontline health workers who says that is 'nonsense' and fear for the safety of their families and friends.

A hospital worker, who spoke to Daily Mail Australia on condition of anonymity, that the case of the Nigerian man - who eventually tested positive for malaria was handled so badly 'that ambulance officers were sent off with potentially Ebola infected gear, Prince of Wales and Royal North Shore hospitals argued over who would take him and there was no follow up about the Ebola issue with the people who handled him'.

The Nigerian man ' ticked all the boxes' of the NSW Health Ebola virus disease patient risk assessment when he was taken to Prince of Wales.

Ultra isolation: This is one of the two designated Ebola High Security Isolation Units at Westmead Hospital, the only hospital in NSW which can test for the deadly virus. Some health workers don't believe there are enough beds for potential Ebola outbreak, although health authorities insist any hospital can take a suspected victim

Well suited: The NSW Fire Brigade's station at Mascot Airport in Sydney (pictured) where paramedics say officers have Hazmat suits, the only gear adequate with which to handle suspected Ebola sufferers flying in from Africa

Completely covered: Health workers from Britain's North East Ambulance Service at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, UK, wear the right gear as they take part in an exercise to test Britain's readiness for an Ebola outbreak

Special training: Westmead Hospital staff including intensive care unit nursing manager Tracey-Lee Osling (pictured) have undergone training for how to deal with an Ebola pateint, but ambulance workers feel they have been left out and are at risk, while staff at an other major Sydney hospital also feel exposed to danger

'As it turned out, he didn't have Ebola,' the source said, 'but if he had and he'd vomited or secreted some fluid the ambos would have done for.

Ambulance staff are issued with a flimsy gown, goggles and a small mask for their ordinary day to day work. They say they have not been given extra Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) which would be adequate to cope with Ebola cases.

They told Daily Mail Australia they are fearful of not being protected and are kitting themselves up by sourcing equipment from other professionals.

'Nothing has been communicated to us, so if a suspected Ebola case turned up tomorrow and I had to deal with it, I'm not going to go home. I couldn't take the risk of infecting my family.'

One worker told Daily Mail Australia she had read in the media that the ambulance service had special vehicles to deal with an Ebola outbreak, but that 'we've been told nothing, we haven't been given any proper gear, it's scary'.

Four hour agony: An ambulance in the Emergency car park at Prince of Wales hospital (pictured) in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where a Nigerian man waited for four hours in August, while doctors argued where the potential Ebola suspect should be treated 

Border security: health care workers have suggested field hospitals be set up at all major airports such as Mascot in Sydney (pictured) to isolate planeloads should a passenger develop Ebola symptoms while en route to Australia from overseas

Daily Mail Australia obtained a set of the ordinary PPE gear worn by ambulance officers, and the special white suit and perspex face visor and breathing mask some officers are kitting themselves up with.

One health professional said the only equipment suitable to deal with an Ebola outbreak belonged to the NSW Fire Service officers, who had 'hazmat' suits and were trained to deal with chemical leaks and similar crises.

'If a person flying to Australia developed symptoms on board tomorrow and a whole planeload of people had to be isolated where would they go?' the health professional said.

No chance: Frontline health care workers in Sydney say they are in no way adequately kitted out to deal with Ebola victims like this Spanish worker (pictured) at Madrid's King Carols II Hospital

'Westmead has two isolation beds and we have been told that is who will be taking Ebola cases.

'Surely the quarantine needs to be contained as swiftly as possible. So why isn't the Federal or State government setting up field hospitals or isolation wards at the major airports?'

Professor Lyn Gilbert from Westmead Hospital, where two Ultra Isolation Rooms have been set up in the intensive care unit, said Westmead was the 'designated' hospital for Ebola cases in NSW.

'Unless there's a good reason why not, any patient with Ebola or who is highly likely to have Ebola will be transferred to Westmead,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'There is a level of anxiety because it is a disease with high mortality, but it can be treated.

'Staff have undergone training and we need to be super sure the staff know what's involved and what the risks are.

'If  a patient developed symptoms on a flight, unless that patient was copiously vomiting, the rest of the people on te plane would be absolutely minimal risk, although they would be anxious.

'The other passengers would be reassured and asked to report any illness developing.

'If there had been significant exposure they would be asked to place themselves in voluntary isolation, take their temperature twice a day and stay in very close contact.'

Professor Gilbert said the Ebola training at Westmead had included a detailed protocol for removing protective gear after dealing with a suspected Ebola patient.

'Gowns, masks and face shields ... have to be taken off with great air in a very strict order and folded from the outside in.

'We have a buddy system, with someone watching and reminding them of the sequence if they forget.'

Dr Vicky Sheppeard  told Daily Mail Australia the Nigerian man who was taken to Prince of Wales hospital in August 'did not require testing for Ebola as he did not meet the case definition'.

How it's done: Aid workers and doctors transfer Spanish priest, Miguel Pajares, who was infected with Ebola while working in Liberia

Protective equipment: One of Westmead Hospital's two ultra isolation rooms (pictured) is stacked with equipment for nurses and doctors to treat Ebola patients, but some health workers say it is not enough if there is a severe outbreak

She said, 'all clinical staff assessing the patient, including paramedics, had the correct Personal Protective Equipment'.

'NSW Health has undertaken extensive preparations to ensure the health system is adequately prepared for the unlikely event of an Ebola case reaching NSW,' she said.

Westmead is the only hospital equipped to test for the Ebola virus in NSW.

Dr Sheppeard said all hospitals 'are equipped to isolate a suspected patient' and that NSW Health had 'held discussion-based exercises via teleconferences at state level ... to ensure staff awareness'.

When told of health workers' fears, she said an Ebola protocol circulated in August had 'alleviated' fears about the levels of personal protection for health workers in NSW.

She said the alleged case of the Nigerian man had never been regarded as a potential Ebola case, although paramedics told Daily Mail Australia the ambulance was roped off during the four hours it sat in the car parkwhile the hospitals argued over admission of the patient.

Daily Mail Australia has asked the Federal Health Minister, Peter Dutton, about national strategies for an Ebola outbreak and the possibility of field hospitals at major airports, but had not received a response at the time of publication.
