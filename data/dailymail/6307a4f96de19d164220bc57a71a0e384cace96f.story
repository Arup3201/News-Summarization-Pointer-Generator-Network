A fashion designer whose clothes have been worn by Cara Delevingne and Paris Hilton has been fined after she pursued a cyclist and deliberately knocked him off his bike following a row. 

Lamis Khamis, 42, was behind the wheel of her black 2.0 litre Audi when she got into a row with a man riding an electric-powered bicycle at a roundabout near Shepherd's Bush Green, in London.

After the man kicked her car, Khamis followed him and drove her car into him at low speed, knocking him off his bike.

Fashion designer to the stars Lamis Khamis has been fined £600 after she followed a cyclist in her car and deliberately knocked him over after the pair had argued and he kicked her Audi on a London roundabout

Khamis was fined £600 after a judge ruled that on her part 'it should not be described as road rage', but added that the cyclist could have been injured. 

The designer launched her own brand in 2001 after she graduated from Camberwell College of Arts. 

She set up a stall to sell her wares in Portobello Market in London and has since then attracted the attention of model Cara Delevingne, who has been pictured wearing her designs, Paris Hilton and musician Chris Brown. 

At a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and a valid MOT on May 17.

The court heard that after the cyclist kicked the side of her car as they argued at the roundabout he made a dent, costing around £300 to repair. 

Recorder John Gallagher said: 'He rode off, but because his cycle had no registration plate you followed in an attempt to obtain details from him.

'You, in an attempt to stop him, drove into him and he fell off his cycle. Your actions were deliberate, but it was not a case of running a person down because you were only travelling at 10mph and he sustained no injuries.

'However, this was a deliberate act and he might well have been injured and you did not consider the risks and alternatives.' 

Mr Gallagher also gave Khamis six penalty points on her licence. 

But he added: 'You are a mature lady who has never been in trouble with the police in the past and you have a clean driving licence and in twenty years have had no disqualifications.'

The court heard that the prosecution had previously dropped a more serious charge of dangerous driving.  

Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and was fined, after the judge ruled the incident was not one of road rage, but that the victim could have been injured in the incident
