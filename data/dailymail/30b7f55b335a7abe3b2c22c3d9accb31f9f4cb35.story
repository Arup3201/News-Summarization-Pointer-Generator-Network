Steven Gerrard again covered every blade of grass in the midfield battle

Their shoulders were sunk, their faces long. This was supposed to be the day when Anfield hosted its biggest party for 24 years but ultimately it became the setting for a wake.

No matter that Liverpool signed off an impressive campaign with the runners-up spot after beating Newcastle United; the emptiness of falling short of the ultimate dream as Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez and Co strolled around Anfield was palpable.

For Brendan Rodgers, however, this was no time for despondency. Gloom had descended following the results against Chelsea and Crystal Palace that fatally damaged their title aspirations but, to lift the mood in the dressing room, Liverpool's manager took his squad back to the first day of the campaign.

Before that opening contest against Stoke, he read out a letter that had been sent to him by a supporter.

Ratings by Dominic King at Anfield

The fan, named Ben, explained about 
his pride in Liverpool and his faith that this could be a memorable 
season. Sensing the need to put into perspective what they have 
achieved, Rodgers felt the need to provide his group with a reminder.

'He
 told us not to just think about fourth (place) but think about winning 
(the title),' said Rodgers, taking up the story. 'At the time, probably 
the staff and the players thought it was a bit far-fetched. But I truly 
believed we could progress and (before the Newcastle match) I read the same letter back 
again.

'All the words 
that went back into the players' minds were the same as the beginning of
 the season. Now the word that comes from this is belief. We will 
improve. We will get better next season and we will be able to fight 
again as we have got belief.'

It will be difficult to see images of
 Manchester City with the trophy they covet so much but once the 
frustration subsides over the coming weeks and months, Liverpool will be
 able to reflect on a campaign that has given them a base to attack the 
top on a regular basis.

Though
 they had to work hard for victory here, coming from behind to snatch 
the points with goals from two Daniels, Agger and Sturridge, they 
dazzled for long periods and taking 37 points from the last 42 available
 is clear evidence they are capable of championship-winning consistency.

Mending
 the wobbly defence is a prerequisite when the transfer window opens - 
Newcastle, with more poise, could have had this contest wrapped up 
before half-time - but should Rodgers do that, Liverpool will continue 
to be a threat.

'We
 will get better,' Rodgers insisted. 'The style will be enhanced and 
improved. The philosophy here is very much based on attacking creative 
play. We just need to be better and more concentrated when we are 
winning other games. But there will be no fear.'

Ow no! Martin Skrtel puts through his own goal to give Newcastle an early lead

Now what we had planned: Skrtel (right) cannot hide his despair following the first-half concession

Silver service: Newcastle celebrate their unlikely opener in the 20th minute

Frustration: Daniel Agger rues a missed chance as Liverpool tried to find an equaliser

Realisation: Liverpool fans react to news that Manchester City had taken the lead against West Ham

No goal: Suarez had a first-half effort disallowed by Phil Dowd, who had not seen the striker's quick free-kick

So close: Luis Suarez shows his frustration as Liverpool's title hopes faded

His words were as 
impressive as the show of support that came before the game. As has 
become the habit, Liverpool's fans lined Anfield Road with flags and let
 off flares to greet the team bus. Inside the stadium, the club DJ 
provided a soundtrack with hits from their glorious past.

There
 was even a rendition of 'Bubbles' to show that Red allegiances on this 
day were also with West Ham United, who needed to provide the ultimate 
favour and beat City if Liverpool were to win their 19th 
title.

In reality, the 
fairytale scenario never threatened to come true. Liverpool were scruffy
 in the opening 45 minutes. Newcastle, by contrast, showed plenty of 
fight and spirit and deservedly took the lead when Martin Skrtel 
horribly sliced Yoan Gouffran's cross past Simon Mignolet in the 20th 
minute.

That
 was the 12th goal Liverpool had conceded in the last six matches and it
 nearly became 13 when Gouffran skipped clear but succeeded only in 
shooting straight at Mignolet after Shola Ameobi had split Liverpool's 
defence open. Expectations at that point deflated like a punctured 
balloon.

'We couldn't 
have ended the season in that way,' Rodgers said. 'We needed to put that
 behind us.'

To their credit, Liverpool's response was impressive. Full 
of energy and movement, they began pressing and Newcastle were 
powerless to prevent themselves being pushed back deeper and deeper. 
Eventually they cracked.

Clash: Paul Dummett was sent off following a challenge which felled Suarez

On the run: Joe Allen tries to get away from Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko

Raheem Sterling again provided evidence ofwhy he should be included in Roy Hodgson’s23-man squad with an energetic display thatcaused Newcastle problems and showed howmuch he has progressed in the second half ofseason.

Daniel Sturridge also made his markwith the winning goal. He was quiet in the firsthalf but improved and was given a standingovation when substituted.

Glen Johnson didnothing to harm his position as first-choiceright back, and Steven Gerrard and JordanHenderson were solid.

Uruguay, meanwhile, will be relieved to seeLuis Suarez end the campaign unscathed.

Parity
 was secured in the 64th minute when, after foul by Vurnon Anita on 
Sterling, Gerrard swung a deep free-kick beyond the far post to Agger, 
who divert the ball back past Tim Krul; 60 seconds later, an identical 
set piece from another cheap foul presented Sturridge with the chance to
 win the game.

From 
that point, Newcastle lost their discipline. Ameobi was sent off for 
persistent dissent - a decision by referee Phil Dowd that left Alan 
Pardew perplexed - and he was followed by substitute Paul Dummett, who 
went in late on Suarez.

'The
 referee could have managed the game better,' Pardew observed. 'We had a
 good game plan and played well but Liverpool have been fantastic. We 
haven't been good enough in the second half of the season but we will 
come back stronger.'

Rodgers
 echoed with the last part of that statement, maintaining Liverpool 
'will be better'; if they are true to his word, the dream may yet be 
fulfilled.
