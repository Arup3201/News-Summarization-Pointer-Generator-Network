Everyone has experienced having an advert jingle or catchy slogan stuck in their head.

But a new concept is literally putting adverts straight into people's skulls by using 'bone conduction - the transfer of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull.

Advertising agency BBDO is using a combination of the concept and clever technology to allow individual commuters to hear an advert in a noisy train carriage.

The company is harnessing technology to allow train windows to silently talk to commuters in a new product placement strategy.

Tired commuters resting their heads against train windows in Germany got a surprise when they heard a voice inside their heads.

Transmitters on a train route between Munich and North Rhine-Westphalia send high-frequency vibrations to windowpanes, allowing commuters to hear advertising messages through bone conduction.

The messages cannot be heard by the rest of the train passengers expect the commuter whose head is in direct contact with the window pane.

The sound transmission technology is currently used in some headphone and hearing aids as well as by the military.

Passengers on the train heard an advert promoting Sky Deutschland's new mobile app.

The campaign was the brainchild of BBDO in Dusseldorf, which launched the prototypes back in January.

A spokesman from the agency told Mashable: 'Passengers got surprised and enjoyed this new form of advertising' adding that they had 'highly encouraging first reactions by commuters and our client'.

There are no immediate plans to roll out talking window panes across Germany's train network.

However, BBDO said that the technology could be used for entertainment as well as advertising so that commuters could listen to music or get transport information by leaning their heads against the glass.

The technology reportedly surprised commuters when it was rolled out on a German train service

BBDO said that the technology could also be used for entertainment and informative messages
