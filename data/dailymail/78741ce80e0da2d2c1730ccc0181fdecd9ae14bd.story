A staff member has found what is being described by police as a 'deceased human fetus' in a bathroom at a Texas high school.

Authorities in east Dallas are now looking for a student they believe gave birth inside Woodrow Wilson High School during class time on Friday.

A maintenance worker made the disturbing discovery in a trash can in a second-floor girls' bathroom around 2:30pm.

Police are reviewing security footage to determine who the mother of the fetus is and have referred to the girl or woman as a 'suspect.'

A spokesperson for the Dallas Independent School District said the mother is likely a student at the school.

'[The bathroom] could be used by staff members, but it's predominantly used by students,' Jon Dahlander told Fox 4.

Woodrow Wilson has approximately 1,600 students, according to CBS.

So far, police have not revealed a suspect and have asked anyone with any information to come forward.

'We're reviewing video, talking to the teachers, trying to determine if anybody has any knowledge of any student that may have had something going on in their life, and pray,' Major John Lawton with the Dallas Police Department told Fox 4.

Police have not revealed the developmental stage of the the fetus.

Detectives with the Dallas Police Department's Child Abuse unit are investigating the incident and are hoping the mother of the fetus will come forward voluntarily.

Counselors were called to the school on Friday to help students and staff after the shocking discovery and still on-hand Tuesday as students return from the long weekend.

'The district encourages parents and families to discuss the situation with their students, and when appropriate, encourage their students to meet with counseling staff at the school,' the school district said in a statement.

'Dallas ISD will continue to provide additional support and resources to the school community during this difficult time.'
