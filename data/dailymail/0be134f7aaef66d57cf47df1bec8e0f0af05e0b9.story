Nike has been forced to remove a pair of tattoo-style leggings from its range after they were criticised for being culturally exploitative.

The monochrome printed garments have sparked controversy in Australia and New Zealand where residents say the design of the Pro Tattoo Tech Tights is similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo.

New Zealand's ONE News reports that by using the traditionally male print on women's leggings, Nike has offended many people in the Pacific community, who find it to be exploitative in the first place.

Nike's Pro Tattoo Tech Tights have sparked controversy in Australia and New Zealand where some people say the design is too similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo

New Zealand parliament member Su'a William Sio told ONE News: 'Before you launch into something like this, there's generally a consultation.'

'I don't think Nike has taken the time to do that.'

The Nike Pro Tattoo Tech collection was unveiled over a month ago and it was noted that they had taken inspiration from the tatau - the traditional tattoos - of Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand.

An online petition against the leggings was posted in early August on Change.org petition, which described them as a 
'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific, and is 
furthermore in violation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples'.

Some 750 people signed an online petition against the leggings, posted in early August, which described the leggings as a 'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific'

Nike were quick to withdraw the leggings after 750 people signed the petition and the sports brand released the following statement: 'The Nike Tattoo Tech collection was inspired by tattoo graphics.

'We apologise to anyone who views this design as insensitive to any specific culture. No offence was intended.'

Facebook users, however, didn't seem to find the leggings offensive.

One user wrote: 'Oh that's ridiculous. People are too sensitive. It's a pair of leggings. How is that offensive. The culture has inspired the fashion.'

Facebook users didn't seem to find the leggings offensive and said that we should share cultures to educate each other

Another added: 'We should all be willing to share our cultures in order to educate others so we have a greater understanding of each other.'

While another said: 'This is really beautiful,,, i'm sorry where is the racism here? I can't see that, i can't see anything offending!'
