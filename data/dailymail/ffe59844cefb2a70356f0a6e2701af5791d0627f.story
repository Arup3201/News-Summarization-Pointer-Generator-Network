He's conquered the music charts and now Justin Bieber is taking the perfume world by storm.

Last night the 18-year-old beat David Beckham and Kim Kardashian as his debut scent Someday was branded Best New Celebrity Fragrance 2012 by the Fragrance Foundation UK.

And the Canadian will also be receiving the highly coveted Elizabeth Taylor award at the 40th annual FiFi event held in New York next week, which honours those who have helped promote the world of perfumery.

Justin Bieber's debut secnt has been regonised globally by industry experts

His female scent described as 'playful, fresh yet flirty and anything but ordinary',  smashed records back in June 2011, raking in $3 million in just three weeks at Macy’s in U.S.

And this month in the UK  it sold out instantly, after the star himself  deemed it 'irresistible'.

Commenting on his cluster of awards, Bieber said: 'I am honoured to be named Elizabeth Taylor Fragrance Celebrity of the Year. It means a lot to me that my fans and The Fragrance Foundation support all my accomplishments.

'The best part is that my favorite charities are sharing in the success; it is important to pay it forward. Plus, I have the girls smelling great!'

Last year, Halle Berry responsible for a trio of scents - Halle by Halle Berry, Pure Orchid and Reveal - took home the title.

Bieber is also in the running for the luxe women gong, competing against Beyoncé's Pulse, Bottega Veneta, Prada Candy and Tom Ford Violet Blonde.

According to reviews, Bieber's fragrance starts off with notes of mandarin, pear and wild berries and ends with warm hints of vanilla and soft musk

Proceeds from perfume sales have benefited Pencils of Promise, an education-based charity organization that helps helps build schools all over the world.

Explaining the thought behind Someday, Bieber said it is about hope and dream.

'It explains a dream. Someday I will drive a BMW. Someday I will be an astronaut. In the commercial, (co-star Dree’s) Someday was meeting me.

'So when she sprayed on the perfume, I appeared in the room and we floated off into this place. That’s what I perceive it as.'

According to reviews, the fragrance starts off with notes of mandarin, pear and wild berries and ends with warm hints of vanilla and soft musk.
