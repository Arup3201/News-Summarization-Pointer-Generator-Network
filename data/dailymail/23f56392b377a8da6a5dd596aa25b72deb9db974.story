Liverpool's American owners have told supporters they are encouraged by recent performances.

Manager Brendan Rodgers had been under recent scrutiny with his team 11th in the Premier League and out of the Champions League at the group stages.

But successive league wins have lifted them to eighth, five points behind fourth-placed Southampton.

Chairman Tom Werner said: 'We are pleased to see a number of positive signs as new players start to settle.'

Liverpool were in sight of their first Premier League title last term before finishing runners-up, two points behind champions Manchester City.

'There was much to celebrate during our memorable season that ended in May,' Werner and John Henry wrote on the club's website.

'While we did not achieve our ultimate ambition in winning the Premier League, our style of play captured the attention of the world as the club played attacking football, scoring 101 goals.'

After the departure of star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona in July, Liverpool recruited a series of players in the summer.

The owners admitted that Liverpool started the season slowly after losing striker Luis Suarez

They added: 'Luis Suarez was named the best player in English football, winning the PFA Player of the Year award; Brendan Rodgers was awarded the LMA Manager of the Year award; and our captain, Steven Gerrard, continued to demonstrate his talents as one of the greatest football players of our era.

'As you would expect losing a footballer as capable as Suarez and making a number of new signings, our season has gotten off to a slower start than we would have wanted.

'However, in the past few weeks we are pleased to see a number of positive signs as new players start to settle into life at Anfield.'

Southampton trio Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, Benfica winger Lazar Markovic and controversial striker Mario Balotelli were all brought in, but early season displays were disappointing, losing at home to Aston Villa and also failing to score in stalemates with Hull and Sunderland.

'As you would expect, losing a footballer as capable as Luis Suarez and making a number of new signings, our season has gotten off to a slower start than we would have wanted,' the owners admitted.

Striker Daniel Sturridge scored 21 league goals last season but has not played for the club since August after a succession of injuries, the first of which came while training with England, but the Liverpool owners expect him to return soon.

'We look forward to the return of Daniel Sturridge sometime in late January. We are very encouraged by his efforts and determination to resolve his injuries.

'Great progress has been made that should help him going forward.'
