The first female professional coach in football history has mysteriously resigned from the job without compensation before taking charge of a single match.

Helena Costa looked every inch the crestfallen but resilient manager as she appeared at a press conference at Clermont Foot 63, the League 2 club based in Clermont-Ferrand in central France. 

‘I only made my decision yesterday after discussing it with the president,’ said Ms Costa. ‘Before this decision, I did all my work.’

Game changer: It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Helena Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a sport traditionally dominated by men upon being appointed coach of Clermont Foot

It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Ms Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a game traditionally dominated by men.

Today she refused to reveal exactly why she left, saying: ‘Only the president knows the reason for my decision.

'I hope this won’t cause prejudice towards women in the sport. I want to be viewed as a coach,' she added.

Ms Costa suggested that she had least broken a glass ceiling, by becoming the first female football manager ever - albeit without actually taking charge of a training session, let alone a game. 

As journalists pressed Ms Costa to 
explain herself further, a clearly angry club president Claude Michy 
intervened, saying: ‘She leaves with her secret. She resigned without 
compensation’.

Career: Helena Costa has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women's national teams of Qatar and Iran (pictured), as well as scouting for Celtic

Mr Michy said: ‘The life of the club continues’, adding: ‘The players are disappointed, because their adventure has been stolen. They were ready to live differently.’

There was speculation that Muslim players had not wanted to work with a woman boss, but Mr Michy said played this down as an unfounded rumour, saying: ‘I won’t return to this subject’.

He said he had not ruled out recruiting another woman to replace the Portuguese Ms Costa, who is now expected to take a ‘long holiday’ before considering her future further. 

She has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women’s national teams of Qatar and Iran, as well as scouting for Celtic. 

Some of the journalists at this morning’s press conference suggested the whole affair had been a publicity stunt aimed at raising the club’s international profile.
