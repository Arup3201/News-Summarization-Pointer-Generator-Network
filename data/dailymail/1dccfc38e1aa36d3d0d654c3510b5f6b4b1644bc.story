Uruguay are considering the option of resting Luis Suarez for their World Cup group encounter with England in Sao Paulo next week.

If they kick off their tournament campaign with a win against Costa Rica on Sunday, they could take the decision conscious that Chile’s Arturo Vidal has struggled to recover from an almost identical knee injury.

Sources in Uruguay already believe that Suarez is unlikely to face the Costa Ricans in the opening game for Oscar Tabarez’s team.

Learning: Chile's Arturo Vidal has struggled to recover from an almost identical injury

But only if they failed to take three points this weekend would they feel it necessary to rush Suarez back for what would then be a key clash against Roy Hodgson’s side.

The fact is there is an acute awareness in the Uruguayan camp of the crisis which has hit Chile after they brought back Vidal, the Juventus midfielder, too early.

The 27-year-old underwent knee surgery in early May to repair a meniscus – the same knee condition which saw Liverpool striker Suarez break down in Uruguay training and require an operation.

There were confident claims from Santiago that Vidal would be back for the World Cup. But a surprise 15-minute appearance in a friendly against Northern Ireland in Montevideo on May 30 proved disastrous. Vidal’s knee swelled badly and now his hopes of appearing for the Chileans here in Brazil are in serious doubt.

Vidal is as important to Chile – who face a tough group with Spain and the Netherlands - as Suarez is to Uruguay.

Uruguay coach Tabárez said: ‘We have no set deadlines with Suarez. I don’t know if we’ll have him for the first match, for the second, for the third. If it were up to me, Suárez would play tomorrow.’

Suarez has trained alone at Uruguay’s Belo Horizonte base this week. He has worked with the ball, taking soft shots and short passes with his right leg but as yet has not put his left leg under any real strain.
