Treasurer Joe Hockey has pointed the finger at his Abbott government colleagues over speculation that he's going to be dumped as treasurer in favour of Malcolm Turnbull.

Mr Hockey said he faced a tougher job than any other treasurer in the past 15 years and said his ministerial colleagues were also responsible for spruiking the budget to the public.

It comes amid reports of growing support within senior ranks for Mr Turnbull to take the treasurer position if government support is the same come next year, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said his ministerial colleagues were also responsible for spruiking the budget to the public amid speculation the treasurer position could be handed to Malcolm Turnbull

'Everyone wants Joe to ­succeed. But to say there is not a problem is barking mad. The backbench wants Malcolm,' a colleague said.

Mr Hockey was asked about reports that his colleagues had lost faith in him on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Friday morning. 

'Look, this is part and parcel of being treasurer. When you have conversations with your colleagues about asking them to live within their means, in their portfolios, some of them don't like it but we have got to do what is right for the Australian people,' he said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to Mr Hockey's defence on Thursday, saying he was one of Australia's greatest treasurers

'I know it's hard for people. I know it's hard for the community. I know it's hard for colleagues but we have to do what is right.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to Mr Hockey's defence on Thursday, saying he was one of Australia's greatest treasurers.

'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott told the ABC's 7.30.

A ministerial colleague reportedly said the Abbott backbench wanted Mr Turnbull in as treasurer

Sources within the Abbott government told the Telegraph it was likely the idea of a Cabinet reshuffle had been flagged with the prime minister, but said there was 'no push to get rid of Joe'.

'No one is out to get Joe. There is no push. If he has a great summer he will come back a hero,' one source said.

'No one expects Tony will move him. But what we are doing is not working.'

Mr Hockey has faced several blunders this year, including when he was filmed smoking cigars on the night before the budget was released and comparing the $7 GP co-payment to the cost of beer and cigarettes.
