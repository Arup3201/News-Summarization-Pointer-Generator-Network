Manchester United will not announce their new manager this week, despite Louis van Gaal being all but confirmed as the club's new boss.

Sportsmail understands that there is no problem with the deal to bring the Dutchman to Old Trafford and he will still take charge this summer.

Van Gaal, who is currently the manager of Holland, will begin his new role after this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

New man: Louis van Gaal is set to be appointed as Manchester United manager but it will not happen this week

Own team: Current Holland assistant Patrick Kluivert could come to Old Trafford with Van Gaal

Experienced: Current Holland boss Van Gaal enjoyed successful spells at Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Ajax

It is not yet known whether interim boss Ryan Giggs, or any of the Class of '92, will be retained by the 62-year-old. Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt are all part of the club's coaching set-up at present.

Van Gaal is believed to be keen on bringing his own staff to Manchester, including current Holland assistant manager Patrick Kluivert. He may also bring in goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, physio Jos van Dijk and video analyst Max Reckers.

The former Barcelona boss has never managed in England before, but he has vast experience with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich, as well as two spells in charge of the Dutch national team.

Van Gaal will become the club's permanent replacement for David Moyes, who was sacked less than a season into his six-year deal at Old Trafford.

The 
ex-Everton boss oversaw a disastrous campaign, which has seen the 
Premier League champions fail to challenge for the title and drop out of
 the Champions League places.

United
 owners the Glazer family are prepared to back their new manager in the 
transfer market, with Mats Hummels, Marco Reus and Toni Kroos all on Van 
Gaal's summer wishlist.
