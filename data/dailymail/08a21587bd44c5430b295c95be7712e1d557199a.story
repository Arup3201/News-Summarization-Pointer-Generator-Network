Anthony Joshua has his sights raised towards winning a world heavyweight title as early as next year but he remains heart-warmingly in touch with the more humble amateur environment which turned him from a street chump into an Olympic champ.

Big Josh turned professional a year after striking gold at the London Games.

Yet he still makes the trek north from Watford to the English Sports Institute in Sheffield where several of his former GB team-mates continue to work under national coach Rob McCracken.

The other day he came into close contact of a very personal kind with both levels of his fighting life.

Joshua found himself not only helping Britain’s leading amateur boxers get ready for this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but also sitting in on Carl Froch’s gruelling  preparations for his mega-rematch with George Groves.

McCracken, who trains both Team GB and the Nottingham Cobra, cleverly links those amateur and professional experiences to the benefit of both parties.

Joshua never forgets how the uplifting atmosphere which McCracken created in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics helped him turn away from the drug-strewn temptations of gang-land.

He has talked eloquently and often about how boxing enabled him to transform his life but his actions speak even louder than those words.

There has not been so much as a hint of a relapse since his solitary cannabis conviction four years ago. Furthermore, but he is already giving back to the sport which rescued him.

Joshua journeyed to Sheffield to spar with his likeliest successor in the GB team, the new ABA champion Joe Joyce.

‘If I can be of help I’m only too pleased,’ said Joshua. ‘But it’s no hardship for me. I loved my time with the amateurs. I love coming back to see the guys and working with them. I only wish I could do it more often.’

A sense of belonging with this amateur family made Joshua hesitate about turning pro for a full year after his Olympic triumph and he was strongly tempted to go on to Rio 2016.

Now the aura of nostalgia draws him back and the lads in vests are thrilled to see him.

Joshua’s 
arrival galvanises the camp, as does Froch’s regular presence during 
training for his big world super-middleweight title fights.

These two are glittering examples of what the future may hold for a dedicated and successful amateur.

For Big Josh, the chance to talk professionally with Froch is a bonus.

Joshua faces Matt Legg on the undercard of Froch-Groves II and he is thrilled to be appearing in front of an unprecedented 80,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium.

‘I can’t wait,’ he says. ‘So excited. This will be a huge night in my life. Imagine the atmosphere.’

Joshua believes this exposure to the big-time will help accelerate his ascent to the world heavyweight title.

It is only seven months since the first of his five paid victories but he says: ‘I’m already thinking about challenging Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.’

That may require him to take up the offer of a big British battle with Tyson Fury en route, assuming Manchester’s giant traveller beats Dereck Chisora in their summer rematch.

But Froch does nothing to dampen the enthusiasm. He tells Joshua: You’re doing great. Boxing is a short career but it can earn a long living. You must stay focused and totally dedicated. That does mean making sacrifices now. But it’s only for a few years and it’s worth it.’

Froch, as he goes into his 12th consecutive world title fight, is living proof of that – as well as an inspiration to the young men who are the long-term future of the British ring.

KHAN REWARDED FOR COLLAZO WIN

Amir Khan’s gamble that he would excite the wide world of boxing with his appearance on Floyd Mayweather’s latest under-card in Las Vegas has reaped its first reward.

The WBC have promoted him to the position of No 1 challenger to Floyd Mayweather for their world welterweight title.

This does not mean he gets the next shot at the best pound-for-pound boxer on the planet, even though the WBC were clearly impressed by his 12-round, three knock-down demolition of respected former world champion Luis Collazo.

But in holding back from enforcing the young man from Bolton as the mandatory contender that organisation is respecting Khan’s Muslim obligation to observe Ramadan, which renders him unavailable for Mayweather’s next outing in September.

Demolition: Khan looked impressive as he dismantled Collazo in Las Vegas earlier this month

The odds are – assuming that Mayweather beats whoever he chooses to face in that fight and Khan wins an interim contest of his own in late October or early November – that the WBC will  call for them to face each other next May.

Prior to his fight for redemption little more than a fortnight ago, there was much scoffing at the conviction held by some, myself included, that Khan has specific assets which could cause  Mayweather serious problems.

Now, after seeing Khan dazzle and his former victim Marcos Maidana give Mayweather a tough time, the belief is growing that King Khan’s  lightning speed might trouble a  slightly slowing Money man.

What a difference a night makes.

COULD MAYWEATHER AND PACQUIAO FINALLY COLLIDE?

The man who calls himself Money may yet be coerced into the fight the world wants to see above all others by finance, of all things.

A fall in pay-per-view ratings in America is being blamed in some quarters there on the failure of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao to get into the ring with each other.

Signs of declining public interest in these, the two greatest pound-for-pound fighters in the world today, going through the formality of beating other opponents are detected in television box office returns projected at less than a million for their most recent fights.

Drop: Floyd Mayweather's fight with Marcos Maidana is expected to have seen a drop in pay-per-view revenue

Unbeaten: Mayweather ws given a torrid time by Maidana before preserving his perfect record

Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum has admitted to no more than 650,000 subscribers for the HBO telecast of his man’s revenge win over Tim Bradley last month.

Meanwhile, more than two weeks after the event, the Showtime network have still not released figures for Money Mayweather’s win over Marcos Maidana.

The boxing grapevine is a-rustle with whispers of 850,000 buys, which would fall short of their minimum pre-fight prediction of one million.

What is certain is that there will be a huge drop from the 2.2million sales for Mayweather’s preceding fight with Canelo Alvarez, which stands second in the all-time pay-per-view ratings to Mr Money’s historic battle with Oscar De La Hoya which drew 2.4m.

Mayweather was guaranteed at least US $32million for this fight and should still bank more than $40m. But the Forbes Rich List in America is flatly discounting his boast of a $70 million pay-night.If he cannot improve the numbers for his next fight in September – which may or may not be a re-match with Maidana once the true income from their first fight is taken into account  – he may struggle to reach the $300 million estimate for his six-fight contract with Showtime.

Three of those spectaculars are yet to come.

Take that: Manny Pacquiao earned his revenge over Timothy Bradley with victory in their rematch last month

Will it happen? Pacquiao has so far failed to agree terms with Mayweather for a mega fight

Pacquiao, meanwhile, is heading for a fifth fight in his series with Juan Manuel Marquez in the autumn following the Mexican’s predictable win over Mike Alvarado at the weekend. That would test the public’s appetite for repetitive contests.

Still, Mayweather finds reasons for not fighting Pacquiao.  

First the PacMan consented to Olympic standard random blood testing. Then he agreed to take less than 50 per cent of the money.

Now Mayweather is insisting that Pacquiao dumps Arum, which frankly is none of his business even though he walked out on the Hall of Fame promoter at the height of a bitter dispute some years ago.

But when it comes to Money, money talks.

Unless the returns pick up, Showtime may well insist that he fights Pacquiao during the course of their current contract.

Nor is it any secret that in Mayweather’s hands money evaporates like water in the Nevada desert.

Let's do it again: Marquez could now face Pacquaio in the autumn in the fifth leg of their rival

Although his career earnings are reported close to $400 million, his current net worth is put at $216 million.

The high-end gambling in his home town of Las Vegas, the extravagant spending on such luxury goods as Rolls, Bentleys and diamond-encrusted watches, the expanding entourage and the separations from the mothers of his children can quickly mount up.

Then there are the run-ins with the Inland Revenue and it may be that the only resolution to the tax man will be to call the PacMan.

Perhaps Mr Money will rake in another $300 million before he’s done.

But then so did Iron Mike Tyson...
