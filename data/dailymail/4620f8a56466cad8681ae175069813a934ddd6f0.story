These are the stomach-churning pictures of Europe's steepest funicular which has a gradient of 106 per cent - but not a seatbelt in sight.

The breathtaking images show two children clutching onto a single rail as the ground drops away beneath them in Bern, Switzerland.

The Gelmerbahn funicular takes tourists a vertigo-inducing 6,000 feet above sea level to Lake Gelmer and while the journey might be slow it's not for the faint-hearted.
