Controversy was mounting last night over claims that Frances Andrade was left unprepared for the ordeal of a rape trial after police advised her against counselling.

Rape support groups and 48-year-old Mrs Andrade’s family criticised a policy that she should not seek help prior to the hearing in case it triggered ‘false memory syndrome’, and possibly brought her testimony into question.

Yvonne Traynor, of the Rape Crisis Centre, said: ‘Whoever said Frances should not have help prior to the case was totally wrong.

Fresh revelations: Levine Andrade, pictured with Frances on their wedding day in 1988, claims police told his wife not to have counselling before her abuser's court case was heard in case it brought her testimony into question

‘We understand the principle that we cannot “coach” on the actual case but there is much we can do to help. The defendant has everything in front of them, yet the victim goes into the courtroom blind. For Frances to have been actively discouraged from seeking proper help was monstrous.’

Mrs Andrade’s son Olly, 21, a Cambridge University student, sat through her cross-examination at Manchester Crown Court a week before she took her own life.

He said: ‘Having been heavily advised by the police not to receive any form of therapy until the end of the case she was forced to cope with only the support of family and close friends.

Guilty: Michael Brewer, 68, left, and his 
ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, right, were both found guilty of sexually 
assaulting a former student of his, Frances Andrade, 30 years ago

‘She was forced to relive the many times Michael Brewer sexually abused her as a child both to the police and in court to a hostile party. The court system let her down.’

Last night Detective Chief Superintendent Mary Doyle, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘It is our policy to encourage victims to seek whatever support they need.The advice not to seek support may have been given by another party.’

Surrey Police, which was involved in the investigation, said: ‘The death of Frances is extremely saddening and as one of the agencies who had contact with her we will review  our involvement.’
