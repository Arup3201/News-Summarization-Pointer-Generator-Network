Roy Keane regrets apologising to Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz over the row which brought his 12-year spell at Old Trafford to an end.

Keane and Fergie fell out over the then Manchester United midfielder's stinging analysis of his team-mates in an interview on MUTV in 2005.

The Irishman tore into a number of United stars, including John O'Shea, Alan Smith and Rio Ferdinand.

Keane left after Fergie and chief executive David Gill revealed in showdown talks that they were happy for him to move on. 

But Keane reveals in his book, The Second Half, extracts of which have been published in the Express, that he regrets apologising to the then United manager and his assistant.

But the Irishman says he regrets ever apologising to them for the way he left the club in 2005

He writes: 'Now I kind of wish I hadn't. Afterwards I was thinking, "I'm not sure why I f***** apologised." I just wanted to do the right thing. I was apologising for what had happened – that it had happened.

'But I wasn’t apologising for my behaviour or stance. There is a difference – I had nothing to apologise for.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'
