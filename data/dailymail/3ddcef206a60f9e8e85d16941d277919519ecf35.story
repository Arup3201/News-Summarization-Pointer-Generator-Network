Four police cars are caught on camera carrying out a carefully co-ordinated breakfast time raid - on a doughnut drive-through.

The marked patrol cars were spotted parked outside a Krispy Kreme store in Bristol yesterday morning as officers tucked in to an unhealthy treat.

Onlooker Paul Amery said a fifth car was parked outside the store out of view of his camera buying more of the sugary treats on Monday morning.

The doughnut division sat in their cars tucking into their food on the Avon Meads Retail Park.

The spot is a favourite haunt of local police with patrol cars pictured picking up doughnuts from the same place in July and August.

Mr Amery, 42, a freelance IT project manager, said: 'We are all entitled to our breakfasts and lunches but seeing so many police cars together was a bit of a surprise.

'It was like something out of The Simpsons - I was expecting Chief Wiggum or Homer to appear at any moment.

'There was four cars neatly lined up and a fifth coming through the drive through. I think they were all sat in their cars eating their food.'

The photo - posted online yesterday - left a bad taste with some.

'Capt cabbie' commented: '& yet if you ring up if your car is broken into they say they’re on other urgent calls. Not really an effective use of resources is it.

'Whilst I understand we all need a refreshment break why all 4 cars at the same time? No doubt the area commander will say that it was necessary & all we can do is accept this.

'It does however make (Police and Crime Commissioner) Sue Mountstevens & Chief constable Gregan look pretty stupid given that they’re constantly talking about saving money.'

Another commentator, Steve059 added: 'Had two cars bumped into each other in the car park?

'That’s usually the only way you get that many police cars together at the same time.'

After seeing Paul’s photo Twitter user Joes85 posted one of a police car at the drive-thru window of the same Krispy Kreme store in the summer and said '£keepingbristolsafe'.

Avon and Somerset Police admitted their officers had 'decided to begin the week in style with a sweet treat'.

Chief Inspector Mark Jackson said: 'Our officers are encouraged to take their breaks out in the community rather than returning to a police station.

'This increases our visibility and means we are out and ready to respond to emergency calls.

'Response officers also have access to mobile data - including our key systems - in their vehicles so can do more work from their cars.

'On this occasion some of our officers on a break must have decided to begin the week in style with a sweet treat.'
