At the Miss Michigan pageant Friday, a bevy of home-grown beauties charmed the audience with their grace and poise, but it was a special 14-year-old boy who stole everyone's heart.

Drew Foster was wheeled onto the stage at the Frauenthal Center for the Performing Arts in Muskegon to be honored by 2008 Miss Michigan Ashlee Baracy.

'He is Mr Michigan,' Baracy, who was acting as Mistress of Ceremonies, said of the teen.

Drew was born with two rare medical conditions: Osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bones disease, and neurocutaneous hypermelanosis - a central nervous system disorder that causes birthmarks all over a patient's body, Mlive.com reported.

During the second night of the contest Friday night, Julie Stephens, a coordinator at the Miss Michigan pageant, performed the Rascal Flatts song 'My wish' in Drew's honor with her daughters.

Ashlee Baracy later shared a photo on her Facebook page of her posing with a smiling Drew along with 2013 Miss Michigan Haley WIlliam.

Drew's plight has inspired the creation of the non-profit DREW Foundation which stands for 'Discovering Recreation and Enjoying Wildlife'

Drew, a sweet, bespectacled boy with a mop of dirty-blonde hair, has become a favorite on the local pageant circuit.

In 2011, Foster, then aged 11, was brought on stage at the Miss America contest in Las Vegas and recognized as a special person who touched many lives.

In the summer of 2010, the child, who lives with his parents, Chad and Angela in Flint, Michigan, was also named honorary Mr Bay County. 

Drew Foster has been treated at the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, which is part of Children's Miracle Network Hospital - one of the partners of the Miss Michigan beauty contest.

Drew's plight has inspired the creation of the DREW Foundation, which stands for ‘Discovering Recreation and Enjoying Wildlife.’

Hot wheels: Drew has been gifted an Action Trackchair allowing to move around with greater ease

The non-profit organization’s website explains that when Drew was born, his parents were told that he would not live past the age of three, but he has beaten those odds.

Over the past 13 years, he has broken over 50 bones in his body, but Drew stills enjoys the great outdoors and hunting, which he does with a crossbow since he cannot hold a rifle in his fragile hands.

The winner of the 2014 Miss Michigan will be selected from 34 contestants Saturday night, receiving a $10,000 scholarship and a ticket to the Miss America pageant, which will be held in September in Atlantic City.
