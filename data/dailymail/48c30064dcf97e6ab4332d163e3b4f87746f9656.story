Barcelona right-back Dani Alves has shown potential Barclays Premier League suitors that he is fighting fit.

The 31-year-old Brazilian posted a video of himself lifting weights in the gym on Tuesday during the international break and left some words of wisdom for his fans. 

Alves, wanted by Liverpool and both Manchester clubs, writes 'in life there are those who think they want something... but do not fight for what they want'.

Manchester United have been reportedly interested in signing Alves, currently a right-back for Barca

He continues: 'Those who work, work and work for one reason only, the hard work is the only way to the realisation of will and power.

'Never forget, if you want the world to conspire in your favour! #ifyouwantyoucan…'

Barcelona currently sit second in La Liga, two points adrift of rivals Real Madrid.
