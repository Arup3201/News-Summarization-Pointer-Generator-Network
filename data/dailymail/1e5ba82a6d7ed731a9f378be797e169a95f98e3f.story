When most travellers jet off for a summer they will have an iPod and perhaps a Kindle tucked away in their hand luggage.

But when Premier League footballers fly in on their summer tour they cannot go without a haul of luxury goods.

New Manchester City signing Jesus Navas showed off his designer wares as he flew off to Munich for the latest leg of his club's round the world pre-season trips.

Life of a star: City's new signing Jesus Navas had his bag open as the team jetted on to Munich from Manchester for the next leg of their tour

The Spanish international, who cost £15million, doubled his pay when he signed a contract worth an estimated £80,000 at City.

The 27-year-old used to suffer from chronic homesickness which stopped him moving away from his hometown club Seville.

However, he was able to overcome the condition to play abroad for his country and won both the World Cup and the European Championships with Spain.

Manchester City were in Hong Kong to 
take part in a pre-season competition called the Audi Cup. The English 
side faced AC Milan, Sao Paulo and Bayern Munich in the competition.

Here MailOnline identifies
the items inside and compiles the wallet-busting accessories you need 
to fit in as a Premier League star... just thank God there's a cash 
machine behind him.

1. Gucci double-zip washbag - £250

To carry every toiletry a Premier League
star could get his hands on, be it gel to keep the hairdo in place 
during the action or aftershave to smell terrific after the match. 

2. Beats by Dr Dre - £219No Premier League player worth his salt can be seen without their ludicrously oversized headphones in tow. These top-of-the-range headphones are the audio must-haves, if you're willing to spend big.

Even the cheapest Beats by Dr Dre headphones cost nearly £100. The biggest, chunkiest and priciest are a must have for your matchday bag if you are a millionaire Premier League footballer.

3. iPad - from £399Who wants to socialise with team-mates on those long flights when you can get stuck into a bit of Angry Birds on the latest iPad? Kept in a zip compartment in Navas' bag, the Spanish star could have his favourite TV shows from home loaded on to save him from repeats of TOWIE.

With just a few hours of training each day, Premier League footballers have a lot of time to kill.

4. Nike Air Max - £119These brand-spanking new shiny trainers are pride of place in Navas' bag, and while they'll cost you a pretty penny, it's a fair bet the Spanish star's boot sponsors were generous enough to chuck him a complimentary pair.

Most likely these trainers will just be for casual wear as football clubs carry their players' training and matchday boots and kit.

5. Manchester City training T-Shirt - £16.99Likewise this sky blue training t-shirt, with a big City crest pride of place. Again you'd have to think this was a freebie, compulsory wear from Navas' new club. Unless, of course, large-branded items available for £16.99 from the club shop are de rigueur among Premier league footballers on £100k-plus a week these days.

6. Unidentified furry object - ??

This looks like a small soft toy - perhaps Navas's mascot? After all, even the best players need a little bit of luck...

TOTAL: £1003.99... and that's just your hand luggage!
