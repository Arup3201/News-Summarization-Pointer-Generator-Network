French judges have ordered Google to stop providing links to the sadomasochistic private life of former Formula 1 chief Max Mosley.

In a landmark ruling in Paris, they agreed that the 73-year-old should have all details of his sexual past erased from the internet giant's search engine.

It follows the defunct newspaper the News of the World publishing videos and nine photos of Mosley taking part in an S&M orgy in 2008.

Max Mosley: All details of the Formula 1 boss' sexual past will be erased from the Google search engine

Although Mosley, former president of the FIA motor racing organisation, successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £60,000 in damages from the paper, the images can still be found on the worldwide web.

Now Google will have to introduce a filter to prevent the material appearing in any search results, after Mosley successfully argued that sexual activity is a private matter.

Lawyers for Google had told the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris that the request was a 'legal aberration' which 'undermine the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information on the internet'.

The ruling comes after the News Of The World published images and videos of Mr Mosley's sex life

Daphne Keller, associate general counsel at Google, said: 'This decision should worry all those who defend freedom of expression on the internet.'

Google has two months to comply with the order. The court also fined the firm a symbolic €1 and ordered it to pay €5,000 (£4,205) in court costs.

Mr Mosley's legal team failed to secure a broader ruling which would have also forced Google to block access to any further extracts from the video which may emerge in the future.

Google said it had, at Mr Mosley's request, already taken steps to ensure hundreds of pages whose content could be deemed to breach the law in some countries are excluded from its search results.

At the heart of the legal debate is the question over whether companies like Google should be obliged to play a role in policing the internet.

The company says no to that and believes its stance is supported by a European Union directive (law) on e-commerce which should take precedence over privacy .

Oxford graduate Mosley is the youngest son of the late British fascist Sir Oswald Mosley.
