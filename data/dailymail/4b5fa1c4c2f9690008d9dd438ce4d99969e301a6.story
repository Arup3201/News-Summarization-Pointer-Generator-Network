Two cage-fighting brothers who ran a drugs and racketeering empire in their hometown through 'fear' have been jailed for a total of 32 years.

Anthony Diprose, 27, and his brother Jason, 26, exploited their terrifying reputations in the ring to build up their drugs network with 'iron fists'.

Both men live a glittering high life and, according to police, had 'iconic' status in their hometown of Lancaster.

Jailed: Jason Diprose, 26, left, and his brother Anthony, 27, who ran a drugs and racketeering empire in Lancaster, ruling the town through fear

Teetotal fitness fanatic Anthony - who 'regarded his body as a temple' - drove a Range Rover Sport and a BMW Five series and regularly went on holiday to Malaga, Spain.

He spent £7,500 on a chunky gold chain, £5,000 on a Rolex watch and bought his fiancee a £5,500 diamond ring. He also wore Armani and Gucci clothes and rented a three-storey townhouse which was lavishly furnished and filled with designer items and a 50 inch television.

Despite running a drugs empire, Anthony would regularly stop and talk to police officers on the beat, apparently believing he was untouchable.

His younger brother Jason - who once caused the death of a four-year old boy dead in a hit and run crash - acted as Anthony’s enforcer and kept three fearsome Pit bull dogs.

The brothers used military-style paraphernalia including pistols, Rambo-style hunting knives, Nato flak jackets and gold three-bladed knuckledusters as they ruled the Skerton and Ryelands estate in Lancaster.

Arrest: Jason Diprose is put into the back of a police car as officers from Lancashire Police carry out coordinated raids on members of the gang. They have been jailed for a combined total of 67 years

Lavish: Anthony Diprose's Range Rover which he bought with the proceeds of his crime. He also drove a BMW Five Series and lived in a three-storey bachelor pad

Weapon: A blank-firing handgun which was seized by police as they raised properties across Lancashire

Chilling weapon: A samurai sword discovered by police which was used by the gang during their reign of terror across Lancashire

The pair encouraged children to shout: '*** the law' at police in the street and on the Ryelands estate was littered with graffiti inspired by the rap group NWA.

In a text message Diprose boasted: 'I don’t trust no-one except my brothers. All the rest just do as I say and want to be me.'

But the pair were arrested in raids on their homes in 2010. Eighteen other people were held and 14 of them were charged with various criminal offences.

Anthony was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and an offence under proceeds of crime laws after a 14 week trial.

Father-of-two Jason admitted conspiracy to supply class B drugs, conspiracy to supply class A drugs and fraud by false representation.

The pair were given 16 years behind bars each.

Superintendent Andy Webster, from Lancashire Police, said the pair operated a 'sophisticate drugs network'.

'Anthony Diprose is a muscular individual who put himself up as a cage fighter and used his aggression to intimidate people,' he said.

'Jason was very much seen as his enforcer. Both were living a lifestyle significantly beyond their means.

'Anthony lived a lavish lifestyle, he spent over £5,000 on family holidays to Spain and spent a significant amount of money on jewellery. His Range Rover Sport was expensive and luxurious.

'Yet was quite clear that he had no honest source of income. He had no tax returns yet the way he said he earned his money was a sham.

'He said he was a car dealer but when he was asked the mile per gallon for a Range Rover he couldn’t give the correct answer.

'He drove around Lancaster every day in his car and would go to the best jewellers in Lancaster. Anthony thought he was too far up the ladder to be caught and I think that is a good example of his arrogance and his belief that he was unattainable.

'He was the head and ran the group on fear and intimidation and his gang members were forced to do their job. Weapons were used to intimidate and to threat. They were used as enforcements if people did not pay for drugs.

'Anthony would go to the gym on a daily basis and spend two to three hours weight training and working on his muscles.

Paraphernalia: A drugs press which was also seized in the raids. Jason and Anthony Diprose who ran the drugs network have been jailed for a total of 32 years

Enforcement: A flak jacked used by the brothers which was recovered by Lancashire Police officers during the raids

Haul: A Rolex watch that belonged to one of the Diprose brothers, left, and, right, a knuckleduster with a skull and crossbone on it

'He would think nothing of pulling over at the side of the road and chatting with police officers as he honestly thought he was publicly that far removed from the gang’s activities.

'The Preston house was like a bachelor flat. He didn’t drink or smoke and his body was very much a temple. He was a fitness fanatic and did not go to casinos or clubs.'

'The gang had an iconic status but we built up the intelligence and had a very clear picture about the hierarchy of the group. We identified the safe houses, money launderers and dismantled it from the bottom up.'

The brothers would use the same mobile phones for four weeks before switching them to avoid being detected.

But CCTV footage showed a meeting between Anthony Diprose and two associates in his black Range Rover where large piles of cash were seen being passed over to him.

Accomplices: Kenneth Smith, 23, who got four years in prison, and Brian Coulton, 20, who got five years, for their role in the drugs and racketeering network

Behind bars: Andrew Gunningham, left, who got seven years, and Aiden Higgins, right, who got four years

Locked up: David Threlfall, 28, who got 18 months, while Liam Parkinson, right, got seven years

During 12 raids officers recovered three firearms, ammunition, imitation firearms and a stash of cocaine.

Gang member: Liam Wiper who got six years and nine months

Officers also recovered 'tick lists' which were effectively the dealers’ diaries and they would list all the people who wanted drugs.

Superintendent Webster added: 'We have had really positive feedback from the public as the brothers’ activities have been going on for almost three years and has had a huge impact on the area.

'The estate now sees a low level of crime and feedback says there has been a change in the atmosphere in the area because we have been able to tackle this crime group.

Andrew Gunningham, 30, Brian Coulton, 20, Kenneth Smith, 23, David Threlfall, 28, Aiden Higgins, 21, Liam Wiper, 24, and Liam Parkinson, 24 were convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs.

Gunningham and Parkinson were each jailed for seven years, Wiper got six years nine months, Coulton got five years, Smith and Higgins each got four years and Threlfall got 18 months.

Katie Noon, 24, a cousin of the Diprose brothers and her husband Paul, 30, their uncle Paul Lynch, 45, and his wife Rachel, 41, were all found guilty of money laundering.

The Noons were both given six month suspended jail terms and each ordered to complete 50 hours of unpaid work.

The Lynches were given a two year community order, a two year supervision order and 40 hours of unpaid work.
