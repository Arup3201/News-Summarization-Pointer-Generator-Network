'Could have killed his victim': Graham Smith has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for dropping a dumbbell on a friend's face

A man who dropped a dumbbell on his friend’s face as he attempted to go to sleep leaving him scarred for life has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Graham Smith agreed to put him up the victim at his home in Easington Village, County Durham, several days before the incident.

At Durham Crown Court, Ros Scott Bell, prosecuting, said they were drinking at the house with others for much of the day on Saturday September 22.

Smith became ‘argumentative’ and complained when the other man said he wanted to go to sleep in the early hours of the following morning.

The ‘guest’ retired upstairs to a spare room, converted into a ‘gym room’, where he lay on a cushion, at 3.30am.

Smith entered carrying the 5kg dumbbell and tried to strike up a conversation, but the other man said he just wanted to go to sleep.

Miss Scott Bell said: 'The next thing he knew felt the impact to his face, with the defendant standing close above him. The complainant briefly blacked out.

'When he came round he was cut to the face and the defendant was shouting to him to get out of the house.

'He ran to a phone box at the top of the street, rang the police and stayed there until officers arrived.'

Miss Scott Bell said the 23-year-old victim went to hospital suffering a 5cm laceration above the left eye and a cut to the temple.

He received nine stitches under local anaesthetic and had to return to hospital for further pain relief treatment, but will be permanently scarred.

Smith, of Shelley Square, was arrested and claimed any injury might have been suffered during a 'scuffle' on the landing.

But, after forensic evidence emerged over the nature of the injuries, Smith admitted wounding with intent.

The court heard he has a number of offences of violence on his record.

Stephen Constantine, mitigating, said: 'He is at a loss to explain how he behaved like he did, but he had a lot to drink.

'He had been a "Good Samaritan", briefly giving the complainant somewhere to sleep and his remorse is now genuine.'

Jailing him, Judge Neil Clark told Smith: 'It seems that for nothing more than sheer annoyance, in drink, you dropped that dumbbell on his face.

'It is a miracle he didn’t suffer more serious injuries than he did. He could easily have suffered a lot worse injury or even been killed by your actions.'
