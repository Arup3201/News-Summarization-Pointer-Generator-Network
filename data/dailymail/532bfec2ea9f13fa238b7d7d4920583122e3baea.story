Few would describe life at Fulham as serene. But, when you’ve left behind the car crash that is Leeds United, that’s how it feels.

Despite a run of poor results under Felix Magath, as Ross McCormack chats at Fulham’s Motspur Park training base, the troubles in Yorkshire couldn’t seem farther away.

McCormack is, however, intent on setting the record straight surrounding his departure from Leeds - a switch which made him the most expensive player in Championship history when he moved for a jaw-dropping £11million.

The striker, 28, claims the version put about by Leeds’ Italian owner Massimo Cellino - that the player refused to turn up for training - is laden with inaccuracy. ‘It’s pretty easy to respond to because it’s just pure facts,’ McCormack said. ‘I was told by the club not to train because they were talking to Fulham.

‘They didn’t want me injured with the size of the fee - it was important to the club that they didn’t miss out on that. I didn’t train on the Thursday or Friday. We were off Saturday and Sunday. Monday was the day the fee was agreed. Leeds were going to Italy for pre-season so I was down here doing my medical.’ Cellino asserts that was the day McCormack failed to show up for training.

‘Where that one came from, that I didn’t show up on the Monday to go to training, is ludicrous.’ There was no resentment in McCormack’s voice, no disbelief. The tone was one of grim acceptance.

‘It’s just the way that it was always going to be,’ he added. ‘It was never going to be “thanks for what you did last season, thanks for the help you’ve given the club”. It was pretty nasty in the end to be honest.

‘The conversations were that the club didn’t want me to leave - or Mr Cellino, Mr President… the chairman - he didn’t want me to leave. He said you can leave but it’s got to come across as you are initiating it.

‘So there was a transfer request put in all for the benefit of the club, where they can come across in a good light to the fans.

‘Unfortunately at the time the fans probably took sides with the owner. After a few things have come to light maybe they are turning a little bit.

‘At the time I didn’t want to go. I wasn’t the only player that didn’t really like what was going on. The only difference was that I was probably the only one who said what he felt. They didn’t take too kindly to that.’

Settled: McCormack is starting to get used to life at Fulham and has moved close to the club's training base

Price tag: McCormack moved to Fulham for a hefty £11m but insists that fee will not affect him this season

So, was it the case that Cellino smelled the cash and got shut of McCormack? ‘There you go. He named his price and he got it. It’s sad because that was somewhere I honestly thought I was going to finish my career. I believed it was my club.

‘I had a house there and was more than happy to retire there. My little man was settled and my missus liked it.’

McCormack now lives close by to Fulham with his girlfriend Courtney and son Layton and has settled well down south. The focus on a different pressure - arresting Fulham’s recent slide - is a relief as he prepares to link up with last season’s strike partner Matt Smith, who was also shown the door at Leeds.

The huge fee paid by Fulham doesn’t daunt him, and he delivered a fair dollop of pragmatism with his reasoning, addressing why there was only a £5m difference between himself and Liverpool’s £16m signing Mario Balotelli.

Big money: McCormack cost £5m less than Mario Balotelli, who moved to Liverpool this summer for £16m

‘What you’ve got to remember is I had four years left on my contract at Leeds. Fulham had to pay a premium to get me out of that contract,’ he added. ‘It’s hard to sit here and say I could’ve gone to other clubs but I probably could have. But Fulham were willing to give Leeds the most money. Leeds said “you’re either going there or you’re not going at all”.

‘If you’re talking Balotelli, if AC Milan didn’t want to sell him then he wouldn’t be sold for £16m. I’d say there’d be an extra £10m on top of that because he’s worth it.’

It is only four years ago that Leeds paid Cardiff £300,000 for McCormack. ‘You’re worth what someone is willing to pay for you,’ he said.

If only there was that kind of reasoning at the club the Scot left behind.
