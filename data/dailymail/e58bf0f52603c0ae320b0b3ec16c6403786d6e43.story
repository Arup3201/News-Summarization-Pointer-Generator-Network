Fifty Doctor Who fanatics showed their devotion to the iconic sci-fi series - and each other - by taking part in a mass 'Whovian' wedding in costume.

The superfans got married, entered into civil partnerships and renewed their vows at the event in London in front of a congregation of other fancy-dressed well-wishers who attended dressed as Daleks, Cybermen and the different incarnations of the Doctor himself.

The event, which marked the 50th anniversary of the BBC series, saw couples from America and Canada tie the knot alongside Who-mad couples from the UK.

Time traveller's wedding: The couples, known as 'cosplayers' even had a page boy dressed as David Tennant's pin-striped suit-wearing version of the Doctor

As part of their time-traveller themed big day, they were given commemorative rings especially designed for the occasion and even complimentary Dr Who themed tattoos.

The congregation of Who fans took place at the Bloomsbury Ballroom yesterday and was conducted by a Minister and arranged so that the enthusiasts all said their vows at the same time, making it one of the biggest sci-fi themed weddings in Britain.

According to the event's website, one couple, Jennifer Horn and Klehlyn McCord, both 23, jetted in from in Cincinnati, Ohio to take part in the ceremony.

They picked out an engagement ring with blue diamonds because it reminded them of the Tardis and Jennifer even wore a blue gown inspired by the Doctor's famous time-travelling vessel.

Another couple, Damian and Hayley Marks from Texas, renewed their vows at the event.

After proposing dressed as Matt Smith's bow-tie wearing version of The Doctor, Damian married his wife in a Whovian wedding in the US. At that ceremony, Hayley had a miniture Tardis in her boot-strap as 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue'.

Well wishing Whovians: The event was also open to members of the public who attended to cheer on fellow fans. Many turned up in fancy dress as their favourite Doctor such as Matt Smith's incarnation, right, or David Tennant's memorable version, left

The mass wedding was staged by bespoke experience company Special Events who have also ran Klingon weddings for Star Trek fans.

It was open to the public so that 
Whovians without a travelling companion could attend the event, with 
tickets being sold at Â£10 per head.

The
 event followed the record-breaking broadcast of this week's Doctor Who 
special anniversary episode, which featured doctors from bygone eras in 
the same show.

Famous foe: The Whovians were treated to a Doctor Who themed party after the service which featured appearances by memorable characters such as the Daleks, above, and Cybermen

The 50th anniversary special set a 
new world record after being broadcast in 94 countries across six 
continents following a massive global campaign.

In
 addition to the TV broadcast, the episode was screened in more than 
1,500 cinemas worldwide, including in the UK, US, Canada, Latin America,
 Germany, Russia and Scandinavia.

More
 than half a million tickets were sold for the theatrical screenings at 
which fans were able to watch the episode in spectacular 3D.

First broadcast on BBC One on 
November 23, 1963, Doctor Who is already in the Guinness Book of World 
Records as the most successful sci-fi series.

The
 award was presented today by Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness
 World Records, to the show's executive producer and head writer Steven 
Moffat at the Doctor Who Celebration at London's ExCeL.

Mr
 Moffat said: 'For years the Doctor has been stopping everyone else from
 conquering the world. Now, just to show off, he's gone and done it 
himself!'

Cause for celebration: The happy couples took their vows simultaneously in one of the biggest 'Whovian' weddings ever, before enjoying Doctor Who themed cake, right

Tim Davie, from BBC Worldwide, said: 'We knew we were attempting something unprecedented in broadcast history, not only because Doctor Who is a drama, unlike a live feed event such as a World Cup football match or a royal wedding, but because we had to deliver the episode in advance to the four corners of the world so that it could be dubbed and subtitled into 15 different languages.

'If there was any doubt that Doctor Who is one of the world's biggest TV shows, this award should put that argument to rest - and how fitting for it to receive such an accolade in its 50th year.'
