The NYPD is investigating the death of a man found bound and gagged in his East Harlem apartment.

The 59-year-old victim Milton Ortiz was discovered in his bed by neighbors Thursday morning.

Police say his feet and hands were bound with phone cord and a towel was wrapped around his neck.

'Neighbors looked in and saw his body slumped on the floor,' Steven Goldman, who runs a business on the street, told the New York Post.

Neighbors say Milton Ortiz had lived in his first-floor walkup on East 126th Street for decades.

They say he was very friendly and everyone knew him.

'He’s harmless ... totally harmless,' said neighbor Artie Roscher, 46, told the New York Daily News. 'He’s always by himself.'

Brother: Ortiz's younger sibling Edwin Ortiz says his brother did not deserve whatever befell him last night

Investigation underway: Police are examining surveillance footage and evidence in Ortiz's apartment to determine who could have been with him last night

The medical examiner will determine the cause of death.

According to Gothamist, Ortiz had a medical condition that required outside care, and police are now questioning his home health care aide about the crime.

They are also examining surveillance footage from a nearby bus station to determine who could have been with Ortiz in his apartment before his death.

There was no sign of a struggle, and not sign of forced entry into the apartment.

Ortiz's brother Edwin Ortiz said his brother was well-known in the neighborhood, and he had no enemies.

'There's no reason for whatever happened to him,' said Edwin Ortiz. '(It's) something that shouldn't have happened. Not to him.'
