Rob Kearney has vowed that the ‘real Ireland’ will roar into Murrayfield to try and salvage a Six Nations title win on Saturday, amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to Wales.

Ireland face a major challenge to retain the championship with England enjoying a better points difference and Wales expected to run up a big total against Italy in Rome.

However, the Welsh were left fuming on Monday night after it emerged there will be no trophy to present to Sam Warburton in the Stadio Olimpico even if it transpires after the final match of the day between England and France that the Welsh are champions.

There are two Six Nations trophies and one will be in Murrayfield, and the other in Twickenham, a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some Welsh supporters. It will require a more coherent and less error-addled performance from Ireland to defeat the Scots, and Kearney did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team-mates.

‘This week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole, how we react after a very disappointing defeat,’ the full-back said.

‘We’ll see the real Ireland step up this week. A lot of us who underperformed last week know if we get the opportunity, [we have] to right a lot of those wrongs.’

Ireland’s message for the week appears to have been decided: they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless Scotland, but Kearney did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there.

The impression was of players straining, impatient for their coaches to let slip the leash. Yet whether it is admitted or not, the sense in salting away as big a points difference as possible is evident given England’s superior figures and the fact that they are hosting underwhelming France. Wales will also be confident of eating into the Irish and English points’ advantage against Italy.

‘I think any time you get to the last game of a championship you can go and play a bit,’ said Kearney on the question of style. ‘When I say that, it’s important the wrong perception isn’t picked up here and that we’re going to chase this game and we’re going to try and build points, because we’re not,’ he quickly added.

‘But we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash. It’s important to get the win but how we do that will be no different to over the last three or four weeks.’

The Ireland style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game, and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by Schmidt in chasing the match last Saturday. That explained the dislocated moves close to the Wales line, goes this argument.

‘We have good confidence in our running game,’ said Kearney. ‘We were just getting a lot of value from our kicking game. If you launch up a ball and it travels 40 metres and you get it back, that is the equivalent of a 40-yard line break which is very hard to come by.

‘I think the other side of that is maybe we were chasing the game a bit from early so maybe we were forced to keep the ball in hand a little bit more and try and go after the game.’

They couldn’t do so, but there is little expectation of significant changes being made by Schmidt for the trip to Scotland.

One of the rare positives to survive the journey to Wales was the fitness of the squad.

No new casualties were sustained, and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the Millennium Stadium.

Iain Henderson was the most dynamic of the subs used against Wales and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week, with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility.

There have also been calls from some for the addition of Luke Fitzgerald to the replacements’ bench.

Kearney admitted that when a team is changed it can sharpen the attention of everyone within the group.

‘It keeps everyone on their toes. I think every single player has been dropped at some stage in their career. It’s happened to the very best of guys. You’ve got new guys coming into the team and they bring a huge amount of energy and excitement because they’re finally getting their chance.

‘The guys who performed under par realise that maybe they have been given a second chance and they really need to pull their socks up.

‘I think when that does happen there can be some positives taken from it.’
