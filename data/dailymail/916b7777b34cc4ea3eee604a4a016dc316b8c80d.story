A mother and son who claim to have given some of the stars of TOWIE their brilliant white smiles are facing prosecution after being accused of not being licensed for dentistry.

Joanne Wheatley, 43, and her son 23-year-old Cane Wheatley appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court today facing allegations by the General Dental Council (GDC) that they 'unlawfully held themselves out to be prepared to practice dentistry'.

Several celebrities including The Only Way Is Essex stars Danielle Armstrong and James Lock, as well as Geordie Shore's Gary Beadle have been used in advertising for the business called Essex Smiles.

They offer whitening treatments ranging from £40 for a 'White Smile' to £60 for a 'Essex Smile'.

But Ms Wheatley and her son, both of Harlow, have both pleaded not guilty to being unregistered dental professionals.

Prosecutor Fallon Alexis told the court that tooth whitening could only be undertaken by a registered professional dentist, dental hygienist, dental therapist or clinical dental technician.

He said that neither of the defendants were registered with the GDC.

He explained that undercover investigators working for the GDC posed as potential customers using false names after the local council received complaints about Essex Smiles, based in Harlow.

Retired police officers Pierre Turner and Deborah Woledge told the court how Ms Wheatley explained and demonstrated what would happen to the 'nervous' Ms Woledge when they visited Essex Smiles on May 19 this year.

The court heard how she also let them visit a patient undergoing treatment in another room.

Ms Woledge said it was explained to her that a blue gel would be put on gums to protect them and a whitening gel would then be put on teeth in the 45-minute session.

There would be three applications lasting 15 minutes each under a LED accelerator lamp, 'which activates the gel, opens the pores and whitens the teeth from the inside out.'

She said the gel did not contain peroxide and was a USA 'oxygel', the court heard.

Giving evidence, Ms Woledge said she mentioned she had heard on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine programme that you had to be a dentist to do teeth whitening.

Ms Wheatley is said to have claimed: 'No you don’t need to be a dentist. It’s only tooth whitening.'

Asked if she was qualified or trained, she allegedly replied she had been trained and it cost her £2,000.

She said if Ms Woledge went ahead with the £40 sale price offer, she would do the treatment on a later date as her son would be on holiday.

The defendant allegedly told her she would be happy.

Ms Wooledge added: 'She said she had lots of repeat customers and they were all happy with the result.'

Bobby Norris from TOWIE and Gary Beadle from Geordie Shore have also been involved in helping to promote Essex Smiles 

The court was also told that the prosecution against Cane Wheatley is based on a video downloaded on May 23 this year from the Essex Smiles web address in which he is seen talking about and performing a treatment on a young woman.

In it he says: 'I am the owner of Essex Smiles and this is one of my clients today.'

Another GDC investigator, retired Met officer Steven White, told magistrates he posed as someone responding to the firm’s advert and spoke to Mr Wheatley over the phone on March 31 this year about the services on offer.

Mr White claimed that Wheatley stated there was a registered GDC dentist who supervised the teeth whitening technician.

He also said a client’s mouth was not examined by a dentist beforehand.

Warning letters were sent to Essex Smiles’ Harlow address on 18 September 2013 and 3 February 2014.

Both mother and son, who run Essex Smiles have pleaded not guilty to being unregistered and 'unlawfully holding themselves out to be prepared to practice dentistry'

Letters inviting both to a voluntary interview were sent on 3 June.

There were no replies to any of those, said Mr White.

Magistrates have now adjourned the trial until February next year.

Outside court Ms Wheatley confirmed that they had lots of celebrity clients and her son said he was friends with a lot of the TOWIE stars.
