Researchers have been left baffled as hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups continue to wash up on California beaches in what is proving to be a particularly deadly winter for the pinnipeds.

In January, rescuers netted more than 250 frail pups from San Diego to San Francisco Bay, mostly seven-month-olds that should have been nursing with their mothers in the Channel Islands or Mexico.

Although this is the third year of mass die-offs of pups, the 2015 figures are the worst so far. They have even prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to declare a rare 'unusual mortality event'.

The reason behind the increasing die-offs is unknown. Many scientists believe warmer-than-average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food, leaving their offspring behind.

Others say the fish the seals eat may be feeding farther from the islands than in the past, leading to the same problem. And some theorize the pups may be suffering from an unidentified disease. 

Speaking of the sick pups, Erica Donnelly-Greenan, who manages the Sausalito-based Marine Mammal Center’s rescue station, said: 'They just look very emaciated, very underweight.'

She added: 'You can see the bones under their skin. You can get a visual of their ribs.'

Dozens of wayward pups have been found at the center, situated along Monterey Bay.The nonprofit  responded to 120 pups in the first five or six weeks of 2015, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

It is currently treating the pups - many of which washed ashore weighing just 15 or 16 pounds compared to a healthy 40 pounds - with antibiotics. The sickest are being force-fed with tubes.

Recovery: The reason behind the increasing die-offs is unknown. Many scientists believe warmer-than-average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food, leaving their offspring behind

Left by its mother? Some say the fish the seals eat may be feeding farther from the islands than in the past, leading to the same problem. And others theorize the pups may be suffering from an unidentified disease

'Our numbers are twice what they were in 2013,' said David Bard, operations director of the San Pedro center. 'In 2013, we saw an unprecedented number of rescues, it was a record then.' 

Meanwhile, more than 50 malnourished sea lion pups have been placed in a holding pen at Sea World San Diego since the beginning of the year after being rescued on beaches along the city's coast.

'When they came in, they couldn't raise their heads, so to see them start grooming and barking, that means they're feeling much better, much more themselves,' SeaWorld vet Dr. Hendrik Rollens said.

'They are ready to go back to the wild.'

Because young sea lions typically do not wean off their mothers until they are 10 or 11 months old, they could struggle for survival if left by their mothers while they search farther afield for food.

'The pups are desperate and starving, so they just jump in the water and swim and get pulled to the coastline,' said Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary medicine for the Marine Mammal Center. 

Speaking to SFGate, she added: 'This is the third year that we’ve seen these mass die-offs, but this is the worst so far. If this continues, there will be some long-term effects on the sea lion population.'

Justin Viezbicke, stranding network coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said the population of sea lions might have reached its  capacity in the animals' environment, sparking the mass die-offs.

Swimming: Despite the die-offs, sea lions in California have been relatively healthy in recent decades, with the population at 300,000 today. Above, the same pup is seen eating the fish while swimming at the center

'These animals are a puzzle piece for us,' Mr Viezbicke said. 'They provide insight into what’s going on in the environment... These things could come back and affect humans.'

Despite the current situation, sea lions in California have been relatively healthy in recent decades, with the population at 300,000 today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.

In 1972, Marine Mammal Protection Act  helped boost the pinnipeds' numbers by banning hunters from killing the animals for their hide and blubber. 

NOAA is investigating the mass die-offs.
