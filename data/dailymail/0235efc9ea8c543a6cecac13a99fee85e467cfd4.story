Christie Dawn Harris, 28, was hiding a loaded gun in her genitalia and bags of crystal meth in her buttock cheeks

Police officers who searched a woman as part of a drugs raid were stunned to discover she had hidden a revolver in her vagina and bags of crystal meth in her bottom.

Christie Dawn Harris, 28, was arrested after after police in Ada, Oklahoma, searched her car and found meth, drug paraphernalia, a pistol, and some ammo, reportsÂ Gawker.

As she was taken to jail she complained to arresting officers that she needed to go to the bathroom.

When she was told that she had to change into 'jail clothing', she refused to do so, claiming she was on her period.

She eventually agreed to submit to a body cavity search, at which point Officer Kathy Unbewust says she 'observed at that time a wooden and metal item sticking out from her vagina area.'

It turned out to be a loaded Freedom Arms .22-caliber handgun, with three live bullets and one spent shell.

But the revelations didn't stop there. According to Pontotoc County District Attorney Chris Ross, 'as [Harris] turned around, [the officer] noticed more plastic baggies, larger plastic baggies wedged in the crack of her buttocks.'

The bags were found to contain meth.

Harris and an accomplice were booked on various drugs and weapons charges. They both have extensive criminal records.
