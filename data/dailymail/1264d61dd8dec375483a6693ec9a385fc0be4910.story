How's this for a line-up? The guitarist has 78 fingers and 12 picks, the drummer has 21 sticks and six arms - and the keyboard player can flash multi-layered beams from its eyes.

Mach, Ashura and Cosmo form Z-Machines - a three-piece rock band made up of robots - and they made for a scary sight while performing at an art and technology event in Tokyo, Japan.

The group, who made their debut live performance in July, were created by a group of engineers and academics at Tokyo University, who hope they will one day be able to perform in space.

Performance: Guitarist Mach and drummer Ashura (back), members of a robot rock band Z-Machines, at the technology event Maker Faire Tokyo at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation

Skilful: A boy plays a keyboard to control Mach. The band made their debut live performance last July

Rocker: Guitarist Mach has a computer screen and cables coming out of its head - which give the impression of long hair when it moves its head back and forth. One video shows him playing at 1,184 bpm

They were pictured today during the two-day Maker Faire Tokyo event at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, four months after their first live performance in the same city.

Guitarist Mach has a computer screen and cables coming out of its head - which give the impression of long hair when it moves its head back and forth. One video shows it playing at 1,184 bpm.

And the idea behind keyboard player Cosma projecting laser beams from its eyes is to give crowds a ‘transcendental music performance’. Drummer Ashura can play four times faster than humans.

The robots – who have been sponsored by Zima, an alcoholic drink which rose to fame in the 1990s but is still popular in Japan - are programmed to perform based on the audiences' reaction.

Movements: The human powered robot suit, made of aluminum skeleton, is developed for the performance for screen and stage plays

For example, in one concert, when audience members lifted up their bottles of Zima, the robots played harder. During that performance there were also dancers and singers on stage with the band.

At their latest performance, Cosmo did not appear to be present, although it has played with the group on previous occasions.

Also seen this weekend at the fair - which is only in its second year - was a man wearing the lightweight robot suit Skeletonics, which expands its users' motions two times larger.

Expectations: The scientists behind Z-Machines want Mach and his band-mates to play on the moon
