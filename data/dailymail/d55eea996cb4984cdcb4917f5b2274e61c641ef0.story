With record snowfalls and icy temperatures, ski resorts across North America are booming.

But these haunting images show that while tourists may be flocking to some resorts, others can lay abandoned and in a few short years become overgrown as nature reclaims the mountain.

The Talisman hotel, in Ontario, Canada, was once a booming holiday spot, but after going bankrupt four years ago, it has fallen victim to its surroundings.

Spooky: It has taken just four years for nature to start reclaiming the Talisman hotel, near Toronto in Canada

Abandoned: The resort, which opened in the early 1960s, closed down in 2011 after going bankrupt, and has since been home to squatters

Ready: The hotel looks like it has been abandoned half way through the day - with tables seemingly set and ready to receive guests

Skiing: The resort did not just offer skiing, but had a golf course and multiple swimming pools for the guests

Located just 70 miles north-west of Toronto, the 200-acre resort once bustled with families and skiers taking to the slopes and enjoying drinks at apres-ski bars.

The hotel had its own snow-making machines, multiple swimming pools, as well as a golf course and tennis facilities for those visiting in the warmer months.

A 1984 advert for the Talisman, which was built in the 1960s, shows people enjoying the slopes, as well as taking a dip in the pool and dancing with friends after a hard day's skiing.

'More than a ski hill,' the voice over boasts. 'A resort.' 

All that seems a far cry away now: squatters and damp have taken their toll, and nature has crept back in. 

Urban explorer, known only as LeftAhead, has captured these eerie images, showing the abandoned site, where empty chair lifts swing above grassy slopes and restaurants remain set for a dinner that will never appear. 

The swimming pools are no longer filled with clear water, but plant life, dust covers every inch of the once-popular hotel and the only reminder of the 21st century comes from two abandoned chip and pin machines.

But it may all change yet: it seems there was hope for new life at the Talisman.

Overgrown: The pools which generations of visitors enjoyed jumping into are now home to the mountain's plant life

Broken: Windows across the building have been smashed, adding to the feeling of neglect which permeates the area

Dust covered: It seems no one even bothered to sell off the furniture when the hotel and ski resort closed in 2011

Modern: The only hint the pictures give to its recent past are these two chip and pin machines, also abandoned at the Talisman

A group of developers has snapped up the property, announcing at the end of January it would get a new name: Talisman Mountain Springs Inn.

Speaking to the Toronto Star last year, businessman Brian Ellis suggested the resort would need $5million to $7million (£2.525million to 3.675million) to bring it back to its former glory.

The developers have penciled in an opening date of July 1 (Canada Day) for the new, revitalised resort - complete with yoga studio and spa, and rebuilt golf course. 

However, the ski slope is not going to be bought back as it was decided they were no longer financially viable.

New life: But there is hope for the future of the Talisman: after years being left to rot, new developers have moved in to transform the site

Millions: The total cost of renovations to bring it up to scratch was somewhere between $5million and $7million 

Hope: The developers are confident they can bring customers back to the resort - but it doesn't seem they will be reintroducing the ski lifts

Date: The developers are hoping to open up once more on July 1 - which is Canada Day, a public holiday in the North American country
