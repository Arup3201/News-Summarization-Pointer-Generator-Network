Only Gordon Ramsay could take asparagus, fructose and shiitake mushrooms and come up with a recipe for teaching his children how to swear without causing offence.

The chef, known for his use of expletives, has revealed he is teaching daughters Megan, Matilda and Holly and son Jack ‘some really nice alternatives to curse words’.

Ramsay, presenter of The F Word on Channel 4, tells them to say ‘shiitake’ instead of ‘s***’, ‘asparagus’ instead of ‘a**’ and ‘fructose’ in place of ‘f***’.

But the 48-year-old admitted that at his last parents’ evening, one of the children’s teachers said that it was still offensive and that he should stop.

Ramsay said that he replied: ‘I said: ‘Well it’s a Japanese mushroom, it’s delicious, now f*** off.’’

The chef has long been known for his bad language - but this is the first time that he has admitted that he is teaching the same to his children, who are aged between 12 and 16.

In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live in the US, he said: ‘I tried to teach them some side language. 

Known for his use of expletives: The chef, who was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, has gained fame on shows such as Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares

'So I said: "Look, cursing is not smart, it’s an industry language and sometimes daddy lets it slip - 20 times a day." So I come up with some really nice sort of alternatives to curse words. 

'So rather than saying the word s***, which you know, is not nice - shiitake. And instead of the F word? Fructose. Rather than saying a**, it’s asparagus.’

Ramsay has admitted to unconventional parenting in the past and has told his children that cooking is a ‘life skill’ - and is more important than passing exams.

He was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and moved out of home at 16 because of his abusive alcoholic father - gaining fame on shows such as Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.
