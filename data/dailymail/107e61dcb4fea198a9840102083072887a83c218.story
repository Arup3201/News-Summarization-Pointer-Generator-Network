When Austin Wayne Underwood proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Smith, it marked a celebratory milestone for the Texas couple, who both have Down syndrome.

Austin and Jessica first met when they were three years old, after their mothers connected through a support group for children with disabilities.

But their friendship soon developed into something stronger and the couple, now in their mid-30s, are busily planning their wedding.

The couple's romance is a cause of celebration for their families, who had fought to give Austin and Jessica a regular childhood at a time when many people who have their condition were kept separate.

Austin's mother, Jan Underwood, had to battle the Fort Worth school system to send him to the regular high school, and even found a New Mexico college that takes in Down students, so her son could experience student life.

'People usually hide people with 
disabilities. We always treated him as a little boy first and his 
disability second. He has a normal life,' Mrs Underwood told Fort Worth Texas Magazine.

Her determination that Austin would lead a normal life has paid off, with him set to marry his fiancée, Jessica, at a Western-themed wedding at a Dallas vineyard.

Austin proposed to Jessica, who is from Dallas, just before Christmas in 2012. He rented a limo and took her on a tour of holiday lights, before getting down on one knee and presenting her with a diamond ring.

The couple created a 'save the date' DVD to send to friends and relatives, and were recently fitted for custom-made cowboy boots to wear on their big day. 

'Austin and Jessica both have short, wide, little feet, and wearing boots off the shelf is a huge challenge,' Mrs Underwood, who arranged an appointment for them at boot-maker Justin Boots, said.

While the wedding plans are cause for excitement, Austin is just delighted to be marrying his childhood sweetheart.

'For me, it is about being a part of Jessica’s life and always being together,' he told FWTX.

The couple and their families have been close for more than 30 years, often spending Christmas together.

And, after the wedding, they can look forward to even more joint family celebrations.
