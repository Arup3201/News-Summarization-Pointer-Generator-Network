A Delaware boy who uses a wheelchair was beaten and robbed by two other boys on Monday - and police say it wasn't their first assault.

The New Castle County Police Department said in a news release Monday afternoon 'the victim was outside exercising in his wheelchair when two suspects ran up behind him.'

The victim, who has been identified by local media as Lequan Mackey, was beaten by the teen assailants after his wheelchair was shoved into a storm drain, police said.

Victim: Lequan Mackey was reportedly beaten and robbed by two boys on Monday afternoon 

Both Mackey's key and lanyard were snatched, according to the New Castle County Police Department.

The boys are both between the ages of 12 and 14 and 4'8", the police department said. 

Police said the Caucasian suspect's hand has a birth mark and that he is of 'regular build with short blond hair.' The African-American suspect has a 'thin build with short black hair.'

Mackey told CBS Philadelphia 'These kids pushed me into a sewer grate thing and my wheel got stuck and he started punching me. And I put my hand up to block the punch and then he grabbed my lanyard, twisted it, put it back around my neck again and started to pull it.'

'I’m thinking no, no I can’t let this happen and I started to scream and they ran off,' he also said of the incident.

CBS Philadelphia reported Mackey uses the wheelchair because of surgery on his leg and has cerebral palsy.

Attack: Mackey says the assailants have attacked him at least two times before

Upset: Father Paul Mackey has said 'When I hear that somebody is doing evil to my child, I get quite angry'

Mackey told the affiliate station the assailants have attacked him at least two times before.

Paul Mackey told CBS Philadelphia, 'When I hear that somebody is doing evil to my child, I get quite angry.'

Officer Tracy Duffy told MailOnline no friends or neighbors have come forward with information about the assailants since the story broke. She said if they are identified, they'll likely face robbery charges since that is how the case is being handled at this point. 

Duffy said Mackey was assaulted by the two boys several days ago, but that his property did not seem to be stolen in that instance.

A motive has not been established, she said.
