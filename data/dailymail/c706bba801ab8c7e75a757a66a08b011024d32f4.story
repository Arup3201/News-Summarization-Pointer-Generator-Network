Midfielder Sergio Busquets believes the speed and mobility that has been such a strength for Barcelona in recent years has become their great weakness.

Busquets concedes size has mattered of late for Barca, no more so than when their goal was breached yet again from a set-piece as they fell 1-0 to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.

On Sunday, left back Jordi Alba, at just 5ft 5in, couldn't deal with a first-half corner by Sergio Canales and headed past his own keeper Claudio Bravo for the only goal of the game.

'We haven't started the year well,' Goal.com quotes Busquets as saying. 'People say it is normal to lose but it isn't for us. 

'We don't have physically strong or tall players and that has cost us at corner-kicks.'

Barcelona are so lacking in height that Luis Suarez, hardly renowned for his size at 5ft 11in, was the third-tallest outfield player in Enrique's starting XI on Sunday.

Only Jeremy Mathieu and Busquets, both listed at 6ft 2in, were taller.

The loss in San Sebastian hurt Barca even more as it would have taken Enrique's side ahead of league leaders Real Madrid, who were beaten 2-1 at Valencia.

Barcelona next face Elche in the Copa del Rey on Thursday before meeting Atletico Madrid, who are behind them on goal difference on 38 points, on Sunday.
