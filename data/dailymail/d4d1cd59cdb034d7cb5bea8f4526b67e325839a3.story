A Great British Bake Off fan irritated by the constant moaning of finalist Ruby Tandoh has created a online blog which pokes fun at her vast menu of facial expressions.

The blogger hi-jacked a gif gallery set up by Ruby's supporters, called TheManyFacesOfRubyTandoh, and inserted his own captions ridiculing the 21-year-old former model.

Ruby, who has been awarded the coveted 'Star Baker' accolade three times by judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, has riled viewers with her constant self-deprecation.

Despite irritating viewers Ruby Tandoh has managed to reach the final of Great British Bake Off

Now dozens of Twitter users fed up with Ruby's little-girl-lost act have tweeted a link to the blog, which appears on Buzzfeed.

One gif captioned 'How embarrassing... I've been made Star Baker AGAIN' shows Ruby bashfully blinking, and another video featuring Ruby with a cocked head and a shy smile has been captioned: 'Aw shucks... and I thought they were burnt'.  

Meanwhile a short clip of Ruby scowling as she ferociously stirs a meringue mix has been given the heading: 'Dammit... everyone's mixing faster than me' and another clip of her coyly biting her lip and touching her hair is captioned: 'Gee guys... not in front of Christine!'

One viewer tweeted after last night's show: 'Finding Ruby's childish faces so tedious now... #dramaqueen. She should have gone, not Becca. Please let Kimberley win! #gbbo'

Another Twitter user fed up with Ruby wrote: 'Is there any need for the facial expressions that Ruby makes on the great British Bake Off? You are only making a cake love, calm down.'

Meanwhile one of the show's fan simply posted a link to the blog and tweeted: 'For anyone as irritated by Ruby as I am.'

Great British Bake Off viewers have also been venting their frustration with Ruby on the BBC's Points of View online forum.

Now dozens of Twitter users fed up with Ruby's little-girl-lost act have tweeted a link to the blog, which appears on Buzzfeed

One viewer posted: 'Oh the pouts, the hang (puppy) dog looks and at the end the tears - and she didn't even lose! Ruby, give it a rest (yes I know it's not live) but for goodness sake enough is enough.'

And another disgruntled viewer said she would be boycotting Great British Bake Off next year if philosophy student Ruby won.

She posted: 'The programme is worse this year as they keep fawning over Ruby... she pulls a sad face and they swoon over her... pathetic it's more like X Factor than ever.

'She shouldn't have got star baker last week... if she wins I wont be watching next year... they need to be careful that they don't lose their loyal viewers!'
