Congressman Aaron Schock has given his new office  a Downton Abbey-style make over.

The Republican has reportedly taken interior design inspiration from the Crawley family for the redecoration of his new digs.

The normal beige, that is favored on Capitol Hill, has been replaced with bright red paint, extravagant mirrors, gold fixtures and black candles.

A member of staff was said to have confessed that that the new design was based on Downton Abbey's red room, the Washington Post reported.

However, the 33-year-old Illinois congressman has refused to say if he drew his inspiration from Julian Fellowes' hit television series, starring Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery and Elizabeth McGovern.

'I don't even know if he watches it,' his communications director replied, when asked about the bold refit by the newspaper.

Each member of congress is allowed to repaint their office when they move in, but there are a limited number of colours available.

The bright red chosen by the rising Republican star, who has appeared on the cover of Men's Heath, is not believed to be on the list.

Annie Brahler, the interior designer behind the new look, told the publication that Schock was 'fresh minded' and not 'hung up on doing things the same way as everyone else.'

Fictional Downton Abbey is set in Highclere Castle in Newbury, Berkshire, and is home to the Lord and Lady Carnarvon.
