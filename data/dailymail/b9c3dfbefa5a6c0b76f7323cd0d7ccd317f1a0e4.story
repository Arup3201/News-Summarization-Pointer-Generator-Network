It’s the dappled brown fur many of us first laid eyes on watching Disney’s Bambi.

But now the same soft hide has been turned into a luxury fashion accessory – to the horror of animal rights campaigners.

Marketed as ‘for the individualist’, a collection of deer fur clutch bags and iPad cases has been designed by Rosemary Hobrough – whose husband is a deer stalker. Her Dorset-based company Rah & Co launched this year and sells the bags online for up to £110.

Controversial: Deer fur handbags from Rah & Co, which have angered animal rights campaigners

But a spokesman from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has urged people to boycott the products. He said: ‘People would rather be caught dead than wearing Bambi.

‘Deer are beautiful animals, in contrast to the ugly nature of people who would sport their skin as an accessory to their own heartlessness.’

Managed deer culling is legal in the UK, and is used as a form of population control to prevent the animals starving or falling victim to disease.

But the Peta spokesman added: ‘Selling bags made of animals who were gunned down while enjoying a natural life... results only in greedy, arrogant deer skin sellers keeping deer alive each year just long enough to kill them so as to sell more deer skin products.’

Designer: Rosemary Hobrough

However Mrs Hobrough, who is in her fifties, said her creations were a mark of respect to the animals.

She explained that she had the idea when she took a course in venison butchery and discovered the skins were simply incinerated.

‘[It] is a great shame considering how beautiful the material is,’  she said.

The grandmother-of-four makes her designs from the hide of animals killed by her 70-year-old husband Martyn.

He added: ‘It’s a good idea on Rosemary’s part because we eat the deer meat but the hide is wasted.’
