An investigation is underway into a drunken vicar who had to be locked in the vestry after he fell over on his way into a church to conduct a wedding.

A replacement had to take the ceremony after Reverend Brian Taylor allegedly fell over in front of nearly 100 wedding guests,while it was believed he was drunk, and had to be ushered into the sideroom.

He could then apparently be heard shouting 'In the name of the Lord, I'm not drunk' from behind the door, while Chris John and Lori Collins were getting married at St George’s Church, in Cwmparc, South Wales.

The vicar has has now reportedly been given a month's leave to 'deal with some issues', according to The Sun.

A Diocese of Llandaff spokesman told MailOnline: 'This is a very unfortunate incident and we are investigating what happened. We are sincerely sorry for any upset or inconvenience caused to all those at the service.'

The happy couple, both 24 and from nearby Treorchy, South Wales, spent more than £20,000 on the wedding.

The bride's mother Debbie Collins, 49, told The Sun said they would not have been able to get married if a replacement was not found.

She said: 'It is a funny story but it wasn’t funny at the time.'

Usher Rhodri Jones said he saw the vicar stagger down the hill as he made his way to the service at the church.

The couple, who are currently on a three-week honeymoon, have apparently told friends they still had a 'wonderful day' (file picture)

He said: 'He walked past me like Jack 
Sparrow, tripped over the step into the church and fell through the door
 in front of 96 people.'

A friend of the groom meanwhile told the
 paper the couple, who were due to sign the register in the vestry, had to sign the book outside.

But the couple, who are currently on a three-week honeymoon, have apparently told friends they still had a 'wonderful day' and now found the event 'quite funny'.

Mr Taylor last night told The Sun he was unable to comment on the incident.
