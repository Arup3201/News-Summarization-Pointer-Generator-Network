Gripping new reality TV show Southern Charm wrapped its first season last Monday with a shocking baby bombshell, and millions of its eager viewers are waiting with baited breath for tonight's reunion episode, hoping some important questions will be answered.

In a surprise twist at the end of last week's finale, it was revealed that Thomas Ravenel, 51, and his 22-year-old girlfriend Kathryn Dennis - who the last we knew had broken up - had actually welcomed their first child together, baby Kensington Calhourn Ravenel.

In the last nine months since the cameras stopped rolling, a reconciliation clearly occurred between the troubled pair after they learned they were expecting, and they now appear to be thriving in a state of parental bliss, with Thomas posting gushing photos of his new daughter Kensington to his Facebook account.

Since the cameras packed up and left, the couple began shacking up in Palm Beach, Florida after spending last summer in the Hamptons.

Last week's finale introduced baby Kensington to its shocked viewers in the last minute of the episode, following straight after footage of Thomas dumping his philanderess girlfriend after she admitted to sleeping with his friend, Whitney.

The
last scene of the finale, however, was tranquil and the parents looked entirely content. Normally lithe 
Kathryn's baby weight added to the feeling that things settled down for 
the duo as they entered into parenthood.

Cute as a button: Little Kensington Calhoun Ravenel, now five weeks old, was born on March 24th, seen here in the first photo her father Thomas shared of her on Facebook

Southern mini-belle: Little Kensington (pictured)'s arrival was a shock to viewers, who last saw her parents Thomas and Kathryn break up at the end of the first season's finale

But missing from the footage is any indication of what happened between the breakup and birth.

Things didn't look good for young Kathryn when the finale opened with foppish Whitney finally confessing to Thomas that he had slept with his friend's then 21-year-old flame-haired girlfriend.

Thomas forgave his chum but wanted Kathryn to come clean without his prodding.

Hands on father: Thomas, who had previously experienced a false pregnancy alarm with Kathryn during an earlier episode, realized he wanted a baby 'for real' - and happily, he got his wish soon after

Vocal: 'Kensington is starting to make her needs known - I need ear plugs!' Thomas exclaimed during a recent interview

Missing mom: Bundle of joy: Kathryn shared this photo of her 'sweet pea' over the weekend during a flyby visit to New York with Thomas

'We never had anything serious,' Kathryn said as she and Thomas got ready for Whitney's long anticipated July 4th soiree.

The
 rest of the gang managed to get through the party without scrapping 
with outsider Kathryn, but it was when she and Thomas returned home that
 tempers truly flared.

After a heated argument, she admits to Thomas: 'I hooked up with Whitney.'

New York moment: Thomas (front left) shared this snap of the cast of Southern Charm at a hip Meatpacking restaurant last week

New life: In last week's finale, the couple (pictured) appeared happy and relaxed as they settled into their new roles as parents

Darling: The adorable baby girl has one of her mother's family names, Calhoun, as a middle name in honor of ancestor John Calhoun, the seventh vice president

Devoted: One scene showed Thomas cradling his baby girl, with a monogrammed spit up cloth tossed over his shoulder

The secret was out and the couple broke up shortly after a July 4th party at Whitney's new apartment.

Baby weight: Kathryn showed off a fuller figure following the birth of her first baby

But the show's vixen was harboring another secret that leaked a week before the finale aired, and was finally shown to the world last Monday.

While the credits rolled, viewers were introduced to the baby girl they welcomed March 24th.

Judging
 from what was shown, Kathryn did not know she was pregnant when Thomas 
dumped her, citing their 29 year age gap through his tears.

She
 fled his Charleston home barefoot, clutching a few possessions and her 
laptop as her much older boyfriend chased her down for a last hug.

Prior to the break-up, Thomas and Kathryn, made headlines for a previous pregnancy false alarm, which became a major story 
arc in the first season.

Kathryn's pregnancy 
scare was all the more dramatic when it remained unclear if it was Thomas who was the 
potential father or another of her conquests, fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur, 
Shep Rose.

Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's rabid fans, Kathryn did not end up being pregnant that time.

While Thomas seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal's test came back negative, he told BravoTV's The Dish that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl in March.

'I hooked up with Whitney': Tempers had flared 
earlier in the finale episode when Thomas (left) finally got a tearful Kathryn (right) to admit she had
slept with Whitney, leading to a dramatic break up scene

Drama: She fled his house and ran to her Mercedes barefoot, clutching her laptop, after he delivered what seemed to be a final blow to their pairing

'It's really a blessing,' he said. 'It's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be a part of!'

In fact, it was the scare itself that showed Thomas just how much having a baby with Kathryn would mean to him.

'I'm
 getting on in my age and I wanted a child,' he said. 'And after we had 
wrapped up shooting in Charleston, we had both decided we wanted to have
 a baby for real. We both love each other and care about each other.'

Tears: Thomas came back inside, kept sobbing, and sat in a chair and the credits rolled. It seemed their relationship with done for good, as well as season one of Southern Charm

The new mom is doing well, too, Thomas said.

'She
 has tremendous motherly instincts,' he said. 'She's been constantly 
reading books about babies and doing her homework. She is all over her 
new responsibilities.

'She has the energy and the mindset to make sure the baby is well taken care of. I've really grown to respect and admire her.'

Fertile for ground for drama: Kathryn and Thomas in an earlier episode which showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Kathryn's pregnancy test results - which turned out to be negative

So will the happy couple be getting married any time soon?

'We've been talking about it,' he said. 'Eventually I'd like to get married. All I can say is stay tuned.'

For now, they're just focused on learning to be parents.

'Kensington
 is starting to make her needs known - I need ear plugs,' he said. 'But 
everyone's healthy and happy and we're just blessed.'

Arrests: Thomas once served months in 
prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a DUI. And this 2012 mugshot of Kathryn was 
snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession

Despite not initially being a main cast member, Kathryn's presence on 
the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, 
intrigue and southern seduction.

When the local celebutante, political 
scion and model was hauled into Berkeley County jail for underage 
drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012, authorities snapped the sexy 
mugshot of the century.

For fans wondering how Kathryn got to 
join the soapy series' main cast members in their drunken antics: the 5ft 11in redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the 
show's already impossibly high drama.

Earlier times: Kathryn (right) caused a stir when she first made an appearance on the show as a minor character, and proceeded to turn Thomas' (right) life upside down

And Kathryn
 may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate 
developer turned felon Thomas, even with the 30-year age gap.

Like Kathryn, Thomas also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking.

He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July.

The
 former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license 
suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and
 Courier.

Tonight's reunion episode airs on Brave at 10pm.
