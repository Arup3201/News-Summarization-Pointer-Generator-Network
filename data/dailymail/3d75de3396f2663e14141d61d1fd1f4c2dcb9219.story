Christmas has become so commercialised it has lost its true meaning, David Blunkett has warned.

The former Home Secretary claimed ‘fairy lights, tinsel and extravagant presents’ have made us forget about those who do not have families to celebrate with.

Mr Blunkett used the example of one of his constituents – who organises an annual Christmas lunch for hundreds of lonely and homeless people – to highlight the importance of helping others over the festive period.

Saying we should be ‘counting our blessings’ rather than feeling sorry for ourselves, he urged families to relearn the ‘true spirit of Christmas’ by inviting less fortunate into their homes. 

He told the Radio Times [must credit]: ‘Charles Dickens published A Christmas Carol in 1843, introducing the world to Ebenezer Scrooge and Tiny Tim. It remains perhaps the most popular Christmas fiction story of our time.

‘But since it was written, it saddens me that Christmas has become so commercialised and over-hyped that its true meaning has become lost beneath the welter of fairy lights, tinsel and extravagant presents. 

‘But despite what I say, I am not a Scrooge. I like Christmas and recall with fondness the simpler Christmasses of my childhood.

It’s an occasion when most of us look forward to spending time with family and those we love.

‘Nevertheless, for some, Christmas will bring only heartache and loneliness, and the thought of families getting together to celebrate serves only to make the loneliness worse.’

Mr Blunkett said the story of one woman in his Sheffield constituency was ‘heart-warming’. 

Every Christmas Day for the past six years, Gloria Stewart, 63, has organised a lunch for lonely and homeless people by gathering funds, food donations and volunteers from local businesses.

In the past, the event – staffed by volunteers from a bank branch – has welcomed single mothers, dementia patients and a 105-year-old pensioner.

He said: ‘Her story began in November 2008, when she attended a hospital appointment and asked those around her whether they were looking forward to Christmas. 

‘She was shocked to find that many of those she spoke to were not. In fact, they were dreading the festive period as they found it a very lonely time, and one elderly lady was preparing yet again to spend Christmas Day alone in bed.

‘Although not in the best of health herself, Gloria had the idea of organising a Christmas lunch for some of the hundreds of people destined to spend the season in isolation.

Believing that there must be others in the community who felt as she did and would be willing to help, she set about raising funds.’

The Labour MP added: ‘Her first dinner was attended by 87 people and over the years, the event has grown and grown. This year several hundred guests will sit down to lunch, to enjoy turkey and trimmings, a singsong and a smile. 

‘No one, least of all Gloria, could have dreamed that her idea would have expanded in the way that it has and become a major event in Sheffield. It is a massive logistical task but each year, she manages to pull it off.’

Mr Blunkett said we should take inspiration from Mrs Stewart and welcome others into our homes on Christmas Day or help create similar festive occasions.

He said: ‘I hope that this and other examples of the true spirit of Christmas will warm not just the hearts of those embraced by such events but those of us who, from time to time, are guilty of feeling a bit sorry for ourselves when we should be counting our blessings.’
