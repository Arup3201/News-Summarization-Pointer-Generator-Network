Parents have complained that a Wisconsin elementary school is promoting homosexuality through its 'Gender Bender' theme day.

As part of the Milwaukee school's 'Spirit Week' pupils from kindergarten to eighth grade were encouraged to dress like the opposite sex.

But parents described the voluntary event as 'ridiculous' and 'creepy', fearing it would encourage homosexuality among children.

Outrage: Parents at Tippecanoe school say 'Gender Bender Day' is confusing for their children

Sam Ward, who has a child at the school, told Fox News 6: 'I think it’s just teaching them the 
wrong lesson about gender. If you’re a boy, stay a boy. You shouldn’t 
have something like that at school.'

Other parents chose to keep their children at home rather then send to Tippecanoe School for the Arts and Humanities on the theme day last Friday.

One mother, who asked not to be named, said she had no problem with teenagers having a fun day dressing like the opposite sex, but her seven-year-old son had been confused by the event.

The voluntary theme day, which features at other schools too, came in the same week as Boy Scouts of America overturned a ban on gay members.

Deidri Hernandez, who was so incensed about 'Gender Bender Day' she complained to principal Jeffrey Krupar, said: 'Having students dress as "transvestites" will distract from the learning process.'

Ms Hernandez also said the event would promote the acceptance of homosexuality, according to the Huffington Post.

In effort to appease parents, the school changed the name to 'Switch It Up Day' but Ms Hernandez said: 'They might as well call it "Transgender Day".'

Choices: Tippecanoe school council chose the gender swap day as part of its 'Spirit' theme week

A member of the school board however, hit back at the parents' criticism, saying they were 'using the kids for political purposes', according to National Review Online.

Board member Terence Falk added: 'This is nothing new. I don’t think they kids were thinking about sexual orientation.'

The voluntary theme day was selected by members of the school council and the school says it was intended to be a fun event, but a spokesman for Milwaukee Public schools noted that it had caused concern among parents and pupils.

Confusing: Sam Ward, whose child goes to the school, says the theme is teaching pupils the wrong lesson

Ms Hernandez, who says she had never complained about a school event before, said: 'Every time something’s bothering a liberal or an atheist, they come forward to complain. And somebody always has a problem with Easter or Christmas.'
