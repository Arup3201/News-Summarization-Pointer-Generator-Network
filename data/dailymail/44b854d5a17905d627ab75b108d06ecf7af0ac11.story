Cricket legend: Geoffrey Boycott outside the High Court in London where he was suing a firm of solicitors over a property deal but lost

It wasn’t pretty, but he dug in and defended his end doggedly. Just like his performances at the crease in the old days.

Geoffrey Boycott strode into the High 
Court yesterday to tell the legal world how to play with a straight bat 
as he launched a £1million-plus claim over a house he bought with a 
former lover who is now dead.

‘Us ordinary people are meant to get a
 fair deal from the law,’ said the England cricketer turned commentator.
 ‘How are ordinary people expected to understand when it’s double-Dutch?
 We have come to think English law is for decent, honourable people all 
over the world; why does it not mean what it says?’

At the centre of the wrangle are a relationship and a £2.5million house that few would probably consider ordinary.

The property is in the millionaires’ playground of Sandbanks, Dorset, overlooking Poole Harbour and with its own private beach.

Boycott, 70, bought it with Anne Wyatt
 for £450,000 in 1996. For years Mrs Wyatt was Boycott’s business 
partner and lover. They met when they worked at the Ministry of Pensions
 in Barnsley in 1958 – she was 32 and he just 18 – and lived together 
for nearly 20 years in the village of Woolley, near Wakefield, before 
they bought the house in Sandbanks.

Divorcee Mrs Wyatt moved in alone 
there. He remained in Yorkshire, eventually marrying his other long-term
 lover, Rachael Swinglehurst, in 2003 after she nursed him through a 
battle with throat cancer. The couple moved to Jersey three years later,
 buying an eight-bedroom house for £1.2million.

Mrs Wyatt died from lung cancer at the
 age of 82 in 2009, and half of the Sandbanks house went into her estate
 rather than being automatically inherited by Boycott as he had 
expected, the court heard.

Partners: Ann Wyatt with Geoff Boycott at a Foyles Literary Luncheon in 1982

She bequeathed her share of the house 
to her niece, Patricia McDermott, it is understood. The property was put
 on the market for £3million last year but the asking price has since 
been reduced by £500,000.

Boycott is suing lawyers for 
compensation claiming that, had they done their job properly 15 years 
ago, Mrs Wyatt would have been able to stay in the house only for her 
lifetime and, on her death, it would have been his outright.

When the house was bought, it was put 
in both their names as ‘joint tenants’. Boycott said it was ‘a huge 
surprise’ to discover that, in 2007, she had converted that to a 
‘tenancy in common’ so that she could leave half the property to her 
heirs.

Asked by defence counsel Hugh Evans if
 he would have gone through with the purchase if he had known she could 
‘sever’ her interest in the house, Boycott replied: ‘If I had known 
either one of us could do that, I wouldn’t have gone ahead.’

Mrs Wyatt was his ‘friend and 
confidante’, he said, and he let her live in the house rent-free for 
years, although they were no longer partners.

He was shocked when he learned that 
she was within her rights to sever her interest in the property, and 
told the court: ‘I didn’t understand why she was doing it. I was running
 half way round the world doing my commentating and I just couldn’t 
understand it.’

It is not the first time Geoff Boycott has stirred up a courtroom with his straight-talking Yorkshireman approach.

He was convicted of beating up his 
then lover Margaret Moore in an Antibes hotel room in 1996 - which he 
has always strenuously denied, saying she made the story up after 
slipping and banging her head.

During the appeal trial in Grasse, 
southern France, in October 1998, he felt moved to tell one of the 
opposing lawyers to 'shoot oop' and had to be restrained by his own 
aghast brief.

In the adjournment that quickly followed, he explained why he snapped: 'They all talk bloody French.'

He lost the appeal.

After expressing his confusion at the 
legal issues, Boycott told Mr Justice Vos: ‘I don’t mean to be 
disrespectful; I’m just very straight. I don’t want to offend people, 
but I am very direct.’

The judge apologised for the 
‘obscurity’ of the law in the field which dates back 300 years, telling 
Boycott: ‘It’s history. Life’s difficult sometimes and that’s why, 
unfortunately, you have had to come to court.’

Boycott replied that he now considers the whole idea of joint tenancies ‘ridiculous’.

His barrister, Christopher Lundie, 
said he helped buy the house by permitting funds to be drawn from a 
company which he controlled and through which he provided his cricket 
commentary and other public speaking services.

‘It is his case that he was prepared 
to assist because he had agreed with Mrs Wyatt that the survivor of them
 would have the property. At that time Mrs Wyatt was 70 and Mr Boycott 
was only 56.’

The lawyers deny any liability and argue that Boycott has left it too late to sue them.

The hearing of that issue is due to last two days, with the judge expected to reserve his decision.
