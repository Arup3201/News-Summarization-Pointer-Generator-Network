Wayne Rooney's hopes of claiming England's fifth goal in the romp against San Marino have been dashed by referee Marcin Borski.

The Polish official has recorded it in his match report as an own goal and UEFA have awarded it officially to Alex Della Valle, who now has two for England, the same as Andros Townsend, who also found the net at Wembley.

Rooney's chipped shot-or-cross from an angle on the England right clipped Della Valle on the chest, swerved over goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini and landed in the net.

Gary Lineker - 48

Own goals - 47

Jimmy Greaves - 44 

Wayne Rooney - 42 

The Manchester United striker tried to claim it after the match but has discovered he will remain on 42 international goals from his 98 games.

He scored the second in the 5-0 win against San Marino from the penalty spot and stands fourth in the goal charts, two behind Jimmy Greaves and further adrift of Gary Lineker (48) and Sir Bobby Charlton (49).

Roy Hodgson was hoping it would go down to his captain and give him a boost before the trip to face Estonia on Sunday.

'I would give it Wayne Rooney, all day,' smiled Hodgson, after the San Marino game. 'But the record won't play on his mind. He's 29 later this month and we'd like to think with the way he is and the footballer he is that he has a few years in him yet.

'There are plenty of games left. I don't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early. The important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working hard, as he did.

Rooney celebrates after scoring the second goal on an extremely comfortable night  against San Marino

San Marino's Alex Della Valle scored his second own goal against England on Thursday evening, having already netted in the Three Lions' 8-0 victory away in March 2013.

Della Valle has now scored more goals than 12 of the outfield players in the England squad - including Raheem Sterling (0),               Adam Lallana (0) and Jack Wilshere (0).

'He got in a lot of times. His runs were very good. He's a bit disappointed with the chip he missed, because he thought it was on, but I'm more than happy with him. It was another good captain's performance, solid throughout.'

Rooney did not have the same good fortune with the referee as Gareth Barry, three years ago. With England on 1,999 goals, there was much interest generated in who would score the 2,000th goal, ahead of a friendly against Sweden.

The only goal of the game skidded off Barry's face and on to the head of Swedish defender Daniel Majstorovic before it flashed into the net. On that occasion, however, the referee gave it to Barry, who will forever be in the record books as the scorer of a landmark goal.
