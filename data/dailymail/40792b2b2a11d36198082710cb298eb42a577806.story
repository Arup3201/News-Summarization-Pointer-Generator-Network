Despite leaving Manchester United at the end of the Barclays Premier League season, Sportsmail’s World Cup columnist Rio Ferdinand is still in touch with former team-mates Rafael and Fabio, and plans to watch the opening game of the World Cup at their family home in Brazil.

He has warned the twins that they better not be wearing any Speedos when he arrives though!

Ferdinand, who is a BBC Sport pundit for the tournament, tweeted this morning: ‘Up early....5:50am....first day of the World Cup..can’t wait! Going to a favela then to Rafael and Fabio’s house to watch Brazil and food!! Good day.'

Brazil kick off the tournament against Croatia at the Estadio de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo tonight, with the game being shown on ITV1. Coverage of the opening ceremony begins at 7pm. Kick-off is at 9pm.

Ferdinand, who played in the 2002 and 2006 World Cups for England, is without a club after being released by United at the end of the domestic season.

The 35-year-old reportedly snubbed an approach from Aston Villa last week and would prefer a move to London, with Harry Redknapp interested in handing him a one-year deal at QPR.

It would be a move back to the capital for the former England captain, who left West Ham for Leeds in an £18million transfer 14 years ago.

He then switched to Manchester United two years later for £30m and won six Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the League Cup twice.
