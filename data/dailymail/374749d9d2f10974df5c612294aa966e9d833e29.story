The brother of notorious crime bosses Terry and Tommy Adams was arrested along with his wife in a dawn raid today as part of a money-laundering investigation.  

Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Octopod arrested a total of seven people this morning, including an accountant and a solicitor, in a series of raids across London.  

They also seized around £100,000 in cash  from an office believed to be one of the Adams 's headquarters.

Michael Adams, 48, and his wife Debra, 
46, were seen shouting as they were bundled into a van by officers 
outside their home in Finchley, north London.

Arrest: A total of seven people have been arrested following raids on eight different properties

Members of the Adams syndicate have been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, hijacking and white-collar crime.  

The group detained today, including a trained accountant turned property developer and a solicitor, are suspected of laundering millions of pounds through an investment scheme. 

The raids were carried out under the Proceeds of Crime Act and included specialist financial investigators, the Territorial Support Group, the dog unit, local police teams and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  

They executed search warrants simultaneously at seven residential addresses in Limehouse, Shoreditch, Hendon, Finchley, Dartford, Dorking and Rye.

Allegedly one of the UK's most powerful organised crime syndicates, the Adams Family has been linked  to at least 25 murders worldwide, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, hijacking and white-collar crime. 

Terry Adams first formed the group with his brothers Sean and Patrick in the Clerkenwell area of Islington, north London, in the Eighties, and it gradually expanded over the years to include other relatives and close friends.

The gang allegedly grew through extortion, security fraud and the hijacking of gold bullion shipments, eventually forming international links with various criminal organisations, particularly Latin American drug cartels.

They are said to have developed links with corrupt Metropolitan Police officials and even one Tory MP, and allegedly worked with Jamaican Yardie gangs to silence informants and neutralise rivals.

Before the convictions of Sean and Terry Adams, the failure to make charges stick against members of the gang had led to speculation they had undermined the British justice system to become untouchables.

The latter, widely believed to be the leader of the gang, was so effective at distancing himself from the sharp end of his alleged criminal business that he was only convicted with the assistance of MI5, the domestic spy agency.

At his trial, prosecuting barrister Andrew Mitchell QC said of Terry Adams: 'It is suggested that Terry Adams was one of the country’s most feared and revered organized criminals.

'He comes with a pedigree, as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld.

'A hallmark of his career was the ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited.'

Detectives 
are continuing to carry out searches of the premises, but they have 
already seized items such as financial documents, computers and mobile 
phones, which will be sent away for forensic examination.  

Four men and three women, aged between their 30s and 70s, were held by police, although none has been charged with a crime.  

The
 latest arrests bring the total number linked to the Adams family to 22,
 following similar raids in February when almost £300,000 in cash was 
seized along with a haul of deadly weapons.  

One raid was carried out on a £2.5million central London mansion owned by Tommy Adams, 55, and his wife Androulla, 54.  

Tommy
 - who once led the syndicate with his brothers Terry and Patrick - was 
jailed for seven and a half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an
 £8million cannabis smuggling plot.  

Terry, who has not been arrested in the raids, was jailed for seven years in 2007 after being convicted of money laundering. 

Octopod is the biggest operation to date against the organised crime group.  

Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Manson said: 'This is continuing activity, bringing together some of the Met's most skilful teams to target a highly harmful organised crime group which we believe also has links across Britain and Europe.  

'The group as a whole is known to be involved in serious and violent crime which is harming people and damaging communities across London. We believe those arrested today are laundering huge quantities of cash.  

'We believe they - with other members of the group - are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business, the proceeds of which are laundered and either pumped into other illegal money-making schemes or spent on luxurious living.  

'Operation Octopod is a demonstration of the sheer investigative force the Met can apply to organised gangs - some of whom think they can hide criminal cash from the police.'
