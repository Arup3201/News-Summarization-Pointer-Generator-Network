This is the bizarre moment a sword wielding raider calmly leans down and strokes a dog during a terrifying pub raid. 

The masked man was captured on CCTV briefly lowering his weapon to pat the sandy coloured dog, while a number of bound hostages cowered nearby.

The duo, armed with a three-foot long machete and half a pool cue, stormed into the Strawberry Duck in Clayton, north Manchester.

This is the moment that the masked raider stroked a sandy coloured dog during a terrifying pub raid in Manchester

The masked men stormed behind the bar at the Strawberry Duck in north Manchester during the raid

The pair were wielding a three-foot long machete and half a pool cue, which they used to threaten staff and customers

The balaclava wearing raiders bolted the pub's doors shut before rushing behind the bar and threatening staff in the middle of a Saturday lunchtime.

Frightened workers opened the till, before being marched downstairs by their captors who then bound their hands  together with cable ties.

It was as one of the men was left alone to guard the handful of frightened hostages, that he oddly bent down and started to stroke the dog.

The moment of kindness happened as his accomplice was out of the room ransacking the pub for more money.

A police spokesman said the two men left the pub with a quantity of cash and ran off down the canal in the direction of the city centre.

CCTV footage of the robbery on at 12.40pm on February 7, has now been released in the hopes of identifying the robbers.

The masked duo got their hands on the pub's takings after forcing staff to open the till 

The robbers bound together the hands of terrified staff and customers after ordering them into a downstairs room

As one of the raiders was left alone to guard the hostages he stroked a pet dog that had wandered into the downstairs bar

Detective Constable Alexander Day said: 'Almost four weeks has passed since the robbery and I hope that by releasing this footage it might help to identify who the two men responsible for this terrible incident are.

'This is still very much an active investigation and I would like to reassure anyone who may have been concerned by the events of that day that we are committed to finding the offenders.

'I would also like to pay tribute to the pub's owners and staff who managed to stay calm and reassure the customers who had been caught up in this terrifying situation.

'If anybody has any information at all, no matter how little you might think it is, then please contact the police.'
