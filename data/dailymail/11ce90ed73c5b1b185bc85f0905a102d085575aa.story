A serial burglar dubbed 'Safari Boy' after being sent on a trip of a lifetime to Africa in a failed bid to stop his offending as a boy was jailed today for his latest offence - breaking into an elderly widower's home.

Mark Hook, now 38, was taken on an 88-day safari to Egypt and Kenya at public expense when he was just 17 - sparking a national outcry which included condemnation in the House of Commons by the then prime minister John Major.

But it proved to be a waste of taxpayers' money as Hook has continued to offend ever since.

Today Gloucester crown court heard that in April this year, he smashed his way into 86-year-old Frederick Talbot's remote home near Dursley, ransacked it and stole property and cash, including photographs of sentimental value.

Judge William Hart told Hook, from Gloucester: 'You targeted an elderly man's remote home at night after smashing the burglar alarm off the wall.

'Your victim, who has been burgled before, can hardly sleep happily in his bed again under those circumstances.

'You have a chequered criminal history and committed your first burglary when you were only 14 or 15 years of age.'

Prosecuting barrister Julian Kesner said: 'The day before Frederick Talbot returned from holiday to his home, the defendant jemmied his way into the property through a bathroom window using a screwdriver.

'An untidy search was made of every room and drawers were left open and cupboards ransacked.

'A bag containing £120 in £2 coins, £26 from the victim's grand-daughter's money box, cheque books, bank cards, a wallet, a watch, Mr Talbot's national service medal, old passports and photographs were taken.

'Tokens for an OAP to use on buses were left behind, but the defendant's fingerprints were found on them.

'The victim is naturally upset and unnerved and fears the burglar will come back again.

'Mr Talbot lives alone as his wife died four years ago after the couple had been married for 59 years.

'Fortunately the old passports and photographs were recovered in a car nearby which the defendant had attempted to hot-wire after the burglary.

'Hook has a large number of previous convictions - more than 100 - including seven burglaries.'

Defending solicitor Nicola Colwall said: 'Damage was minimal and my client denies that he brought the screwdriver with him - he says he found it in the garden shed.

'All the items of sentimental value were recovered.

Hook's innocent smile as a child gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years

'He has had a troubled, miserable childhood, was in care from the age of 11 and in custody when he was 16.

'But although he was offending prolifically in his 20s now, at the age of 38, he is beginning to feel the weight of his background.

'His feelings of guilt and remorse are growing, he is tired and ashamed of himself and having nightmares about the things he has done.

'He also has an eight-year-old daughter and needs to feel responsibility for her.'

Judge Hart jailed Hook for 22 months.

During the safari trip in 1993, Hook visited the Pyramids and the Sphinx, cruised the Nile and went to a big game park.

Hook first appeared in court in 1991 when he admitted taking a car without consent. 

In 1993, he was sent on the 88-day holiday by social services to show him how worse-off people in the world coped without resorting to crime.

The trip caused a national furore and was denounced by critics who said it would not reform the teenager. 

John Major, the then prime minister, told MPs no offenders would be sent on trips abroad again. 

Referring to the £7,000 trip after a previous hearing, Mr Talbot said: 'Holiday or no holiday he will obviously never change his ways.'

Hook claims to be a descendant of Private Henry Hook, who won the Victoria Cross fighting the Zulus at Rorke's Drift in 1879.

The battle inspired the film Zulu in which Private Hook, who is buried in Churcham, near Gloucester, was played by James Booth.

Ratboy 

A notorious criminal who gained the nickname 'Ratboy' for his habit of hiding in ventilation shafts as a child burglar was back behind bars in August 2013 after returning to his old ways.

Anthony Kennedy, then 34, made headlines nationwide as a baby-faced schoolboy who terrorised the Byker Wall estate in Newcastle in the 1990s.

He would raid homes and then escape police by crawling through heating ducts and stairwells while on the run from council care.

Kennedy had his first police caution at the age of 10. By 13 he had committed 55 offences and run away from care 37 times.

In 2007, Kennedy claimed to have given up a life of crime after finding love and religion. He and his partner moved to Blyth, Northumberland, to have a fresh start.

He said at the time: 'I believe it’s important to treat others how you would like to be treated yourself and to have respect for other people.

'When I was Ratboy, those were things I didn’t care about.'

But Kennedy was jailed again after he admitted committing two burglaries in Blyth in May.

He was sentenced to three years in jail at Newcastle Crown Court.

'Demons from hell' 

Two young brothers dubbed 'demons from hell' after making their neighbours' lives a misery are still getting into trouble with the law nearly a decade later.

Ricky and Daniel Oakley were both given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 when they were just 11 and 12.

It was hoped the ASBOs would help put a stop to their loutish behaviour which included throwing knives, starting fires and letting down tyres in their hometown of Park Village in Wolverhampton.

But fast-forward eight years and it seems not much has changed, with both brothers - who were once nicknamed the 'Asbros' - having racked up a string of criminal convictions. 

At the age of 20, Daniel Oakley, was sentenced in April to a 12-month probation order at Walsall Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to burglary. He was also ordered to pay £570. It is his fourth criminal conviction to date.

Meanwhile his brother Ricky, two years his junior, has been in and out of prison six times since he and his brother were first given two-year ASBOs in 2006.

It demanded the pair behave or face five years in a young offenders' institution but both brothers now admit they just saw the ASBOs as badges of honour.

The boys claim they grew up in a troubled household. Abandoned by their mother at a young age and left in the sole care of their father, they said they became used to committing antisocial behaviour and crime. 

During their reign of terror in their small community, the brothers often set things alight, which on one occasion resulted in the pair both suffering severe burns after Ricky placed a can of foam on a fire and it exploded. 

At 10 years old, the boys’ petty crimes escalated to burglaries and robberies.  

But since 2006, Danny claims he has tried to get his life back on track.

He said: 'I’m well known for bad things. I don’t want to be known for that anymore. All I can do is apologise for what I’ve done.

'I’m now just thinking positive. I’m going to get myself somewhere to live and I’m going to get a job and start working.'

His brother, however, doesn't share his concerns.

Ricky, who was released from Brinsford prison, Wolverhampton, in March, said: 'I’m not bothered about going back [to jail]. It doesn’t bother me because I’m not scared of jail.

'That’s why I go back so many times because I’m not scared.'
