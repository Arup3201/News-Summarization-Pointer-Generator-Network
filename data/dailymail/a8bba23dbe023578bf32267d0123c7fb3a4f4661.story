When this empty Russian cruise ship disappeared into the mist en route to the Caribbean, it was thought the abandoned vessel could be lost to the ocean forever.

But after spending almost two months adrift the ghostly liner is reported to have re-emerged near Ireland's west coast - thousands of miles from its intended destination.

The MV Lyubov Orlova - named after a famous Soviet actress - was being towed to the Dominican Republic to be scrapped when the cable pulling it snapped, leaving the Orlova to slip away as the crew on board the towing ship battled howling winds and 10ft waves to try in vain to reconnect the line.

Adrift: The empty MV Lyubov Orlova spent around two months drifting in the ocean before being spotted by a firm that uses satellite imagery to create maps for the U.S. government

The stranded liner, which had left Canadian shores on January 23, was later secured by the supply vessel Atlantic Hawk, but the ship drifted loose a second time, according to a report on the PhysOrg website

Maritime authorities in Canada could not pinpoint the location of the ship, which has no warning lights and a broken global positioning system.

But now a U.S. intelligence agency has reported that the Orlova was sighted 1,300 nautical miles from Ireland's west coast.

Canada's transport authority has said the abandoned ship is no longer its concern as the vessel has left the country's waters, with officials insisting the owner of the Orlova is responsible for its movements.

A document from the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency states that the Lyubov Orlova was spotted
at the co-ordinates 49-22.70N and 044-51.34W, or roughly 1,300 miles 
from the Irish coast.

The agency analyses satellite imagery and uses the results to create detailed maps for the U.S. government.

The empty liner is understood to be slowly drifting towards the European coastline.

Now home only to rats, the 1976-built ship once carried passengers on Antarctic cruises.

The
ship was seized by authorities in Newfoundland in 2010 amid spiralling 
debts owed to charter firm Cruise North Expeditions after faults on 
board meant a scheduled cruise had to be cancelled.

She is understood to have been sold to Neptune International Shipping in February last year to be broken up.
