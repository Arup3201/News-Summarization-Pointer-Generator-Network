A woman whose boyfriend confessed he was actually born a girl has opened up about their relationship and rubbished claims that they are in a gay relationship. 

Charlotte Urie, 20, has been dating Kieran Moloney, who used to be called Ciara, for two years.

For years, 23-year-old Kieran kept his sex-swap a secret, until he met Charlotte in 2012. 

Speaking about meeting Kieran and finding out the truth on This Morning, Charlotte said: 'When we first met, it was boy meets girl. But then as the relationship went on, Kieran told me that he was born a female.'  

Speaking out: Charlotte Urie, 20, has been dating Kieran Moloney, who was born a girl called Ciara, for two years. Today, they appeared on This Morning and spoke about their relationship

She continued: 'He obviously had some reservations about telling me, as you can imagine.

'But I was relieved that he wanted to carry on the relationship with me because I'd fallen in love with him for who he was.' 

The couple have now been together for two years and are hoping to marry and start a family using Kieran's best friend as a sperm donor.

Kieran, originally from New Zealand, but now living in London, opened up about revealing his secret. 

He said: 'It (happened after) about three weeks. We weren't "together" yet, (so) it was the deciding moment.

'It was so scary because it is something that is completely out of the norm and a lot of people don't know enough about it, so they judge you on it. It was scary, this is a girl I really cared for.

'There's two people in a relationship - there's someone that deserves to know and someone (who wants you) to fall in love with them for them.' 

Opening up: For years, 23-year-old Kieran kept his sex-swap a secret, until he met Charlotte in 2012 and the pair fell in love. They are now planning on having a family

Final steps: He explains that he has only had top surgery and not lower surgery because he feels it isn't advanced enough yet. 'For me, it has to be perfect,' he added

Growing up: Kieran was born as girl called Ciara (right), but since the age of four he was unhappy with his gender 

Kieran, who works as a barista, had been unhappy with his gender since he was four years old. 

He had no interest in girly things and cried if his mother put him in a dress and when he started primary school, he became a target for bullies.

He said: 'From the moment I could think and make decisions for myself, I knew I was different. I knew I wanted to be a boy. I didn't just like females, I knew I wanted to be a boy.'

Kieran credits his family with being 'amazing' when he told them about his decision. His mother Bronagh Moloney, 49, a nurse, began calling him her son.

'Ive been through so many hard times. My family were amazing. They knew before me, they knew straight away. Instead of Barbie dolls, it was trucks,' he said.

'A lot of people asked me how I was going to tell my family but it wasn't asking them, it was more a case of "this is what I'm doing are you with me or are you not?" They were with me.'  

Support system: Charlotte said that if the surgery became more advanced and that's what Kieran really wanted to do, of course she would support him

Kieran has been living as a man for seven years. 

He cut his hair into a short spiky bob and wore sports bras and baggy tops to hide his feminine figure, then after seeing a counselor aged 16, Kieran was finally diagnosed as transgender. 

By 17, fine hairs started to grow on Kieran's face and with a rigorous gym workout, his body started transforming into a man's.

He began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. Gradually, his cup size dropped from a B to an A.

In November 2009, aged 18, Kieran started monthly testosterone injections and, two years later, had a £5,000 double mastectomy that was paid for by his mum. 

Kieran is yet to have full gender reassignment surgery.

In his teens, Kieran began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. At 18, he had a £5,000 double mastectomy 

He explains that he has only had top surgery and not lower surgery because he feels it isn't advanced enough yet. 'For me, it has to be perfect,' he added.

When asked about their sex life, Charlotte said: 'I believe what happens behind closed doors with a couple, happens behind closed doors. 

'I am a straight girl with a straight boy and that's the way it is.'

'If the surgery got advanced and that's what Kieran really wanted to do, of course I'd support him, but if not, I am perfectly happy as we are.'

Responding to questions about whether she has ever questioned her sexuality, she replied: 'Not at all. I identify as a straight female.' 

Finding love: In August 2012, Kieran changed his name by deed poll and met girlfriend, Charlotte 

The co-habiting couple are planning to tie the knot and have children together.

Charlotte said: 'Kieran's my soulmate and we'd be the best parents. 

'We'll explain his background to our kids when they're old enough - they'll have two loving parents, that's the most important thing.'

When asked why, after moving away from New Zealand, he wanted to tell the world his story, he said: 'Before I left New Zealand, I went online and it made me sick to see how many people were crying for help.

'I've met this beautiful girl and physically, I cannot hold this with me. 

'I need to show that you can have anything you want, you can go and get it. I did it and I am perfectly happy.

'It's going to be hard but it's worth it and there is not one person in this world who can tell you how to live your life. If you want to live it like that, you live it. You're not alone.' 

Supportive: Kieran's family supported him and his mother Bronagh Moloney, 49, a nurse, began calling him her son when he turned 16
