Former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez may not be able to afford his attorney fees as he faces murder charges in the deaths of three men.

The one-time tight end has made legal filings requesting Suffolk County court give him two months 'to make financial 
arrangements to retain counsel.'

WCVB reports his current attorneys may not be able to represent him all the way through settlement of the cases.

In their most recent court filing, Boston-based attorneys Charles Rankin and James Sultan said their representation was 'limited to 
arraignment only and related proceedings.'

Over three years in the NFL, Hernandez earned a reported $18 million.

His money troubles could be connected to the fact his $12.5 million signing bonus for a 2012 contract is in dispute and the fact that he is barred from selling his home in North Attleborough, valued at $1.3 million.

He has entered a plea of not guilty to the charges related to the 2012 murder, in which prosecutors claim he gunned down two men outside a nightclub in Boston.

Police report Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado 
were each shot to death.

Hernandez only became a person of interest in their deaths after he was arrested for the murder of Odin Lloyd.

Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was found murdered on June 17 not far from Hernandez's home.
