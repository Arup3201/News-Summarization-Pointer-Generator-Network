Hospitals that allow private company reps to bombard new mothers with marketing materials while on maternity wards could face action from the health watchdog under new proposals by MPs.

Companies such as Bounty - the UK's biggest parenting club - pay the NHS to allow their reps on to maternity wards to speak to new mothers.

Following a series of surveys and campaigns by Mumsnet, which found eight out of ten mothers felt the practise was unacceptable, MP John Robertson is bringing an Early Day Motion on the issue before the Commons.

Health minister Dan Poulter, who is also a hospital doctor, has now vowed to take action and insisted the Care Quality Commission has stronger powers to act when a patient's dignity is compromised.

Stricter rules: The Care Quality Commission will be able to take action against hospitals if a new mother's dignity is compromised by private company reps approaching them within hours of giving birth

He told the Independent on Sunday: 'Many Bounty representatives engage with women appropriately during pregnancy and before birth. However, I wrote to hospitals about a month ago to highlight the outrageous behaviour of some Bounty reps in showing an unacceptable disregard for the privacy and dignity of women and families at what can be a very vulnerable time.

'We have recently been strengthening the role and powers of the Care Quality Commission to intervene where there is poor care or where patients' dignity is compromised during their care. So if hospitals do not take action to get a grip on the situation, then the CQC will be able to take action against the birthing unit.'

Bounty is paid around £90,000 a year to distribute benefit forms at hospitals as it is cheaper than posting them out individually.

But the company has been accused in research by Mumsnet of telling new mothers they must sign up to its own parenting club to receive the benefits - which isn't true. Bounty refuted the claims - insisting it has a strong code of conduct for its staff.

Other complaints have included private companies pressurising mothers to buy professional photographs or to reveal personal information which is then sold on to third parties. 

A petition on change.org calling for an end to reps in maternity units has 21,000 signatures so far.

It says: 'The hours after having a baby are an important time for mums and their partners to get to know their new baby, learn the skill of feeding and baby care and for the mum to recover from the physical effects of birth. This is a time for rest and recuperation and for the new family and their relatives and friends.

'Interruption from sales representatives there to pass on advertising material and extract data from mothers to sell on, is not something a new family needs. Yet in maternity units across the country this is what is happening, often within the first few hours of a baby being born.

On board: Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter has promised to take against to stop the practise

'Profit motivated parenting clubs such as Bounty are paying maternity units for the right to access their wards and approach mothers just hours after they have given birth. They are also allowed to take photographs of new parents with their babies that they then sell to parents. They generate a large profit both from the photographs and by selling the data they obtain from parents on to companies, who then shower parents with advertising and sales calls.

'A survey by Mumsnet shows over half of new mothers felt the Bounty rep invaded their privacy on maternity wards. Maternity Units are not the place for strangers selling their products. The government must stop allowing sales reps onto maternity wards.'

The survey by Mumsnet also found that more than half - 56 per cent - of new mothers felt a Bounty rep invaded their privacy while 60 per cent were not specifically told their personal details would be passed on to other companies.

In cases where mothers reported feeling hassled by over-zealous Bounty salespeople, 17 per cent said Bounty reps implied parents would only be able to claim Child Benefit if they filled in Bounty's commercial forms. 

Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said: 'We're very pleased that the government is listening to Mumsnet users' concerns which have led to the Bounty Mutiny campaign.

'We look forward to working with the CQC to ensure that new mothers are protected from hard-sell tactics on maternity wards.

'Some hospital trusts have already taken swift action to address the situation, and we will continue to put pressure on other hospital trusts to review their policies.'

But ComRes, an independent research 
company, has raised questions over the research.

They studied the survey and were concerned by the methods used by 
Mumsnet to gain participants (for instance, a tweet with a link to the 
survey that read 'Hassled by Bounty? Tell us your experience'. 

As a result, they have said: 'The 
greatest concern regarding the validity of the research is the sample 
selection. The survey is not representative of UK mothers and therefore 
does not stand up to scrutiny.

Eight of ten mothers said reps being allowed on to maternity wards was unacceptable, a survey by Mumsnet found

'Of concern as well is the fact that 
both the framing of the survey on the Mumsnet website, and some of the 
questions themselves, are leading. These lead the respondents to a 
negative perception of Bounty representatives. Overall, the results of 
the survey can be questioned and not be considered representative of 
mothers’ opinions.'

Clare Goodrham, General Manager of Bounty, added: 'We enforce a rigorous Code of Conduct, which respects mums’ privacy as well as use of any data collected.

'Bounty ladies, many of whom are mums themselves, never enter a ward without being cleared to do so by medical staff.

'We take any violation of the code of conduct seriously and regularly review it as part of our collaboration with the NHS.

'For over 50 years, we have worked in partnership with NHS hospitals and trusts to ensure that mums and hospital staff are happy with the service we provide, as we strive to achieve 100 per cent satisfaction amongst mums.

'The Department of Health have also confirmed recently that they continue to value their relationship with Bounty.

'We are proud to say that Bounty is welcomed by 99 per cent of maternity units, and an independent survey by IPSOS-Mori shows that 93 per cent of all midwives and heads of midwifery approve of the service provided by Bounty staff.

'We are also proud of the fact that  92 per cent of mums say that they love Bounty packs, as it gives them free products and money off coupons - as well as access to essential health information. T

'This is important to all mums, and particularly to those from lower socio-demographic groups who might not have access to this from other sources.

'Our work to deliver child benefit forms to mums is hugely successful and helps 82 per cent of mums, of all backgrounds, to claim this important financial assistance.'
