A popular US-based beauty brand is claiming to have created a one-of-a-kind lip treatment which promises to completely eradicate any signs of dryness or chapping - a common problem which plagues millions people each year as soon as the colder winter months arrive. 

But according to Bite Beauty, chapped lips could well be a thing of the past thanks to the brand's newly-launched Five Night Fix For Lips, a $15 treatment kit which includes a lip exfoliating stick and an overnight mask. 

Bite claims that the lip-treating duo will 'replenish and revitalize lips', leaving you with a 'healthy, soft and nourished' pout after just five nights.

A quick fix: Bite Beauty's $15 Five Night Fix For Lips includes an exfoliating lip scrub stick and an overnight lip mask treatment

Eager to find out if such a quick-fix cure was really possible, I put Bite's treatment to the test. 

Having been a dedicated lover of lipstick for many years now, I've always found it irksome that, during the coldest times of the year, I am forced to abandon my favorite bold lip colors in favor of boring balms and salves in an attempt to heal my dry, cracked, wind-battered lips.

As a result of the recent frosty weather in New York - gale-force winds and sub-zero temperatures - my lips have been worse than ever during the past few months and I was desperate for a solution. 

On paper the treatment seems incredibly well-thought out. Bite have even ensured that all of the ingredients included in their products, which are intended to be used over night, are 'food-grade', meaning that they can be ingested without any fear that the user will be exposed to something dangerous or unpleasant.

Similarly, the dosage is incredibly generous; there is more than enough product to last you through the suggested five nights of use.

But how does the treatment fair when it is actually put to use?  

Day one: My lips were dry and sore, and I am unable to wear lipstick

Day four: After using the treatment for three nights, I braved lipstick for the first time in weeks. Iwas happy to see that it applied smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable

Day six: Following five nights of treatment, my lips were back to their usual, flake-free state and all my lipsticks were back in action

Upon first use, I was quite surprised to find that the exfoliating stage of the Bite treatment, which comes packaged in a fun, medicinal jar, was actually rather uncomfortable to use. 

According to the brand's description, the Whipped Cherry Scrub Stick is supposed to 'gently buff away impurities' with 'castor oil beads to help leave lips soft and supple' and 'fruit extracts to help brighten and restore lips'. 

But despite its deliciously sweet scent - it really does smell, and taste, like cherry-flavored sugar - I found that the scrub had a bit of a bite to it and left my already-dry lips feeling red raw and quite sore. 

In all fairness, I perhaps didn't hesitate to think about was the fact that I was rubbing my lips with a stick of what is essentially a lump of sugar granules; it might have been worth proceeding with a slightly lighter hand, at least initially.  

Thankfully, the second stage of the treatment - the Agave Lip Mask - was wonderfully soothing, and really felt like it was helping to nourish my flaky, cracked lips. 

The idea is to leave the lip mask on overnight, in order to allow it to work its 'magic' while you sleep, so, following the instructions carefully, I left the treatment on and headed to bed. 

Initially, the next morning, I didn't notice a huge amount of difference - until I realized, at around lunchtime, that I hadn't reached for my lip balm once since leaving the house which, given that I had taken to applying some sort of salve almost every 15 minutes, was something of a personal triumph. 

A further two nights' worth of treatments later and the improvement was far more obvious. My lips were smooth, soft and practically flake-free, bar the odd stubborn crack which refused to heal straight away. I even dared to reach for one of my favorite lipsticks and was happy to see that it applied pretty smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable.

And on day six, the cure was complete as far as I was concerned - although I still had plenty of both of the products left over. After five nights of use, my lips were back to their usual, flake-free state and all my lipsticks were back in action.

Plus, there is still plenty of both products left over, which means I don't have to purchase the same kit again, should my lips run into any trouble in the future. All in all, I'd consider this test a real success. 

And I'm not the only one who thinks so; thus far, the product has received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media, with fans of the brand taking to both Twitter and Instagram to heap praise on the treatment. 

'Holy grail beauty item! Couldn't live without it this winter!' one person wrote on Instagram, while another added: 'The only thing that works [to help chapped lips] is the 5 night fix for lips by @bitebeauty - I don't wear lip balm anymore!'
