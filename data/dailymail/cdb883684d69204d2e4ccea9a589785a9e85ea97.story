Troy Davis, who is set to be executed by lethal injection tomorrow night, has lost a bid for clemency launched by his defence lawyers who said he was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer.

Georgia's board of pardons rejected the last-minute plea even after it attracted high-profile support, and his execution will go ahead as planned. It was the last hope for the 42-year-old, who was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989.

Anti-death penalty activists, who also claim Davis was wrongly convicted, chanted and held banners through Atlanta last week.

It is the fourth time in four years his execution has been scheduled by Georgia officials.

Steve Hayes, spokesman for the Board 
of Pardons and Paroles, said the panel decided to rejected Davis' 
request for clemency after hearing hours of testimony from his 
supporters and prosecutors.

Troy Davis was convicted of the August 19, 1989, murder of Georgia police officer Mark MacPhail, who was working as a security guard at a Burger King when he intervened in an argument between several men in a nearby parking lot.

He was shot in the heart and face without having drawn his gun.

One of the men, Sylvester Coles, went to police and implicated Davis in the killing, and he was arrested four days later.

During Davis’ 1991 trial, many witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail. Two others testified that Davis had confessed the murder to them. The murder weapon was never found, and no physical evidence linked Davis to the crime.

Throughout his trial and subsequent appeals, Davis has maintained his innocence but was sentenced to death in August 1991.

Seven of nine witnesses to the 
murder changed or 
recanted their testimony in recent years. Several stated they had felt pressure by police to implicate Davis.

New witnesses implicated Coles in the crime.

Many appeals in state and federal courts followed. Davis and his lawyers argued that the racial composition of the jury and poor advocacy from his lawyers had affected his right to a fair trial.

In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld, with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia declaring that the new evidence cast only 'minimal doubt on his conviction'. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected.

In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled but stayed shortly before the events took place.

The decision appeared to leave Davis 
with little chance of avoiding the execution date. Defence attorney 
Jason Ewart has said that the pardons board was likely Davis' last 
option.

His lawyers have long argued Davis 
was a victim of mistaken identity. But prosecutors say they have no 
doubt that they charged the right person with the crime.

MacPhail's relatives said they were relieved by the decision.

'That's what we wanted, and that's 
what we got,' said Anneliese MacPhail, the victim's mother. 'We wanted 
to get it over with, and for him to get his punishment.'
    
'Justice was finally served for my father,' said Mark MacPhail Jr, who 
was an infant when his father was gunned down. 'The truth was finally 
heard.'

Kim Davis, the inmate's sister, declined immediate comment on the decision.

Amnesty International USA director Larry Cox said in a statement that the decision was 'unconscionable'.

'Should Troy Davis be executed, 
Georgia may well have executed an innocent man and in so doing 
discredited the justice system,' Mr Cox said.- but Mr MacPhail’s mother 
Anneliese remains convinced Davis is guilty.

She said the upcoming execution of her son's 'killer' will bring her peace.

‘I will never have closure,’ Ms MacPhail told CNN. ‘But I may have some peace when he is executed.’

The case has captured international attention because of concerns about the quality of evidence involved in Davis’s conviction - but Ms MacPhail said she has ‘never had any doubts’ it was him.

‘I think these people are just against the death penalty,’ she told CNN, of the many protesters who claim to be worried the state will put an innocent man to death. ‘They don't know what happened.’

Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to meet on Monday to consider whether to stop Davis' execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled for next Wednesday.

‘I pray that this rally will have an 
impact on Pardons and Paroles,’ said marcher Solana Plaines, of 
Savannah, Georgia. ‘I hope they will do the right thing.’

Davis declined to order a special last 
meal. He will be served what's on the menu at the Georgia state prison 
in Jackson before his execution on Wednesday - grilled cheeseburger, 
oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape 
beverage.

Davis's supporters say there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and that key witnesses in his trial have since recanted their testimony.

‘You just can't give up hope,’ said Ellen Kubica, who travelled all the way from her home in Germany to attend Friday's event, which featured banners reading: ‘Too much doubt to execute.’

Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and television show host, also attended.

‘The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing,’ he said of the parole board. ‘It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row.’

In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2009 ordered a new hearing for Davis to assess what he said was new evidence showing his innocence.

The justices transferred the case to a U.S. District Court in Georgia for a hearing and determination of his claims that new witnesses will clearly establish his innocence.

A year later, the judge, William T. Moore Jr, rejected Davis' claims of innocence. But on Thursday, supporters of Davis delivered petitions with more than 600,000 names to the parole board.

In a column last week in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, former FBI Director William Sessions called for Davis's sentence to be commuted to life in prison, saying the case was 'permeated in doubt'.

However in an opposing column written in late 2008 and republished on Thursday, Spencer Lawton, the district attorney who prosecuted Davis, said the condemned man had a fair trial.

The claim that seven witnesses at the trial had subsequently recanted their testimony was ‘not believable’, Lawton wrote - and he denied any witnesses had been coerced by police.
