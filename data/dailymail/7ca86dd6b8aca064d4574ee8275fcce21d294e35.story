A mechanic has seen sales rocket after deciding to use models in skimpy underwear to sell dirty old bike parts on ebay.

Nick Nudy, from Pennsylvania, hired the models to accompany the mundane motorbike parts in his online auctions after realising he needed something to boost sales.

Instead of posting pictures of greasy second-hand kit on its own, his company adopted one of the oldest marketing strategies in the book - sex sells.

In just two years, Babes Not Included has become a popular virtual store on the world's biggest auction website

Mr Nudy, who owns online motorcycle shop Babes Not Included, said: 'I always wrote "everything in the photos is included" on the eBay listing.

'I hired a local model just to jazz up the pictures a bit, and all of a sudden I started getting loads of bids, and requests asking if the girl could deliver the part, or if the babe came bubble-wrapped.

'That's why I started writing "Babe not included" and it sort of took off from there.'

Mr Nudy started selling used bike parts four years ago, but his sales have skyrocketed since he began using glamour girls to hold his products for all promotional material.

In just two years, Babes Not Included has become a popular virtual store on the world's biggest auction website, and they have shifted thousands of bike parts to customers all over the world - some of whom don't even own a bike.

He said: 'In 2010, I began buying old bikes to tear apart for parts, mostly sell motocross and sport bikes.

'Around a year or two after starting to sell parts, we got the idea to feature models with the parts to attract customers.

Mr Nudy said he has had 'a lot of requests' from amateur models wanting to pose with the spare engine parts

'There is a lot of competition on eBay, so having 'Babes' hold the parts really helps attract buyers.

'It really took off. The models we use are mostly found through modelling network sites, but we do get a lot of requests from amateurs too.

'We started finding customers buying parts that did not own a motorcycle or have the motorcycle we were selling parts to.'
