Say cheese: Matthew Feroze with the winning cheeseboard that made him Champion de France at the Concours National des Fromagers

He says his French is fluent, but one wonders how much Matthew Feroze understood of what was being muttered about him in Lyon, the capital of Gallic gastronomy, last weekend.

After becoming the first foreigner to scoop the top prize in one of France’s most prestigious national contests for cheese-mongers, the Londoner said the other competitors had been ‘friendly and encouraging’.

If so, that’s commendable, not to mention rather startling, given the French’s famous fondness for fromage.

‘Any country with 300 cheeses cannot die,’ remarked Winston Churchill, and today France is reckoned to have more than 1,000 varieties. All the more galling then that two of the cheeses presented to the judges by Matt were — sacre bleu! — a stilton and a West Country cheddar.  ‘The French don’t have many things comparable to a stilton,’ says Matt. ‘To them it’s really quite exotic.’

As if all that is not enough, the French must be choking on their camembert to discover the relative inexperience of the man who became ‘Champion de France’ in the Concours National des Fromagers.

Though judged to be one of France’s foremost experts on the food, 30-year-old Matt has been in the cheese business for little more than a year. Until 2011, he was working for the National Audit Office as an accountant.

When he learned his employer was offering unpaid sabbaticals of up to two years — a kind of ‘trial separation’, as he puts it — he seized the chance to swap his calculator for a cheese wire.

‘I enjoyed elements of my job, but I felt it was perhaps not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,’ says the man who now wrestles not with columns of figures but blocks of cheese.

With an uncut Emmental weighing upwards of 170lb — the average weight of a British male — the work has had an unexpected effect on Matt’s waistline.

Cheesemonger: Mr Feroze had to present a cheese platter that he had selected and matured himself as part of the Concours National des Fromagers at the Salon Mondiale de Restauration et Hôtellerie

‘You need pretty big biceps to work with some of the bigger blocks,’ he says. ‘I thought I might get fatter with all the cheese I get to taste, but, in fact, I’ve lost weight.’

This is but one perk for Matt, who fell in love with France and its cheeses when he went to Lyon to learn French after graduating from Durham University with a degree in chemistry.

‘I worked on a farm where they were making goat’s cheese, and discovered there is something compelling about the people who are involved with it.

‘There’s not really much money to be made in cheese, especially on a small scale, so they tend to be people who are passionate about what they do, interested in keeping something historic alive, but also in creating something brilliant. I found them engaging to be around.’

His fascination with cheese was put on hold — ‘except that I liked to eat lots of it’ — while he pursued his accountancy career, but one Saturday he started chatting with a stall-holder at London’s Borough food market.

He was selling cheeses supplied by the Fromagerie Mons-Etienne Boissy, one of France’s best-known cheesemongers, and gave him the name of a contact in Lyon.

It was the start of what has turned out to be a remarkable venture for Matt and his fiancée, Jen, who works in publishing.

We LEFT home with some savings, an idea we might want to live in Lyon and a fair amount of enthusiasm,’ says Matt.

‘Around that time I saw pictures of the kinds of platters presented at the French cheese competitions, but I had no idea then that I would be up there one day, not only putting one together but actually winning.’

Matt’s fast track to fromagerie fame continued when he was offered  work experience at Fromagerie  Mons-Etienne Boissy’s shop in Lyon.

Taken on as a trainee cheese- monger, he learned some of his most important lessons in the ‘caves’ — a term dating back to the days when the first blue cheeses were matured in the natural caves of France, the temperatures and humidity proving ideal for the growth of mould.

‘Part of what I love about good cheese is that it’s an expression of the land that produced it,’ says Matt.

‘I’ve heard stories about farmers shooing their cows from under trees when it’s raining so they are forced to feed on fresh grass rather than ruminating what they have eaten already.

‘All those things affect the taste — there’s far more to cheese than you could ever imagine.’

Such knowledge is tested in the written section of the competition won by Matt last weekend. Which cheese is hand-wrapped in chestnut leaves? (A southern variety called Fagace.) And which is made from the last ebbs of milk from cows making milk for large wheels of Comte in the Alpine pastures (Mont d’Or, not something you find in your average sarnie).

Selection: Mr Feroze's selection included two British cheeses, a stilton and a West Country cheddar (stock)

Candidates must then identify unlabelled cheeses from all over France, an art in which Matt has quickly become skilled.

‘First, you look at the colour. If it’s yellowy, that suggests it’s made from cow’s milk, because of the carotene in the grass they eat. If it’s white, then you are probably looking at goat or ewe’s cheese.

‘Then you crumble it to see how it has been made, how the curds push together. Finally, you taste it. Is it acidic or sweet? Does it have a woolly, sheepy taste, or is it more goaty?

‘Or has it a woody flavour, like Vacherin Mont D’Or, which is wrapped in a belt of spruce bark? These are all things you get to distinguish in time.’

Equally challenging is the section where contenders slice a block of cheese into specified weights without scales.

‘Judging the weight by eye is something that French customers expect you to get right because it’s something they are very good at themselves,’ says Matt. ‘They have grown up around cheese.’

The highlight of the competition is the presentation of the platters of up to 25 cheese ‘sculptures’.

‘You know roughly the size of the platter, but not the shape, so it’s all about what you do on the day, which makes it very pressured,’ says Matt who carved his cheeses into elaborate crescent shapes.

Apart from the Stilton — ‘one of the British cheeses I’ve always loved’ — his other selected cheeses included a Swiss gruyere, which he describes as tasting ‘savoury and fruity at the same time and with great texture’. And, more practically, he picked mimolette, an orangey cheese from Lille.

‘It added great colour and it’s very easy to carve,’ he says.

He clearly impressed the judges.

‘He was best, that’s all you can say. He worked hard on his presentations, with great passion and knowledge,’ says the competition organiser Catherine Bonnetaud.

So what’s next? ‘I want to keep improving my knowledge about cheese and it’s definitely something I’m considering as a career,’ he says.

That’s bad news for Matt’s competitors. After all, they might have applauded the upstart ‘Rosbif’ last weekend, but who could blame them if they feel a bit cheesed off?
