Liverpool's win over Manchester City was one of the best games I’ve seen for a long time. Liverpool were sensational and just blew City away in the first half.

There were questions over whether they could cope with the pressure but they answered them all with a wonderful performance.

Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho set the tone and were fantastic all game but after going behind City came back so well. They had Liverpool on the ropes and the home side looked almost ready to settle for a draw before Coutinho hit a brilliant strike to win it.

Liverpool have won 10 straight Premier League games, equalling their club record.

It was an enthralling, end-to-end game and what the Premier League is all about.

Now we have to wait and see what will win the title: the flair and power of Liverpool and Man City or Chelsea’s defensive determination.

Liverpool have won 10 in a row but they will have to break a top-flight record if they want to win it. Arsenal won 14 straight games in 2002 but that was split across two seasons. Liverpool could match that record in one. They have four games left and need to win them all. There is no room to slip up.

Tough day at the office: Manchester City's Vincent Kompany holds his hands on his hips

Kompany's bad day at the office

After his performances this season 
plenty of people were ready to say Vincent Kompany was the best defender
 in the world, but Sunday was a game to forget.

He
 played a part in all three Liverpool goals, with Raheem Sterling’s 
sidestep catching him out so badly he had to pay to get back in. Then he
 was easily brushed off by Martin Skrtel for the second and made a hash 
of his clearance for the third.

Watching the Masters 
this weekend you might wonder how the pros can miss a putt from two feet
 — it was the same watching Kompany slice his clearance. It was 
something you would see in a park on a Sunday morning. If Martin 
Demichelis had made that mistake, I don’t know if we’d see him in a City
 shirt again, but Kompany is such an important part of this team.

The Belgian had one of those days that we all have in football and he will want to move on, but for City it came at a big price.

Three-horse race

People might find it hard to believe but I’m sure Man City will have been pleased to see Chelsea win at Swansea.

That win keeps the title race alive for Jose Mourinho because if they had lost, I think he would have put the Premier League on hold and focused all his efforts on the Champions League.

With this result, I expect Chelsea to go to Anfield later this month with everything still to play for, which will only help City.

Chelsea play Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-final either side of their game against Liverpool, and with Jose’s fixture complaints he could easily have focused on Europe. But with that win the fight for the title remains a three-horse race.

Marshall rule

Winning at St Mary’s was a good result for Cardiff and goalkeeper David Marshall played a huge part.

The Scot has been in fine form all season and Saturday was no exception. He made seven saves in the game — more than any other goalkeeper this weekend — and has made more saves than any other goalkeeper. Without him between the posts Cardiff might have struggled even more this season.

Christian drives Spurs onwards

Christian Eriksen saved Tottenham yet again on Saturday with a last-gasp goal. Spurs spent a huge amount of money last summer and none of the other signings has looked up to scratch. But the £11.5m they paid for Eriksen looks like money well spent.

His late goal spared Tottenham’s blushes at West Brom and it’s not the first time he’s led a Spurs fightback. He scored the winner at Old Trafford and when Spurs went 2-0 down at home to Southampton it was Eriksen who scored twice to get his team back in the game.

He has fantastic ability on the ball, good vision and he has that great imagination that Tottenham fans want to see. He has made the most assists at the club and also created nearly twice as many chances as the next best Tottenham player. Tim Sherwood said he could be the club’s Dennis Bergkamp. He has a long way to go to reach that level, but he’s made a good start to his career at White Hart Lane.

The force is with Fulham

After two wins on the bounce, Fulham have now got enough momentum to get out of trouble. They have not won two straight games since October and at the end of March they were five points from safety having played a game more. Now they are just two points behind Norwich and level on games played. With the fixtures they have left, Felix Magath and his men will be optimistic of staying up.

Trophy a must for Arsenal

I was not surprised by Arsenal’s FA Cup performance. After the defeat by Everton the game against Wigan was all about getting to the final. They were not at their best but they will be back at Wembley next month as red-hot favourites. All the pressure is now on Arsene Wenger because the club need silverware and they can’t afford to let this chance slip by.

93 - The omens are good for Brendan Rodgers’ free-scoring Liverpool. After scoring another three at Anfield they have now hit 93 goals this season, their best tally for 50 years. In  1963-64 Liverpool scored 92 on their way to winning the league title. And at an average of 2.7 per game this season, Liverpool are on the march again.

6 - Sunderland have now conceded a league-high of six own goals this season. Wes Brown’s against Everton took his career tally to five — only four men have scored more in the Premier League.

1962 - The last time Cardiff beat Southampton away from home in the league was in October 1962 when they won a 5-3 thriller at The Dell.

0-0 - A scoreline you won’t see when Fulham are playing. There has not been a goalless draw in Fulham’s last 46 Premier League games, the longest run of any team in the league.

24 - Sunderland had 24 efforts at goal against Everton, including blocked shots, but failed to score with any of them. Only Chelsea (26) had more attempts.weekend.

84 - No player completed more passes than Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin this weekend. The midfielder found a team-mate with 84 of his 88 passes, a success rate of 95.5 per cent.

56 - Liverpool have been attacking teams from the off all season and they have now scored 56 goals in the first half of matches. They have also scored 22 goals in the first 20 minutes, more than any other team in the league.
