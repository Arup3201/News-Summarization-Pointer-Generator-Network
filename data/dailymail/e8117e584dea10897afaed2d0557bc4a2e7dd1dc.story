Military Cross winner Brian Wood said British troops had been dragged through 'five years of hell' by the Al-Sweady inquiry

Soldiers and their families yesterday said they had been left ‘disturbed’ and ‘angry’ after enduring a five-year inquiry into false claims that British troops murdered, tortured and mutilated Iraqis.

Former troops said their reputations had been tarnished and their relatives had suffered years of anguish due to the allegations, which the £31million investigation eventually exposed as ‘calculated lies’.

Last night the mother of one of the soldiers who gave evidence to the taxpayer-funded inquiry said the way her son had been accused of wrongdoing was ‘disgraceful’.

She said Scott Hoolin, now 31, heroically fought off the enemy – only to have his name dragged through the mud. 

Ann Hoolin, 50, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, told the Daily Mail: ‘I think the inquiry disturbed him and this coming back again now has just upset and disturbed him again.

‘To be accused of wrongdoing in the aftermath of what happened is disgraceful.’

She said her son was just 21 when he engaged in a ferocious firefight named The Battle of Danny Boy in 2004. The convoy he was travelling with came under fire from militants armed with grenades and AK-47s.

‘It was a worrying time for the family as he was so young and fighting over there,’ she said. ‘Now this has opened it all up again for both Scott and the family.

‘As a family we are angry about that and we are angry because when he went to give evidence to the inquiry he told us when he returned home that the whole thing was a waste of time.’ 

Soldiers were accused of war crimes on the gravest scale by insurgents who told ‘deliberate and calculated lies’ in order to damage the reputation of the Armed Forces.

The lawyers representing nine Iraqi claimants were branded ‘shameful’ after their case was comprehensively rejected by a war crimes inquiry on Wednesday.

Former corporal Brian Wood won a Military Cross for his bravery during the bloody firefight.

Echoing comments made by Mrs Hoolin, he said: ‘We have been dragged through five years of hell. That in my view is a betrayal of our service. We did what we had to do as soldiers and we did the right thing.’ 

The 34-year-old, of the 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales’ Royal Regiment, was conducting a vehicle checkpoint in 2004 when he heard a soldier had been hit by a grenade and another shot in the arm and rushed to their aid.

Detained Iraqis being guarded by a British soldier that was shown at the the Al-Sweady Inquiry. The long-running inquiry found that British troops mistreated nine Iraqi detainees following a fierce battle a decade ago, but false allegations of murder and torture were the product of 'deliberate lies'

The Al-Sweady public Inquiry released shocking images which formed part of its investigation into the ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, at a checkpoint near Basra in 2004 when a number of insurgents were killed

But on the way there in armoured Warrior vehicles, his unit was ambushed by insurgents from three positions. The troops had to charge across open ground and they fought for five hours in one of the most intense battles since the Falklands.

In the firefight, 28 insurgents were killed and nine militants were taken to the Camp Abu Naji military base where they were questioned. But their heroic efforts were tarnished when the detainees claimed they were subjected to torture and witnessed executions and mutilation.

The Al-Sweady probe into the shocking allegations found they were ‘wholly and entirely without merit’. It exonerated British troops, saying the Iraqi men they were accused of torturing were not innocent farmers but insurgents killed or captured in the firefight.

British troops had responded to the ‘deadly ambush with exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism’, according to Sir Thayne Forbes, who was conducting the inquiry.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon demanded Leigh Day and legal aid-funded Public Interest Lawyers, the two law firms that represented the discredited Iraqis, make an ‘unequivocal apology’.

But Phil Shiner’s PIL has refused to admit any wrongdoing. As it stands, PIL will receive around £3million for its work on the inquiry. Both firms are being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority for alleged misconduct.

Lawyer Phil Shiner has repeatedly been condemned for taking on legal aid clients to sue British institutions despite having flimsy cases.

His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, has received around £3million in public money for the Al-Sweady Inquiry alone and has been involved in dozens of other such claims.

It is still representing another 1,500 Iraqis who say they are the victims of British abuse. Birmingham-based Mr Shiner has also persuaded prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to probe Britain over claims of war crimes by troops. 

The 57-year-old set up PIL in 1999, shortly before the Human Rights Act came in. In 2004 Mr Shiner – who has links with the barristers' chambers of Tony Blair's wife Cherie Booth QC – was named 'Human Rights Lawyer of the Year'.

But as recently as May, two High Court judges attacked his controversial firm for using thousands of pounds of taxpayer-funded legal aid to bring another worthless case to court.

Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Collins called for powers to strip the practice of the legal aid fees it will be paid for trying to win compensation for a murderer complaining about not being allowed to vote while in jail. They said the claim made on behalf of Somali-born Dutch inmate Samson Teshome was 'absurd'.

PIL had argued that as an EU citizen, convicted killer Teshome – who served 14 years for the murder of a fellow asylum seeker – should have been allowed to vote in local and EU parliamentary elections in 2012.

Mr Shiner drew criticisim for persisting with the legal fight even after a Supreme Court judgment had removed any possibility of success. However, prosecutors in the Hague have launched a 'preliminary examination' into claims UK forces tortured and mistreated Iraqi prisoners between 2003 and 2008.

It is the first time the ICC, which usually prosecutes blood-soaked dictators, has investigated Britain.

Mr Shiner made more than 400 allegations of beating, sexual assault, mock executions and electric shocks of Iraqi captives. He has been criticised for sending representatives to Iraq to talk to people who claim to have been abused by British troops.
