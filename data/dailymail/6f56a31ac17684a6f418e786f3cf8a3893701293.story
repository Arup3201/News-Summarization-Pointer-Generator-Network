A farmer accused of the manslaughter of a rambler who was gored to death by one of his bulls had admitted it ‘kept walkers on their toes’, a court heard.

Paul Waterfall, 39, denies manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman died on a public path on Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar in November 2010.

The 63-year-old died after he was allegedly attacked by the bull while walking with his wife Glenis, 70.

Paul Waterfall, who is charged with manslaughter by gross negligence after rambler Roger Freeman  was allegedly killed by one of his bulls in a field in Stanford on Soar, Nottinghamshire, in November 2010

Waterfall is accused of breaching his duty of care to the public by failing to ensure the bull was safely confined on his land on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border.

Opening his case at Nottingham Crown Court today, prosecutor Andrew McGee told the jury Waterfall was aware of the ‘deadly risk’ posed by the bull, who was named Moonriver Zac Pi, and of the public footpath that ran across his land.

The trial, being held at Nottingham Crown Court, is expected to last five weeks

The court heard that the bull, known as Zac, the 19-month-old Brown Swiss bull had been involved in two previous incidents just weeks before the fatal attack on Mr Freeman.

Mr McGee said: ‘As a farmer Paul Waterfall had a duty of care to those who used the public footpath. Paul Waterfall had that duty of care and knew his bull posed a real risk of death to people using that path’

The prosecutor added that Waterfall had been ‘grossly neglectful’ in failing to take any steps to prevent that risk.

‘The death was made all the more tragic because it was completely avoidable’, he added.

The jury of four women and eight men heard Mr Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was walking with his wife along the public footpath through a field off Leake Lane in Stanford on Soar at around 4.30pm on Friday November 12 2010 when the bull struck.

The couple were experienced walkers who had been on a walking holiday.

Dressed in walking clothes and boots, the couple had walked for about 12 miles when they reached the public footpath near Mr Waterfall’s farm, Mr McGee told the jury.

Mrs Freeman told police after the attack that the couple had seen cows and a bull in the field when they had got on to the path, Mr McGee told the court.

She was walking ahead when she heard an ‘oof’ from her husband and turned around, the prosecutor told the court.

‘Glenis saw Roger on the ground with the bull there,’ Mr McGee said.

‘She tried to distract the bull but it attacked her and continued to attack Roger.

‘Roger told her to go and get help. He told her “I’m sorry my baby I can’t get us out of this.”’

Mrs Freeman told officers the animal had 12-inch horns which were long and curved and described it as ‘brown and slobbering’.

She told them the animal had “looked excited and had started pawing at the ground” before attacking her husband, Mr McGee told the jury.

It then pawed at the ground and ran at her, he said.

She told police it was like ‘a bull charging in a bull fight’.

Mrs Freeman ran from the field and flagged down a motorist who called for an ambulance.

She was taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham where she had surgery for chest and abdominal injuries.

Police and paramedics found Mr Freeman, a father-of-two, face down with only his underpants and boots on.

His clothes had been stripped from him and were scattered at the scene, Mr McGee told the court.

The jury of four women and eight men heard Mr Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was walking with his wife along the public footpath through a field off Leake Lane in Stanford on Soar at around 4.30pm on Friday November 12 2010 when the bull struck

He was declared dead at the scene and taken to hospital where tests confirmed he had died from multiple injuries including fractures to his ribs and shoulders.

The court heard the bull had allegedly been involved in two previous incidents with humans in the weeks leading up to the attack.

On October 1, two Central Networks engineers had attempted to carry out emergency electrical repairs on the farmland but were chased off by the bull when it charged at them, Mr McGee told the jury.

But the workers managed to fend of the animal with metal rods, and were rescued by Mr Waterfall, who picked them up on his truck.

He told the workers that Zac was ‘a nasty, aggressive bull’ that he himself was wary of but that ‘he did keep walkers on their toes’, Mr McGee said.

A second incident just two weeks before Mr Freeman was attacked involved another Central Networks engineer who had been carrying out work on the farmland.

The prosecutor told the jury: ‘These comments are obviously significant in that they reveal as of October 1 - six weeks before the fatal incident - Paul Waterfall was well aware that Zac was aggresive and presented a risk to walkers in the field.’

The court heard Mr Waterfall had farmed at Underhill Farm for ten years and kept around 500 cattle of various breeds on the 300 acres. He bought Zac in 2009 to breed with his heffers.

Mr McGee told the court that one previous owner had described Zac as 'a cocky bull' but none had reported any aggresive behaviour.

However the prosecutor said dairy breeds were recognised as being ‘potentially more aggresive and dangerous’.

Zac was put down immediately after the attack on Mr Freeman however Mr McGee claimed experts said the bull should have been culled following two previous incidents in the weeks before the fatal incident.

Mr Waterfall was charged last year following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.

The trial is expected to last up to five weeks.
