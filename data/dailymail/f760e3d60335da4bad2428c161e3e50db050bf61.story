Government employees in Florida have been banned from using the terms 'climate change' or 'global warming', an investigation has revealed.

Former staff members from the state's Department for Environmental Protection (DEP) confirmed they were not allowed to use the phrases in reports, emails or official communications because it is 'not a true fact'. 

The bizarre practice is said to have been enforced since Governor Rick Scott took office in 2011 - a politician who insists climate change is not caused by humans.

The unofficial guidelines have been criticized as a number of scientists have warned The Sunshine State is more vulnerable than anywhere in the United States to rising sea levels.

A report published in 2012 suggested southern parts of Florida could be under water within 100 years. 

Despite  concerns, four former DEP employees across the state say the order not to use the phrases was well known and distributed verbally statewide.

Kirstina Trotta, a former DEP employee based in Miami, told the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (FCIR) they could not use the terms because they were not 'allowed to discuss anything that was not a true fact'.  

Christopher Byrd, an attorney with the DEP’s Office of General Counsel in Tallahassee from 2008 to 2013, added: 'We were told not to use the terms "climate change," "global warming" or "sustainability,"

'That message was communicated to me and my colleagues by our superiors in the Office of General Counsel.

'It’s an indication that the political leadership in the state of Florida is not willing to address these issues and face the music when it comes to the challenges that climate change presents.' 

Another staff member, who wanted to remain anonymous, said they were warned use of the words would bring unwanted attention to their projects. 

They told the FCIR: 'We were dealing with the effects and economic impact of climate change, and yet we can’t reference it.' 

Spokesman for the DEP, Tiffany Cowie, told the FCIR: 'DEP does not have a policy on this'. A representative from the Governor's office also denied the claims.
