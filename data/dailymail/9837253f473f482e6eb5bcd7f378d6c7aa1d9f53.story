The days of waiting for eBay sellers to post your purchases, and making sure you're home when they arrive, are numbered.

The auction site has bought London-based courier service Shutl that specialises in delivering online goods within an hour - although the firm's record is 14 minutes.

Ebay has not announced when it will start offering the superfast delivery option, but has said it will be launched in London before being rolled out nationwide.

The service will only be available when both seller and buyer are in the same area and will begin in London. Launch dates have not been announced

Earlier this year eBay announced plans to trial touchscreen 'shoppable windows' fitted to the front of shops in New York.

The screens, which are nine feet wide
 and two feet tall, are fixed to the windows of currently empty stores 
in busy neighbourhoods such as the lower east side and Soho.

The screens sell 30 items from 
new fashion brand Kate Spade Saturday, owned by Fifth and Pacific, and if successful, could be expanded to other brands in other cities. 

Shutl launched in 2008 and calls itself a 'rapid fulfillment service'. It works by connecting stores with local couriers. 

Buyers can choose to have their items delivered as soon as possible, or choose an hour-long window later that same day, or week, which is still preferable to current day-long delivery windows.

The firm already has deals with high-street stores including Argos, Warehouse and Maplin and adds around £5 onto the price of items to guarantee quick delivery. 

EBay's Shutl service will initially only be available when both seller and buyer are in the same area.

However, it is expected that once the service is rolled out fully, sellers who have national stores or warehouses across the UK may also be able to offer the delivery option. 

Ebay already offers a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes to expand to 20 more American cities over the next year.

Shutl founder and chief executive Tom Allason wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition: 'Today, approximately 75 per cent of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home.

'E-commerce is quick and convenient, two
 things that delivery is not. Together with eBay, we believe that we can
 transform this market and fulfill our mission.'

Neither eBay nor Shutl has announced the financial details of the deal.
