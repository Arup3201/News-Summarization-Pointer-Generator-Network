She has consistently insisted that she won't be running for President in 2016.

But a controversial author now claims Hillary Clinton does have the White House in her sights - but only 'if her health holds out'.

Ed Klein claims the Secretary of State, 64, is planning to take time off to 'get back into shape' but - in comments that are unlikely to be welcomed by Mrs Clinton - remarked that she looks 'overweight' and 'very tired'.

'Overweight and very tired': Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks to the New York Women's Foundation on May 10 (left) and on a visit to Belgium earlier this year (right)

The author - the man behind books including The Truth About Hillary - says she will only be able to make a White House bid 'if her health holds out' and 'that's a big if,of course'.

In an interview on America's Fox News Radio, the former New York Times magazine editor said: 'At this very moment that we're 
speaking right now... [the Clintons] are already thinking seriously
 about running in 2016.

Knives out: Critics have said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (pictured during a visit to Bangladesh in May) is looking 'very tired'

'She'll be 69 years old. And as you know -- and I don't want 
to sound anti-feminist here -- but she's not looking good these days. 
She's looking overweight, and she's looking very tired.'

Mr Klein added: 'And if 
her health holds out - that's a big if, of course - if her health holds
 out, there's no question in my mind she and Bill - two for the price 
of one - will run in 2016.'

In May, photos taken of the former First Lady during visits to Bangladesh and India, showed the Secretary of State looking tired and withdrawn - far from the well-coiffed image she has maintained over the past two decades in politics.

The images - in which she was make-up 
free, casually dressed and wearing glasses - came as she claimed she had
 no desire to make another bid for the White House because she wanted a 
rest.

In January, she announced that she was ready to step off the 'high wire' of U.S. politics altogether.

'I have made it clear that I will 
certainly stay on until the president nominates someone and that 
transition can occur' if Obama is re-elected, she told a town hall 
meeting.

'But I think after 20 years, and it 
will be 20 years, of being on the high wire of American politics and all
 of the challenges that come with that, it would be probably a good idea
 to just find out how tired I am.'

However she took the time to sharply rebuff comments made by her detractors that focused solely on her appearance.

Under fire: Hillary Clinton meets Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet in Istanbul on Thursday

Position of power: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attends a 'Friends of Syria' meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on June 6

In an interview last month, she 
laughed at the attention she had received for her sense of style, 
especially after the photographs of her make-up-free face.

Mrs Clinton was photographed with an 
all-natural look at press events held in Bangladesh and India after 
completing a whirlwind, three-day tour of the region.

She told CNN: 'You know, at some point, it's just not something that deserves a lot of time and attention.'

The Secretary of State added: 'I feel
 so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now... and if 
others want to worry about it, I let them do the worrying for a change.

Presidential material?: Hillary Clinton (shown meeting Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) is rumoured to be considering running for the White House in 2016

'Because you know, if I want to wear my glasses I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to wear my hair back I'm pulling my hair back.'

She was referring to the attention she received after a member of staff criticised her frequent use of hair scrunchies.

The Democrat has appeared to make some slight sartorial changes, toning down her once-gaudy colored trouser suits in recent months.

She also became to subject of an Internet meme, Texts From Hillary, which shifted the focus from the Secretary of State's appearance to her relentless routine of international travel, high-powered meetings and 24/7 attention to her Blackberry.

Mrs Clinton is far from the first high-profile female politician to have attracted comments about her appearance.

Former
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy commented loudly and uncharitably on 
the quantity of cheese Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel consumed at a 
dinner, while Sarah Palin, the Republican Party nominee for Vice 
President in the 2008 presidential election, was criticized for her $150,000 designer wardrobe.

Ed Klein, 75, is a former New York Times magazine editor who has written extensively about the Kennedys and Hillary Clinton.
