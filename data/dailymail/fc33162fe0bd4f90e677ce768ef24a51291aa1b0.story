A crooked custody officer stole a police mugshot to create a Facebook page falsely accusing a heroin dealer of being an informant to help a rival pusher.

Within hours of the picture appearing on the social network, the man shown in the picture - 31-year-old Domenico Masciopinto -  had been shot by a gunman.

Jonpaul Pasqualone, 28, was jailed for seven years after stealing Masciopinto's mugshot which he posted online with the caption: 'A Police informant since 2009'.

Mugshot: Crooked custody officer Jonpaul Pasqualone posted this picture of heroin dealer Domenico Masciopinto on Facebook accusing him of being a police informant

Masciopinto, 31, survived being shot in the chest and the wrist, but has subsequently been jailed for 14 years at Luton crown court after being convicted of two charges of conspiring to supply Class A drugs.

Pasqualone, who worked as a £23,000 a year detention and escort officer at Luton Police Station in Beds, hoped to become a police officer.

Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'The consequences of what you did resulted in a man being shot - fortunately not fatally.

'Your recompense for what you did was to receive £1,000 in cash.

'When Mr Masciopinto discovered what had happened, he was very annoyed and feared for his own and his family’s safety.

'He was not a police informant and never had been, he was a dealer in Class A drugs based in Bedford.

'He has recently been convicted to conspiring to supply Class A drugs and he is presently serving 14 years in prison.'

'The fact that a man, whoever that man 
may be and whatever his antecedents and criminal leanings, was shot as a
consequence of what you did amounts in my judgement to a serious 
aggravating feature of your case.'

The court heard how Pasqualone had joined Bedfordshire Police in 2010 in a civilian role working in the custody department.

Before that, he had worked as a detention officer at Yarlswood Immigration Detention Centre for four years.

He had also worked as a custody officer at both Luton Magistrates and Luton Crown Courts.

A statement by Bedfordshire Police said that Pasqualone had carried out the offences to help another suspected drug dealer who had been a friend since childhood.

The idea had been to disrupt a rival drug supply business by making it appear that Masciopinto was an informant.

In the course of his duties Pasqualone had access to a number of computerised information systems which contained highly sensitive and confidential police reports and intelligence.

At the end of 2010 Pasqulone, who lived with his girlfriend in a privately owned penthouse flat in Bedford and drove a silver TT Audi with a personal number plate, was contacted by a former friend who had criminal connections.

As a result said Peter Shaw prosecuting a week later while working night shifts at Luton Police Station, Pasqualone sat at a computer and under the noses of his bosses accessed a series of intelligence reports relating to the man.

Strict rules govern the viewing of such information and police personnel can only do so for lawful and valid policing purposes.

However Pasqualone got round security measures by simply photographing on screen documents using his mobile telephone.

The court heard Pasqualone accessed one system known as ‘Boris’ which stood for Bedfordshire Open Research Information Service.

But a permanent record is left by anyone accessing Boris, revealing the information that has been obtained.

In the days that followed he copied more highly sensitive information following requests by his former friend.

On one occasion, Pasqualone downloaded a picture of another associate of his friend and edited the picture with the words ‘Police Informant since 2008.’

Guilty: Pasqualone, 28, was jailed for seven years ay Luton Crown Court

Judge Gullick said he was in no doubt what he had done in relation to this picture was a 'dummy run' for what was to follow, involving Mr Masciopinto’s custody picture.

The prosecutor said in December of 2010 his friend visited Pasqualone at the flat in Herron Heights, Bedford that he shared with his girlfriend, Emma Cook.

Mr Shaw said 'Emma Cook recalls that the man said to Mr Pasqualone that he wanted more information from him as the information Mr Pasqualone had was not sufficient and he wanted photographs of people that he had named to Mr Pasqualone.

'She saw him pay Mr Pasqualone £500 to £600 for the information from a bundle of notes that he had in his possession and she also heard him say to Mr Pasqualone ‘You will get a another lot or a lot more next time when I get the rest of the information,' said the prosecutor.

The court then heard how in January of last year having just got back from a trip to New York with his girlfriend, Pasqualone returned to work at Luton Police Station and accessed information held by the police relating to criminal Domenico Masciopinto who lived in Bedford.

He also accessed custody photographs of Mr Masciopinto and once more used his own mobile telephone to photograph the images and information.

Mr Shaw said after returning home from work that evening he took the custody images of Mr Masciopinto on his mobile and transferred them to his laptop.

The court was told that by using software on his computer, he altered the custody picture by adding the caption 'Police Informant since 2009'.

Once more the man who was instructing Pasqualone to get the information came to the flat and was able to leave with it once it had been transferred to his own mobile phone. On this occasion Pasqualone was paid another £5-600 pounds according to his girlfriend.

Judge Gullick was told that on Sunday 
January 16 2011 pictures of Mr Masciopinto were displayed on the 
Facebook networking site with the caption that he was a police 
informant.

'Domenico Masciopinto logged onto Facebook and found the relevant account.

'He
saw that it had a picture of him taken whilst he was in Police custody,
he thought in 2010. He saw the text around the picture saying that he 
was

‘A Police Informant since 2009,' said Mr Shaw.

He
went on 'Mr Masciopinto was worried that family, friends, associates 
and even people that did not know him may believe he was a police 
informer and that could put his welfare in jeopardy.'

That day as he set about trying to 
find out who was responsible, Mr Masciopinto was standing outside his 
home in Bedford with a friend and on his phone.

Suddenly
a gunman approached the pair armed with a hand gun. Shots rang out and 
Masciopinto was shot in the wrist and the chest.

A bullet ended up close to his spine at the back of his neck and he had to undergo an emergency operation.

The
following day Pasqualone was arrested. At his flat in Bedford officers 
found two prohibited self loading pistols that were on display on a wall
- which he had bought whilst on holiday in Bulgaria.

Also discovered at the property was an electronic shock device made to look like a mobile phone.

He
pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit an act of misconduct in
a public office, two offences of possessing a prohibited firearm and 
possessing a disguised firearm.

Mr Shaw said that in an interview Pasqualone claimed he had had been at a cafe in Bedford in November 2010 when he was approached by his former friend who wanted a police picture obtained of Masciopinto with the words Police Informant printed on it.

'He said the man threatened to f... him up if he didn’t assist in editing the photographs with the words. Pasqualone stated that as a result of receiving this threat that he was scared for his own safety and that of his girlfriend and so he agreed to undertake the task requested,' said Mr Shaw.Bozzie Sheffi defending said 'His great regret is that he succumbed to the threat.'

The court heard he had been behind a criminal enterprise bringing drugs to Bedford from Bradford.

After the hearing today, Beds Police said Pasqualone had formally resigned from his job 'several months ago.'

The Assistant Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police, Andrew Richer, said: 'The image which was posted on Facebook is a copy of a page from the Bedfordshire Police custody system, which is not accessible to outside sources.

'Having used his position as a custody officer, at the request of his friend, to access the page and copy it, Pasqualone then added text to make it appear as if the person was a police informant.'
