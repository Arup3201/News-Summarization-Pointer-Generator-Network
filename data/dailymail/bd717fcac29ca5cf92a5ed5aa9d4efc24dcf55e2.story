A pay-it-forward craze of pinning scarves and hats to trees is  warming hearts  across North America.

Items of warm clothing are deliberately being left in public places amid freezing temperatures across large parts of the U.S. and Canada.

Many of the items, which include gloves and blankets, are accompanied with notes explaining that they are available for anyone who needs them - and requests to pass the favour on in the future.

Warm-hearted: These scarves were tied to trees in the Canadian city of Winnipeg in Manitoba

Notes attached to the scarves explain how anyone can take them away if they are feeling the cold 

The Chase the Chill scheme, which started in Pennsylvania in the US, is already becoming popular in other cities including in Winnipeg and Ottawa in Canada.

It comes a week after frostbite warnings were issued across the East Coast of the US, with millions of Americans urged to avoid prolonged exposure to the cold as temperatures plunged across the country.

A group has recently been set up in Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada, where temperatures have dipped as low as -45C.

Branch founder Dianne Mursell said: 'I felt it was something badly needed here as just this past weekend it was -45C with the wind-chill.

Many of the items, which include knitwear, gloves and blankets, are accompanied with notes explaining that they are available for anyone who needs them - and requests to pass the favour on in the future

'I can't imagine being homeless or out in this weather.

'One of the reasons I wanted to start this is because not everyone will ask for help, people have dignity and pride.

'It's hard to ask for something when you can't provide for yourself - this way it's just there for them.

'Not all shelters are open throughout the night so this way it's there for them if they need it.

'It's hard to believe something as simple as a hat or scarf is considered a luxury item but for some people it really is.'
