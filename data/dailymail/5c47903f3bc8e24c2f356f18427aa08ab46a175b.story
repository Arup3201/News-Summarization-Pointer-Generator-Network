 A five-year-old boy asked why 'Santa' never visited him despite being good after he was seriously neglected by his mother and her partner. 

The young child had severely rotten teeth, with several having exposed roots and abscesses, while there was no toothbrush suitable for his use in his house.

Authorities were alerted to the boy's plight after he escaped from the house and his frantic mother rang the police. 

York Crown Court, pictured, heard that the young boy had several teeth removed due to decay

When police arrived at the house, officers found it was covered in flies, with piles of rubbish and rotting food. The kitchen was full of dirty plates while there was dogs excrement inside the house. The fridge was full of rotten food. 

York Crown Court heard that the boy's school had warned his mother and her partner of their concerns over his welfare. 

Prosecution counsel Aisha Wadoodi said several of the child's baby teeth had exposed roots while some teeth had developed abscesses. Several of his teeth needed extraction. 

Ms Wadoodi told the court that after the child was recovered, he was placed into foster care. The court heard that the child's education standards and speech were considerably below the average for his age. 

According to The York Press, the child told his foster mother: 'Santa doesn’t come to my house. I don’t know why, because I have been good.' 

The court heard that there were no toys in the boy's room and he had no idea what a bath was for or how he should be washed.

Ms Waddodi said that over the past six months, the boy has thrived in foster care, described by his foster mother as 'a lovely little boy, very chatty, open and likes to please people.'

She said that the boy does not mention his family or his previous home. 

She added: 'This was serious long-term neglect.'

The boy's mother, who is 43, and her 42-year-old partner have both pleaded guilty to two charges of child cruelty by not seeking dental care or providing suitable living accommodation. 

The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, recently moved into the property. 

The court heard that the boy had been neglected between September 1, 2013 and August 2014, while the man had neglected him between March and August. 

The mother's defence team claimed she was a loving and caring parent who was suffering from depression. 

She said the mother received no support from the boy's father. 

Victoria Smith-Swain, for the woman claimed she had difficulty coping with rearing her son and working in a shopping centre. 

The court adjourned sentencing so it could assess reports of the mother's mental health. Her partner has not yet provided his mitigation statment. 

The pair are due to be sentenced next month at Leeds Crown Court.
