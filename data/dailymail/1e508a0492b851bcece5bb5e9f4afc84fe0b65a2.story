Entertainer Lance Percival has died at the age of 81.

The actor was renowned for his comic renditions of calypso songs on the 1960s satirical television show That Was The Week That Was, hosted by David Frost.

He was later given two series of his own, The Lance Percival Show and Lance at Large, a 1964 sitcom which featured Bernard Bresslaw, Gladys Bacon and Eric Barker.

Lance Percival - the star of numerous Carry On films and That Was The Week That Was - has died aged 81

He appeared in films such as Carry On Cruising, Up Pompeii, Postman’s Knock and the 1970 musical Darling Lili, with Julie Andrews.

His other TV credits include 1970s shows Shoestring and Citizen James, and he provided the voices of both Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in the 1960s cartoon The Beatles.

His version of the song Shame and Scandal in the Family was a top 40 hit in October 1965, and he appeared on BBC radio, including Just a Minute, throughout the 1980s.

He is perhaps best remembered for his role as the ship's cook in the 1962 film Carry On Cruising

In 1970, he was involved in a fatal car crash while reportedly racing in his Jaguar XJ. He agreed to pay damages after driver Paul Young died.

Born John Lancelot Blades in Sevenoaks, Kent in 1933, he was educated at the Sherborne School, Dorset.

A death notice in The Times said he died on Tuesday in a central London hospital after 'a long illness'.

His son Jamie said yesterday: 'He was an amazing dad. He was involved in my life right up to the present day.

'He came to every rugby game I was in, and we watched sports together, and we held Ryder Cup parties. He was loved by all his family and will be very much missed.' 

His funeral will be held on January 20 at Putney Vale Crematorium, south-west London.

The comedy saw him star alongside Kenneth Williams (right) and Kenneth Connor (left) as well as Sid James

In his first film role, he starred as a French gendarme alongside Ingrid Van Bergen in The Devil's Daffodil
