Something to hide? Professor Brian Cathcart has had time off to campaign against a free Press - but who has paid his salary?

Hacked Off co-founder and university professor Brian Cathcart yesterday faced questions about who is paying his salary while he campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press.

The executive director of the lobby group – fronted by actor Hugh Grant – has been on leave of absence from his academic job for nine months.

But the man whose organisation is demanding greater openness and transparency from newspapers refuses to say whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical.

Mr Cathcart, 56, professor of journalism at Kingston University, is understood to be receiving around two-thirds of his estimated £80,000-a-year salary while he runs the high-profile pressure group that is demanding statutory legislation of the Press.

During his time off he has played a key public role for the organisation and was one of four Hacked Off representatives who sat in on controversial late-night talks in Ed Miliband’s Commons office when the controversial Royal Charter on newspaper regulation was agreed by the three political parties.

Hacked Off has consistently defied calls to identify its donors. Earlier this year the lobby group refused to tell MPs the names of the rich individuals bankrolling its fight for a Press law and Professor Cathcart was criticised by the audience at a Glasgow literary festival when he refused to name its backers.

Over several days, the Mail has made detailed requests to Professor Cathcart, Hacked Off and Kingston University, in South-West London, to reveal whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical but they have refused to answer.

Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any suggestion that taxpayers have paid for Brian Cathcart to work for Hacked Off is deeply worrying and requires explanation.

‘It’s vital that those involved come clean about whether hard-pressed families are funding Mr Cathcart’s time lobbying for Press regulation.

‘Hacked Off’s campaign has resulted in vital Press freedoms being threatened. If this work has been subsidised by taxpayers it will only add to the scandal.’

On Professor Cathcart’s Kingston University website it says: ‘Brian joined the university as one of its founding members of the journalism department in 2003, and has watched student numbers grow to 300 in that time.

Major players: Jemima Khan has made a £5,000 donation to the pressure group Hacked Off, which is fronted by Hugh Grant

‘He was made a professor in 2006, and teaches at all three levels on the journalism BA course.’

Messages sent to his university email address received the reply: ‘Brian Cathcart is on leave of absence from Kingston University from September 2012.’

The Hacked Off campaign was launched by the Media Standards Trust in July 2011 in the wake of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. The professor and the trust’s Martin Moore co-founded the lobby group, which represents celebrities and other victims of Press intrusion.

During his leave of absence from the university’s school of humanities, Professor Cathcart has been prominent in reacting to the Leveson inquiry report and has frequently appeared in print and on TV and radio demanding greater newspaper regulation. Hacked Off has come under increasing pressure to disclose the source of its funds.

Heiress Jemima Khan confirmed she had given £5,000 to the group fronted by her ex-boyfriend Mr Grant and last month financier Arpad Busson and chart-topping music producer Guy Chambers were named as secret donors.

Chief: Hacked Off have continued to campaign through Lord Leveson's inquiry into Press regulation

On its website the only funding Hacked Off discloses is money from Mr Grant, a £50,000 grant over 2012-13 from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and more than £20,000 it says it is soon to receive from the Journalism Foundation, a charitable body set up by the owners of the Independent newspapers.

Kingston University had an income of £203million in 2011/12 with £73million of the cash coming in public money provided by government funding and £98million in tuition fees and education contracts.The university said the Data Protection Act prevented it from discussing Professor Cathcart’s absence.

The Mail made repeated efforts to speak to Professor Cathcart without success.

A series of questions was sent to Hacked Off about his year off and his salary arrangements, including whether Mr Cathcart thought his work with the lobby group was a suitable use of a sabbatical funded by the taxpayer.

Hacked Off replied: ‘Professor Cathcart is currently on leave of absence from Kingston University and working as executive director of Hacked Off.

‘His salary is a private matter. He, the university and the Government all take the view that, where possible, academics should contribute to society and to public life.’

Secret: Lord Justice Leveson with the Report from the Inquiry into the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press has refused to discuss his findings

The judge who chaired the public inquiry into the newspaper industry is refusing requests to appear in front of MPs to discuss his report and the future of the Press.

The Daily Mail has been told that over the last six months Lord Justice Leveson has received several invitations from the Commons culture, media and sport select committee to face questions at a special parliamentary hearing.

Sources say Lord Justice Leveson, who delivered his report into media standards last November, is ‘well aware’ that the committee is keen to scrutinise him publicly over which of the proposals under discussion he believes would deliver the best system of Press regulation, but all offers have so far been rebuffed.

It is unlikely that other aspects of the Leveson Inquiry – including the controversial relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins, a lawyer working on Leveson’s team, and David Sherborne, a barrister acting for celebrity phone-hacking victims – could be examined because of restrictions set out by the Judicial Executive Board on judges commenting on public figures.

The pair struck up a close friendship while the Leveson inquiry was under way, going on holiday together to a Greek island last August. They deny their affair began before the inquiry ended in December, but critics believe they may have breached official guidelines by becoming so close last summer.

John Whittingdale, the media select committee’s chairman, has been in regular contact with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, since last December about the possibility of Lord Justice Leveson appearing though so far no formal summons has been made. Lord Judge, in effect Lord Justice Leveson’s boss, must give his permission before the judge can make an appearance.

Official guidelines do not forbid sitting judges from appearing in front of select committees but they do limit their ability to discuss certain matters, including ‘the personalities or merits of... politicians, and other public figures...’ as well as individual legal cases.

But the rules say nothing about judges who have led public inquiries, and the committee is ready to toughen its stance in order to force Lord Justice Leveson to attend a hearing so that his views can be considered.

A source said: ‘It is surely an irony that Sir Brian Leveson is the only person associated with this public inquiry from whom the public have not heard.

‘He was asked by the Government to lead a public inquiry. He did so at considerable public expense. Admittedly we’ve moved on from the recommendations he made in his report last year but this is very much a live issue for the committee, who would be very, very interested to hear from him.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is ridiculous that Lord Justice Leveson should be excused from sharing his thoughts in public on the crucial matter of the future of the Press.’

The newspaper industry is still locked in a stalemate with the Government over how it should be regulated.

A spokesman for the Judiciary said: ‘The chairman of the select committee has spoken to the Lord Chief Justice, who has concerns about Lord Justice Leveson’s position. The chairman has told the Lord Chief Justice he understands those concerns and together they are considering how best to meet them.’
