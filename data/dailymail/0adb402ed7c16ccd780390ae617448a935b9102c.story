Members of Congress were among the wealthiest on Capitol Hill with fortunes most families can barely dream of, new figures have revealed.

Democratic Congressmen have a median net worth of $878,5000 - almost ten times that of a typical American household.

Driving up the figures were the super rich including Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts who is worth $232 million, in part because his wife Teresa belongs to the Heinz family.

Republicans also count the  super wealthy in their ranks too including California’s Representative Darrell Issa who has a fortune of $448million.

The analysis of politicians’ financial disclosure forms by the Center for Responsive Politics revealed that there is huge wealth gap between lawmakers and the general public.

Researchers claimed that if politicians did not have so much money they would concentrate on issues which affect people more and not be distracted by their own interests.

The figures show that as income inequality has widened in America, so has the gap between Congress and the public has increased too.

Capitol Hill is now overwhelmingly made up of lawyers and businessmen - some have never even worked outside of politics before assuming office.

Across both parties, Congressmen earned $174,000 a year which is well above the median family income of $49,445 for 2010.

Family fortunes: The Obamas wealth now stands at $7.3million according to the report while presidential challenger Mitt Romney has a vast personal fortune of more than $250million

Their net worth has been creeping up every year since 2004 and now dwarfs the median net worth of a typical U.S. household, which was $96,000 in 2009.

The Democrats, who model themselves as defenders of the middle class, count 21 among their numbers who have assets of more than $10million each.

It's very hard for someone of median wealth to serve in Congress, even if they could raise the money to get elected.

President Obama also has a net worth of $7.3million, making him far richer than many of those who voted for him.

The Center for Responsive Politics found that overall the Republicans were still the wealthiest of the two parties with a median net worth of $957,500.

Some 35 have assets worth more than $10 million including Texas Representative Michael McCaul who boasts a $380million fortune.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has also faced repeated criticism over his reported fortune of $250million he acquired while working at a private equity company in the 1980s.

Nick Carnes, assistant public policy professor at Duke University, who did not take part in the research, said that just two per cent of Congress was from a working class background.

He said: ‘Politicians from working and middle classes are more likely to work hard on bread and butter domestic economic issues that matter to ordinary Americans’.

Nolan McCarty, a politics professor at Princeton University, added: ‘It's very hard for someone of median wealth to serve in Congress, even if they could raise the money to get elected.'
