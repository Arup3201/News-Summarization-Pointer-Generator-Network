Abraham Shakespeare could barely read, wrote his name in block letters and had given away most of his $17 million in lottery winnings when he became friends with Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, a calculating woman who later became his financial adviser, prosecutors said Wednesday.During opening statements in Moore's first-degree murder trial in Tampa, assistant state attorney Jay Pruner said Moore swindled what was left of Shakespeare's winnings from his bank account in 2009, then killed him and buried his body under a concrete slab in her backyard.Pruner said when Shakespeare won the lottery, his life 'drastically and dramatically changed' — and that the money caused all sorts of problems, eventually leading to his death.

On trial: Dorice "Dee Dee" Moore arrives in court at the Hillsborough County Courthouse for the opening statements in her case Wednesday

Big winner: Mr. Shakespeare collected his millions with his family by his side in 2006

Moore, 40, wore a yellow button-down blouse and black pants to court, and her long, curly hair framed her face as she highlighted notes with a yellow marker during Wednesday's trial.

Booked: Police said Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore shot Shakespeare twice than his his body in concrete

Her attorney, Byron Hileman, said there is no evidence that ties his client to the gun used to shoot Shakespeare.'There are no eyewitnesses who can testify that Ms. Moore shot and killed Mr. Shakespeare or was present when he was shot and killed or had any part carrying out his murder,' Hileman said, adding that the evidence against Moore is mostly circumstantial.Both attorneys agreed on one thing: that by the time Shakespeare and Moore met, the man had already spent or given away most of his lottery winnings.

Friends and acquaintances owed him millions of dollars, the lawyers said, and Pruner called him a 'soft touch.'Moore befriended Shakespeare in late 2008, claiming that she was writing a book 'about how people were taking advantage of him,' said Pruner.Prosecutors said Moore became his financial adviser, eventually controlling every asset he had left, including an expensive home, the debt owed to him and a $1.5 million annuity.

Prosecutors said Moore got close to Shakespeare by telling him she was writing a book about his financial woes

Pruner said that during the trial, he will prove that Moore shifted money from Shakespeare's bank accounts to her own, and that she formed a company in his name — yet didn't allow him to withdraw money from the bank account attached to that company.In April 2009, Shakespeare disappeared.

Pruner said he was shot, killed and buried under a 30-by-30-foot concrete slab in the back of Moore's home.

Moore presented herself as a leggy blond in her social media profiles

Smith is expected to take the witness stand because he became a confidential informant and recorded numerous conversations and meetings with Moore — who told police various stories about her relationship with Shakespeare and his disappearance during several interviews.In January 2010, investigators searched Moore's property and found Shakespeare's decomposing body in Moore's backyard.Moore's attorney acknowledged that 'we certainly would agree that Ms. Moore had some knowledge that something happened,' and told a story about a meeting involving Shakespeare and a couple of guys at Moore's home.'The fact is that something happened,' said Hileman. 'Ms. Moore may have suspected something happened but she was not an eyewitness to details.'The trial is expected to last two weeks.
