It has generally been agreed that northern Africa underwent desertification about 3 million years ago, leading to the formation of the Sahara.

But now scientists at it may be twice as old as thought, with desertification starting around 7 million years ago.

Climate simulations suggest the shrinking of the Tethys Sea coupled with the uplift of the Arabian peninsula weakened the summer monsoon, forming the vast desert that exists today much longer ago than thought.

Research led by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway suggests the age of the Sahara desert (shown) is double previous estimates. Evidence had suggested that some dunes in Chad, part of the Sahara desert, were as much as 7 million years old

The research, published in Nature, was co-authored by Dr Zhongshi Zhang, a palaeoclimatologist at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway.

The evidence comes partially from dune deposits in northern Chad that were estimated to be seven million years old.

Other studies also found evidence for extended dry spells in the region starting eight million years ago.

The reason why this was so was not known, but now Dr Zhang says he may have an answer.

His team’s climate simulations suggest a gradual rearrangement of land masses in northern Africa.

The Sahara desert is one of the largest deserts in the world and covers more than 3.5 million square miles (9 million square km) - 10 per cent of the African continent.

It is bordered by the Red Sea in the east and the Atlantic Ocean in the west

The desert covers parts of several African nations including Algeria, Chad, Egypt and Sudan.

About a quarter of the desert is made of dunes, with some of them reaching more than 150 metres (500 ft) in height.

One permanent river runs through the Sahara today - the Nile.

One particular shift was thought to occur in the Tethys Sea that once bordered northern Africa.

The sea gradually shrunk around seven to 11 million years ago, and it’s thought this may have weakened the African summer monsoon.

The uplift of the Arabian peninsula was also thought to play a part.

The quelling of the monsoon would in turn have weakened westerly winds, shifting a flow of moisture from the tropical Atlantic further south.

This suggests the desertification, and ultimately the formation of the Sahara desert, may have formed earlier than thought.

‘Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations,’ the researchers write.

‘These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period.'

Climate simulations suggest the shrinking of a body of water called the Tethys Sea (shown) may have weakened the African summer monsoon. This led to the desertification of northern Africa earlier than thought. The Sahara desert is one of the world's largest deserts and covers about 10 per cent of the African continent
