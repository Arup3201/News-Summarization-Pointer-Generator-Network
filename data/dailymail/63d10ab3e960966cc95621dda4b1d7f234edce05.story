Catherine Eade says though she is happy in her own company she misses having a man to talk to

Her question was direct and accusing, catching me unawares over the breakfast table. I tried — and failed — not to look guilty. ‘Mum, who was that man at the door last night?’

Trying to secretly ‘date’ under the watchful eye of an 11-year-old mourning her father’s departure from the family home was proving impossible.

Caught in the twilight world of post-divorce heartache, I hoped for a new relationship at some point, but it didn’t feel right at that moment and it clearly wasn’t something my youngest daughter was comfortable with.

Coming up with a not-terribly-convincing tale about a problem with the car, I wondered if I’d ever negotiate this no-man’s land between raw, painful separation and the world of dating.

When my husband Mark moved out after our 16-year marriage broke down last year, I spent months in virtual lockdown, vowing never to go near a man again.

He’d moved in with his girlfriend just weeks after we split, a situation that our three children — Jasmine, 15, Joe, 13, and 11-year-old Alex — weren’t exactly keen on. The last thing I wanted was to rock the boat further by introducing a new man into their lives.

But I did miss having a partner. I just didn’t know if I’d ever be able to ease a man into this domestic tinderbox.

Please, before the howls of ‘you don’t need a man to be happy’ begin, yes, I know that. I have a caring family and an amazing group of female friends. I am happy in my own company and have been happi(ish)ly single for a year, but I miss having a man to talk to.

I love it when I get on as well with my friends’ partners as I do with my friends, and I have in the past had good male friends. But a few months after my husband left, I realised I had been almost solely in the company of women.

Men friends seemed to have faded into the background since my split from Mark, possibly because they felt obliged to take his ‘side’.

Catherine, 46, and her 'nearly' boyfriend Simon, 40, who have been supporting each other through the stresses of divorce

So when I met Simon, a 40-year-old IT consultant, at a music festival last summer, I thought I was ready to try again. There was an immediate mutual attraction, and after a couple of nights spent chatting until the small hours by the campfire outside my tent while my youngest, Alex, was asleep, we swapped phone numbers.

Like me, Simon had also come out of a marriage and was involved in divorce proceedings, with money worries and childcare issues complicating everyday life.

I discovered that he lived just around the corner from me in Brighton and we began spending time together, meeting up in the odd hours when I didn’t have my children and he didn’t have his seven-year-old son, Harry.

Simon was a very pleasant distraction from what was turning into an ever-more acrimonious divorce, but after a few weeks of ‘dating’ it became clear that neither of us was ready to leap into a serious relationship.

The huge emotional demands placed on people who are negotiating childcare arrangements with a difficult ex, and the wrangling over finances and property — not to mention disentanglement from such a key relationship — leaves little room for falling in love.

However, the strong bond that Simon and I had forged meant I was loath to write off our brief relationship as just a summer fling, and Simon insisted that he wanted me in his life, too.

‘What is going on with us?’ I asked him one evening as we sat outside on his balcony with a glass of wine.

Simon looked across at me and held my gaze. ‘When you really click with someone, it doesn’t have to mean sexually,’ he said. ‘I like you way too much to pursue something that might not last and would end in loss.’  

So we agreed on a compromise: Simon is to be my ‘almost’ boyfriend. I’m his ‘not quite’ girlfriend.

We are more than close friends, but not ready to make the leap into coupledom. We are a halfway house as we lick our wounds and learn to trust again.

Simon will turn up at my house with a bottle of wine and a hug when I’ve had a bad day. He will fix a household problem if I can’t. We play badminton, go on long walks, organise Sunday roasts for family and friends and even find ourselves in B&Q on a weekend afternoon: all the things couples do, but without being a couple.

And my children like Simon, as they know he is not my boyfriend (oh yes, the girls did ask) and so not a ‘replacement’ for their dad.

In fact, Alex enjoys having someone other than me to help with her IT homework when I’m at a loss.

Friends still can’t fathom it, though. ‘What’s the deal with Simon?’ one girlfriend asked me after we’d spent an entire weekend in and out of each other’s houses, eating together and taking the kids to the cinema. ‘We’re just friends,’ I said, laughing at the look of incredulity on her face.

In truth, both Simon and I were enjoying having someone in our lives to fill the hole left by the exit of our respective life partners.

While neither of us was ready for a new partner yet, because our circumstances were so similar we regularly turned to each other for support and advice.

One evening I was struggling to compose an email to Mark about childcare issues. Finding it hard to write something polite when I felt so sad and angry, I forwarded it to Simon for a second opinion.

Soon after, I received a text from him which read: ‘Needs work. Come here to discuss?’

Five minutes later I was drinking tea in his kitchen, sharing information I wouldn’t dream of telling anyone else — certainly not a new boyfriend. 

Simon had added at the start of my first draft: ‘Hi Mark, I hope you had a nice weekend’ — something I’m afraid I would have had to type through gritted teeth.

He also explained that, as a man, he would prefer to receive communications from an  ex-partner clearly stating what was being asked for, not littered with emotion or references to perceived failings.

I had to admit that his version garnered a much more reasonable reply from Mark.

In return, Simon showed me a couple of texts and emails from Emma, his ex, that he had found baffling and I — as a woman — was able to translate.

Then, of course, there are those ‘plus one’ invitations to occasions that no one likes to attend alone.

One weekend, the prospect of going to a friend’s wedding reception seemed too much,  and I asked Simon to be  my chaperone.

‘You don’t have to pretend to be my boyfriend, but it would be good if you could look adoringly at me every now and then,’ I joked.

Simon’s company that night gave me the confidence to attend. And he certainly rose to the task, which made a huge difference to my mood.

Two weeks later Simon asked me to accompany him in turn to a social event at his son’s school.

We had a whale of a time.

One of the saddest things about a break-up is the way that friends feel they have to ‘take sides’.

This was another reason why our ‘almost’ relationship felt so important: I was devastated to have lost some friends I’d known for years.

Simon had no ties to my past and was therefore all mine. He felt the same way, having also lost a group of friends who had dropped him in favour of his ex.

I can’t deny that I find Simon attractive and he says I am one of the loveliest people he’s met. But while we have on more than one occasion said those three little words to each other, we don’t fancy each other physically.

That’s not to say it didn’t enter my head a few times that we could be ‘a real couple’ — but not yet.

We’re simply not ready.

‘Why do you like being with me?’ I asked Simon once.

‘I enjoy talking to someone who understands what I’m going through and is supportive, who can shed light on the whole break-up scenario,’ he said. ‘You bring out the best in me.’

It is a boost to my self-esteem to spend time with Simon, and he feels the same way about me. We have the best of all worlds: we don’t argue, the kids never find us kissing or cuddling and freak out, and there is no pressure about our ‘future’.

Who knows, maybe we will end up together in 20 years’ time. But until then we’re perfectly happy being each other’s ‘nearly’.
