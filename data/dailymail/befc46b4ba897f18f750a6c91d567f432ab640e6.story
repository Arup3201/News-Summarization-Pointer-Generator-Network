Three teenagers killed when their car collided with the back of a lorry were seen ‘having a bit of a giggle’ together just moments before their deaths, an inquest heard today.

Jack Boyton, 17, of Enfield, north London, was driving to show his mother his new car when he was killed with friends Harry Ferrand, 17, also of Enfield, and Ashley Jones, 19, of Canvey Island, Essex.

All three were pronounced dead at the scene on the A10 in Hertfordshire last November after the crash in a Vauxhall Corsa, which had been bought just a few hours beforehand.

Liam Bradshaw, another 17-year-old boy from Enfield, survived the crash. Coroner Ed Thomas recorded a verdict of accidental death at Hatfield Coroner's Court in Hertfordshire.

Victim: Ashley Jones, 19, of Canvey Island, Essex, was also pronounced dead at the scene last year

He confirmed the victims died from dramatic head injuries after their car collided with the back of a lorry parked in a layby.

Mr Thomas added: 'For me to make suggestions would only be speculation. There was no braking. The vehicle went straight into the lorry.

'The lorry was legally parked there and very visible. There's nothing that I've heard that suggests that up to that point the driving was inappropriate.'

Addressing the victims' parents, he said: ‘They were all in the car together and you can imagine they were in the car and they were having a nice time. They were all young men who had a lot of promise. Nice young lads.'

Investigating officer Robert Wagstaff said there was no evidence the two rear passengers - Harry and Liam - were wearing seatbelts, while Jack and Mr Jones were found to be wearing their seatbelts. There was nothing inappropriate found in the teenagers' bloodstreams.

The driver of the Mercedes Sainsbury's lorry the car crashed into, as it sat parked in a layby while he had a 45 minute rest break, spoke today.

Addressing the victims' parents, Nigel Bennett fought back tears to say: ‘The emergency services were very professional. They couldn't have done anything more for your children.’

Mr Bennett described the moment the car crashed into the back of his lorry just as he was about to have a cup of coffee after eating his lunch.

‘There was a massive bang and the vehicle moved and slipped slightly off the tarmac,’ he said. ‘I've never experienced anything like it. It was like the suspension had collapsed.’

The accident happened at about 2.15pm on the northbound A10 between Turnford and Hoddesdon.

The last man to speak to the boys recalled how Jack had excitedly called in with him to show off his new car just before the crash.

Jack, who was just about to embark on a career as an estate agent, had worked for Daniel Moseley selling Christmas trees and fireworks and was described by his ex-boss as ‘polite, outgoing, bubbly’.

Mr Moseley said: ‘He said he'd come back tomorrow. He was going to meet his mum. When he left me he was going to show his mum his new car.’

He added that he told Jack to ‘drive carefully’ when he said goodbye.

Joanne Cole was driving behind the teenagers a short time before the crash and recalled how they appeared to be having a good time. ‘It was nice to see lads laughing and getting on,’ she said.

Ms Cole described the movements of the car as ‘normal driving’ and said she believed the driver was ‘concentrating on the road’. She added: ‘They were having a bit of a giggle.’

'They were all in the car together and you can imagine they were in the car and they were having a nice time. They were all young men who had a lot of promise. Nice young lads'

In a statement released by police after the inquest, Jack's mother Sarah and father Michael Boyton said: ‘How can I describe Jack, well my boy, my friend, my son?

‘Jack had a very caring nature and would always help someone that needed a hand. Jack passed his driving test a few weeks before the accident and as soon as he had it was his goal to get a car. He was so excited. Jack at this point was the happiest he could have been.’

Describing the moment she was told of the tragedy by police, Mrs Boyton said: ‘I remember being at home when Pc Sparkes came and told me what I didn't want to hear. Our boy, our baby, my little husband was dead.’

Vivian Fegan, mother of Mr Jones, said the last thing he said to her was ‘love you too’.

In her witness statement, she said: ‘At the end of every phone call I would always say “love you”. Depending on who Ash was with he'd say it back.

'Because I knew he was with his friends I said it again almost making him say it in front of his friends. Ash said “love you too” very quickly and quietly - that was the last thing he said to me.’
