Claim: Merseyside PCSO Pauline Harrison is suing a property firm after injuring herself while on duty

A police community support officer is seeking £5,000 compensation from a property firm after she injured her knee while investigating a burglary.

Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft high wooden fence.

The PCSO, who serves with Merseyside Police, said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport.

The case will reignite controversy over the millions of pounds in compensation claims – fuelled by no-win, no-fee lawyers – made by police who are injured on duty every year.

Last night Miss Harrison’s decision to sue was condemned by her own force.

The incident happened in 2009 when she was called to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind, owned by property development firm Lightflask Ltd.

Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds and the firm had secured the perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden 3ft fence closing off a gateway at the front  of the site.

In court papers, Miss Harrison alleges Lightflask Ltd was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’.

The former dog trainer also claims the company had failed to provide or make the wooden fencing safe, failed to properly warn the PCSO about the fencing, or erect warning signs.

Miss Harrison also says there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site.

She is claiming up to £5,000 in damages, which also includes £25 travelling expenses, £14 prescription charges and £102 physiotherapy costs.

Last night a spokesman for Lightflask Ltd said it was ‘concerning’ that the public could be sued by police officers and PCSOs going about their duties.

Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are:

WPC Fiona Clark sued for £400,000. She hurt her back lifting boxes of stationery.

WPC Kelly Jones demanded £50,000 from the owner of a petrol station where she tripped on the kerb during a call-out.

Detective
Inspector Brian Baker won a £7,000 payout after he claimed exposure to 
cannabis fumes made him snore and caused problems in his marriage.

WPC Louise McGarva sued for £500,000 after claiming she developed a fear of sirens following a riot-training exercise.

PC John Franklin won £108,000. He was injured by handcuffs on a safety course.

PC George Smillie was awarded an estimated £10,000 after he hurt his knee playing football on a training course.

WPC Lesley O’Shea sued for £200,000 after slipping on a banana skin.

‘I don’t think people expect to be sued by somebody working in the police who claims injury in the course of their duties,’ the spokesman said.

‘Surely the nature of the job carries inherent risks.

‘In this case the claimant is a community support officer. There must be a worry that these support officers may not be trained to the level of a regular officer.’

Chief Superintendent Nikki Holland, of Merseyside Police, said Miss Harrison’s decision to make a claim ‘is not a course of action that the force would encourage or support. However, this is a private matter for the individual and the force has no direct influence over private civil claims’.

Miss Harrison was unavailable for comment. Her solicitor, Jared Bailey, said it would not be appropriate to comment.

The case is due to before Liverpool County Court next month.

Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May criticised ‘frivolous’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘not the sort of attitude’ they should exhibit.

Her comments came after WPC Kelly Jones, 33, threatened to sue a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, after she tripped over a kerb while investigating a burglary. She later dropped her claim.
