A lot may have changed in the last century but it seems one thing hasn't - a woman's quest for eternal youth and the bizarre lengths she'll go to in order to look younger.

Today women will try vampire facials and dermarollers to banish wrinkles. But a book has revealed that in Edwardian times they had less sophisticated beauty methods but still believed in no pain, no gain.

In Health and Beauty Hints, a 1910 book by Margaret Mixter, recently unearthed on Archive.org, the author emphasises the importance of keeping skin firm and tightened, especially around the face and neck. She recommends vigorous self-massage and various oils and creams.

Massage was also recommended to reduce swollen eyelids, left, while tinting eyebrows and lashes was in fashion just like today

'It is a fact always to be remembered 
that the tendency of flesh on the face is to droop downward with age,' she writes. 'So
 all muscles and cords must be rubbed up, to prevent their stretching.'

A
 photo demonstrating how this is done shows a woman in an elaborately 
ruffled nightgown sitting in front of a sink, her palms rubbing against 
each cheek.

The caption reads: 'Face massage, showing upward stroke on cheek - must be hard'.

At
 night, Mixter recommends applying a mixture of almond oil, white wax, 
lanoline, elderflower water, witch hazel and spermaceti - a wax made 
from the head cavities of sperm whales.

Application
 is different depending on your face shape, however. 'Rub gently to 
increase the flesh and make the cheeks round,' she says.

Alternatively, 'If a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed, rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction.'

Not a modern idea: Women a century ago had their own form of dry shampoo

Another way to maintain clear skin, according to this 1910 beauty expert, was by embracing the elements.

'Even in extreme cases shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks'

'Walking in the rain, for persons who are not susceptible to cold, is an excellent tonic for the complexion,' she writes.

Surprisingly, modern celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood - whose clients have included Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Hudgens - told MailOnline that this advice 'wasn't that far off'.

'Today the closest thing would be to probably give your face a good steam!' she said.

When it comes to haircare, it appears women in the early 1900s were equally averse to over-washing - although the period they could tolerate between shampoos was significantly longer.

'Even in the extreme cases of exudation shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks,' Mixter advises.

Staying youthful: 'By the time a woman is twenty-five years old she should devote at least ten minutes, night and morning, to massaging her throat under the chin,' she writes

Excess grease, like today, was dealt with by using a sort of dry shampoo.

'Should the hair become heavy with grease during the intervening weeks much of it can be removed by sprinkling the locks thickly with fine corn meal,' she says.

The cornmeal is then 'brushed out after absorbing the dirt, with a long but soft-bristled brush.'

Mixter writes that being in the sun gives 'tone and vigor' to hair, 'and to dry one's hair in the sun after washing it is ideal'.

She takes it a step further when she writes just how essential sunshine is. 'So important do
 I regard this treatment that I consider it an error to wash the hair on
 a damp or cloudy day,' she writes.

And her views on brushing your hair before bed were apparently non-negotiable.

'I believe that it is impossible for a girl to have pretty hair, and I know that she cannot possess luxuriant tresses when an old woman, unless she brushes and combs her tresses before going to bed,' she asserts.

Unlikely method: 'If a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed, rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction'

In order to ensure a strong head of hair in old age, she advises 'at least twenty long strokes of the brush after all snarls have been removed with a comb'.

Physical exercise, she wrote, could be done to benefit both the complexion and the figure - a statement that still holds true to this day.

'Exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion'

But the manner in which women were advised to exercise - and the clothes in which they carried out these routines - are a true mark of the times.

'An excellent 
garment to wear when going through these movements is a light flannel 
dressing sacque that will give warmth without impeding the freedom of 
movement,' writes Mixter.

'I mention this article of wearing apparel because the 
exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion, 
and if one is not properly clad, the flesh might become chilled,' she explains

'Felt or
 woolen slippers must also be worn,' she adds, presumably to similarly avoid 'chilled flesh'.

Keep fit: Women were told to touch their toes to keep their waistline small... and do the housework

Nailcare: While some of the 'hints' are undoubtedly undated, others have held true to this day - like trimming cuticles when giving yourself a manicure

An activity she recommends for keeping fit and 'developing the figure' is housework, like sweeping, dusting and washing.

'Housework is excellent exercise for a girl who wishes to develop a round, pretty figure,' she says, 'for [it] helps to strengthen 
and beautify the body.'

She goes on to elucidate how a woman should hold back her shoulders and bend at the waist while carrying out household chores to get the most benefit out of it.
