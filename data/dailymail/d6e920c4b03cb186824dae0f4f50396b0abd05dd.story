Sometimes it's hard to believe the best things in life are free.

But the truth is exactly that, according to a poll which says crisp winter weather, a clean house and duvet days are the things which make us smile.

The survey asked 2,000 people in Britain about their favourite pleasures.

What a view! With scenes like this in the Lake District, it's no surprise our top pleasures include walks in the countryside. Others included cuddles, saying 'I love you', duvet days and sitting down in a clean house

At number one was having a cuddle with a partner - followed closely by clean sheets at number two.

Country walks and saying 'I love you' also made it into the top ten, though not everything was free. The top ten also included chocolate, booking a holiday, Christmas dinner and alcohol.

However, Nick Giles, managing director of Ordnance Survey Leisure which ran the poll, said the full list showed how simple pleasures are still the best.

'Our everyday lives are becoming so much more stressful and busier than ever before,' he added.

'Because of this, many of us appreciate things like reading a book or going for a stroll a lot more than we used to.

The good life: A cuddle with a partner came in at number one, followed by lazy days at home (posed by models)

Temptation: Despite having simple tastes we still can't resist a good cheese board, which hit number 17

'Some
80 per cent of those polled enjoy exploring the countryside, many 
preferring to do it on foot. Something as simple as a relaxing 
countryside walk can turn a bad day into a good one.'

The poll was commissioned by Ordnance 
Survey to launch its new range of custom-made maps, where ramblers can 
choose the area they want printed themselves. The maps start at Â£16.99.

Pleasures which can't be bought included kissing, snuggling under a blanket, hugging your baby and 'good photos'.

Receiving post and flowers also featured, as did a day at the beach.

Among the more costly items were edible treats - including cheese boards, chocolate, steak, pub roasts, picnics and cake.

And, of course, a list of pleasures would be nothing without payday - which clocked in at number 26.
