Two seven-year-old sisters are facing life as the only twins in Britain with one of the world’s rarest genetic disorders.

Hannah and Katie Beck suffer from Alstrom syndrome, a progressive condition that affects every organ in the body, and has just 60 known sufferers in the UK, and 800 worldwide.

Often the first symptoms of Alstron syndrome are eye problems which lead to, as in the little girls' case, early-onset blindness.

Hannah (left) and Katie (right) Beck suffer from Alstrom syndrome which means they are living on borrowed time and are unlikely to live beyond their 20s. There are only 60 known sufferers in the UK

Hannah and Katie, who were diagnosed when they were four, are also slowly losing their hearing.

The girls have to wear dark glasses throughout the day because their eyes are intensely sensitive to light and they are being trained to use white canes and Braille.

They both attend a mainstream primary school where they get special one-to-one teaching to help them live as normally as possible.

Their parents Julie, 41, and Ian, 44, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, both carry the Alstrom syndrome gene but are unaffected themselves.

Alstrom syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited genetic disorder.

The first symptoms it causes are eye and heart problems - including heart failure and an intense dislike of bright light.

Hannah and Katie (pictured with their mother, Julie), were diagnosed when they were four-years-old and are slowly losing their sight and their hearing

Most children with the condition eventually end up with severe sight loss.

The condition also causes sufferers to gain weight quickly, even if they have a healthy diet.

A large percentage of children with the condition also develop type two diabetes.

Children with Alstrom syndrome tend to develop hearing problems and often become incontinent.

The condition can also cause problems with the liver, kidneys and bowel.

Mr and Mrs Beck are determined to give their daughters as full a life as they can before they lose their sight completely.

Mrs Beck said: ‘We’ve been trying to do things while the girls can still see them.

‘We took them on their first holiday abroad to Lanzarote in February and Hannah particularly loved it and begged to go back again so we’re going back next year.

Sufferers do not tend to live beyond their 20s.

‘Katie is just into princesses, she loves all the Disney princesses, so we want to take them to Disneyland.

‘Katie loves singing and has loads of confidence, while Hannah is really quiet and a lot more shy.

‘But really they are just two normal, seven-year-old girls who love horse riding and swimming, which is great for their posture and will benefit them greatly.

‘They’re mad about playing with dolls and love school, and the other pupils have really taken to them and treat them just like everyone else.’

She added: ‘They are doing so well and they are so strong willed. I’m proud of their determination and their wish to be independent.

‘They also have a fantastic bond, like all twins really, but I think they have a bit of a sixth sense about when the other really needs them.

‘Ultimately they really lean on each other and spur each other on, and I’m glad they have each other for that support.’

Mrs Beck, a primary school teacher, told how experts had struggled to identify what the girls were suffering from.

They saw numerous experts including a paediatrician, a dietician, eye doctors, a special educational needs coordinator and speech therapist before being referred to a geneticist.

She said: ‘We went along and the expert mentioned Alstrom briefly which we had never heard of.

Mr and Mrs Beck say that they are determined to give their daughters as full a life as they can before they lose their sight completely - they have just taken them on their first foreign holiday

‘But as soon as we got home, we looked it up online as most parents would do and we wish we hadn’t as our world fell apart.

‘We were utterly devastated. We read it is incurable and children with it don’t have a long life. It is a very complex condition which affects every organ in the body.

‘We looked at the list of symptoms the girls had and they ticked most of the criteria between them.

‘We didn’t really need the genetic test as we knew in our hearts that they had it.

‘We got the call back for Hannah’s positive result for Alstrom three days before Christmas that year.

‘We
were hoping and praying it wasn’t going to be a positive result for 
Katie, but just three weeks later, our worst fears hit us hard.

Mrs Beck said: 'We were utterly devastated. We read it is incurable and children with it don't have a long life. It is a very complex condition which affects every organ in the body'

‘Every parent’s worst nightmare is for 
their children to be poorly and Alstrom is totally out of our control, 
with no cure at present.’

The family say they have received life changing support from Alstrom Syndrome UK (ASUK) which will receive a grant this year from Genetic Disorders UK to fund an information DVD entitled Living with Alstrom Syndrome.

'This DVD is so important as it will be sent out to doctors to raise awareness of Alstrom,' said Mrs Beck who is also a trustee of the charity ASUK which is attempting to raise £1m for research into the condition.

'It is so rare that doctors just don’t know about Alstrom. We hope the DVD will lead to better understanding of the condition and quicker diagnosis.

'The charity also organises fun days and events so that the girls get to meet children with the same condition which is very helpful.

'They know what they’ve got but they don't realise the true extent of it. They know they are special.'

A charity close to the girls, Jeans for Genes, raises money for Genetic Disorders UK and aims to change the world for children with genetic disorders.

'Its annual fundraising event takes place on September 20 when work colleagues across the country are encouraged to wear jeans in return for a donation to Genetic Disorders UK.
