Police investigating the murder-suicide that left four dead in a wealthy suburb are looking at whether the New Year's Day shooting could have been motivated by jealousy.

John Robert Reeves, 25, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head after murdering three others with him - fellow Navy pilot David Reis, 25, his sister Karen Reis, 24, and Matthew Saturley, 31.

The four dead were found in Coronado, California, after authorities responded to a report of gunfire shortly after 2am on Sunday.

Officials say they do not know the motive for the killing, but are investigating the possibility that Reeves had romantic feelings for, or a relationship with, Ms Reis.

Alleged killer: Police are investigating the suggestion that John Robert Reeves was motivated by jealousy

'We are looking into all aspects, including the possibility there was 
some type of relationship between Karen Reis and John Reeves but that 
has not been confirmed yet,' said sheriff's captain Duncan Fraser.

'That is one reason why we are
still soliciting information from the public who may know about this.'

Authorities are also awaiting toxicology results to see if drugs or alcohol might have played a role.

Mr Fraser cautioned that investigators might never determine the motive 
because there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting.

He said the suggestion that Reeves was jealous of the attention being paid to Ms Reis by Mr Saturley was only speculation.

A passerby called police on his mobile phone after hearing shots being fired at this address in Coronado in San Diego Bay at 2.20am.

Retired Naval pilot Steve Diamond said the case was shocking because it involved such high achievers.

'The first thing that most people think of even within the Navy community is how could such an enormously tragic thing happen involving people who are the cream of the crop, highly trained, highly educated, national assets basically,' he said.

It takes years of training to get one's wings as a Navy pilot, and fighter-jet pilots are considered to be among the top in that group.

They undergo a battery of rigorous physical, psychological and background tests before finishing the highly competitive program. Their top-notch skills and mental toughness were featured in the film Top Gun.

'It's still a shocker,' said Rebecca 
Bailey, 26, who played college volleyball with Karen and later coached 
with her at a high school and club programme.

'This kind of thing doesn't 
happen to people like her and David. Their family is the family 
everybody wants to be a part of. They're just so loving, and there's so 
much love in their family.'

Confirmed dead: Tom Reis said on Monday that his son David, left, and daughter Karen, right, were confirmed as victims by the Navy

The siblings' father Tom Reis
didn't know who else was at the condo in the seaside community where 
his son had been living. 'He just had his first F/A-18 flight,' Mr Reis 
said. 'Oh man, he loved it.'

David Reis held a mechanical 
engineering degree from the University of New Mexico. Karen Reis 
graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2009.

She
stayed in the area, coaching volleyball and working at a grocery store. 
'She has a really great spirit and knows how to make things fun,' Ms 
Bailey said.

A passer-by called police on his 
mobile phone after hearing shots being fired outside the San Diego Bay 
condo in Coronado, California, at 2.20am on Sunday morning.

The first officers arrived within 
four minutes and found a dead man in the doorway to the three-story 
condo and the bodies of two men and a woman inside in different parts of
the structure.

the sidewalk'

'They checked and he had no 
obvious signs of life,’ Sheriff's Lieutenant Larry Nesbit said. ‘They 
tried to make contact with anyone else that might be inside the building
and they got no response.’

A SWAT team then sent in a robot 
to the first floor and later searched the second and third floors. The 
bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the 
three-storey building.

It was not immediately clear how 
the four people died. However, authorities previously said they did not 
believe there were any outstanding suspects.

Asked if it was a murder-suicide, 
he said: 'I'll let it infer what it does. We're not going to say that. 
Although it's very early in the investigation, we don't believe there 
are any outstanding suspects.'

Neighbour Don Hubbard said he was 
awakened by the shots that he thought were fired by New Year's revellers.
He went back to sleep, but two hours later got a phone call and heard 
SWAT teams swarming the area.

Hubbard, a retired Navy commander,
said he saw the body of one man in the condo doorway and recognized him
as his neighbour — a Navy pilot receiving training at Miramar.

'The amount of crime happening in Coronado is absolutely unacceptable. This is supposed to be a quaint little village where people come to sleep, not to party'

Jerry Toci

'I knew these guys were pilots 
because I was one and we'd talk about airplanes,' Hubbard said. 'Even 
now, you say, how could this have happened? What the hell is going on 
here?'

Officers from the Naval Criminal 
Investigative Service (NCIS) were called to the scene of Sunday's 
shootings in case any of the victims were military personnel.

Mr Hubbard confirmed two victims were Navy pilots training at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

NCIS is the federal law 
enforcement agency which conducts investigations of offences - 
punishable by imprisonment of more than a year - affecting the Navy and 
Marine Corps.

NCIS spokesman Ed Buice said its investigators were participating in the probe, which was being led by the Sheriff's Department.

‘This is very shocking,’ neighbour
Julie Lisne told 10 News. ‘We think we live in such a safe little town -
so it's always shocking and sad.’

Coronado, where 24,000 people 
live, is home to Naval Air Station North Island where several aircraft 
carriers are based and is a haven for Navy pensioners. Murders are 
extremely rare in the area.

However in July last year the area
made national headlines when the naked girlfriend of a millionaire was 
found hanged in his Coronado mansion.

The Coronado area was rocked last year by an apparent suicide at a millionaire’s mansion when his lover allegedly hanged herself.

Rebecca Zahau, 32, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, in July, two days after his son Max, 6, was fatally hurt from a fall off the stairs while she was looking after him.

Her family believed she did not commit suicide but police were not convinced to reopen the case following the results of a second autopsy that was discussed on the TV show Dr Phil.

Police sources said Rebecca Zahau,
32, killed herself two days after her boyfriend's six-year-old son was 
fatally injured while in her care (see box).

‘This is Coronado, for heaven’s 
sake,’ local man and retired naval officer Don Hubbard, 85, told Sign On
San Diego. ‘The biggest thing that happens here is a kid rides his bike
on the sidewalk.’

The condo where the bodies were 
found sits a few blocks from the famed Hotel del Coronado and a block 
from the main street, which is lined with boutiques and restaurants.

Eleven U.S. presidents have 
visited the hotel beginning with Benjamin Harrison in 1891 - just three 
years after the beachfront resort was built.

In 1920 the Prince of Wales, later
to become King Edward VIII, visited and it has long been speculated 
that it was at the hotel that he first met Coronada divorcee Wallis 
Spencer Simpson. It was 16 years later that he gave up the throne to 
marry her.

The hotel is also where a banquet 
was hosted to honour aviator Charles Lindbergh after he crossed the 
Atlantic in the 'Spirit of St Louis'. A replica of the plane circled the
hotel's Crown Room ceiling during the dinner, according to the hotel 
website.
