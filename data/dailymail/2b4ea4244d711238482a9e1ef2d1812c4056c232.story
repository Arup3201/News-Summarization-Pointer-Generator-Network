Worrying new study: Coleen Boyle, Director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC in Atlanta

Rates of autism in the United States rocketed by nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2010 and have more than doubled since the beginning of the century, according to a worrying new study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

The condition now affects 1 in 68 U.S. children - which in effect means that every grade in every elementary school in the country has an autistic child - which is an astonishing rise in numbers for a condition that was unheard of 25-years ago.

The study does not explain why the numbers have so dramatically risen, but much  of the increase is believed to be from a cultural and medical shift, with doctors diagnosing autism more frequently, especially in children with milder cases of the condition.

'We don't know the extent those factors explain in terms of the increase, but we clearly know they do play a role,' said Coleen Boyle, director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC to USA Today.

'Our system tells us what's going on. It only gives us clues as to the why.'

Experts have also made a link between parents who have children later on in life.

However, Robert Ring, the chief science officer for Autism Speaks said that he believes the problem needs to be confronted and that something in the environment may be causing the problem.

The latest report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looks at data from 2010, estimates that 14.7 per 1,000 8-year-olds in 11 U.S. communities have autism. That compares with the prior estimate of 1 in 88 children, or 11.3 of 1,000 8-year-olds, in 2008, and 1 in 150 children in 2000

Other experts told USA Today that they were not surprised at all by the increase and said that numbers were only set to rise.

They pointed out that in New Jersey, autism rates were 50 percent higher than the rest of the nation in 2000 and were still much higher in 2010.

This suggests that national rates will only catch up to those in New Jersey.

'We can't dismiss the numbers. But we can't interpret it to mean more people are getting the disorder,' said Marisela Huerta, a psychologist at the New York-Presbyterian Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in suburban White Plains, N.Y.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest estimate Thursday. The Atlanta-based agency said its calculation means autism affects roughly 1.2 million Americans under 21. Two years ago, the CDC put the estimate at 1 in 88 children, or about 1 million.

The cause or causes of autism are still not known. Without any blood test or other medical tests for autism, diagnosis is not an exact science. It's identified by making judgments about a child's behavior.

Autism encompasses a spectrum of disorders, ranging from a profound inability to communicate and mental retardation to relatively mild symptoms in people with very high intellectual ability

A child diagnosed on the autism spectrium must show deficits in three distinct areas: communications, social skills and typical behavior.

Roughly one-third of children in the CDC study also showed intellectual problems, but the other two-thirds showed above-average intelligence.

Thursday's report is considered the most comprehensive on the frequency of autism. Researchers gathered data in 2010 from areas in 11 states — Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.

The report focused on 8-year-olds because most autism is diagnosed by that age. The researchers checked health and school records to see which children met the criteria for autism, even if they hadn't been formally diagnosed.

Then, the researchers calculated how common autism was in each place and overall.

The CDC started using this method in 2007 when it came up with an estimate of 1 in 150 children. Two years later, it went to 1 in 110. In 2012, it went to 1 in 88.

Last year, the CDC released results of a less reliable calculation — from a survey of parents — which suggested as many as 1 in 50 children have autism.

Experts aren't surprised by the growing numbers, and some say all it reflects is that doctors, teachers and parents are increasingly likely to say a child with learning and behavior problems is autistic.

Some CDC experts say screening and diagnosis are clearly major drivers, but that they can't rule out some actual increase as well.

'We cannot say what portion is from better diagnosis and improved understanding versus if there's a real change,' said Coleen Boyle, the CDC official overseeing research into children's developmental disabilities.

For decades, autism meant kids with severe language, intellectual and social impairments and unusual, repetitious behaviors.

But the definition has gradually expanded and now includes milder, related conditions.

The study showed significantly different autism rates by region, ranging from 1 in 175 children in Alabama to 1 in 45 children in New Jersey, which could reflect access to healthcare and other factors

One sign of that: In the latest study, almost half of autistic kids had average or above average IQs.

That's up from a third a decade ago and can be taken as an indication that the autism label is more commonly given to higher-functioning children, CDC officials acknowledged.

Aside from that, much in the latest CDC report echoes earlier findings. Autism and related disorders continue to be diagnosed far more often in boys than girls, and in whites than blacks or Hispanics.

The racial and ethnic differences probably reflects white communities' greater focus on looking for autism and white parents' access to doctors, because there's no biological reason to believe whites get autism more than other people, CDC officials said at a press briefing Thursday.

One change CDC officials had hoped to see, but didn't, was a drop in the age of diagnosis. Experts say a diagnosis can now be made at age 2 or even earlier. But the new report said the majority of children continue to be diagnosed after they turn 4.

'We know the earlier a child is identified and connected with services, the better,' Boyle said.

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement Thursday, saying the nation needs to step up screening for the condition and research into autism's causes.

'It's critical that we as a society do not become numb to these numbers,' said Dr. Susan Hyman, head of the group's autism subcommittee.
