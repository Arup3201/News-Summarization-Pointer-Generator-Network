Dozens of pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a New Zealand beach - but rescuers did manage to save another 22 of the animals. 

The whales came ashore at Ohiwa Harbour in the Bay of Plenty, prompting a major rescue effort involving volunteers and the local Maori community.

The Department of Conservation said 25 of the whales died and 11 had to be euthanized. But the rescuers successfully released a group of 22, which swam out of the harbor to deeper water.

Wildlife conservationists from non-profit organization Project Jonah co-ordinated efforts to shepherd the whales through the channel and out to the ocean.

The group wrote on its Facebook page: 'We did it! All 22 whales were shepherded through the mouth of the harbour to the ocean and were last seen heading towards deeper water. 

'A tremendous effort from all those involved and a reminder of how important community can be. A huge thank you to our medics who answered the call.'

Mass pilot whale strandings are common in New Zealand, but scientists unclear about why the marine mammals swim ashore in large groups.

The short-finned pilot whale is known for its close-knit social groups. One theory is that if one whale gets stuck or stays behind, the others are likely to stay or even beach themselves as well.

The species get their name from the fact that it is thought that each pod follows a 'pilot' in the group.

Daren Grover, general manager of Project Jonah told the BBC that the rates of whales stranded in New Zealand are higher than anywhere in the world.

'It's something we have lived with and we are quite geared up to respond to,' he said. 'Today was a great effort - all those that were alive were refloated.'

Pilots are among the smaller of the whale species, with adult males reaching up to 18 feet in length and females 12 feet. The species is also the one most frequently involved in mass strandings.
