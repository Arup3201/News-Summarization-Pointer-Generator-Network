The alleged victim of a racist attack by the father of Chelsea captain John Terry denies making up the abuse so he could sell it to the papers, the Old Bailey has heard.

Ted Terry, 59, is accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette.

Mr Talafair, who works in customer service for train operator C2C, went to police after recognising his attacker from a photograph on the internet, the court heard.

Trial: Amarjit Talafair has accused the father of John Terry, Ted (right), of racist abuse and of headbutting him

He admitted he knew about the allegations John Terry racially abused another player during a football match but denied suggestions he only went to police because of Ted Terry’s celebrity status.

Ted Terry’s barrister, Alexia Power, said: ‘You only chose to go to police when you found out that Mr Terry was a celebrity, the father of a footballer.’

Mr Talafair replied: ‘That doesn’t bother me at all. If someone was assaulting, racially abusing me I would have gone to police anyway.’

He admitted he asked police once about going to the newspapers with the story but was advised it would ruin the investigation.

Miss Power said: ‘That’s what this is all about, isn’t it?’

Accused: The court heard that Mr Talafair made up the abuse to try and sell his story to the papers

Mr Talafair replied: ‘No it’s not. He racially abused me and I don’t want him to get away with it.’

Miss Power continued: ‘You embellished what happened with racist abuse purely because of who Mr Terry is. You want to sell your story.’

Terry is standing trial for the racist attack at the Old Bailey alongside his friends Tudor Musteata, a 47-year-old Moldovan, and Stephen Niland, 36.

Mr Talafair claimed the attack started when he refused to give Ted Terry a cigarette outside the Windsor Pub near Fenchurch Street station in central London on 22 March last year.

He told jurors: 'They put on a fake 
Eastern European accent and said "Can I have a cigarette." I said no I 
don’t have any cigarettes. They got aggressive, started swearing at us 
and they started racially abusing me.

'They started saying “f****** p*****”, then “f****** c****”, then after that they got racial and were calling me “f****** P***”.'

Mr Talafair said he walked off with a friend towards New London House but were followed by the three men.

'As the third male [Ted Terry] walked past me he said something to me, took two or three steps twoards me and tried to headbutt me. He put his head towards me but I moved my head back.'

Miss Power suggested that Terry ‘put his forehead to your mouth, stopping you shouting’.

Mr Talafair replied: ‘No, if I wasn’t able to move back he probably would have broken my nose or something.’

Terry denies using racist language during the confrontation.

Jurors have heard Terry also racially abused a black cleaner at Fenchurch Street station, calling him a ‘black c***’.

Terry denies racially aggravated common assault and racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence. Niland and Musteata deny racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

The trial continues.
