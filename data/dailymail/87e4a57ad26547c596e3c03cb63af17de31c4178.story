Riann Manser and his girlfriend, Vasti Geldenhuys, reached Miami Wednesday in their small, but high-tech rowboat, bringing an end to a trip that began in late December in Morocco.

Manser told CBS News that he and Geldenhous collectively took about a million strokes to make the journey across the Atlantic Ocean. And the voyage wasn't always smooth, as in February, the boat capsized, trapping Geldenhuys underneath it for a short time.

The 105-day, 5,000-mile journey started on Dec. 30, 2013 in Morocco and ended Wednesday in Miami

'You have to be willing to give everything, and that even includes your life,' Manser said.

'After the first day of rowing, I collapsed in that cabin, and I thought, I can't do this. This is too tough,' Geldenhuys said.

As to why the couple made the arduous journey, they say it was a desire to visit New York City. And after a few days of rest in Miami, they will set off again for the Big Apple before returning to South Africa.

The couple set sail on Dec. 30, 2013 from Agadir, Morocco aboard the 'Spirit of Madiba,' a 23-foot-long boat named after the late former South African President Nelson Mandela. They had no support boats accompanying them. Three weeks later, they reached the Canary Islands.

After that, it was two and half months of open water until they reached the Bahamas.

'You get this quiet time, and the sun is setting, and there's like pink and blue and white fluffy clouds, and it's just so quiet,' Geldenhuys said.

Just before the couple reached Miami, they embraced with a hug and a kiss.

'If Vasti wasn't with me, I wouldn't have been able to have this moment,' Manser said.

And the couple said they are looking forward to their first regular meal in more than 100 days. 'A big hamburger with bacon, cheese and anything else that can go on it and a beer and Coke Zero,' Geldenhuys said.
