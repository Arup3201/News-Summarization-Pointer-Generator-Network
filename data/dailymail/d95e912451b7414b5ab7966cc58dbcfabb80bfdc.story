Sickening: Mother of three Emma Bent, 36, dumped bodies of pets in bin bags and set fire to animal corpses at her home in Heage

A mother who burned the bodies of pets in fields and left their bodies to rot in bin bags has been fined just £3,000.

Emma Bent, 36, made £90,000 by setting up a 'pet crematorium' where she promised owners tasteful funerals for their beloved animals.

Those who were duped by her scam, which she ran from her home in Heage, Derbyshire, were outraged that she 'got off lightly' for the illegal disposal of 2,800 animals.

Bent served only seven weeks of her 
eight-month sentence after pleading guilty to 23 charges in February.

The charges included seven counts of 
fraud and 16 others relating to her business Peak Pet Cremations.

These included operating an illegal incinerator and disposal of 
animal by-products.

Bent's operation was only discovered when a dog walker came across the bodies of four dogs in a ditch.

Police traced owners from microchips implanted in the animals and realised they had all used Bent's service.

The bodies of four cats, a guinea pig, rabbit, chicken and badger were found in sacks in Bent's shed, as well as the charred remains of three cats and five dogs.

At Derby Crown Court, a judge ruled she was to pay £3,100 despite the prosecution alleging Bent made £88,202.23 from her business.

Callous: Two of the dogs that Emma Bent disposed of illegally after promising owners a 'respectful' funeral

Linda Allen's collie Bourneville was found decomposed in a Derbyshire field in August 2009 after supposedly being cremated by Bent.

She said: 'She's got off lightly. There were so many people she hurt. She's starting a new life now - it just doesn't seem fair.

'It's not enough. After all, she was sentenced to eight months but she only did seven weeks. We were furious when we found out.

'Our pets were not just animals, they were part of our families. We treated them with respect when they were alive so their bodies should have been treated with respect as well.'

Thrown away: Tyson the dog was much loved by her owners and was dumped by Bent who ran a 'pet crematorium'

Bent, a mother of three, also conned pet owners by telling them their animals had been cremated when in fact she was handing over jars of ashes from a bonfire.

Nicholas Cole, prosecuting, said Bent made £88,202.23 from her business.

However Judge Ebraham Mooney said Bent only needed to pay back £3,100 as that was the value of her assets.

The remains of Barbara Lambert's 17-year-old terrier, Nip, were found rotting in a shed in a field rented by Bent.

Disgusted: Some of the pet owners who were scammed by Emma Bent attended Derby Crown Court to see her sentenced

Mrs Lambert, from Ilkeston, said she was 'gobsmacked' by Bent's actions.

She said: 'I can't believe it, although I'm pleased they tried to get money off her because she shouldn't benefit from what she's done.

'It's nearly two years since we lost our Nip but this is still going on and I'm gutted. It's an insult to us all. She's got away with so much.

'She did something that none of us would ever dream of doing, yet she's got away with it so lightly.'

The Crown Prosecution Service would not comment any further on the decision.

A spokesman said: 'We can't comment on any details which did not come out in court. The court's decision is based on a valuation of the person's assets.'
