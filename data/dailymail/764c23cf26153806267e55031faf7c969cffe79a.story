Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis has called for a repeat of the Budapest blueprint when his side take on Greece.

Davis and company kicked off their Euro 2016 campaign with a impressive 2-1 win in Hungary, coming from behind with a pair of late goals to take the points.

A straightforward home success over the Faroe Islands followed at the weekend but that hardly required the levels of intensity needed in that opening fixture.

Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis is aiming to replicate the win over Hungary, facing Greece on Tuesday 

And the experience of seeing off higher-ranked opponents on their own turf is driving Davis as he eyes another prize scalp in Athens.

'All the away games will be difficult for us but we put in a great performance in Hungary and we deservedly won the game,' he said.

'That's the blueprint we're going to work off when we play Greece. That's the standard we have to reach in every game we play in this group.

'It will be no easy task but as a group we need to be at the top of our game every time to get results and that will be the case again.

Davis, in action on Saturday, is keen for Northern Ireland to copy the form shown so far in Euro 2016 qualifying

'We realise it's going to be very difficult but we're confident - after our opening two qualifiers - we can get a result.'

Greece reached the 2014 World Cup by maximising their return for every goal.

They scored just 12 times in 10 qualifiers, but a stingy defence saw those goals converted into 25 points and they sealed second place behind Bosnia-Herzegovina.

A defeat by Romania and a draw in Finland suggest the model is not yet as finely tuned under Claudio Ranieri as it was for his predecessor Fernando Santos, but Davis hopes for a typically close game.

GREECE (prob, 4-4-2): Karnezis; Torosidis, Vyntra, Papastathopoulos, Manolas; Maniatis, Tachtsidis, Samaris, Karelis; Mitroglou, Athanasiadis.

NORTHERN IRELAND (prob, 4-5-1): Carroll; McLaughlin, McAuley, Hughes, Ferguson; Baird, Ward, Davis, Norwood, Evans; Lafferty.

REFEREE: Stephane Lannoy (Fr).

TV: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 7.30pm (kick-off 7.45).

'Looking at the past results before this game they tend to win or lose by the odd goal,' he said.

'We are aware of individual players that they have, but I think their strength is the team. Having seen the game against Finland they are going to be a threat.

'Hopefully it will be tightly contested again and we can keep them at bay and create some chances ourselves. There are always very fine lines to get results in football matches.'
