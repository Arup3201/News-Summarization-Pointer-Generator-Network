A giant trench is being built on Iraq’s border with Syria to prevent militants and smugglers passing into the country.

The trench, the work of the Kurdistan Regional Government, is thought to be 11 miles (17 kilometres) long, two yards deep and three yards wide.

It has been reported that smugglers have started to operate in the border areas as they became insecure with Syrian authorities losing control of them.

The trench is on the northern Iraqi border near to Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region.

Kurdistan has largely managed to insulate itself against the violence afflicting Syria and the rest of Iraq.

But the digging of the ditch has proved controversial with some political parties, who have described it as unnecessary.
