A Washington state woman who was a victim of a serial sex offender is suing police after they allegedly discounted her story, ignored evidence proving she was raped and then slapped her with a $500 fine for making a false statement.

The woman, identified only as D.M. in court documents, was gagged, bound and sexually assaulted at knife-point in her Lynnwood apartment by an intruder five years ago.

Then 18, she reported the attack but she says detectives Jerry Rittgarn and Sergeant Jeff Mason didn't believe her story, and ignored evidence including stained sheets, doctors reports detailing injuries to her wrists and abrasions on her genitals and DNA samples.

She says the officers bullied her for hours, without a lawyer present, into recanting her account and, when she later tried to insist the rape did take place, she was charged $500 for false reporting.

According to the Seattle Times, two-and-a-half years later Lynnwood police reopened the investigation, after Marc O'Leary, a man wanted for a string of sex attacks in Washington state and Colorado, was found to have D.M.'s photograph and ID card in his wallet.

She describes in the law suit the man, wielding a kitchen knife, warned her that he had taken photos of her and knew her name as he fled the apartment.

O'Leary was convicted of five rapes, including the Lynnwood one, and is serving a 327-year sentence in a Colorado prison.

Last week, D.M. filed a federal civil 
rights suit against the city of Lynnwood, Rittgarn, Mason and Lynnwood 
Police Chief Steven Jensen.

In
it she claims the detectives ignored 
her account of events and bullied her into saying the rape never 
happened.

She also accuses them of threatening to 
have her thrown out of her apartment, owned by an at-risk youth home 
called Cocoon House, when she insisted it did take place.

After the attack, she says she was forced to stand up in front of a group of teens at a Cocoon House-run program and confess that she'd lied about the rape, something which resulted in her having to see a councilor.

The facility and two of its employees are also named in the lawsuit.

Cocoon House CEO Cassie Franklin told the Seattle Times this week: 'Our hearts go out to D.M. and her family ... We strongly believe that Cocoon House and its employees acted appropriately on behalf of the client.'

Jensen refused to comment to the newspaper because of the litigation and Rittgarn, who has since left the Lynnwood Police Department and now lives in San Diego, said he was unaware of the lawsuit and couldn't remember the case. Mason is still with the Lynnwood Police Department.

The victim, who now lives in Wyoming, and her lawyer also declined to comment to the Seattle Times.
