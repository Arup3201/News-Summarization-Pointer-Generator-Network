Monica Lewinsky has spoken out about becoming 'the most humiliated woman in the world' when salacious details of her affair with then-President Bill Clinton emerged.

As part of her return to the spotlight, Lewinsky shared details in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?', which will air starting next Sunday.

On Tuesday, the Today show gave a first 
glimpse at the three-part special, in which Lewinsky, now 40, opens 
up about the day a 445-page report by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was published.

'That was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated woman in the world.

Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky will appear in a special NatGeo documentary detailing how her world was turned upside down when details of her affair with Bill Clinton emerged in the 90s

'To have my narrative ripped from me, and turned into the Starr report, and things that were turned over or things they delved out of my computer that I thought were deleted. I mean it was just violation after violation.'

Lewinsky, who was 22 when she first began her affair with the president, said she was also left devastated by the media coverage.

'To be called stupid, and a slut, and a bimbo, and ditzy, and to be taken out of context, it was excruciating,' she said.

'To be in the vortex of this media maelstrom was quite alarming, and frightening. And confusing. I think a lot, too, had to do with the fact that I was a woman.'

Stepping out: Lewinsky attended the Marie Curie Timeless Party at the Royal Hospital in London on Monday

Lewinksy's
 interview, which also shares her suicidal thoughts and whether or not 
she feels she deserves an apology from Clinton, will air on Monday.

Her re-emergence into the spotlight comes after 10 years of self-imposed exile.

The
 former White House intern made her intentions known with a revealing 
article in May's issue of Vanity Fair, in which she made her desire to 
move beyond her affair with President Clinton clear.

'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she wrote in the Vanity Fair
 story. 'I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President
 Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. 
Happened.'

And
 on Monday night, Lewinsky cut a stylish figure as she stepped out at 
the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in 
London.

Sitting pretty: Lewinsky, pictured at the event on Monday, has said she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile nearly two decades since the scandal

She mingled with stars such as Clive Owen, Yasmin Le Bon and Princess Beatrice at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity,  which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer.

The timing of Lewinsky's decision to return to the spotlight coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up.

Lewinsky says that after laying low when Hillary ran for office in 2008, she's unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 years. 

'I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past - and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.'

Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures

Hillary Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same.

The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated her husband's presidency.

In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.'

However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue.

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP
 presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on
 women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president 
engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when 
her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995.

Hillary Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public.

Lewinsky says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media.

'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote.

'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.
