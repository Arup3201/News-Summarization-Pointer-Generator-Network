Joseph Kennedy III last night won his bid for a congressional seat in Massachusetts, returning the Kennedy dynasty to Washington after an absence of 22 months.

At least one Kennedy served in the House, Senate or White House for 64 years until Congressman Patrick Kennedy retired in January 2011.

Mr Kennedy, 32, easily won the Massachusetts congressional seat being vacated by the retiring fellow Democrat Barney Frank.

John F Kennedy (1917-1963)
- Known as 'JFK', and to his family as 'Jack', he entered politics as a
U.S. Representative in 1947. In 1953, he came a Senator for 
Massachusetts and was elected as President in 1960. He was assassinated 
in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.

Robert Kennedy (1926-1968) - JFK's brother was known as 'Bob', 'Bobby' and 'RFK'. He was U.S. Attorney General from 1961 to 1964 while his brother was president and was then a Senator from 1965 onwards. He was shot dead at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1968 while campaigning to become president.

Edward Kennedy (1932-2009) - Another brother, 'Ted' Kennedy was a Senator for Massachusetts from 1962 to 2009. He died of brain cancer in August 2009.

Mark Kennedy Shriver (born 1964) –  Another democrat, he served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for two consecutive terms, from 1995 to 2003.

Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (born 1951) – She was the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003. An attorney, she ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Maryland in 2002.

Joseph Kennedy II (born 1952) – He served as a member of the House of Representatives from the 8th congressional district of Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999.

Patrick Kennedy II (born 1967)  - The son of Ted kennedy, Patrick was the Representative for Rhode Island's 1st congressional district, serving from 1995 until 2011.

Joseph Kennedy III (born 1980) – The son of Joseph Kennedy III, he was elected to congress for Massachusetts's 4th congressional district on Tuesday.

He was virtually assured of victory 
over Republican Sean Bielat after he defeated two lesser-known 
Democratic Party rivals in the September primary. The district is 
solidly Democratic and last elected a Republican in 1944.

Mr Kennedy said: 'We each want the 
chance, the opportunity to make the most of what we've got, the chance 
to build a life we can be proud of.

'I got into this race because, above 
all else, I believed that that is the promise this country makes to each
and every one of us.'

As supporters and family members gathered at a hotel in the Boston suburb of Newton, Mr Kennedy's 
campaign reported that he had captured 62 per cent of the vote versus 
Bielat's 36 per cent, with 80 per cent of precincts reporting.

He is heir to one of America's most 
storied political clans, which also produced President John F Kennedy 
and Senator Edward M Kennedy.

As the son of former Representative 
Joseph Kennedy II and the grandson of the late Senator Robert Kennedy, 
he has plenty of direct connections to his family's illustrious past.

He is the first Kennedy of his generation to hold public office.

Before launching his bid earlier this
year, he graduated from Harvard Law School in 2009 and then worked in 
various Massachusetts district attorney offices.

He served as a Massachusetts 
prosecutor; served in the Peace Corps, founded by his great-uncle 
President John Kennedy; and worked on the final election campaign of his
great-uncle Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who died in 2009.

The Kennedys' unbroken 64-year run in
politics was only came to an end last year when Patrick Kennedy, who 
was a congressman for Rhode Island, retired from his post.

Mr Kennedy's win maintains both his family's and the district's long-term Democratic control.
His grandfather was Robert Kennedy, who served as U.S. Attorney General 
and as a U.S. Senator from New York. He was assassinated in 1968.

His great-uncles were the late U.S. President John F Kennedy and the late Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts.

His father founded the non-profit 
Citizens Energy Corp in 1979 and later served as a U.S. Congressman from
Massachusetts for 12 years.

The Kennedy family had seen its 
influence in Washington fade in recent years as its younger generations 
have largely shunned public office.

The death of Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2009 left a void.

The retirement of his son Rep Patrick
Kennedy of Rhode Island last year marked the first time in 64 years 
that there was not a Kennedy serving in elected office in Washington.

His exit marked a bittersweet turn for one of America's most powerful and prominent political families.

Politics was the family business, the
lifeblood of a dynasty that often dominated the public stage with its 
triumphs, as well as its personal traumas.

JFK arrived as a young congressman in
1947, later capturing the White House and leaving an outsized stamp on 
the nation's history. First Lady Jackie was equally memorable.

Robert Kennedy's presidential ambitions were snuffed out by an assassin's bullet, but he inspired generations of activists.

Edward Kennedy was seen as one of the most influential senators in U.S. history.

Bobby Shriver is currently the lone 
family member in politics, serving as a city councillor in the seaside 
Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica.
