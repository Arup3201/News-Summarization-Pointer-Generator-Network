Millie Thompson: Nursery staff denied panicking when she chocked

A baby girl choked to death on shepherd’s pie at a private nursery, an inquest heard yesterday.

Nine-month-old Millie Thompson began coughing and spluttering and her lips turned blue as she was fed her lunch.

Nursery staff pulled her from her high chair and desperately carried out first aid but within an hour she was dead.

Her mother Joanne told the hearing she wanted answers about her daughter’s death.

Addressing the jury while clutching one of Millie’s shoes, Mrs Thompson, 28, a quantity surveyor, said: ‘All I want to know is why my perfectly healthy daughter was dropped off somewhere she was supposed to be perfectly safe and then died.

‘How she can choke on shepherd’s pie I’ll never understand.

‘All we want to know is how this happened and to make sure that this never happens to anyone else ever again.’

Millie had been at the Ramillies Hall School and Nursery in Cheadle Hulme, near Manchester, for only three days when the tragedy happened on October 23 last year.

She was a confident eater and had previously been given a range of foods including cucumber and bagels, the inquest heard.

She had been dropped off at the nursery by her father Dan, 40, a building inspector.

But as nursery supervisor Alison Pope, who has worked at the school for 
17 years, fed her shepherd’s pie, with a drink of water between each 
mouthful, she started coughing and crying, and began to turn blue.

Mrs Pope shouted for help. Nursery 
assistant Samantha Sloan, who was trained in paediatric first aid, 
helped clear Millie’s mouth and, holding  her face down, slapped her 
back.

Another nursery supervisor with first
aid training took  over as Miss Sloan went to call for an ambulance.

Mrs Pope denied a suggestion by the Thompsons’ lawyer that she had 
turned away to talk to a colleague at the time Millie began to choke.

She also denied that she had panicked.

She said that Millie ‘was making noises, if she’d have had something stuck she wouldn’t have been crying or coughing’.

But in a statement given after 
Millie’s death, Miss Sloan said that Mrs Pope was shouting and ‘really 
panicking and flapping’, the inquest heard.

By the time the ambulance arrived ten
minutes later, Millie had gone into cardiac arrest and less than an 
hour later she was pronounced dead at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport.

yesterday her mother Joanne delivered an emotional plea to the jury asking how the tragedy last October could have happened.

Parents: Mr and Mrs Thompson with Millie, who went into cardiac arrest after choking on the food

Clutching one of her daughter's 
shoes, she said: 'All we want to know is how our perfectly healthy 
daughter was dropped off where we felt she was safe and did not come 
home that day.

'How could she have choked on mashed potato? All we want to know is how did this happen.

'We don't want any other parent to go through this.'

She told South Manchester Coroner John Pollard that it was only her daughter's third full day at the school, which had been recommended to them.

Mrs Pope recalled giving her five tiny mouthfuls of shepherd's pie, with drinks of water in between each bite, before she first coughed.

'A little bit of food came out,' she said. 'I picked her up out of the chair. She started coughing more and she started going blue.'

Daughter: Mrs Thompson issued an emotional plea at the inquest into Millie's death

She said that within seconds she passed Millie to nursery assistant Samantha Sloan, who was trained in paediatric first aid.

Mrs Pope said they tried to clear her mouth of any food but there was no obvious blockage.

Giving evidence, Ms Sloan said she gave Millie five slaps on the back and a brown liquid came out and on to the floor.

She said she 'instinctively knew' she had to get out whatever was stuck in her throat as the youngster continued to struggle to breathe.

When she rang for an ambulance, she said the call operator told her to keep Millie alert and put her on her side in case she vomited.

'That person said to ring back if anything changed and told me the ambulance was on the way,' she said.

Heartbreaking: The girl's parents have vowed to find out what happened to her

In her statement, she said that at 
that stage she felt 'helpless', adding: 'I could see what was happening 
and could not do anything.'

When Millie was being treated at the scene she said she thought Millie 'was not going to make it'.

Nursery supervisor Clare Thomas held 
Millie on her side in the school entrance area after the ambulance was 
called and said her breathing remained shallow but her lips were no 
longer blue.

She kept on talking to her and Millie responded, remaining conscious until the ambulance arrived.

Ms Thomas said she would have performed CPR if she felt it was needed, but added that did not know exactly what was wrong with the baby.

'I am a first aider,' she said. 'My job is to preserve life. I am not medically trained to know what the problem is.'

Mr and Mrs Thompson have started Millie's Trust, a charity which offers free first-aid training for carers

Nursery supervisor Maria Royal said in her statement that Millie 'did not look right' and appeared unwell at the entrance area.

She went on to say her lips were blue but Ms Thomas was taking care of the youngster and 'seemed to be coping fine'.

The inquest was told that other witnesses would say Millie was limp at this point and her eyes were closed.

Nursery assistant Sandra Clark witnessed Millie being cradled by Ms Thomas, and said the girls arms were limp while her lips had turned blue and her eyes were shut.

In her statement she added: 'I got the impression that Millie was not going to survive.'

The hearing continues, and is scheduled to last three days.
