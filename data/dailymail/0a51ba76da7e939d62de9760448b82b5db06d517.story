Britain's baby boomers are choosing to face the final curtain with a laugh with Monty Python’s irreverent hit Always Look on the Bright Side of Life topping the charts as the most popular funeral song.

The tongue-in-cheek ditty poking fun at death has replaced Frank Sinatra's My Way  as the most popular song played at funerals - the first time the song has been toppled from the number one spot since 2002.

The song, written by Eric Idle, was taken from the controversial 1979 film The Life of Brian - which was banned in Norway and Ireland.

A study by The Co-operative Funeralcare showed that traditional hymns, football anthems and classic pop songs top the list of the 'funeral music chart'.

A study of songs played at 30,000 funerals also showed some unusual requests such as Abba, Elvis Presley, Star Wars or Blues Brothers fancy dress themed services.

The top 10 included Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life, The Lord Is My Shepherd, Abide With Me, Match Of The Day theme, My Way, All Things Bright And Beautiful and Angels by Robbie Williams.

Queen is the most popular group for funeral songs such as Who Wants To Live Forever, while an increasing number of songs written by the deceased are played.

David Collingwood, operations director of The Co-operative Funeralcare, said: 'We think we may be seeing a generational shift in attitudes towards funerals, and the choice of music being requested.

'Music plays such an important part in people's lives that it now acts as the theme tune to their passing. 

'Modern funerals are very much about personal choice, which can be reflected in the choice of music, dress, coffin, flowers, hearses or memorials.'
