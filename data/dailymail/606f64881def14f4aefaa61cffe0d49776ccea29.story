Chelsea want Cesc Fabregas to replace Frank Lampard. Fine player though Fabregas is, it is hard to imagine he will come near. Lampard changed English football.

Had Manchester United not found a midfield player to score more than 20 goals a season to match him, Chelsea might have won the League seven years on the turn.

That this player was Cristiano Ronaldo, currently regarded as the best footballer in the world, confirms the nature of Lampard’s talent.

In 2004-05, Lampard scored 15 goals from midfield and Chelsea won the title. The following season he scored 19 times and Chelsea retained it.

And that is how it would have continued had Ronaldo not begun to outscore him. In 2006-07, Lampard got 21 to Ronaldo’s 23 — so Manchester United won the League.

The following year, Ronaldo was simply unstoppable with 42 to Lampard’s 20 — another title for United.

In Ronaldo’s final season, he scored 26, Lampard 20 and he left Manchester United as champions.

With Ronaldo at Real Madrid, Lampard’s 27 goals in 2009-10 helped return the title to Stamford Bridge.

Fabregas is a beautiful footballer but as a goalscorer he is not in Lampard’s class.

Hit and miss: During his spell at Arsenal, Fabregas only managed a goal every five games in 303 appearances

World's best: Lampard goalscoring feats can only be matched by Cristiano Ronaldo's at Manchester United

He scored three goals in 2004-05, five the next season, four the season after that.

His goals total for Arsenal was 57 across all competitions in 303 appearances, an average of one every 5.3 games.

Lampard bows out with one in three for Chelsea, Ronaldo with one every 2.4 for Manchester United. Unlike Lampard in his twilight years, however, he was always used in a forward role.

Jose Mourinho’s tribute to Lampard summed up his worth. He scorned matters of opinion and stuck only to the facts.

‘Go to the number of matches he played, the number of goals he scored, the number of assists, the number of ball recoveries, the areas on the pitch he was playing,’ he said. ‘Lampard was the best for 10 years.’ That is some act to follow.
