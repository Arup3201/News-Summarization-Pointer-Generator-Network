Four days after a gunman opened fire on his co-workers before committing suicide, detectives are investigating whether a verbal reprimand for missing an audit deadline could have triggered the rampage.

Andre Turner, 48, methodically shot colleagues with a semi-automatic handgun then killed himself on Friday inside an office complex that houses more than 1,000 employees of utility firm Edison International.

He had previously been disciplined at his workplace in Irwindale, California, but the exact timing of the reprimand is unclear, sheriff's Lt Holly Francisco said last night.

Motive? Turner had previously been disciplined at work, but the exact timing of the reprimand is unclear

Victim: Robert Lindsay, 53 was one of the two co-workers killer by Turner

Two men were killed in the rampage and another two employees were hospitalised.

Henry Serrano, 56, died on the way to hospital, and Robert Lindsay, 53, died at the scene.

Abhay Pimpale, a 38-year-old independent contractor who was wounded in the shooting, declined to comment.

The father of a 
three-year-old son and a newborn baby was released from hospital on 
Saturday. He said he only wanted to 'spend time with my family'.

A fourth victim, 46-year-old Angela 
Alvarez, was moved from critical condition to serious condition at 
County-USC Hospital yesterday, said spokeswoman Rosa Saca.

Turner, whose death has been ruled a suicide, reportedly targeted managers in the shooting spree.

Edison employees were described as hiding behind their 
desks while he roamed the office with a gun.

A budget meeting was held shortly before the incident began, but it was not immediately known what was discussed.

A
source told the Los Angeles Times that Turner 'told some people to 
leave and he was very deliberate about who he shot. He did not like 
management.'

KCAL 9 
reported Turner's wife Jean was concerned her husband may have
been one of the victims, and didnâ€™t find out that he 
may have been the shooter until hours later.

The station also reported that Turner's daughter had also worked for Edison on the second floor of the building, but was recently laid off.

Shock: Edison said it is offering grief counselling for employees and is establishing a fund to support the victims' families

In an emergency call released by 
authorities yesterday, the operator reports hearing possible gunfire 
when the security guard from the office park called to report the 
shooting.

In the recording, she says: 'I heard a
male voice in the background yelling. There's also some loud popping 
noises in the background.'

Turner had been a systems analyst at Edison for seven years, company spokesman Steven Conroy said.

His wife, Jean Turner, said in a 
brief statement: 'We are in shock and still trying to process this 
tragic event. Our hearts and prayers go out to all the victims and their
families.'

While the motive remains unconfirmed, reports say
Turner's house faced possible foreclosure and was recently listed for 
sale at $120,000 less than he paid for it in 2004.

The victims were all in supervisory 
roles at Edison, but it is unclear whether any of them were Turner's 
direct supervisors, Lt Francisco said.

Mr Lindsay was a manager in the IT 
division at Edison and had worked for the company for 29 years. He was 
married and was a father. Mr Serrano, a manager in the same area, had 
been with the company for 26 years.

All five people worked in the same 
area of the same building at the office park in Irwindale, a small 
industrial city in the San Gabriel Valley.

Edison said it was offering grief 
counselling for employees and is establishing a fund to support the 
victims' families. The company will donate $100,000 and seek employee 
contributions.

Southern California Edison yesterday 
said it has stepped up security, but declined to provide details. The 
Irwindale facility remains closed to workers.
