Talk about salt being rubbed into the wound. To all those head-in-the-hands Manchester United fans wondering where their defence has gone, these words from Inter Milan sporting director Piero Ausilio will cut deep.

'We always look for players that can improve Inter's quality regardless of their provenance. Nemanja Vidic is an example of this. He was a great signing because he arrived here intact and for free. He's got a great mentality and he will show what it means to be a winner. He has been a linchpin to a historical club like Manchester United.'

There are no linchpins at Old Trafford any more - instead Louis van Gaal has a cast list of injury-prone, untried, out-of-position players for the defensive roles. Indeed, Jamie Redknapp called the United defence that finished the match against Manchester City 'the worst back four you'll ever see'.

Here is how United finished their 1-0 derby defeat against City at the back...

Luke Shaw (a prospect but a rookie)

Thirty-something Vidic is doing it in Serie A even if he was deemed past his sell-by date at United.

All that dosh splashed on exciting, attacking players and only one 'senior' summer buy on a defender - £16million Argentine Marcos Rojo. And now he is crocked with a dislocated shoulder.

Van Gaal is trying to build a dynasty and, so far, the foundations are being laid on shifting sands.

Short-term, the Dutchman has a defensive crisis of epic proportions – January must feel light years away. Sadly for him, he cannot take a jemmy to the transfer window now.

Instead the United boss must plan for the next match against Crystal Palace on the back of a measly return of 13 points from 10 matches and 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea.

The players who finished as defenders in the 1-0 derby defeat by City on Sunday were: Antonio Valencia, winger; Michael Carrick, midfielder; Paddy McNair, kid; Luke Shaw, big-money, exciting prospect but still a rookie. 

United's spending included a summer buy on defender Marcos Rojo who is now out with a dislocated shoulder

The Premier League table

Chris Smalling, red-carded against City, is suspended for the Palace game. Phil Jones (shin splints), Jonny Evans (ankle), and Rafael (training ground mystery injury) are also out. 

Van Gaal must decide whether to go for experience, even if that means asking players like Carrick and Valencia to do unfamiliar jobs, or whether to look from the kindergarten ranks.

Add together the Premier League games for United of Shaw, McNair, Tyler Blackett, Tom Thorpe, Marnick Vermijl, Saidy Janko and Reece James and they have notched 15 between them.

Blackett has already played six League matches this season, which puts him one ahead of Shaw and three ahead of McNair.

The next name on the waiting list is central defender Thorpe, who came on as a substitute against West Ham and who is regarded as a star of the future.

Thorpe captains the Under 21s and was part of the successful 2011 FA Youth Cup-winning side. Players who have since emerged from that team include Ravel Morrison, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Paul Pogba.

After that, it really is uncharted waters for Van Gaal. Belgian Vermijl, 22, and left back James, 20, both figured in the 4-0 Capital One Cup drubbing by MK Dons and have yet to make league debuts for United.

James caught the eye on the pre-season tour of America, especially the performances against LA Galaxy and Roma. He has had a second chance at Old Trafford after being released by Preston.

Reach even further down and there is 17-year-old Janko, who was recruited from FC Zurich last year and is regarded as one for the future. He was bought as a right back but often plays midfield.

So it is headache time for Van Gaal. Valencia over Vermijl? Carrick and McNair or Thorpe or both kids at the expense of Carrick? At least Shaw is a shoo-in.

Meanwhile, roll on January...
