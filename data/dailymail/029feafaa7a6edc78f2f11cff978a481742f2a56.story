Lloyd Walsh, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, died suddenly after complaining of a headache

A rugby player died suddenly after complaining of a headache - just weeks after the birth of his first child.

Lloyd Walsh, 20, from Balderstone, Rochdale, was in a car with a friend when he complained of a sharp pain in his head. He then began to look 'a bit funny', an inquest heard.

The electrician, whose baby boy Mason was only four weeks old at the time, became unresponsive and an ambulance was called.

But by the time paramedics arrived around 10 minutes later no pulse could be found.

He was taken to Fairfield General Hospital, where it was recorded he had suffered a heart attack and pronounced dead.

A pathology report read out at the inquest said Lloyd died on November 21, 2012, from sudden adult death syndrome.

A post-mortem examination revealed no significant abnormalities in any of Lloyd's organs, major arteries, or respiratory system.

Recording
 a conclusion of death by natural causes coroner Simon Nelson praised 
Lloyd's family for the fundraising work they have done for CRY - a 
charity which offers support to families who have suffered a loss to 
sudden adult death syndrome.

He said: 'The family are doing some wonderful work to ensure that people never forget about the qualities that he had.

'He clearly was a very special young man.'

Lloyd played rugby league for 
Castleton-based Mayfield and Crossfield in Warrington and worked with 
his father Declan at the family firm Kells Security.

Lloyd's mother Catherine described her son as 'kind and thoughtful'.

The father-of-one was driving with a friend in the car when he became unresponsive. The rugby player - described as kind and thoughtful by family - was later pronounced dead at hospital

Lloyd was treated by medics at Fairfield General Hospital, pictured. His son Mason was just four weeks old when the sportsman, who played for teams in Warrington and Castleton, died

She said: 'He was very kind and thoughtful, and very protective of his family and friends.

'He was someone who did everything right.

'He never smoked, he never really drank alcohol, and he never touched drugs or anything like that. He looked after himself.'

Speaking after the inquest Ms Walsh said: 'Hopefully this will give us closure. We are going to try to keep raising money for CRY.

'We don't want anyone else to have to go through what we have.'

 Sudden
 Adult Death Syndrome (SADS) is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia' - a
 disturbance in the heart's rhythm. It can strike at any age and affects those who are fit and athletic. It mainly affects young men - often when they are asleep.

Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells.

Some
 reports suggest it may be caused by an underlying genetic 
disorder which runs in families, while others suggest it may be acquired.

Around
 one in four cases are thought to be caused by a set of conditions called
 ion channelopathies. These affect the electrical functioning of the 
heart without affecting its structure, meaning they can only be detected
 in life rather than after death.

The
 prevalence of SADS is not fully known as many sudden deaths are put 
down to accidents, but research suggests it claims around 500 lives a 
year in the UK.

It was 
first noted in 1977 among Hmong refugees in the US. It was then reported
 again in Singapore when medics looked through records which showed 230 
healthy Thai men died suddenly between 1982 and 1990.
