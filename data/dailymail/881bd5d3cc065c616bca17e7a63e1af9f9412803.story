Janet Norton, here with husband John who is mentally impaired, is now recovering after being left to lie in her own filth for weeks while a council-appointed carer cleaned around her

A pensioner was left to lie in her own filth for weeks while a council-appointed carer cleaned around her.

Janet Norton, 72, lay immobilised on her sofa for two months with a back injury, yet the carer appears to have ignored her desperate condition.

Her shocked daughter Sharon Matthews discovered her mother at her south London home in December 2012 and alerted paramedics.

The carer - who was given five days 
training before starting work with Care UK - has been suspended after an
investigation was launched.

Both Care UK and Merton Council have apologised for a 'service failure'.

In August 2012 Mrs Norton was deemed by social services to be capable of looking after herself and her husband John, who is mentally impaired following a breakdown 20 years ago.

From October her condition rapidly worsened but the carer failed to notice she was in severe pain, unable to move, and began to use the sofa as a toilet.

Mrs Norton's daughter, Sharon Matthews, said: 'I had not seen mum and dad for three months and after a while I became suspicious because mum would never come to the phone.

'When I discovered what happened I was shocked and disgusted. The smell was unbelievable and there were flies everywhere.

The shocking pictures taken by Mrs Norton's daughter are too disturbing to use.

They show her entire back covered in excrement after she was forced to soil herself because she couldn't move.

Hospital staff had to cut her clothes off her because they were drenched in urine and faeces.

In the pictures, the skin on her buttocks is red raw and weeping from pressure sores, and she has other patches of raw skin up her back.

Every toe on her right foot has turned yellow, and in some parts, black, showing infection and necrosis (death of flesh).

Her left foot has also started to deteriorate in the same way.

'I called the ambulance and it took them two-and-half hours to get her out because she was in so much pain. They had to cut her clothes off because they were drenched in urine and faeces.'

On the day Mrs Norton was discovered, her carer had written in his records: 'Washed the dishes, swept and mopped the floors. Kept Janet company for the remaining [sic].'

The previous day, he wrote: 'Janet was on the sofa with her husband beside her. I swept the floors, washed the dishes and put them away. I kept them company for the remaining time of my visit.'

Simon Williams, the council's director of community and housing, said: 'It is clear Mrs Norton's change in needs was not reported back. We regret we didn't know about it until December 17 when Mrs Matthews told us.

'It is really unfortunate this has happened. We are very sorry but we wouldn't like to cloud the fact there are really good care workers looking after vulnerable adults every day.'

He said social care watchdog, the Care 
Quality Commission, was informed of the case on Tuesday, but the council
has not asked for the police to investigate, nor will the council's 
three-year contract with Care UK be reviewed.

Her family say the carer failed to notice she was in severe pain and was unable to move from the sofa

In a statement, Care UK said: 'Both Care UK and Merton Council had assessed and were aware of the existing very poor state of Mr and Mrs Norton’s home and the extent of the care needs the couple already required before our care worker started to support the couple.

'Our care worker was contracted by the Council to attempt to clean and maintain the house, but, at the couple’s request, was not allowed to provide personal care such as assisting Mrs Norton’s mobility or hygiene requirements.

'Care UK doesn’t have the authority to determine or change the level of care provided to individuals by local authorities, but we are sorry that we were not able to reduce the obvious discomfort and distress that Mr and Mrs Norton and their family experienced. 

'The local authority is responsible for deciding and reviewing care needs and only contracted Care UK to make some limited progress in preventing further deterioration in the state of the couple’s home, which we were able to do. 

'On reflection and despite our limited role, we recognise that we, as well as the council, could have escalated the situation more quickly, and we have now jointly agreed more effective ways to raise concerns in this sort of extremely difficult and sensitive case.'
