The call came in the early hours of October 27 – and Elaine Hanson remembers being ‘frozen in a place of absolute horror’. Only hours previously, she had been persuaded by nurses  to leave the bedside of her son – young author Luke Bitmead – to go home briefly for a change of clothes and a few hours’ rest.

She had done so in the knowledge that Luke was on the mend after taking an overdose of painkillers  in what his mother describes as ‘a classic plea for help’.

Elaine, 59, recalls the tragic night  in 2006: ‘All I could think of was that I had left my boy getting better. Physically, he was fit and strong. And now, just hours later I was being told he was dying.’

What happened to Elaine’s ‘vibrant and handsome’ son was undoubtedly heartbreaking – but also, arguably, avoidable. The 34-year-old, who had a history of depression, discharged himself in the middle of the night and walked out of the intensive care ward dressed in a pair of pyjamas. He took a taxi to a nearby multi-storey car park – and plunged 30ft, sustaining injuries that led to his death.

Just last week, failures in NHS care of mental-health patients were again in the news after an apparent series of suicides at the Bradgate Mental Health Unit, a secure psychiatric hospital in Leicester.

There have been ten such tragic incidents since 2010 at Bradgate, and inquests have highlighted repeated failings by staff. Across the UK,  there are on average 160 inpatient suicides a year.

Following a BBC News investigation, the Care Quality Commission admitted that it has failed to properly inspect some units including Bradgate. Yet Luke was not even admitted to a secure unit – despite his first attempt at taking his own life. Mother-of-two Elaine, of Southrop, Gloucestershire, believes he should have been.

‘It was obvious he was in a fragile state of mind. It should have been clear to anyone – never mind a health professional – that Luke was far from well mentally. If the doctor who was looking after him had taken the time and read his notes, she would have seen that not only did the mental-health nurse who’d assessed him write that suicide was his ‘‘back-up plan’’, but that she was able to section him.

‘The psychiatrist who was looking after Luke had left instructions that Luke was to be sectioned for 24 hours if he tried to leave.’

Being sectioned means a mentally ill patient being admitted to hospital whether or not they agree to it. The term refers to the use of a section from the 1983 Mental Health Act as the authority for the detention. This ‘section’ of the Act is used about 50,000 times a year in England and Wales.Such drastic action is taken when someone is so severely mentally ill that it is necessary to protect their own health or the safety of others.

The process is typically started by  a family member and GP, and the decision is usually made by two doctors, one of whom must be an expert in mental health, and a social worker. The detention order can last up to  six months.

Elaine and her husband, Chris Hanson, who was Luke’s stepfather, had to fight for five years before  the NHS Trust in charge of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, where Luke discharged himself on the night of his death, finally admitted that it made mistakes.

The Trust has issued a formal apology, agreed an out-of-court settlement, and promised to change the way suicidal patients are treated.

Elaine says: ‘Going over and over documents and continually reliving what happened really traumatised  me and my husband – and all because the NHS couldn’t put their hands up and say “sorry”. It’s despicable.’

Former model Elaine is now campaigning for a change in the law to ensure vulnerable people at risk of self-harm cannot discharge themselves from hospital. ‘In England, prisoners on suicide watch are kept safely under 24-hour-a-day supervision – why should it be different for everyone else?’ she asks.

Luke, a former pupil at public school Radley College, had a degree in philosophy from Reading University and  his published novels include White Summer and Heading South. He had taken an overdose before, in 1998, but had not been hospitalised.

He was admitted to the Great Western Hospital after taking an overdose of painkillers on October 24, 2006. Luke had gone to a hotel in Oxford that evening and taken a large number of tablets. ‘He rang me and said “I’ve been really foolish,” and my heart just sank,’ Elaine recalls. ‘He told me where he was and I told him to stay there and we’d come and get him.’

After being admitted to hospital, tests showed the overdose had damaged Luke’s liver and he was moved to intensive care. After three days, his condition improved and Elaine, who had kept a bedside vigil next to her son, went home to sleep.

Hours later, she received a call from the hospital saying her son had discharged himself, followed by another shortly afterwards saying he had been readmitted – and was on a life-support machine. The fall at the car park had ruptured his aorta and severely damaged his internal organs, as well as causing multiple external injuries. Elaine had to make the heart-wrenching decision to have his life-support machine turned off.

All those who knew and loved Luke were shocked at the news of his death. It took four years for an inquest into his death to be held. A verdict of suicide was recorded.

Elaine says: ‘During the inquest, the doctor who discharged him said, “I now know I was wrong.” At the time of Luke’s death, I just couldn’t understand why she couldn’t have simply sectioned him for his own safety. I found this so hard to comprehend. I now know she hadn’t even read his notes.’

Elaine has also criticised the fact that her son was given only one hour with a mental-health nurse during his 60-hour hospital stay. Dr Joachim Stanley, a clinical negligence expert at Withy King Solicitors, says: ‘Luke’s untimely end was all the more tragic because it was avoidable. Sadly, cases like his are not uncommon.’

A spokesman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust says: ‘Since Luke’s death, as a Trust we have made significant improvements to the way we support and manage patients with mental-health needs in the hospital.’

Consultant clinical psychologist Dr Alison Brabban says: ‘Health professionals can sometimes feel so pressured that they avoid asking patients about suicidal thoughts even if they suspect they’re there, just in case they open up a topic they fear they won’t be able to deal with.

‘Not only do staff need training to spot signs of hopelessness, but they also need to feel confident that  they have the competences as well as the resources to help.’

Elaine’s call for new legislation  has been backed by mental-health charities. Paul Jenkins, CEO of one, Rethink Mental Illness, says: ‘Many health professionals can spot the signs of diabetes or a stroke, but cannot spot the basic signs that someone is suicidal. Training is not the only problem.

Often staff are doing their best in a system that  is chronically underfunded, so even when they know someone needs specialist help, it isn’t easily available.’

Elaine adds: ‘When I sat with Luke’s body after the life-support had been switched off, I made a promise to my son that I’d fight with every breath I had to try to see that we achieved better treatment for people with mental-health problems.

‘I will grieve for ever, but I don’t want my grief to be energy that  just floats out into the ether. I want it to be used to create a possibility  of change.’
