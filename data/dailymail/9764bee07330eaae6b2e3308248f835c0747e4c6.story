A boy of just 10 downed a sickening mixture of Nando's sauce, cream, mayonnaise and vodka as part of the deadly Neknominate online drinking game craze sweeping the world, it emerged today.

The primary school-age youngster from Calderdale, West Yorkshire, was reportedly filmed by friends guzzling the nauseating cocktail after he was dared to take part.

The disturbing case comes as council chiefs told Twitter and Facebook they should publish prominent warnings of the dangers of the social media trend, which has already claimed three lives in the UK.

Headmasters across the country are also reading out warnings in assembly and displaying them on noticeboards in an effort to discourage children from taking part.

The Calderdale boy has learned his lesson the hard way after the revolting concoction reportedly made him violently sick and he had to rushed for medical treatment.

An education source told the Daily Mirror: 'The boy's mother was in tears that her son would try such a thing. He was fine in the end, apart from feeling sick as a dog.

'Social media sites are full of this craze. There is such a loss of innocence these days and it is horrifying that kids in junior schools are urging each other to copy lethal games.'

Michelle Foster, CEO of The Basement Recovery Project, a Halifax-based organisation that helps adults affected by drug and alcohol addiction, told MailOnline that, although she was not aware of that particular case, she had learned of other youngsters in the area taking part in NekNominate.

'It has gone on in my son's school, so I've been involved in what's going on there,' she said. 'The problem is that teachers themselves are doing it.

'How are you supposed to be telling kids it's wrong if they can see you doing it on Facebook?'

The 10-year-old boy's case emerged as councils told Twitter and Facebook they should introduce warnings over the NekNominate drinking game.

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, said prominent messages were needed on the websites about the dangers of the craze.

The dangerous game has been blamed for the deaths of Bradley Eames, 20, Stephen Brooks, 27, and Isaac Richardson, 20.

Neknominate involves people filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on social media sites.

Councils are now publishing warnings about alcohol through internet safety campaigns that provide links for parents, carers and young people.

The LGA said some schools had asked for warning notices about Neknominate to be put on noticeboards and read out at assemblies.

On Wednesday, the industry-funded charity Drinkaware called on parents to take a tough stance against the game over fears that young teenagers are under pressure to take part.

Katie Hall, chair of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said: 'This is an utterly reckless and totally irresponsible craze which has tragically claimed lives. More should be done to highlight the dangers and persuade people not to participate.

'We believe social media operators have a responsibility to provide health warnings to user groups and individuals.

'The LGA is looking for these corporations to show leadership -and not ignore what is happening on their sites.

'We are urging Facebook and Twitter executives to sit down with us and discuss a way forward which tackles this issue head-on.'

The LGA said Boston Borough Council in Lincolnshire is encouraging those people nominated to continue the drinking game to contact their community safety team.

Sevenoaks District Council in Kent is launching an internet safety campaign on Neknominate, while Worcestershire County Council has called for people not to join in.Â
