In an industry that often leads women to associate 'bounce back' with 'A-list pregnancy', model and new mother Molly Sims has revealed how 'overwhelming' pregnancy was for her, admitting that she gained 50lbs.

Speaking on the Today show in a segment titled, 'Shed baby pounds like a celebrity,' the 39-year-old admitted: 'The pressure is part of the problem 
because we feel like we need to look like a 20-year-old or someone in a 
magazine who just stepped out three weeks later and... it's not realistic.

'I gained 50lbs, and it was hard and even harder after,' she added. 'I have three Spanx on right now.'

Ms Sims,
who completed the DVD exercises with Ms Anderson throughout the whole 
nine months, said: 'It focuses on everything; arms, your legs, your 
butt, your feet, 
everything.

'It's overwhelming what your body 
goes through. I'm so lucky to have someone like Tracy 
in my life and I work with amazing people. But if you're a woman out there 
who is working and has two kids already, it is so hard.'

Ms Anderson, who recently came under 
fire for a recent article in Du Jour magazine, where she commented that 
many women use pregnancies to let their bodies go, explained the quote 
was taken out of context.

'I've
built my career about empowering women and giving them the tools that 
they need to be able to look and feel their best and be their 
healthiest,' she said.

'Unfortunately, during my first pregnancy I gained 60 pounds and it was really rough and I learned later on in life a healthier approach and having the tools to not do that is kind of a better path to go.'

While get-fit DVDs for mothers 
usually focus on post-pregnancy, Ms Anderson's routines target areas of 
the body during pregnancy, which she says is 'so important for the health of these little ones.'

'First of all,' she explains, 'because what we put into our bodies helps set them up for the rest of their life.

'The first nine months of their life has an impact on them for the rest of their life and people like Molly, a shiny example of a woman, used the tools to go through her pregnancy and feel connected to her body.'

She added: 'We're real women... and [these tools] help women look and feel their best because that's really - that's really important'.
