A nurse has admitted administering ten times the correct dose of salt to a baby who later died but denied falling asleep on duty.

After the overdose, four-month-old Samuel McIntosh suffered fatal brain damage and died at a hospital in Nottingham in July 2009.

Just days before the blunder, staff nurse Louisa Swinburn, 35,  posted a picture of herself appearing to be asleep next 
to the baby on Facebook, without the consent of the hospital or parents, a medical tribunal heard yesterday.

Posted on Facebook: Nurse Louisa Swinburn appears to be asleep next to Samuel McIntoch's cot in intensive care days before he died of an overdose at a hospital in Nottingham in 2009

Intensive care: Samuel had been born prematurely at Nottingham's City Hospital and weighed around a sixth of the normal weight for a full-term baby

An
inquest into the death the year after the incident had heard that two nurses, who 
were involved in a 'dreadful mistake' which led to the death, could not 
explain how the error occurred.

The inquest heard that Sister Karen 
Thomas and Louisa Swinburn were 'distracted' by another 
staff member as they prepared a solution to correct Samuel’s low salt 
levels.

As a result of the mistake, Samuel was
wrongly given 50ml of a sodium chloride solution despite a registrar 
prescribing just 5ml.

Tests conducted on a syringe after the 
mistake was spotted showed that the sodium chloride had also not been 
mixed with dextrose, as required by the prescription.

The error meant the infusion given to 
Samuel was ten times the required concentration, causing swelling to his 
brain from which he died.

Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard Mrs Swinburn, who was not present for the hearing, had admitted administering an overdose of sodium chloride to Samuel (Baby A).

She admitted that the overdose 
related to a concentration of sodium chloride approximately 10 times 
that expected from the prescription.

She
has also admitted posting on Facebook, on or around June 23, 2009, a 
photo of herself on duty at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS 
Trust, and the baby.

This was without the consent of the Trust, or the baby’s parents.

She denies charges that on the 
nightshift of June 22-23, 2009, she fell asleep while on duty, and that 
she appeared to be asleep in the photo.

A fitness to practice panel is to consider whether her alleged actions amounted to misconduct and if her fitness to practise is impaired.

If found guilty of misconduct she could be kicked out of the profession.

At the earlier inquest, Paul Balen, the 
solicitor acting for Samuel’s parents Robert and Sarah McIntosh, urged 
the Nottingham Coroner, Dr Nigel Chapman, to consider a verdict of 
unlawful killing.

But Dr Chapman recorded a narrative 
verdict after ruling that Samuel died after a 'drug error' on the high 
dependency unit at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC).

He said there was no doubt that a
dreadful mistake had taken place, but ruled that it did not fall into 
the category of a gross failure.

Sister Thomas, who was in charge of the unit, told the inquest that she had no clear memory of what she actually did. There had been 'a bit of an interruption', she said.

Mrs Swinburn told the inquest she could not recall opening five 10ml vials of sodium chloride, saying: 'Nothing occurred to me at all that we had made an error.'

Samuel had been born prematurely at Nottingham’s City Hospital on March 1, 2009, and weighed 1lb 4oz - around a sixth of the normal weight for a full-term baby. He was given a 25 per cent chance of survival.

He was transferred to the QMC aged 18 days to receive intensive care and by June there was talk of him going home.

But he became unwell again on July 4 
and after blood tests it was discovered that his sodium chloride levels 
were low and he was put on a course of fluid infusion.

Samuel was prescribed three 
milimoles of the fluid infusion per kilogram per day.

But his sodium chloride levels remained low and after observations it was decided to give him a separate salt solution infusion.

It was then that Mrs Swinburn made a ‘catastrophic drug administration error’ by giving him the fatal overdose.

As a result, by 3.40am he had lost 
340grams of weight, 12.5 per cent of his body weight, and was suffering 
swelling to his brain.

Hannah Stephenson, speaking for the NMC, said: ‘Over the next 24 hours Baby A remained significantly unwell.

‘He remained ventilated and he received fluids to correct his sodium level.

‘Neurologically Baby A had a decreased consciousness level and persistent seizures.

‘His sodium level gradually improved, however, there was no improvement in the neurological status.’

Two days later Samuel’s heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated. At this point doctors determined that the damage caused to this brain was ‘non-survivable’.

Samuel’s parents were told and a joint decision was taken to stop his intensive care treatment.He died at 11am on July 7, 2009, sparking a trust investigation.

The hearing continues.
