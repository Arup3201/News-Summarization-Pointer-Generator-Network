A New York police officer who was awarded for his bravery after chasing and shooting a thief who had shot him in the chest has proposed to his girlfriend during a Shakespeare play in Central Park.

Ivan Marcano, 27, got down on one knee to propose to girlfriend Hilda Molina, 25, as they attended Shakespeare in the Park on Saturday - 10 months after she witnessed him being shot in the chest.

The nearly 2,000 spectators gave the couple a standing ovation after Marcano presented the diamond and sapphire ring - and Molina, who is six months pregnant, promptly accepted.

'She's been there through thick and thin,' Marcano told the New York Daily News. 'Through the tears, I heard a "yes".'

She added: 'I was crying like a baby. I'm very excited. It's every girl's dream come true.'

The proposal was witnessed by 20 relatives and friends, including Marcano's mother and step-father. He said the idea came to him as he watched the company's 'Comedy of Errors' earlier this summer.

His brother, Victor, had helped with the big surprise by contacting Shakespeare in the Park and asking if Marcano could pop the question after Saturday's performance of Love's Labour's Lost.

After the play, Marcano was introduced and called to the stage where he said, 'I'm one hell of a lucky guy', before calling up his girlfriend to the stage.

'I loved him before that happened,' Molina said of the shooting. 'It brought us closer together. When youâ€™re staring in the eyes of death, it changes your life.'

The couple, who have been together for two years, have yet to set a date for the wedding.

The happy news comes 10 months after Marcano, who was off-duty, was driving near Bronx Community COllege with his girlfriend when he spotted two men apparently robbing a cab driver.

After getting out of his car and showing his credentials, Mr Marcano was shot in the chest. Despite sustaining injury, he managed to follow one of the suspects, eventually shooting him dead.

After he jumped in his girlfriend's 
car with the intention of going to hospital, they again encountered the 
men, who had crashed into a livery cab and were attempting to escape on 
foot.

While applying 
pressure to his own chest injury, Mr Marcano got out of his own vehicle 
and fired two shots, killing one of the suspects, 18-year-old Prince 
James, according to the Post.

Mr Marcano was taken to the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where officials said the bullet narrowly missed his heart.

After
the shooting, he was called a hero by New York Police Commissioner Ray 
Kelly, and in May, he was pictured shaking hands with President Obama 
during the National Association of Police Organizations 2012 TOP COPS 
recognition ceremony.

'He 
wasn't on the clock when any of this happened,' Obama said after 
singling Marcano out from the 43 police officers being commended. 'This 
was his date night. It's unbelievable.'
