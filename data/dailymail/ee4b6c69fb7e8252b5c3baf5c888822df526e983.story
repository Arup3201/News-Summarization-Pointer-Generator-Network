As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stepped out of the hospital with their newborn last night, all eyes weren't just on the future King.

As one of the most emulated, adored and scrutinised wardrobes in the world, Kate's Jenny Packham outfit attracted almost as much attention as the Royal baby.

So much so that one of the biggest clothing brands in the country saw polka dot dresses like Kate's sell out within hours.

The Kate effect strikes again! Sales of polka dot items have soared across the high-street since the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out donning a spotty Jenny Packham dress last night

George at Asda has reported huge sales numbers of all of its polka dot styles online as women battle it out to snap up the regal look of Britain's most stylish new mother.

Just over 5,000 dresses, which is more than five dresses a minute, sold on George.com.

Blue and white polka dot items including a pinafore dress, high-waisted shorts, chiffon shirts, skirts, vest tops and ballet pumps also saw a rocket in sales overnight, with a cream and blue polka dot skater style dress similar to Kate's as well as a Royal blue and white polka dot bikini selling out.

The George.com team reported a surge of visitors to the site after the baby's debut at 7:24pm and 'polka dot' has now taken the number one spot as the most searched for term on George.com.  

George expects sales of polka dot items in store to follow suit as women hunt down Kate's winning look for themselves.

The cornflower blue was a nod, no doubt,
to her baby's gender and it earned her serious style plaudits yet again.

Kate is widely cited in the fashion sector as the woman with the most selling power, and Asda have certainly reaped the rewards.

76
per cent of Asda customers have revealed that they are influenced by the former
Kate Middleton's stylish ensembles with George reporting previous 
sell-out items at George inspired by Kate including an 471 per cent 
uplift on coloured denim following Kate's coral jeans hockey appearance 
and a 300 per cent uplift in sales of a Burberry style mac.

George Brand Director Fiona Lambert said:
'Our customers have looked to the Duchess of Cambridge for style tips 
since she emerged onto the scene as William's partner and proved herself
to be the new British style icon. 

Baby blue: Kate chose a crepe de chine polka dot dress by Jenny Packham - a designer she has turned to on multiple occasions for public events - which was made bespoke for her

'There is great love across the nation for the Royal couple at the moment and whether it's snapping up all the celebratory memorabilia or simply emulating Kate's style, we expect sales to soar as the nation show their love for the new family at this special time.'

And it wasn't just Asda who noticed a surge in sales of polka dot items.

Fashion e-Tailer fashionbloodhound.com saw sales of polka dot dresses soar within an hour of Kate wearing hers yesterday.

The online store  was inundated with requests from women who wanted them to source a similar dress.

Desire have almost sold out of their blue polka dot dress offering and Client saw a 70 per cent upturn in sales of a polka dot blouse after Kate's emergence from hospital.

The latest incident is just one of many and whatever the Duchess of Cambridge wears turns to gold.

From
that Zara cornflower blue dress 
to those vibrant pink jeans and her exquisite Sarah Burton wedding gown,
her sartorial selections have sent high-street and designer sales 
soaring as women try desperately to 
emulate her impeccable style.

Whether striking in bright red Alexander McQueen during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee pageant, or dressed down in Le Chameau wellies and a campfire-chic gilet while on a forest outing with inner-city children, Kate's wardrobe choices are consistently classic, carefully considered, polished and chic and her post pregnancy outfits are likely to send the fashion world into a frenzy.
