Manchester City are facing a £49million fine from UEFA and savage Champions League sanctions that could keep up to four of their stars out of Europe next season.

City were fighting their punishment for breaching UEFA’s financial fair play regulations on Tuesday night.

They are understood to have until the end of the week to accept the ‘settlement’ from UEFA or their case will be passed to a panel which has the ultimate power to kick them out of the Champions League. The situation is embarrassing for

City and their Abu Dhabi owners as Manuel Pellegrini’s side attempt to take a step closer to the Barclays Premier League title when they face Aston Villa at the Etihad tonight.

The proposed fine is a significant sum even by the standards of Sheik Mansour but it is the Champions League sanctions that threaten to hit the club hardest.

City face seeing their Champions League squad cut from 25 players to 21, as well as having a European salary cap imposed on them next season. While their ‘homegrown’ quota of eight players would remain the same, UEFA have proposed cutting their foreign contingent from 17 to 13. That could threaten the participation of some of the club’s big names and even have an impact on Pellegrini’s transfer plans for this summer.

All five of his signings last summer were foreign, as are his main targets for next season.

City might also have to reassess plans to let go of some of their homegrown players. Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are expected to leave at the end of their contracts, while Micah Richards, Jack Rodwell, Scott Sinclair, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata and John Guidetti face uncertain futures.

City are one of nine teams being punished over FFP breaches. Club sources last night urged caution, saying reports of the sanctions are premature and speculative. UEFA president Michel Platini has said  in the past that teams will not  be kicked out of the Champions League, but the possibility remains if City fight the measures handed down.

Pellegrini said: ‘When it is official news we can analyse what happens with the team. At the moment we don’t know what happens.’

It is understood Paris Saint- Germain are facing similar  sanctions to City, and their coach Laurent Blanc admitted that the measures would mean the club ‘won’t be able to do everything it wants’ in the Champions League next season.

The issue cast a cloud over City’s preparations for tonight’s game, with City effectively needing four points from their remaining two games at home to Villa and West Ham to secure the club’s second title in three years.

Pellegrini said: ‘We are not thinking about any draws. We are thinking about beating Aston Villa, then we’ll see about the next game.’

Sergio Aguero will miss the game after limping out of Saturday’s 3-2 win at Everton.

The UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, first agreed in principle in September 2009 by the Financial Control Panel of UEFA, were brought in to prevent professional football clubs spending more than they earn in the pursuit of success and in doing so getting into financial problems which might threaten their long-term survival.

Introduced amid concern at the heavy spending of a number of professional clubs across Europe, it was hoped that the regulations would eventually lead to a more ‘level playing field’ by preventing clubs with very wealthy owners who make substantial cash gifts to their club from gaining an unfair advantage over other clubs who are run on a more sustainable business model, and in so doing encourage lower levels of spending.

The financial fair play (FFP) regulations provide for sanctions to be taken against clubs who do not spend within a set budgetary framework over several seasons.
