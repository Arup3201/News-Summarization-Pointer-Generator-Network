A well-respected physical education teacher from Virginia landed behind bars for allegedly trying his hand at styling hair on an unsuspecting friend.

Melvin Hunt, 61, a gym teacher at the private Riverside School in Chesterfield County, has been charged with misdemeanor assault in connection to the bizarre incident.

The victim, a 44-year-old psychical education and health teacher from Elizabeth Davis Middle School, told police that Hunt chopped off 8 to 12 inches of hair on the right side of her head while hugging her in a school parking last week.

Melvin Scissorhands: Physical education teacher Melvin Hunt, 61, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly cutting 8-12 inches of hair from a friend's head while hugging her  

According to a police report obtained by Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Riverside School employee arrived at his friend’s place of work at around 3.30pm Friday to set out on a planned trip.

While sitting in his car, Hunt informed the teacher that he no longer needed her to go with him. He then asked for the keys to the woman's car so he could place a letter inside for her to read later.

The 44-year-old middle school gym teacher handed him the keys, and Hunt went over to the vehicle to put the note on the passenger seat.

The court document states that when he returned to his car, he asked the woman for a hug.

According to the complaint, as the couple embraced, Hunt firmly grasped the woman's ponytail and cut several inches of hair. She only realized what happened after she saw her chopped tresses fall to the ground.

The 61-year-old suspect then tossed his friend’s car keys over a fence and took off in his car, according to investigators. 

Police said Hunt and the women know each other but have not been dating, but in her request for an emergency order of protection the 44-year-old listed her relationship to Hunt as ‘girlfriend.’

Mr Hunt showed up for work Monday morning after his release from jail, but he has since been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.

In 2007, the veteran gym teacher won the Virginia Middle School Physical Education Teacher of the Year.
