Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, has launched an investigation into a Channel 4 docudrama which led to more than 6,500 complaints after it depicted people rioting in the streets following an imagined Ukip election win. 

The broadcaster has been accused of election bias and scaremongering after it painted a country marred by race riots and mass unemployment under an imagined leadership by Nigel Farage in 'Ukip: The First 100 Days'. 

The watchdog confirmed it has launched an investigation to determine whether rules on impartiality and offensive material have been broken following the airing of the programme on February 16.

A Channel 4 docudrama about an imagined Ukip victory at the general election is to be investigated by Ofcom and could receive a formal notification or even a fine after the watchdog received more than 5,000 complaints

Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, has launched an investigation following the Channel 4 docu-drama 

It could see Channel 4 face a fine of around £100,000 if it is found in breach and Ofcom finds this is so serious it requires a sanction. 

The First 100 Days has  become the most complained about one-off programme in Britain this year, sparking 5,262 complaints to the watchdog. A further 1,300 complaints were received by Channel 4. 

A spokesman for the communications watchdog said: 'Ofcom has carefully assessed a number of complaints about Ukip: The First 100 Days on Channel 4.

'We are opening an investigation into the programme as it may raise issues under our rules on offensive material, misleadingness and due impartiality. We are also considering fairness and privacy complaints about the programme. '

Investigations usually take around 50 days, but because of the election in May, Ofcom is not likely to publish its conclusions until after May 7. 

Often an investigation ends in a formal notification to a broadcaster, which is seen as a 'black mark' against their name. But in more extreme and rarer circumstances, often when there has been a repeat of the breach Ofcom can make a sanction. This is frequently in the form of a fine.

Race riots were shown to break out throughout the country three months after the imagined Ukip victory  

Nigel Farage criticised the show after other people said they felt it was biased and scaremongering 

The programme was broadcast last week and has become the most complained about one-off this year

The 5,262 objections to Ukip: The First 100 Days make the docu-drama one of the most complained about in Ofcom's history. Here are a few shows which beat the tally.

Celebrity Big Brother race row: 44,500

Comments made by Jade Goody to Shilpa Shetty in 2007 attracted the most complaints in the regulator's history and forced Channel 4 to issue a public apology.

Jerry Springer the Opera: 8,860

The stage satire prompted outrage in 2005 after a TV version aired on the BBC, showing the chat show host in the bowels of hell and a troupe of dancing Ku Klux Klan members.

The X Factor (2009): 5,975

The vast majority of complaints came from viewers when Dannii Minogue commented on the sexuality of singer Danyl Johnson.

The X Factor (2010): 5,957

The talent show's 2010 run was dogged by controversies including racy outfits on stage, a contestant who led a double life as a prostitute and claims that ratings-grabbing acts were kept in the show at the expense of talented singers.

For example last year Discovery was fined £100,000 after it broadcast violent footage about female murderers, at breakfast time during the school holidays.

Ofcom refused to reveal whether Ukip had complained about the show, saying it did not reveal details of individual complainants. 

The Channel 4 docudrama lasted one hour and was watched by more than 1million people. It depicted rioting on the streets in the wake of a slim Ukip general election victory in May and combined archive footage with imagined scenes.

It shows the country teetering on the edge of destruction just three months after Ukip are elected. It also weaves in the racism and sexism scandals which have dogged the party recently. 

The Channel 4 show featured actress Priyanga Burford playing the part of the party's only Asian woman MP.

Her character is elected for Romford in an imagined landslide which puts Mr Farage in Number 10, but she is left grappling with her conscience as a factory closes in her constituency after the UK withdraws from the EU.

The programme - which depicted riots between protesters for and against tough anti-immigration raids - was strongly condemned by party leader Mr Farage.

'Look like 100 Days of Ukip may well have backfired on Channel 4. A biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain,' he wrote on his Twitter feed.

Following confirmation that Ofcom would investigate the broadcaster a spokesman for Ukip said: A spokesman said,'UKIP are not going to comment about the programme as we did not make a complaint, though we understand why others might have wished to do so.'

Audiences branded the show a 'hatchet job' as a number voiced their criticisms on Twitter, including comedian Jason Manford who raised concerns about bias. 

One viewer said: 'This is so biased from a mainstream media [organisation], it makes me furious - and I don´t even support Ukip.'

Mr Farage tweeted after the programme that it appeared the show 'may well have backfired on Channel 4'

The film combined acted scenes with actual news footage and showed race riots breaking out in Britain

Another wrote: 'I'm no Ukip fan, but this hatchet job Channel 4 is doing on them is quite anti-democratic and quite outrageous.'

Channel 4 has said 'a lot of research' went into the docudrama and that Mr Farage had been invited to watch it before it was broadcast and then to do an interview afterwards but he declined.

The broadcaster said it ordered the drama - which criticised Ukip, its leaders and its supporters - as a way of engaging people in politics in the run-up to the May General Election.

Channel 4's head of documentaries Nick Mirsky defended the controversial drama, saying it was fair and timing was not an issue. 

He said: 'Our job is to reflect and explore contemporary British life. Nothing represents what's different and unique in British political life now more than the rise of Ukip.

'This might be what you wake up to after May 7.'

Anger: The documentary featured a 'far-Right' demonstration in which the only banner was Israel's flag

One scene that raised hackles was a far-right protest where the only visible banner was the flag of Israel.

Sebastian Payne, digital managing editor of political magazine The Spectator, wrote: 'Did Channel 4 just show the flag of Israel to suggest a group of protesters are from the 'far right'?!'

One Twitter user, Nathanever82, wrote: 'You HAD to show an Israel flag in the fascist demonstration. You morons'.

The criticism added to complaints that the documentary had used broad sweeping generalisations about the ideas of political left and right. 

Though one user, Tom Deakin, wrote: 'I've been to EDL counter-protests before and seen EDL supporters flying Israel's flag.'

And it was later said the footage was in fact archive material from a real far-right protest in Doncaster last year.
