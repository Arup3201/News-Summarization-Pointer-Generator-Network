The number of married couples with children has reached a record low, census data suggests

The number of married couples with children has reached a record low, official figures show.

There are around four million such families, census data for the whole of the UK shows.

That is 15.2 per cent of families, or 300,000 fewer than a decade ago. It is also 600,000 fewer than Office for National Statistics estimates.

The news comes at a time of increasing concern over instability within families and the impact on children of family break-up.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is conducting a review of family stability which will gather information on how families are changing, which types of family are most at risk of failing, and what the state can do to keep them together.

Pro-marriage groups have told the inquiry the Coalition’s efforts to shore up marriage – including a tax break worth up to £200 a year to lower income married couples – are too little and may be too late.

The figures, gathered in the spring 2011 census and published yesterday, also show the number of people who live by themselves is at its highest recorded level.

There were 4,017,793 households of married couples with children under 16, or under 18 if they were still in school or college.

That number has fallen by more than 300,000 since the 2001 census, when there were 4,323,069 married couples with dependent children. That is despite rapid population growth in the intervening years, with the number of people living in Britain rising by 3.7million, partly as a result of immigration.

The most recent census found there were 1,053,397 homes of cohabiting couples with children, and 1,895,833 homes with one  parent and children, adding up to nearly three million households.

The ONS Labour Force Survey, which takes a smaller sample of homes to generate annual estimates of how households are made up, said there were around 4,610,000 married couples with children last year – higher by 600,000 than the census.

ONS officials said it was difficult to 
compare the figures and that census results may be lower because they do
 not account for families who share homes.

Experts consider married families the most stable - and say cohabiting couples are three times more likely to break up than married people

Critics fear a lack of advantages for married couples and tax and benefit losses for those who share homes are discouraging married families.

Eight million people live on their own, the most ever recorded, census data shows.

Nearly a third of homes, 31 per cent, have a single occupant.

Some 8.1million people lived alone at the time of the census in 2011. Analysts said one reason was a trend for couples not to live together.

More than a million couples live apart, and experts suggested some are motivated by a system of tax and benefits that rewards single claimants while penalising couples and married people.

In 2001, 7.4million people lived alone, just over 30 per cent of households. Researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘It is genuinely shocking that the benefits system continues to carry disincentives to people to live together as couples and families.’

Some analyses have shown that a couple could be £100 a week better off by choosing to live in two homes.

Experts consider married families the most stable, with cohabiting couples breaking up three times more quickly than married people.

Harry Benson, of think-tank the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘There is a couple penalty on all partners who share a home. It can cost parents with one child up to £7,100 per year in lost tax credits the moment they move into together.

‘So the Government is incentivising couples not to commit.’

He said the Government spends huge amounts on problems tied to family breakdown, including juvenile delinquency and truancy.

He added: ‘The effects of family instability in early years are felt  decades later. Nearly half of  teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are not living with both of their parents.’

The census also showed Britain is an increasingly integrated society.

Nearly one in eight households contain people who are from different ethnic backgrounds.

While 88 per cent of homes, or 16.1million, are made up people of the same race and culture, some 2.3million, 12 per cent, are mixed.
