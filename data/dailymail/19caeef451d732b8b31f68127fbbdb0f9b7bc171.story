The uber-tanned and artificially enhanced cast of scripted reality show The Only Way Is Essex have made false nails, glue-on 
eyelashes and fake tan their own.

But according to the latest research, it is actually the ladies of Liverpool who wear more make-up than anyone else in the UK.

Researchers found one in ten women in the city, which is home to Coleen Rooney and Abbey Crouch, said they adopted a 'nice and thick' approach to applying make-up.

It also emerged that they spend 20 minutes making themselves up on a typical morning, and then a further eight minutes removing it at the end the day.

Scouse style: One in ten women in the city, which is home to Coleen Rooney and Abbey Crouch, said they adopted a 'nice and thick' approach to applying make-up

That tots up to the equivalent of more than seven days putting on and removing make-up every year.

Scouse girls typically need at least two make-up wipes to remove their war paint every day, or 730 over the course of a year, the research found.

The poll found 45 per cent of girls from Liverpool have regularly gone to bed with a full face of make-up and a third of those have kept it on for the next day after a quick touch-up.

Girls from London and Newcastle were more likely to don false eyelashes and Manchester females wear the most fake tan.

The study also revealed more than one third of those polled said northerners were most likely to wear more make-up.

By contrast, girls from Plymouth, Norwich and Oxford we more likely to opt for a simple, classic look.

Wipe it off: Scouse girls typically need at least two make-up wipes to remove their war paint every day and it's women from Swansea, like Catherine Zeta Jones, who are most concerned about their skin

The poll also found women from the Welsh city of Swansea were the most worried about the amount of make-up they wear and the effect it has on their skin.

Celebrity make-up artist Caroline Frazer said: 'Make-up trends come and go just as they do with fashion or hairstyles.

'Some seasons the subtle, natural look is favoured, but on other occasions a more heavy, dramatic look like this season's red lips, fuller lashes and bright eye shadows.

'There is nothing wrong with wearing make-up, as long as it is removed properly to ensure it doesn't block pores or make skin look dull and lack luster. It's equally important to create the right canvas so make-up looks its best which some women forget.

'Great make-up isn't just about applying it well; it's also about looking after your skin so a healthier complexion shines through.

Concerned: The study also found 25 per cent of all women worry about the amount of make-up they wear and believe they could be suffocating their skin

'We are all guilty of occasionally going to bed with make-up still on, but it's really important not to do this regularly as it will take its toll on the skin.'

The study also found 25 per cent of all women worry about the amount of make-up they wear and believe they could be suffocating their skin.

To try and counteract this three quarters of women like to have a break at least once a week from wearing make-up.

Of the women polled by skincare brand Simple, more than half said that women who wear a lot of make-up are trying too hard and 34 per cent said they are hiding who they really are.

In contrast more than one in 20 felt they should wear more make-up to get ahead in their career.

Which is probably the reason why eight in ten women insist on applying make-up before they head to the office.

Half of women said they look 100 times better after they have applied make-up and 56 per cent said just a touch of make-up covers any blemishes.

Caroline Frazer added: 'It's encouraging that women give their skin a bit of a break from make-up.

'Whilst make-up will create a cover for blemishes it won't help skin in the long run, especially if you are prone to problem or sensitive skin.

Name and shame: The poll named and shamed glamour girl Katie Price as having the worst make-up and Harry Potter starlet Emma Watson as the best

'There is no excuse to not look after your skin, it's your insurance policy for the future - you only have one skin so look after it.'
