Motorists were attacked with rocks along a busy A-road after a group of yobs smashed through several car windows.

Police are searching for the culprits who damaged 12 vehicles, with a helicopter flying over the motorway were the crimes took place.

The group carried out the attack as cars were driving along the a road near Rawreth in Essex, just weeks after a similar incident on the A14 in Suffolk.

Through the looking glass: Paul Harvey's car window was smashed by yobs throwing rocks along the A1245

Paul Harvey, 41, who was driving along the A1245 - formerly the A130, had the passenger window of his Land Rover caved in, believes it was sheer luck no-one was killed or seriously injured.

He said: 'I just can’t believe anyone would do something like this. I was lucky it wasn’t my front windscreen. 

'There were cars travelling at 60 or 70 mph and it was a busy time of night, this could have easily caused a major accident.'

Mr Harvey believes the culprits may have been hiding in the trees by the side of the road on Wednesday when the incident took place.

He added: 'It was lucky I was in the car on my own, if someone had been in the passenger seat I dread to think what would have happened. 

'The window imploded all the way over to my side of the car. Whatever hit it must have been quite large.'

In fact the impact was so that it also dented a rear door of his car.

Mr Harvey, who lives in Rawreth, said: 'I was just on the way to see my brother when it happened, on the way back I saw police had pulled over a lot of cars outside the Gables car showroom and the police helicopter was out too. 

'They were taking statements and all the cars looked like they’d had something thrown at them. There was one guy taping up his van and there were piles of glass on the road.'

Police had to comfort and interview shaken-up victims who pulled into a car park of Gables Cars, near the Carpenters Arms. 

Meanwhile the police helicopter searched in vain for the culprits.

Police believe a young gang was responsible - and want parents to help them bring these young offenders to justice. 

Officers are also keen to prevent it happening again and leading to another high profile incident like the one on the A12 where a woman was left seriously injured by a falling concrete block. 

Sgt Chris Bramhill, of Rayleigh police, believes there must be parents out there who suspect their youngsters may have been involved. 

He said: 'We would urge parents to know where their children are and who they are with, especially at night. 

'Even more so if they are on the side of a busy road where they could be at risk, or in this case, posing a risk to others.'

Police have so far received 12 official reports of damaged cars on the old A130 - and are yet to get full details of all the damage caused.

But they are prepared for more motorists to come forward, wondering how their car has been damaged. 

Others may have heard a bump, but did not realise that it was due to louts playing a very dangerous game. 

Chris Black, Rochford district councillor for the Rawreth ward, added: 'Words almost fail me. It’s a stupid, dangerous thing to do. It’s important for parents to know what their children are doing.

'I can’t understand the mentality of somebody who wants to throw rocks at cars at Christmas time or any other time of the year. 

'I just hope everybody’s okay and I hope the police will be patrolling the area very carefully.'
