I have heard that Chelsea right back Branislav Ivanovic can lift other players above his head in the gym. He likes to be the strongman and he likes to express that in games. His physique is more akin to a centre half, but he’s become one of the best right backs we’ve ever seen.

Take a look at full backs playing today; they are becoming more dainty. Pablo Zabaleta, Kyle Walker and Nathaniel Clyne are quick and direct, but they’re not powerhouses.

Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic has become one of the best right backs we’ve ever seen

They need to be quick to get up and down the flank. But Ivanovic is like a tank; everything bounces off him and he fires missiles too.

A defender, by nature, is always very reliable in his performance but when he starts scoring too you start regarding him as really special.

Lauren was like that at Arsenal. When we seemed pushed into a corner; when we were in trouble in games, he could come up with something.

Defenders are usually tough and switched on at the back. When they go beyond that, they get out of their comfort zone. Ivanovic is happy to do that time and again, producing big moments when they are most needed.

His build sets him apart from other decent right backs of the Premier League era such as Gary Neville and Lee Dixon.

Ivanovic is a danger man, producing big moments and scoring important goals

Neville was a leader at Manchester United and he set an example by his performances on the pitch. Dixon was also strong and consistent.

But Ivanovic matches them defensively and is much better going forward. Not in the conventional way that some fast full-backs are great at dribbling down the flank and getting in crosses.

You won’t see Ivanovic beat a man with a bit of skill or glide past someone on the wing, but then you won’t see him get beaten either, however fast the opposition player is. No, when Ivanovic gets in that penalty box he is a bull.

He charges around, thrashing out at opponents and muscling them aside to make space. From set-pieces he’s difficult to get hold of.

He gets into dangerous positions and when he gets the better of an opponent he punishes them. 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho sees a lot of himself in Ivanovic

Jose Mourinho would look at him more than anyone else at Chelsea and say: ‘That’s me on the pitch.’  We all saw his bloodied white boot after the League Cup semi-final win against Liverpool.

Mourinho said he had the mentality of a champion after he headed the winner. A manager wants steely determination in his players — and Ivanovic is the epitome of that.

When you’re in trouble he is the sort you want with you, fighting for the cause. While Mourinho creates that them-versus-us mentality around the club, which he likes to do, Ivanovic is his general on the field.

Ivanovic has made a massive contribution to Chelsea since £9m arrival from Locomotiv Moscow in 2008

Since Ivanovic signed from Locomotiv Moscow for £9million — a steal — in January 2008 he has played 202 Premier League games, crunched 423 tackles, made 309 interceptions and booted away 976 clearances. On top of that he’s weighed in with 19 goals -— crucial ones included.

His only weakness, I find, is he can get caught up in the strongarm tactics at times.

We saw him explode against Everton and clash with James McCarthy, putting his arms around his neck and pushing his head into him. He escaped punishment for that, but he won’t always get away with them. It could cost him bookings and suspensions.

Ivanovic is becoming irreplaceable in that Chelsea team and they can ill afford to lose him.
