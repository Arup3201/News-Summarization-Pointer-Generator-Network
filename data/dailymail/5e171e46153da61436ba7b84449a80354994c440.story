Investigators believe they have finally solved the mysterious murder of a California woman almost 25 years to the day her body was found wrapped in a quilt at San Jose International Airport.

Cathy Zimmer’s remains were found March 10, 1989, and it took until this week for husband David Zimmer, 66, and his brother Robert Zimmer, 69, to be charged with murder. The slain woman's husband had made about $400,000 off life insurance and a home sale shortly after her death, but investigators were unable to implicate him until now.

The arrests came only weeks after authorities released pictures of Cathy Zimmer and the colourful patchwork quilt she was covered in after being strangled to death, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

‘Cathy Zimmer was slain two and a half decades ago, but her family has never forgotten her,’ prosecutor Ted Kajani said last month in a prepared statement, according to KTVU. ‘We, too, have never forgotten her.’

The two men were both arrested within the last week and charged with first-degree-murder, officials said.

Initial evidence pointed to at least Robert Zimmer being involved, his DNA was found on an ‘intimate’ area of the murdered woman’s clothes, investigators said.

The brother-in-law insisted all along he did not have a physical relationship with the 38-year-old, but investigators kept pursuing his guilt.

The couple was in the middle of a divorce and her soon-to-be ex-husband mysteriously cashed two life insurance policies worth $183,000 before selling their home for $225,000 shortly after her death at only 38-years-old, according to KTVU.

They had two teenaged children when she disappeared after driving her children to school and failing to show for an eye appointment later that afternoon, KTVU reported.

Police found her car parked in the airport’s short-term lot two days later, her body was wrapped in the blanket and stashed in the backseat.

Robert Zimmer’s daughter Paula recalled in 2010 to investigators that his father obsessed over his fingerprints being found in her car as police combed it for evidence in the days after the discovery.

He insisted he never had any type of personal or sexual relationship with Cindy Zimmer, but could not recall if he was ever alone in a car with her, authorities said.

It now appears he was much more involved with the slain woman than he was willing to admit, and officials think they have found her killers.

‘When I reinstated the cold case unit to assist county law enforcement with the investigation of unsolved homicides and sexual assaults, it was these kinds of arrests that I had in mind,’ district attorney Jeff Rosen told the Mercury News.

‘We do not forget victims, nor do we ever give up on justice.’
