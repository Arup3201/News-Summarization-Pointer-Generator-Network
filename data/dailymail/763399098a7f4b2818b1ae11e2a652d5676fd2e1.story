Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. 

A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. 

The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. 

Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.

In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. 

Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006.

Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off.

But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording.

The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children.

According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past.

In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. 

The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. 

In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.'

In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. 

Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. 

He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk. 

Authorities are currently in the process of extraditing Durst from New Orleans to Los Angeles where the most recent charges were filed.
