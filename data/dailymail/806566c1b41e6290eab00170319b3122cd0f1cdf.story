Peter 
Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell Estate Agents, said: 'Indian 
investment in luxury property in London goes back to the Edwardian era.

'This
 was when some of India’s richest Princes owned mansions in the capital,
 most notably HEH The Nizam of Hyderabad who owned Hyderabad House at 
No.6 Palace Green in Kensington and purchased properties for his family 
in Mayfair and Belgravia.

'In
 more recent times in 1972 Idi Amin ordered the expulsion of Uganda’s 
Indian business community from the country, and some 27,200 people 
emigrated to Britain, with the wealthiest families buying homes in 
Mayfair, St Johns Wood and Holland Park.'

Flemings Hotel is owned by the Veladail Hotels Group, headed by Satinder Gulhati.

The Washington Hotel on Curzon Street is understood to be owned by the Sanga family and The May Fair Hotel is believed to be owned by Jasminder Singh of the Radisson Group.

Mr Wetherell added: 'The British and international based Indian business community are extremely successful and adroit.

'Many have chosen to invest in Mayfair, especially in Grosvenor Square, because they can see that currently the district is undervalued compared to neighbouring locations such as Knightsbridge and Belgravia.

'There has been a spectacular 314 per 
cent rise in sales values in Grosvenor Square since 2000, surpassing 
rivals such as Eaton Square and Cadogan Square.

'Just
 a decade ago, prices and pounds per square foot values in Grosvenor 
Square lagged behind rivals such as Eaton and Cadogan squares.

'Ten
 years on, the picture is very different and now values in Grosvenor 
Square have surpassed those in Eaton and Cadogan Square with a thrilling
 portfolio of £5,000 per sq/ft plus developments in housing stock 
underway.'
