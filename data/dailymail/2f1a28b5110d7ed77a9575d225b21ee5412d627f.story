A man has been charged with the murder of a young pilot found dead in his flat in Edinburgh.

Darren McLauchlan, 23, appeared before Edinbugh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of former RAF pilot Steven Barrett, 27, who was found dead at his flat in the Scottish capital in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Mr Barrett, who was originally from Cardiff but was working out of Edinburgh Airport as a first officer for budget airline Flybe, has been described as 'fun, life-loving and mischievous' character.

A spokesman for his family said: 'We have all been left utterly devastated and are still in complete shock following Steven's death.

'Steven was a wonderful and loving brother, son and grandson. His kindness and love of life were apparent to anyone he met and no one ever had a bad word to say about him.

'He was always there for his family and friends and lit up the world of everyone he knew.'

Mr Barrett's brother Stuart wrote a 
heart-rending tribute to him on Facebook, saying: 'My heart is breaking 
for the loss of my beautiful boy. Taken from us all. My amazing hero, 
love you so much.

'Our lives have been ripped apart and nothing will fill the void he has left behind. We love you very much Steve and you will live on in our hearts and memories.'

Goodnight and god bless you my wonderful boy, all my love, your heartbroken little brother.'

Mr Barrett's cousin Chloe Richards wrote: 'You will be forever missed and forever in our hearts.

'Wish I could have told you how much I look up to you and how much I love you, I love you Steven and you will always be the twinkle in everybody's eye.'

The circumstances of the pilot's death are not yet clear.

Mr Barrett, known to his friends in his home village of Kenfig Hill as 'Baz', had wanted to be a pilot from an early age, and was a teenage cadet with Rumney Squadron Air Training Corps in Cardiff.

A spokesman for the group said: 'Thoughts go out the family of ex-cadet Steven 'Baz' Barrett at this tragic time.

'Many people who met him will have many stories to share and all of what a fun, life-loving, mischievous and committed character he was.

'We can't help but be touched at the loss of one of our own.'

Arrest: Mr Barrett, 27, was found dead at a flat in Lochend Butterfly Way, Edinburgh, in the early hours of Saturday morning

A spokesman for Rest Bay Lifeguards in South Wales, where Mr Barrett volunteered in his youth, said: 'We've received some very sad news that one of our former members Steven Barrett has died following an incident in Edinburgh.

'Steven was a member in our junior section for several years. He went on to achieve his dream and worked as a pilot. Our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time.'

Mr Barrett left Swansea University in 2007 to join the RAF, where he learned to fly Hawks and won an award for being pilot of the year.

He graduated from their flying training centre in Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire, in 2009 and went on to serve his country for over two years before being made redundant in military cuts.

He then retrained to become a commercial airline pilot at a special school in Jerez de la Frontera in Spain.

A spokesman for the company that runs the course, Flight Training Europe, said Mr Barrett had 'excelled' throughout.

'Steven was a former RAF cadet,' the spokesman said.

'He joined us after they were forced to make compulsory redundancies due to the British government's financial cutbacks.

'Steven excelled throughout the course, completed his training and went on to join Flybe.'

Tragic: Police arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with the pilot's death, he was due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriffs' Court today

'So unbelievably tragic': Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to Mr Barrett, known as Baz, on Facebook

Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to the rugby and Formula One racing fan on Facebook.

Jay Pugh posted: 'Steven did everything he set out to do in his life, he was one of my closest, and best friends - Steven I will truly miss you.'

Another friend, Leigh Jameson, wrote: 'The world will be a quieter place without you. You will be sorely missed by all. Rest In Peace Steven.'

Scott Edmed, who served alongside the pilot in the forces, said: 'RIP Steven, I always looked up to you in the RAF and so glad I met you.'

Air stewardess Caitlin Laird wrote: 'My thoughts are with Steven's family and friends. So unbelievably tragic. Rest in peace.'

A Flybe spokesman said: 'Our thoughts and sympathies are with Steven's family at this tragic and very sad time. Steven was a respected member of our team and will be missed by all those who worked with him.'

Today Darren McLauchlan appeared on petition at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday charged with the murder of Mr Barrett.

McLauchlan made a brief appearance in private before Sheriff Paul Arthurson QC.  No plea or declaration was made on his behalf and the case was continued for further inquiry.  McLauchlan was remanded in custody.
