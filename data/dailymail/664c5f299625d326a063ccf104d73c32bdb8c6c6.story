Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull have tweeted a selfie ahead their appearance at the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday.

The du are set to take the stage at the Sao Paulo arena to perform the World Cup official song 'We Are One (Ola Ola)'.

JLo had pulled out of the event as recently as last weekend, but the backlash was so intense that she performed a dramatic late U-Turn.

U-turn: Jennifer Lopez is now set to perform at the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday

Lopez is thought to have needed a break after her split from 27-year-old choreographer Casper Smart, which was announced Friday.

But it appears now that all is well, and the performance will now, thankfully, go ahead as originally planned.

The 20th World Cup is set to begin on Thursday in Sao Paulo, with hosts Brazil taking on Croatia in the opening game.

Back in business: Lopez is understood to be keen to promote her new album which is released next week
