After Seydou Doumbia's double left Manchester City reeling on Wednesday night, their Champions League hopes are hanging by a thread.

Manuel Pellegrini insists that his team will keep fighting while their is still a mathematical possibility of qualification, but with just two points from four games, it looks a remote possibility.

However, City can take hope from history - there have been two occasions where teams have made it out of the group from a similarly difficult position.

In the 2004-05 season Porto, coming into the tournament as reigning champions, had a shocking start to their defence.

After being held to a stalemate at home to CSKA Moscow in their first game, Porto went down 3-1 to their former manager Jose Mourinho, in his first season at Chelsea, with John Terry and Didier Drogba both on the scoresheet.

And while Chelsea went on to dominate the group, the holders suffered a defeat to PSG in Paris, and were again scoreless at home in the return leg.

After four games the Portuguese side had scored just one goal, and picked up two points - their attempt to retain the trophy looked all but over.

But, with Benni McCarthy leading the line, Victor Fernandez's side bounced back, beating CSKA 1-0 and then Chelsea 2-1 to finish with eight points, one ahead of the Russians.

The last 16 was not quite so kind to Porto, who lost 4-2 on aggregate to Inter.

Even more impressive than the Portuguese side's feat is that of Lokomotiv Moscow three years earlier. 

When Frank de Boer scored for Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Matchday four, Lokomotiv had just a solitary point from four games.

But the Russian side upset the odds by winning away to Galatasaray and then completed the comeback by beating Club Brugge 2-0.

In the end, despite their terrible start, Lokomotiv qualified relatively comfortably, two points ahead of the Belgians, although they would go on to pick up just one point from their six games in the second group stage.

While City can seek encouragement from these two examples from the continent, there is also one recovery from closer to home they might want to take as inspiration. 

In 2002 Bobby Robson's Newcastle looked down and out after four games, despite having just seen off Juventus.

The English club knew they needed maximum points from their final two games - as City do now - and showed resilience and quality to beat Dynamo Kiev and Feyenoord.

It's a lesson that Pellegrini is determined to learn. As the Chilean put it on Wednesday: 'You can never imagine you are out when the maths says you are still in.'
