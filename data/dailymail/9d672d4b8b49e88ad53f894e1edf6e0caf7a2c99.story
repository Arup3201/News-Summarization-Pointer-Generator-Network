It looks just like that speeder chase on the Forest Moon of Endor... if you squint really, really hard.

In fact it's a stunt by hardcore drone-owners, who have emulated their favourite Star Wars scene by racing £150 quadcopters through the woods.

The group of men - and they do seem to be mostly men - wear goggle-mounted monitors as they race radio-controlled machines at up to 70mph near their homes in the French Alps.

On your marks: Drone enthusiasts have emulated Star Wars by racing £150 quadcopters through the woods

Assault course: Unlike the Forest Moon of Endor, hairpin bends are clearly marked with red tape and arrows

Spot the difference: The real scene in Return of the Jedi was a bit more high-octane - with more (primitive) CGI

They claim the exhilarating sport is Formula 1 for the 21st Century, allowing them to blur the effect of a video game and a real life race.

It is carefully modelled on one of the climactic scenes in the 1983 hit Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, when Luke Skywalker whizzes through the woods in a bid to stop stormtroopers from sounding the alarm.

There are a few crucial differences.

The course is marked out with red-and-white tape and plastic tree-mounted arrows, so the fiery crashes are less likely.

And instead of using the force, the enthusiasts see through a front-mounted camera while another films the experience for a highlights clip.

But the members of AIRgonay, a group of 60 radio-controlled flying machine hobbyists who live in Argonay, southern France, insist theirs is still an adrenaline-junkie's sport.  

Event: The drone enthusiasts in the French Alps meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz through the woods

They meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz around the woodland, and insist their high-speed drones rarely break down despite the pressure they're placed under.

Group founder Herve Pellarin, 44, said: 'When we first started there were a lot of broken drones.

'It takes some practice to fly them - even now there are a few crashes whenever several drones round a tight corner. But the drones are very light so they don't break easily and can take a fall quite well.'

The smartphone app designer added: 'When me and my friends first started chasing each others' drones around I thought to myself "wow, this is just like Star Wars" - especially when we're in the woods.

'I used to be a champion skateboarder, but an injury meant I had to stop.

'I'm addicted to adrenaline, and drone racing gives me a chance to get some excitement. Flying through the woods at super speed is pretty thrilling.

Quadcopter: The contraptions, with front-mounted cameras, are capable of reaching top speeds of 70mph

Woodland: The men insist there are fewer fiery high-speed crashes into trees than in the 1983 blockbuster

Cheap: Despite their advanced technology, the racers insist their £150 contraptions are very affordable

'I found a piece of forest and I negotiated with the council to let us fly there on weekday lunchtimes. All of us leave work and meet up for a race over lunch.'

Each quadcopter has two cameras mounted on the front - one to relay the video to a pair of goggles which acts as monitor, and another to record the flight. 

Mr Pellarin said he hopes the sport will become popular all over the world.

'Drone racing is a new motorsport for the 21st century,' he said. 'We would like people to set up their own quadcopter clubs and events. I would love it if there was a league.

'The sport is so representative of the time we live in. It uses state-of-the-art technology.'
