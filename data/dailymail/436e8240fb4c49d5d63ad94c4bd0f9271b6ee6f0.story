It was a hilarious but expletive-filled Bushtucker Trial for viewers of ITV's 'I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here' on Monday evening after Jimmy Bullard was elected by viewers to take on the eerily named Tunnel of Terror.

Before the challenge, Bullard's fellow camp-mate and former World Superbike champion Carl Fogarty joked 'if he comes back with nothing I'll kick his head in'.

Arriving at a clearing to find out his fate, the former Wigan and Fulham midfielder was instructed by presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly that he must descend a ladder into a dimly lit underwater tunnel.

What awaited was a narrow perspex corridor containing five separate tanks filled with various creatures.

Bullard was told he would be given 10 minutes to collect the six available stars.

Spending three of the 10 available minutes in the first compartment, which contained water dragons, Bullard was finding it particularly hard to keep his language clean.

Moving apprehensively through each part of the task, Bullard was confronted by numerous eels, crocodiles, crustaceans and finally water pythons. 

It was the final stage where Bullard's language was its most colourful, when he was met by one particularly defensive reptile that lunged towards him.

After a speedy exit from the tunnel following his trial, Bullard had amassed four stars and was given the choice to convert them into meals or forfeit them to release someone from so-called Celebrity Slammer.

It was a tough decision, but the former footballer chose to release 'Allo 'Allo star Vicki Michelle from the pretend prison.

Speaking about witnessing the trial presenter Ant McPartlin said: 'I haven't laughed so much in ages'.
