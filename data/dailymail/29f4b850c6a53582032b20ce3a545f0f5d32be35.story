Doncaster are chasing former Manchester City midfielder Abdul Razak.

The 22-year-old is currently playing for Greek side OFI Crete, who are managed by Gennaro Gattuso.

But Rovers boss Paul Dickov is keen on bringing Razak back to England this month.

The midfielder, who has five caps for Ivory Coast, came through the ranks at City - making five first-team appearances before leaving for Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013.

He joined West Ham last January but left without playing a game for the club.
