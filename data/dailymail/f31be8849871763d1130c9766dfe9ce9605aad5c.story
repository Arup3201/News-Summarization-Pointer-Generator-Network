A selfie stick and snowboard might seem like a recipe for disaster but one thrill-seeker decided to test the combination for himself.

David M, 18, took his camera holder down a slope in Kopaonik, Serbia, to film himself in action.

Footage shows the extreme sportsman bombing it down a slope before losing his balance and tumbling forwards headfirst into the snow. The crash occurred just four seconds in.

The camera swivels to the sky as David rolls to the ground.

Luckily, he escaped the incident unscathed. After the fall, he is seen swiftly getting up with the selfie stick in his hand.

He then gives a jubilant cry out to the camera. 

Some viewers have advised David to get a camera attached to his helmet for next time. 

However, he says he's confident of his skills, as his love of snowboarding started when he was just eight years old.
