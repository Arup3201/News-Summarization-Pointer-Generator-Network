Researchers conducting a scan on the brain of a deceased soccer player have detected signs of a brain trauma disease believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head.

The test results mark the first time that Chronic Traumatic Encephalopahty (CTE) has been linked to the game of soccer, which until now has been considered safer than contacts sports like football or hockey.

Patrick Grange, of New Mexico, died at age 29 from complications associated with his ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

Lifelong player: Patrick's parents said he had started heading balls at age 3 and had sustained several concussions over the years, beginning when he was a toddler

Grange played soccer in college and later at the Premier Development League in Chicago, the New York Times reported.

Experts from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System said that on a scale of 1 to 4, his CTE was at stage 2 at the time of his death.

According to information from Boston University's CTE Center, the condition is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma, including concussions and blows to the head not accompanied by obvious symptoms. 

CTE has been known to affect boxers 
since the 1920s, but in recent years, a protein associated with the 
illness has been showing up in posthumous brain scans of athletes from a
 wide range of disciplines.

Risky practice: While soccer players do not usually tackle one another, it is standard practice in the sport to head the ball - something that Grange enjoyed doing

Patients suffering from CTE tend to be impulsive, forgetful, experience bouts of depression and can have suicidal thoughts.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia.

Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later.

According to experts, while soccer players do not usually tackle one another, it is standard practice in the sport to head the ball - something that Grange enjoyed doing.

It is especially common during practice for players to bounce the ball on their heads over and over again. 

Mike and Michele Grange told the paper that their son had started heading the ball at age 3. In the course of his short life, the athlete, who aspired to play in the MLS, took some hard knocks to the head resulting in concussions beginning from the time he was a toddler.

'He had very extensive frontal lobe damage,' Dr. Ann McKee, the neuropathologist who performed the brain scan on Grange. 'We have seen other athletes in their 20s with this level of pathology, but they’ve usually been football players.'

According to a published study that surveyed amateur soccer players in their 30s, the more they headed the ball over the course of a year, the more likely they were to show signs of brain damage and inflammations in MRI tests.

The study by researchers at Yeshiva University’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine revealed that players who struck the ball with their head between 885 times and 1,550 times a year had ‘brain abnormalities,’ and players with more than 1,800 headers had lower memory scores compared to those who headed the ball less often.

Researchers have suggested that repeated hits to the head may have caused Grange to develop CTE and resulted in an ALS diagnosis at age 27 - even though most people who suffer from the illness are between 40-70 years old.

Six months after learning his fate, the once-robust, strapping athlete was wheelchair-bound and inching ever closer to paralysis. He died less than a year later.

The news comes just two months after Cincinnati Reds baseball star Ryan Freel, who killed himself at age 36 after years of mental instability, was posthumously diagnosed with CTE.

Freel, who was famously taken off the field by ambulance in May 2007 after colliding with an opponent's elbow, became the first baseball player diagnosed with CTE.
