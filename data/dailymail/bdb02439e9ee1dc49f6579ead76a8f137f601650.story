A police officer accused of plotting to cook and eat women has demanded that prosecutors give him the names of 20 other suspected cannibals.

Gilberto Valle, who served with the NYPD, insisted he needed to contact the alleged criminals to prepare his defence, because he was accused of being in league with them.

Police apparently have 'hundreds of thousands of e-mail and instant-message communications in which Mr Valle and others talked about their violent sexual fantasies.'

'Sick discussions': Gilberto Valle, who served with the NYPD, says he needs to contact others with whom he engaged in perverted online chats to prepare his defence

Hearing: Valle's defence lawyers have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ¿victims¿ are women who the FBI have established did know him

However, prosecutors have so far identified only three of the 20-plus alleged perverts Valle chatted with as potential 'co-conspirators'.

This does leave open the possibility that there may be more, according to the Manhattan federal court filing seen by the New York Post.

The three are identified in court papers as Michael Vanhise, 'Moody Blues' and 'Ali Khan.'

Public defender Julia Gatto wrote: 'Three weeks before trial, the defence needs to firmly know the identity of Mr Valle’s alleged co-conspirators so that it can conduct its pre-trial investigation.

'Indeed, effective trial preparation could uncover facts critical to Mr Valle’s defence in that the individuals with whom Mr Valle was chatting likely will corroborate that they were engaging in fantasy role play with no intention of acting on their fantasies.'

Police declined to comment.

Gilberto and his estranged wife Kathleen Cooke Mangan, 28. It was Kathleen's discoveries on Valle's computer that led FBI agents to her husband

Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan, 28, tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and consume 100 female victims.

Files found on the father of one’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent.

Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’.

In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator.

His defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer, who served in Harlem for six years.

Valle plead not guilty to all charges, including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims.

He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
