Storms rolled in from the south, bringing with it 100km/h winds, torrential rain and hail across much of the city.

Wind gusts of more than 100km/h took down power lines across the city. 

The storm caused chaos in the city, with train services disrupted by lightning strikes. 

Crowds of people soaking up some sun at Bondi Beach were forced to abandon the sand and head for cover when the storm hit.
