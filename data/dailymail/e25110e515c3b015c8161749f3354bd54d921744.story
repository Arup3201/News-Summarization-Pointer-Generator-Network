A humble bungalow which a family bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago has been turned into a luxury holiday home worth £5million.

Dr Edward Andreae paid just £40,000 in today's money for the home on Dorset's Sandbanks peninsula, an exposed spit in Poole Harbour which many people feared would be too unstable to live on.

But the home soared in value as the tiny enclave's popularity soared, becoming what is now the fourth most expensive property hotspot in the world.

The way we were: This is the humble bungalow bought for just £1,000 in the 1920s on the prime Sandbanks peninsula in Dorset. The site is now worth £5million

Luxury: The bungalow, bought by the current owner's great-grandfather, was demolished and replaced with this luxury seven-bedroom house which is let out to holidaymakers for £4,000 a week. Owner Tim Baldwin said he will bring his 10-month-old daughter to the house to have the same experiences he did as a child

History: The peninsula and its modest huts around 100 years ago in a postcard. Tim Baldwin's great-grandfather bought his bungalow for just £1,000 in the 1920s

Idyll: The approximate location of the house on the peninsula, whose millionaire residents include QPR manager Harry Redknapp and Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis

Desirable: Houses began to be built on the spit in the late 1800s, but the current boom only took off in the 1960s. Pictured: A plan of the area from 1896

The bolthole was passed down through four generations of the same family until it fell into a state of disrepair.

In
 2011 Dr Andreae’s great-grandson, Tim Baldwin, and his father Jonathan,
 made the drastic decision to demolish the 90-year-old home and erect a 
new one in its place.

They 
spent £580,000 creating a luxurious beachfront house that is now worth 
5,000 times (500,000 per cent) more than the original holiday home.

The two-storey property, named Hook Sands after the old bungalow, has seven bedrooms and five bathrooms.

It is clad in larch wood, powered by solar panels and has a garden that backs onto the beach.

Interior
 designer Mr Baldwin, 33, from Bath, rents the house to holidaymakers 
from April to October each year for up to £4,100 a week.

He
 said: 'For the last 90 years the bungalow has been in my family. It was
 originally purchased by my great grandfather, so that there was a place
 that everyone could go on holiday together.

Bolthole: The luxury home is now available to rent for up to £4,000 a week - four times more than the amount the plot was originally bought for in the 1920s

Luxurious: Sandbanks, a spit measuring less than half a square mile and jutting into Poole Harbour, has the fourth-highest land value in the world

Pristine: But many people were unwilling to move into homes on the peninsula in the early 1900s because they were concerned about the stability of the land

'It was a much loved place and I have good memories of spending every summer there as a child, and it wasn’t for a long time that I had a holiday abroad.

'It has been passed through my family and over the years it has had various additions and alterations and was rather like patch work.

'There was no central heating in the bungalow which was difficult in the colder months and we wanted a house that could be used year round.

“We decided that instead of trying to fix the various problems that there were with the house, that we should take it to the ground and build it back up.

'It was a very special place to me and when the bulldozers came in and the house came down I thought I would be a lot sadder, but it’s all about the location and the views.

'We wanted to create a contemporary house that was going to last for another 100 years.

'I’m really looking forward to taking my daughter, who is 10 months old, to the property for holidays so she can do the same things I did as a child.'

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not always such
 a popular place to live.

Luxurious: Sandbanks as the area is today. Last month an old bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 elsewhere went on the market for £2.25million

£1,000 was a common sale price for houses there despite the average price of a five-bed family home being more than double that (£2,074) in 1930. Even a three-bed semi was more expensive at £1,192.

Only in a property boom in the 1960s did the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions.

Sandbanks is home to QPR manager Harry Redknapp, Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis and computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden.

Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million.

And in March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down.

Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made Estate 
Agents, said: 'If this property was to come onto the market we would 
look to market it at circa five million pounds.

'A lot of the plots in Sandbanks were purchased for less than 1,000 pounds in the early 1900s.'
