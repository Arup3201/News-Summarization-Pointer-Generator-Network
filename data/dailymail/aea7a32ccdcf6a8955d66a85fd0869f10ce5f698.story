David Cameron likened Russia’s actions in Ukraine to those of Nazi Germany yesterday, as he prepared for a tense showdown with Vladimir Putin.

The Prime Minister will use talks with the Russian president in Australia today to warn him he faces more sanctions and isolation from the West unless he stops trying to destabilise Ukraine.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Australian prime minister Tony Abbott in Canberra yesterday, Mr Cameron drew a direct comparison between Russia’s actions and the Nazi aggression that sparked the Second World War.

‘Russia’s action in Ukraine is unacceptable,’ he said. ‘We have to be clear what we are dealing with. It is a large state bullying a smaller state in Europe.

‘We have seen the consequences in the past and we should learn the lessons.’

Mr Cameron said there was no ‘military solution’ to the Ukraine conflict. But he said Western sanctions were beginning to bite on Russia’s crippled economy – and warned they would be stepped up unless Mr Putin backed down.

He added: ‘I would still hope that Russia will see sense and allow Ukraine to develop as a free country.

‘If they do not then the relationship that Britain and the EU have with Russia will be very different. Russia needs to know that this can’t be like what happened in the past with other frozen conflicts where the world moved on. I don’t think the world can move on from what’s happened in Ukraine.’

His comments echo those made by Prince Charles on his tour of Canada this year. Mr Cameron also mocked Mr Putin for sending warships to Australia where world leaders are at the G20 summit.

It has caused consternation in Australia, with the Navy sending three warships of its own to the region in response.

But Mr Cameron told reporters: ‘I didn’t feel it necessary to bring a warship myself to keep myself safe at this G20, and I’m sure that Putin won’t be in any danger.’
