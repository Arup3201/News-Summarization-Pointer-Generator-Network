From a curved design to faster processors, Samsung has been teasing upcoming features of its next Galaxy phone for weeks.

And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. 

Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip.

'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.'

The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. 

Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display.

Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. 

It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera.

More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. 

The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides.

The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. 

And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. 

However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode. 

The use of the plural  'smartphones' in Samsung's latest blog post adds weight to these claims. 

Elsewhere, this post heavily implies the devices will have wireless charging built in. 

Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March.

These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides.   

Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens.

Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them. 

Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. 

This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers.

There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). 

Samsung is a member of all three groups. 

This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. 

However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. 

The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard.

Samsung's next Galaxy phones are, however, expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built-in chip. 

This means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks.

It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology.

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. 

The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it.

The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.

The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.

Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year.

Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. 

The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. 

The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi.

He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third.  

The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 (pictured) already offers this feature. But the 920 runs on just one of the three standards. A chip that supports multiple standards was released last year, and the S6 is likely to be the first handset to feature this technology

Adding the technology to the S6 and S6 Edge will make Samsung's phones more versatile and be able to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks. It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology (Apple's iPhone 5S, 6 and 6 Plus are pictured)

Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart.

'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts.

In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.

The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.

It explains how 2015 is set to be a 'landmark year' for wireless charging

@highlight

The majority of wireless charging is currently done using accessories

@highlight

These include cases and clips fitted with different types of charging chips

@highlight

Developments mean multiple types can now be added to the same chip

And Samsung is expected to introduce this chip into its S6 and S6 Edge
