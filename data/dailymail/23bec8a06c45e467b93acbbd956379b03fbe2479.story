Peter Crouch has poked fun at FIFA in the wake of the report into World Cup corruption by revealing he was sure of 'problems' at football's governing body after being omitted from the Ballon d'Or shortlist.

FIFA have come in for criticism after findings of an investigation into the World Cup bidding process for 2018 and 2022 only found fault with the losing bids, including England's.

And now Stoke striker Crouch has taken a jibe at the organisation by suggesting corruption within FIFA is to blame for his failure to be selected alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to be in with a shot of winning football's top individual prize.

'I knew there was problems with decision making at FIFA when I didn't make the ballon d'Or shortlist,' the 33-year-old Tweeted. 

The joke went down well with the former England international's 40,000 followers and the Tweet received almost 12,000 Retweets in its first few hours.

Stoke responded to Crouch's disappointment at missing out on the award by rewarding the striker with his very own custom trophy.

'We were shocked too... So, we have got you a special 'Crouch-on d'Or' waiting for you in the office!'
