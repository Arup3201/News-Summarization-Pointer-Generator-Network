Dogged: Officer David Anthony Pitt, who shot a dog and kept its owner from going to the vet, has resigned

A Georgia officer who gunned down a dog and then threatened to 
arrest his owner for trying to bring it to the vet has resigned.

Dog lovers from Georgia and across the country put pressure on Officer David Anthony Pitts, who shot a German Shepherd named Doctor last Thursday.

'I
 had calls over the weekend from Los Angeles and Utah from people who 
were concerned about the case,' Dekalb County Police Chief James Conroy told the Atlantic Journal-Constitution.

Conroy said he accepted Pitts's resignation - though he had not requested it.

The tragic encounter between nine-year-old Doctor and Pitts happened as Pitts was responding to a 
false alarm at the home of the owner Tim Theall.

Doctor
 ran into Theall's front yard and startled Pitts, who shot the dog in 
the jaw and then forced Theall to wait until other officers arrived, 
going as far as blocking Theall's driveway with his patrol car, Theall said.

'Doctor just laid down on my lap and started to die while we waited for the officer’s boss to come and run the procedures,' Theall told KTVU.

After other officers arrived to photograph the scene, Theall was allowed to bring Doctor to the vet - an hour after the shooting. He is expected to survive.

Theall claims that Pitts kept saying, 'I love dogs.'

According to the police incident report,
 'Officer Pitts felt in fear of his life and discharged his duty weapon 
two times at the aggressive k9 to stop the threat.'

In a statement, Conroy says the 
investigation is still ongoing and that the department is 'developing 
protocols' to provide medical attention to animals injured during police
 investigations.

As Doctor recovers from his injuries, Theall’s wife, Melissa Brewer, has set up a Go Fund Me page to pay for his medical care, which totaled $8,000.

As of Tuesday, the campaign has raised over $12,000.
