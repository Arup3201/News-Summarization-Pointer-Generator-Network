The daughter of a crew member on board missing flight MH370 has tugged heart strings worldwide after tweeting for her father to come home to watch his favourite football team win.

Malaysian Maira Nari posted the message on the social media site after her father missed his beloved Liverpool FC's 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday.

The 17-year-old said it was the first time he had missed a game.

Her father Andrew Nari is listed as the chief steward on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight which has not been heard from since around 1.30am on Saturday March 8.

Just hours after the flight disappeared, his daughter Maira posted: 'Daddy, Liverpool is winning the game. Come home, so you can watch the game! 

'You never miss watching the game. It's your very first time.'

Football fans around the world responded to the message while Liverpool FC replied to the tweet on their official account.

The message read: 'Just to let you know that we are thinking of your father & all those still missing from flight £MH370. Be strong. YNWA.'

To that, Maira replied: 'If dad sees this, he'll be so happy! He'll be smiling, he'll be laughing. I can imagine how happy he'll be. Dad's a big fan of LFC!'

One fan wrote: 'I hope he and all the others are found safe and well, god bless sweetness, my daughter would be saying same thing for me, you keep following the boys so you can tell your daddy all about it! YNWA x.'

Emotions running high: Relatives were forcibly removed after invading a hotel room where a press conference was about to take place on the investigation into the disappearance of flight MH370

Mr Nari was one of 239 people on board when the aircraft heading from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

In
 a stark indication of how high emotions were running during the search,
 screaming family members of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines
 jet were forcibly removed from a hotel room after invading a press 
conference.

Half a dozen people held up banners blaming the government of inaction as airline officials desperately tried to resume order.

But one women screamed: 'You are traitors to us... you have let us down. Tell us the truth! We want the truth!'

Ghost flight: A new theory claims MH370 was headed for an emergency landing at Palau Langkawi, shown on the map, but the crew were overcome by smoke before they got there and the plane continued to fly on autopilot for hours into the Indian Ocean

No wreckage has been found from Flight
 MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's 
east coast at 1.21am local time on March 8, less than an hour after 
taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.

An
 unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26
 nations in two vast search 'corridors': one arcing north overland from 
Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian 
Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia.

Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.

Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m
