It's been one hell of a rollercoaster year for Manchester United, who started the year hopelessly with one manager and end it somewhat optimistically with another.

Kicking off 2014 with FA Cup and League Cup elimination, David Moyes' six-year contract as boss at Old Trafford was continually questioned as United looked a shadow of their former selves under Sir Alex Ferguson's compatriot replacement.   

Following Moyes' sacking in April United appear to be revitalised under former Holland manager Louis van Gaal, who joined in the summer and broke the British transfer record with the signing of Angel Di Maria. Rajvir Rai reviews the year for Manchester United.

David Moyes started the year under a dark cloud as he struggled as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor

JANUARY 

A month that very much set the tone for the rest of David Moyes’ doomed reign saw Manchester United crash out of the FA Cup (losing to Swansea at Old Trafford at the first hurdle) and the Capital One Cup (losing on penalties against Sunderland). A humbling 3-1 defeat against Chelsea in the middle of the month left the reigning champions 14 points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The £37.1million signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea, however, did provide some cause for optimism.

FEBRUARY 

Despite the addition of Mata, United still could not click into top gear and managed a single win – a 2-0 victory at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace. United’s struggles were best summed up in the 2-2 home draw against Fulham, which saw Darren Bent score in ‘Fergie Time’ for the visitors – a sign that Old Trafford was no longer the fortress of old. Amazingly, Moyes’ side put in 81 crosses during the game, with Fulham’s Dan Burn saying afterward: ‘I’ve (not) headed that many balls since the Conference!’ On the plus side, Wayne Rooney ended speculation over his future by signing a new five-and-a-half-year contract.

MARCH

Two successive 3-0 home defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City piled the pressure on Moyes. A 3-0 victory over Olympiakos secured United’s place in the Champions League quarter finals, but the atmosphere around certain sections of Old Trafford seemed to be growing more toxic. Marouane Fellaini’s substitution during the Manchester derby was greeted with loud applause and during the next home game, a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa, a plane carrying an anti-Moyes banner flew over the ground – though it was booed by the large sections of the home fans. United ended the month 15 points off leaders Chelsea and 10 behind Arsenal in fourth.

APRIL 

After just 10 months in job, Moyes – who was given a six-year contract after replacing Sir Alex Ferguson – was sacked. Ironically the nail in the coffin was delivered by his former club Everton who eased to a comfortable 2-0 win on the Scot’s first return to Goodison Park. Earlier in the month, United crashed out of the Champions League as they were beaten 3-1 (4-2 on agg) by Bayern Munich, despite taking a surprise lead in the Allianz Arena through Patrice Evra. Ryan Giggs took over as interim manager and started his reign with a thumping 4-0 home win over Norwich.

MAY 

The euphoria of the Giggs era – which also saw former Class of ’92 members Phil Neville, Nicky Butty and Paul Scholes take prominent roles on the coaching staff – was punctured by a 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland. In what proved to be Giggs’ farewell game at Old Trafford – a 3-1 win over Hull – there were debuts for youngsters Tom Lawrence and James Wilson. A 1-1 draw with Southampton on the final day saw United finish 22 points behind champions City in seventh – their worst Premier League finish. Eight days after the season finished, Louis van Gaal was appointed as manager with Giggs as his assistant.

JUNE 

With the Premier League over all eyes were on the World Cup and Van Gaal’s Holland to see what lay ahead at Old Trafford. Back in Manchester, chief executive Ed Woodward, under pressure after a botched summer 12 months earlier, swung into action as United announced the signings of Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao and Luke Shaw from Southampton for £30m. Alexander Buttner became the first casualty of the new era, leaving for Dynamo Moscow as speculation grew as to how Van Gaal would transform his squad.

JULY 

With the World Cup over, Van Gaal arrived for his first day of work at Carrington on the 16th. By this point stalwarts Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra, as well as a number of fringe players, had left and United were being linked with a who’s who of football: Arturo Vidal, Mats Hummels and even Cristiano Ronaldo. The Dutchman’s first press conference will be remembered for his plea that it will take three months for his new squad to understand his philosophy. But Van Gaal’s first game was a thumping 7-0 friendly win over LA Galaxy and was followed by victories over Roma and Inter Milan.

AUGUST 

United’s impressive pre-season form continued with victories over Real Madrid, Liverpool and Valencia. The new era was well and truly under way as United lined up in an unfamiliar 3-5-2 formation and Rooney was appointed the club’s new captain. Optimism abounded after such an impressive pre-season, but the mood quickly changed as Swansea ruined the party on the opening day of the season, winning 2-1 at Old Trafford in Van Gaal’s first competitive game in charge. Two league draws against Burnley and Sunderland followed, as well as a humbling 4-0 defeat in the Capital One Cup to MK Dons. United again dipped into the transfer market, adding Argentine duo Marcos Rojo and Angel Di Maria for a combined £66m.

SEPTEMBER 

September started with a bang as Radamel Falcao arrived on loan from Monaco and Daley Blind signed for £14m from Ajax – taking United’s summer spending to £160m - but academy product Danny Welbeck was sold to rivals Arsenal. At the fourth time of asking, Van Gaal finally got his first win as United thumped QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford. A week later, however, they were embarrassed again as they lost 5-3 to Leicester – squandering a 3-1 lead. United’s injury worries continued as Van Gaal was forced to turn to youngsters Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair in the absence of Shaw, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling.

Star signing Radamel Falcao and Dutch World Cup star Daley Blind also joined the United ranks in September

OCTOBER 

With no European or Capital One Cup football, United only played three times in October, stealing last-minute points against West Brom and Chelsea after beating Everton at home – a game notable for Falcao scoring his first goal for the club. After nine games, Van Gaal’s side sat ninth with 13 points – one fewer than Moyes had at the same stage the season before.

October marked Falcao's first goal for the Reds with this finish to beat former United goalkeeper Tim Howard

NOVEMBER 

Defeat in the Manchester derby – courtesy of a Sergio Aguero strike and a first-half Chris Smalling red card - meant it was United’s worst start to a season since 1986. Level on points with West Brom and Newcastle, Van Gaal’s side were already 13 points behind league leaders Chelsea. But three wins on the bounce against Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Hull lifted United into the Champions League places. Two clean sheets in four games were a welcome boost after United’s defence had been so porous earlier in the season.

DECEMBER 

United’s good form extended into the Christmas period with wins over Stoke, Southampton, Liverpool and Newcastle and draws at Aston Villa and Tottenham – meaning United finished 2014 on a nine-game unbeaten run. The upturn in form had sparked talk of a title a challenge – notably from senior players such as Rooney and Carrick – but Van Gaal’s side were still 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea and just three points ahead of Southampton and Arsenal in fourth and fifth. With the January transfer window set to open, United were again being linked with big money moves – notably a £120m move for Gareth Bale.
