The New York Jets have fired Rex Ryan, the outspoken and popular coach, the team failed for a fourth year in a row to make the playoffs and ended with a pitiful 4-12 record. 

Jets owner Woody Johnson also fired General Manager John Idzik, who has also been blamed for the Jets' poor performance in the last two seasons.

The Jets were the first team to swing the ax on 'Black Monday' - the day after the final game in the regular season when many teams that missed the playoffs fire coaches, general managers and other staffers.

On Sunday, it was announced that the San Francisco 49ers and head coach Jim Harbaugh were parting ways. Harbaugh announced he was taking the head coaching job at the University of Michigan for a reported $8million-per-year salary. 

Late this morning, the Atlanta Falcons fired head coach Mike Smith, who started his six-year tenure by making the playoffs four times in five years, but has fielded losing teams the last two seasons. 

The Chicago Bears also made big moves - firing head coach Marc Trestman and general manager Phil Emery following a 5-11 season that outraged fans. The year was marked by a woeful performance by quarterback Jay Cutler, whom Trestman and Emery signed to a $126million contract extension last season. 

The Jets move was widely expected in the football world - anticipated for weeks following the Jets 1-8 start on the season.

Ryan himself even saw it coming, reportedly cleaning out his office this weekend in advance of his final game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. The Jets won 37-24. 

Ryan started off his tenure in New York with a bang - winning two straight division championships in 2009 and 2010, just one game shy of making it to the Super Bowl.

The next four seasons saw the Jets drop out of relevance. The team went 8-8 in 2011 and 2013 and had a losing record this season and in 2012. 

The 2012 season saw one of the lowlights of the Jets franchise, the dreaded 'buttfumble.' Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez ran into the backside of his teammate and fumbled the ball - which was recovered by the New England Patriots for a touchdown.

Despite the Jets taking on a hapless reputation in the NFL, Ryan remained popular among his players and most fans. 

He made headlines in the sports world during his tenure for repeatedly boasting that his teams would win the Super Bowl. 

'I believe this is the year we’re going to win the Super Bowl. I thought we’d win it the first two years, but I guarantee you we’ll win it this year,' he crowed in 2011. 

The team went 8-8 and missed the playoffs that year. 

Even at the end, when Ryan's fate seemed assured, he managed to maintain the loyalty of his players. 

Wide receiver Percy Harvin, who has only been with the Jets since October, told the New York Post: 'I love him I loved him before I got here, and I’m that much more in love with him now. That’s what guys are still playing hard for him and giving it their all. I’m not going to get into (whether he should keep his job), but I just love playing for him.'
