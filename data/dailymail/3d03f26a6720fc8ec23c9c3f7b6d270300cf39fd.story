Jose Mourinho has completed his fourth acquisition of the transfer window with Kurt Zouma set to sign from St-Etienne.

Chelsea agreed a fee in the region of £12.5million for the 19-year-old centre half, who will stay in France for the rest of the season.

Mourinho spoke in glowing terms about the teenager but said that Chelsea have completed their business for this window.

Confident: Kurt Zouma has joined Chelsea but will stay with St Etienne for the rest of the season

On the ball: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has been eager to add young talent to his squad and made a personal call to the teenager

'He’s a young player in the profile of some Chelsea signings in the last couple of years,' said the Chelsea boss. 'We like the profile. We think he can adapt to the PL.'

Zouma was being closely monitored by 
several Barclays Premier League clubs despite being banned for 10 games 
in November for a tackle which left Thomas Guerbert of Sochaux with a 
broken leg and dislocated ankle.

Mourinho added: 'If we don’t do it now, we can’t do it in the summer because other clubs were strong on him. He will join us for pre-season and ew will see if it is to stay or go on loan. He is a young player for a position where we need a future. Job done, and he stays at St Etienne.

'He is very young but he is playing already a couple of seasons in St Et and many international matches for the youth teams. He is a player with good potential. Physically he is ready but it is another thing to be tactically ready. So well done Chelsea, this is the last one in the transfer window. In almost every position we have the present and the future.

'No more signings. The squad is short. Even players like Kalas is needed. We have 20 for the PL and 18 for the CL. We are there. We let Michael and Ryan go to play. We can’t let other go. We need the squad.'

Mourinho made a personal call to the 
teenager to convince him to come to London. Chelsea improved their 
original offer of £10m to clinch a deal, flush with the proceeds from 
the sales of Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne.

The
 year started with Mourinho insisting he could not foresee any transfers
 in or out of Stamford Bridge during the January window but he has 
already signed winger Mohamed Salah, plus midfielders Nemanja Matic and 
Bertrand Traore.

Zouma’s arrival will raise questions over the futures of established central defenders David Luiz and John Terry.

Mourinho
 has admitted he would like to keep Terry but fears he could lose his 
captain because of the strict club policy to offer contract extensions 
of only a year to all players over 30.

Terry,
 who is already free to talk to clubs outside England, is expected to 
have far more lucrative and longer offers on the table than the one from
 Stamford Bridge.

Luiz has 
been unable to force his way into Mourinho’s preferred back four and is 
in demand from some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Barcelona and Bayern 
Munich have long-standing interest in the Brazilian.
