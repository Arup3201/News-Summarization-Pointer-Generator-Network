There was almost complete silence in the courtroom as Oscar Pistorius was sentenced to five years in jail for the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Former Olympic athlete Pistorius remained stoic as Judge Masipa read out the sentence, which additionally included a three-year suspended sentence for discharging a firearm. It was, Masipa remarked, ‘fair and just.’

Steenkamps’ parents Barry and June sobbed quietly as Pistorius was given his punishment for shooting their daughter to death through a closed bathroom door.

Pistorius’ defence lawyer Gerrie Nel seemed content with the sentence. ‘The court has done what it had to do,’ he said, indicating there will be no appeal from the defence. Pistorius had previously been cleared of the more serious premeditated and unplanned murder charges after a seven-month trial.

The 27-year-old closed his eyes and grabbed the hands of his uncle Arnold and sister Aimee as he was led down to the cells to begin his sentence for culpable homicide, the South African equivalent of manslaughter.

The contrast between this broken man and the inspirational athlete who soared to worldwide fame as he overcame extreme disability to compete on the biggest stage was stark. His career is in tatters. 

It is unlikely he will ever compete in a significant athletics meet again. His house and most of the millions he earned in lucrative sponsorship deals are gone, hundreds of thousands spent on his defence team for this trial.

Since the death of Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day, 2013, the world has watched breathlessly as the unravelling of Pistorius’s life has been played out in the media and before a Pretoria courtroom. 

Steenkamp, a law graduate and successful model who was just 29 when she was killed by a man she had been dating for three months is the only true victim of this crime. But Pistorius’s fall from grace has been sensational.

Born without fibulas, the outer of the bones that run between the knee and the ankle, Pistorius’s legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. His parents insisted he was allowed to go to a normal school and at Constantina Kloof Primary School he ran, swam, played rugby and football like all the children. 

He overcame further tragedy when his beloved mother Shiela died when he was 15 and was already boarding at Pretoria Boys School when he was thrust into the international spotlight at the Athens Paralympics in 2004.

A brace wearing 17-year-old, he became the face of disability sport by breaking the 200 metres world record and winning gold. His natural charm and ease in front of the media was immediately apparent.

He was an inspiration to amputees the world over because of the way he prevailed over disability, winning six Paralympic gold medals in his career so far and even competing against able bodied athletes.

Pistorius transcended Paralympic sport, becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete at an Olympic Games in 2012. He advanced through the heats of the 400m and finished eighth of eight in the semi-final.

VIDEO Oscar Pistorius jailed for five years  

Pistorius embracing Grenadian Kirani James, the best one-lap runner in the world, at the finish was a marquee moment for the London Olympics. The spectators were watching a genuinely ground-breaking moment in world sport.

WIth success came huge fame. The court has heard how he embraced the celebrity lifestyle, dating a string of beautiful women and becoming a regular patron of the nightclubs of Cape Town and Johannesburg. A South African magazine voted him the country’s sexiest celebrity in 2012. 

Pistorius was also preoccupied by guns and speed, firing his weapon in a crowded restaurant and injuring his friend Kevin Lerena, a professional boxer.

This trial and punishment has lifted the lid on the private life of an iconic figure. It has been dramatic and captivating but ultimately desperately sad.
