He says it would be a 'dream' to join a top club like Spurs and would relish the challenge of English football

'It would be a dream to move to a top club like Tottenham. For me, the transfer is a big step, a step with which I can develop myself. That's why I want to take the chance. 

'I'm not someone who wants to stop developing. That is why England would be the next step. I'm playing in Germany. This is pretty much the best league in the world.

'The English Premier League is the only one that can match that. For me, the English league would be a great challenge. There I can develop because it's very demanding. I'm a fan of English football.' 

Wimmer currently has one senior international cap for Austria.
