She lay in a coma last night with her childhood sweetheart at her side.

If Emma Barton pulls through, she will be given the heartbreaking news that she has lost her father and sister in the M5 disaster.

Miss Barton, 19, whose mother died just a few years ago, had been travelling with boyfriend Chris Burbull and her family from a funeral when they were caught up in the carnage of Britain’s worst motorway crash for 20 years.

At least seven lost their lives and 51 were injured in the pile-up which involved more than 30 cars and six articulated lorries on Friday night.

Police believe the crash was caused by smoke from a rugby club fireworks display, but a row broke out yesterday when the organiser attempted to blame the foggy weather and even the motorists themselves.

Police now want to interview several people connected to the rugby club to establish what safety precautions were taken.

As the names of some of the victims were released, there were tales of heroism and astonishing escapes.

One family told how they and their three show dogs managed to get out of their van moments before it erupted in flames.

Friends said Miss Barton was ‘only just alive’ and Mr Burbull was refusing to leave her side in hospital.

The family had faced another tragedy in 2005 when Theresa, the mother of the two girls, died of cancer aged 46.

They had travelled down to the West Country in Emma's white Vauxhall car. Chris is likely to have been at the wheel.

Emma worked for the Thames Hospicecare charity as a volunteer.

Chief executive Jacqueline Clark said in a statement: 'We were all deeply shocked to learn that Emma was seriously injured in the M5 crash.

'Emma is a lovely and very popular girl with a generous and caring heart.

'She has given so much to Thames Hospicecare over the last few years, firstly giving up her own time to volunteer for the hospice and more recently joining our staff as a retail assistant in our Windsor shop.

'Her willingness to help the hospice whenever and wherever she could is a testament to her compassion and kindness.

'This is an absolute tragedy and everyone at the hospice is praying and hoping for Emma's speedy recovery.

'We hope that Emma's boyfriend, Chris Burbull, also a volunteer for the hospice, makes a full and rapid recovery from his injuries. Our heartfelt thoughts and sympathy are with Emma, Chris and their families at this critical time.'

Neither Chris, nor Emma's father Mike, were in work at the time of the accident although Chris had previously worked as a van driver at the nearby Pinewood Studios.

Laura Kyte, 20, said: ‘Chris is really worried about Emma. They met as teenagers and I think they’ve been together for about five years.

‘They are a lovely couple. They’d do anything for anyone and are great to have as friends.

‘We are all in total shock. It’s awful.’

Mr Burbull is believed to have been at the wheel of the car when it crashed.

Last night his parents left their home in Slough, Berkshire, to be with their son at the Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton where Miss Barton is in intensive care.

Horror: The crash scene on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, after the biggest pile-up on British motorways in 20 years

After repairs had been carried out to the motorway, the Highways Agency re-opened the road today. 51 people were injured in the 34-vehicle pile-up

At the Barton family home in Windsor, neighbours told how Miss Barton and her elder sister Maggie had been heartbroken when they lost their mother several years ago.

‘They were a very close family,’ said one. ‘I  think they just had each other.’ Miss Barton’s father, Michael, was wheelchair-bound. Neighbours said he had been ‘poorly’ for some time and would not have been able to escape the wreckage of the crash.

Maggie was described as ‘loving, caring and full of life’.

One neighbour described Maggie as ‘the loveliest person you could ever meet’, while another said she was ‘the best babysitter I’ve ever had’.

A young woman at the family home sobbed uncontrollably.

‘We are just devastated,’ she said. ‘I grew up with them and have known them all my life.’

Also killed in the crash were retired couple Pamela and Anthony Adams who were on their way home from visiting their daughter and grandchildren in Taunton.
