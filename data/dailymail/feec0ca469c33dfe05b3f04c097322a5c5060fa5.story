Louis van Gaal arrived at his press conference on Thursday apologising for still being in what he called his 'work clothes'. That, however, transpired to the least of his worries.

Soon after, he was embroiled in what we can politely describe as a lively exchange about the nature of his relationship with his assistant Ryan Giggs.

Pictures of a rather underwhelmed Giggs at St James' Park on Wednesday and some quotes from his old friend Paul Scholes had given weight earlier in the day to some recent chatter about the United icon's thoughts on Van Gaal's style of play and indeed his own future.

And then there was the Jonny Evans issue. Caught on film spitting towards the ground during a clash with Newcastle centre forward Papiss Cisse, the United central defender now stands accused – rightly or wrongly - of one of the most frowned upon acts in sport.

All in all, it was another challenging day at the office for United's manager. No wonder his mood was rather spiky.

'No, we have a very bad relationship,' said Van Gaal of Giggs, rather sarcastically. 'I'm very irritated because of this question.

'Everyone can see we have a very good relationship and work very hard together, not only Ryan Giggs but all the staff and players.

'This [your question] is a way of suggesting things.

'So now I am very irritated and I take my message against the media. I'm not pleased. 'I think 90 per cent [of everything you say] is not happening.'

Images of Giggs failing to join Van Gaal's celebrations after Ashley Young's 89th minute goal at St James Park on Wednesday were certainly peculiar. So, too, were quotes from Scholes on TV before kick-off.

'There's no doubt, he had that little taste of it for the last three weeks of last year and he definitely wants to be a manager,' Scholes told BT Sport.

'You can see that. Over the next two or three years, will he have the patience to be a No 2 for that long? I'm not sure he will.'

Giggs is understood to have been non-plussed by David Moyes' style of play at Manchester United

The United icon took charge at Old Trafford for the final games of last season following Moyes' sacking

Giggs and Scholes worked together at United when the former was handed the reins last season in the wake of David Moyes' sacking. Former team-mates, they know each other very well.

Nevertheless, it is understood that Giggs views his friend's comments as unhelpful and is furious that anyone should voice doubts about his relationship with Van Gaal.

It is not hard to wonder, though, what Giggs does make of the Dutch coach's style. Giggs grew frustrated at Moyes' reluctance to play on the front foot last season and immediately sought to change it during his spell as interim manager last April and May.

Giggs instinctively went back to what he emotively called 'the United way'.

So have things improved that much this season? It is hard to say that they have.

For now, though, United fans will listen to Van Gaal's words and learn of Giggs' irritation and perhaps be soothed. If performances pick up - starting with a home FA Cup tie with Arsenal on Monday - then the subject will be allowed to melt away.

United defender Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse have been charged with spitting during the game

‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.

‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting.

‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’

THE GAMES HE COULD MISS FOR UNITED: Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Man City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. 

Evans and Cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on Wednesday night 

‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny.

‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.

‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’

THE GAMES HE’LL MISS FOR NEWCASTLE: Everton (a), March 15; Arsenal (h), March 21; Sunderland (a), April 5; Liverpool (a), April 13; Tottenham (h), April 19; Swansea (h), April 25; Leicester (a), May 2.

Cisse has accepted a possible seven-game ban while Evans has until 6pm on Friday February 6 to respond 

As for Evans, he will clearly tell the FA that he didn't mean to spit at Cisse on Wednesday but may still be fortunate to escape a ban of six games. Footage would appear to be inconclusive and it is easy to sympathise with the Irishman's claim in a statement on Thursday that he was not spitting at his opponent.

His manager clearly believes him, too, but whether the FA will feel they can prove the case against one player - Cisse - and not the other will perhaps worry Van Gaal as he contemplates playing much of the remainder of the season without his centre half.

'Of course I've spoken with Jonny Evans,' said the United manager.

'It is like what I said in the press conference after match that he was not aware he was spitting.

'And when he was spitting on the ground, maybe it's a natural thing from a human being.

'I think it was not his intention and that I said already.

'I cannot imagine that Jonny Evans could do that.

'And he has said this also so I believe him.

'So for me the matter has done.'

United will renew their rivalry with Arsenal when Van Gaal takes on Arsene Wenger in the FA Cup quarter-final

With Monday's game at Old Trafford so important to United in terms of their chances of not only winning a trophy but also of finding the required confidence to take in to some tough Barclays Premier League fixtures, Van Gaal may have hoped for a rather less eventful build-up.

Amid it all, at least he can cling to results. United remain fourth in the Premier League and, somehow, on course for the Champions League qualification that was stated as a pre-requisite at the start of the season.

Criticism has been a constant companion throughout his time in England and, indeed, during previous spells in Holland and Spain.

It is partly because of this that it was surprising to see him so irked. He is usually a little more phlegmatic. One imagines that passage to the last four of the FA Cup on Monday night would put much of it right.
