A Taiwanese man who could not swim survived a 60-hour ordeal drifting in rough seas by clinging on to a floating coffin lid.

Tseng Lien-fa was catching baby eels on a beach in Hualien   county, off the island's east coast early Friday, when he was swept away by a huge freak wave.

But in an extraordinary stroke of luck the top of a coffin drifted past and he was able to use it as his life-raft.

'I managed to hold on as the first wave hit me on the chest, but I was overwhelmed by the second and bigger wave,' he told the United Daily News.

The 42-year-old managed to hold on to the lid until early Sunday. There was no explanation of why the lid was present in the sea.

'On the lid, I was drifting and drifting ... during that period I hoped I could be picked up by any ships passing by,' he said.

Strong waves eventually swept him onto a beach in the southeastern county of Taitung, 75 kilometres (46 miles) away from where his ordeal began, the reports said.

Coastguards mobilised to search for Tseng found him lying on the beach around noon Sunday.

Doctors said he had suffered slight dehydration and developed sores on his arms due to seawater immersion.

'Considering the fact that he had not taken in any food or water while drifting at sea for 60 hours and he remained conscious, all I could say about him was that this was a miracle,' said Chen Tien-su, a doctor at Hualien Hospital.

Tseng had been catching eels to make extra money since his fiancee is expecting a baby next month.

He has now promised her the fishing expeditions will stop.
