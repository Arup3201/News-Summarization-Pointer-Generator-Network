Two women have been arrested for allegedly robbing bikini-clad baristas at gunpoint at a coffee shop in Portland, Oregon.

Acacia Bowers, 29, and Lacey Preston, 30, are charged with robbery, unlawful use of a weapon and possession of meth after police say they held up workers at Twin Perks Espresso last fall.

Detectives tracked down the suspects after they were spotted on footage from a security camera that captured the heist.

The footage, obtained by KATU.com, shows one of the women walking up to the coffee counter and pulling a gun on a barista at the drive-thru before making off with a wad of cash.

The second woman then pulled up at the stand in a vehicle and pretended to be a concerned patron who offered to call 911, police said.

But the emergency call was never made prompting investigators to conclude the woman was an accomplice trying to buy the robber getaway time.

Surveillance cameras caught the car's license plate and detectives were able to identify the women.

The suspects have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.

Investigators
 believe the pair also robbed the Smokin' Hot Java Bombshell Baristas a 
week prior. They are still trying to link them to that crime but they 
could face additional charges.

Twin Peaks Espresso owner Tracy Fields told KATU.com that her swimwear-wearing staff were shaken up after the robbery.

'It's traumatizing,' Fields said. 'You can't have a gun put in your face without walking away from it with some sort of damage.'

She added that she and her employees are thrilled police continued to follow leads since the robbery took place.

'You don't know what they're going to do, so the (baristas) are extremely relieved (they're caught),' she said.

Fields said she's confident her security system will deter prospective thieves.

'We'll get them every time. You just have to put the money in to protect your employees and make people understand this is not OK,' she told the TV station.

'It's a bad idea to try and rob us.'
