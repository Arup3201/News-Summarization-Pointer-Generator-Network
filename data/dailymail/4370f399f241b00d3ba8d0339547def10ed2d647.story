A mother is moving to America to marry a paralysed lonely heart she met on a Facebook game called 'Hot or Not'.

Nicole Joseph, 44, signed up to the dating site for fun - but fell for wheelchair-bound Dean Wulfekuhle.

Beauty therapist Nicole said she 'just clicked' with bachelor Dean, 42, as they chatted over the internet every day.

Nicole met Dean online when she joined up to Facebook's 'Hot or Not' dating site as a joke 

Nicole, from Newport, South Wales, said: 'It was just a chance, random meeting online.

'I was only on the Hot or Not game for one day, it was kind of one of those meant-to-be scenarios.

'I can't explain it - we both just hit it off straight away.'

Dean told Nicole how his hopes of having a family was ended when he was left paralysed by a spinal injury in a car accident in 1993 

'Hot or Not', an app that can also be accessed through Facebook, shows you profiles of people, allowing you to vote whether they are 'hot' or 'not hot'.

The votes are calibrated to create 'leaderboards' of the hottest people in your area, and your own profile is also rated. The app also has a 'chat' option where you can contact people also playing the game.

Over the next two years Nicole visited Dean nine times at his home in Minnesota where he works as a life coach.

Quadraplegic Dean was upfront about his 'challenges' and immediately explained to Nicole that he spends his life in a wheelchair.

He explained that his disability affects the lower part of his body but he has some movement in his torso and arms.

Nicole said: 'I think he expected me to run a mile when he told me that - but it made no difference to my feelings for him.

Nicole and her daughters have now moved to start a new life in the US with Dean, who is wheelchair bound

The couple says they 'just clicked' when they began talking online

'When I met Dean in person the first thing I thought was that he was quite a hunk.

'The only thing that was different to what he'd said is that his eyes were far bluer than I expected.'

Dean told Nicole how his hopes of having a family were ended when he was left paralysed by a spinal injury in a car accident in 1993.

But after meeting Nicole on the internet dating game his dream finally came true.

Nicole and her three daughters - Ffion, 16, Imogen, 15, and Mollie, 13 - have all started a new life in America with the girls enrolling at a high school in Minnesota.

Nicole said: 'Some of our friends and family members on both sides were concerned at first.

'But we knew from that first in-person meeting that we were both sincere.'

Dean says he feels very lucky to have achieved his dream of having a family 

Nicole says when she first met Dean in person she remembers thinking he was 'quite a junk'

The couple tied the knot in a beautiful lakeside ceremony in June 2010.

Nicole's three daughters were bridesmaids at the traditional white wedding and Nicole wore a strapless lace gown and said it was the 'happiest day of her life.'

She said: 'It was a real dream come true to marry such a strong and determined man, he truly is my best friend and a wonderful father to our three girls.'

They were joined by friends and family from America and the UK to celebrate their nuptials in Dean's hometown of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota where Nicole now lives.  

Dean said he had never let his disability get in the way of leading a full and active life.

He said: 'I feel very lucky - it was my dream to have a family and I got it.'
