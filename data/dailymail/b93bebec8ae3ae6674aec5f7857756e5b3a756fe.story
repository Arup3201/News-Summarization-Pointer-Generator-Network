A 25-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly advertising on Craigslist for 'fathers willing to share their daughters' for sex.

Brandon J. Bergthold from Will County, Illinois was caught by an undercover cop posing as a father happy to turn over his daughter.

When he was arrested outside a motel, Bergthold thanked cops for saving him from his addiction to child porn, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Caught: Brandon Bergthold allegedly posted ads for fathers happy to share 
their daughters. An undercover cop posed as a father and 
Bergthold was arrested

The arrest followed two months of investigations by Will and Cook County sheriff police, who had been monitoring Craigslist, a classifieds website.

A member of the Police Child Exploitation Unit allegedly noticed an individual using the site to arrange meetings with fathers.

The investigator responded to Bergthold and posed as a dad willing to offer sexual access to his six-year-old daughter, police said.

This weekend Bergthold allegedly began pushing more aggressively to meet the 'father' and his 'daughter'.

'Bergtholdâ€™s demeanor changed,' Will 
County Sheriff Paul Kaupas told the Chicago Sun Times.

'He communicated a sense of urgency in 
wanting to meet with the undercover officer and the minor child.'

Disturbing: Bergthold reportedly also posted ads for women wanting to be raped

He added officers believed Bergthold might have sought out a victim 'if we did not 
end this investigation', the Sun Times reported.

The investigator arranged to meet with the suspect at a motel, where he was promptly arrested. His computer has also been seized.

The Chicagoist reported Bergthold posted around 117 messages on Craigslist appealing for individuals to carry out his fantasies.

He had placed ads for women who wanted to be raped, among others.

He has been charged with two counts of indecent solicitation of a child and one count of travelling to meet a minor.

Bond has been set at $750,000 and he is due to appear in court on February 17. He is to have no contact with children under the age of 18.
