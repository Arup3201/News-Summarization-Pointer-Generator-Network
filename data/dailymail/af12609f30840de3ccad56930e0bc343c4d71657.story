Deeply regretful: Brian Howard is accused of setting a fire in an O'Hare air traffic control center before trying to kill himself. He expressed his remorse through his attorney on Monday

A man accused of setting fire to an air control facility in Chicago on Friday, causing an outage that continues to disrupt flights, appeared in federal court on Monday to hear the charges against him and was ordered held without bond.

Brian Howard, 36, of the Chicago suburb of Naperville, appeared in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois and was charged with damaging an air navigation facility, interfering with its operations and endangering the safety of aircraft in flight.

He did not enter a plea, but through his attorney said 'he deeply regrets' his actions.

For many insiders, who see just how devastating his alleged actions were to air traffic controllers, his regret may not be enough.

'This is the biggest challenge we have faced in the national airspace system since the tragedy of 9/11,' Paul Rinaldi, president of the air traffic controllers union, told NBC News. 

'We're going back to manually inputting routes, and you have a very large chunk of airspace that is not being controlled by anybody, and we're re-routing airplanes around this airspace.'

Howard, a telecommunications contractor at the control center for eight years, tried to kill himself with a knife at the center on Friday when he sabotaged the facility, according to the criminal complaint against him.

He was released from hospital on Monday morning and appeared in court with a bandage around his neck.

'He made a tragic mistake in the course of trying to end his own life,' his defense attorney, Ron Safer, told reporters after the hearing.

'Brian tried to take his life,' Safer told reports, including the Chicago Tribune. 'That he did so in a way that inconvenienced … many, many people is unacceptable and he deeply regrets that.'

Court appearance: Howard, 36, (right) appeared in court for the first time on Monday after allegedly setting a fire that left regional and national air traffic snarled for days. Police say the FAA contractor slit his wrists and his own throat after setting the fire. A court sketch appears to show his neck bandaged

The center controls aircraft flying above 5,000 feet over a large part of the central United States. The sabotage on Friday affected more than 3,000 flights.

Howard was disgruntled because he had been told he was being transferred to Hawaii, according to the criminal complaint. He posted a Facebook message early on Friday saying he was going to take his life. Friends who saw the message alerted the police.

Cancellations and delays continued on Monday at Chicago airports, with 300 canceled flights at O'Hare International Airport, according to Chicago's Department of Aviation.

The U.S. aviation safety agency's top official said on Monday he has asked for a review of all U.S. air traffic control contingency plans and security policies following the incident.

Speaking at an industry conference, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency won't hesitate to make changes in security policies if needed.

Huerta, in his first public comments since the incident, said 20 of 29 pieces of communications equipment were damaged by the fire and were still being replaced. 

Lingering effects: Cancellations and delays continued on Monday at Chicago airports, with 300 canceled flights at O'Hare International Airport, according to Chicago's Department of Aviation. The fire's effects are expected to linger through half of October

Air traffic control at Chicago's O'Hare airport was brought to its knees after Brian Howard allegedly set a fire in a control center basement Friday. As the regional and even nationwide effects linger on, what should you know about the situation and about your own travel plans?

Q: How many flights have been canceled?

The U.S. aviation safety agency's top official said on Monday he has asked for a review of all U.S. air traffic control contingency plans and security policies following the incident

A: Since Friday morning, more than 3,700 flights have been canceled at O'Hare Airport, the nation's second-largest airport by passengers, and Midway Airport, the nation's 21st largest.

Q: Which airlines have been hardest hit?

A: United Airlines and its regional partners canceled 1,579 flights, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. American Airlines and its regional carriers canceled 1,415 flights, Southwest Airlines 601 flights and Delta Air Lines 46 flights.

Q: How did airlines decide which flights to scrap?

A: The vast majority of flights canceled by American, Delta and United were on their regional partner airlines. Those jets, which fly to smaller cities, typically carry 50 or 75 passengers, compared with the 150 or 200 on larger planes. Yet they still require the same amount of work for controllers. 

Q: So did this just affect Chicago?

A: No. As planes fly across the country at high altitudes, they are handed off from one regional control center to another. There are 21 such facilities. The one in Aurora covers 91,000 square miles of airspace over five states and hundreds of airports.

Q: What did the FAA do to keep planes flying?

A: Responsibility for any air traffic flying above 18,000 feet in that region has been split up among the four neighboring air traffic control centers in Minneapolis, Kansas City, Cleveland and Indianapolis. Further, the FAA is redirecting transcontinental flights around Chicago's airspace.

Q: What about flights to the Chicago area?

A: Traffic below 18,000 feet is being handled by 19 regional facilities, which hand off approaching flights to the individual airport control towers for clearance to land.

Q: If the FAA was able to create such a backup system, why were so many flights canceled?

A: First, it took some time to get the plan in place. Next, there was a problem sharing data between the various control centers. Since the fire took out telecommunications, there was no easy way to exchange flight data between Chicago and the four neighboring centers. The FAA was typing in flight-plan information for each plane and printing it out on a strip. To safely manage that process, the number of planes in the sky had to be reduced. The government has since been able to automate much of the process, significantly improving the number of planes that can be handled.

Q: What are delays like now?

A: The FAA said Monday that the takeoff and landing rate at O'Hare was at 80 percent of the rate last week at the same time. Midway's rate was at more than 90 percent of the prior week's rate. Luckily for the airlines and passengers, the area has experienced mostly calm weather, with no severe thunderstorms that could further slow flights.

Q: When are operations expected to get back to normal?

A: The FAA says it will have the Aurora center open on Oct. 13.

Q: Why will it take two weeks to fix the problem?

A: First, crews are cleaning the area damaged by the fire, making sure the building is safe. Other crews are reconfiguring space on a different floor to house new equipment. The work involves replacing 20 of 29 racks of fiber-optic cables and other telecommunications equipment and re-establishing more than 600 circuits, "so it's a very, very large job," FAA Administrator Michael P. Huerta said.

Q: In light of the fire, will the FAA change how it operates and secures these facilities?

A: Huerta said the agency might need to treat some buildings, like the center in Aurora, differently because they are more critical to the national air traffic system than others. Over the next 30 days, the FAA will conduct a review of its contingency plans for unexpected events like Friday's fire, as well as security at its facilities.

United Airlines and its regional partners were reportedly the hardest hit canceling 1,579 flights, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. American Airlines and its regional carriers canceled 1,415 flights, Southwest Airlines 601 flights and Delta Air Lines 46 flights.
