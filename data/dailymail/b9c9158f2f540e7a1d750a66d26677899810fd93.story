Tragic story: Ben and Catherine Mullany were shot to death on their honeymoon in Antigua

Two men who executed a newlywed British couple on their honeymoon have escaped the death penalty.

Avie Howell, 21, and Kaniel Martin, 24, were jailed for life for the murder of newly-weds Dr Catherine Mullany and husband Ben, who were shot dead on the last night of their two-week Caribbean holiday.

Dr Mullany and her husband, both, 31, were forced to kneel by their side of the bed then 'executed' in their luxury hotel apartment on the island of Antigua in 2008.

Howell and Martin - nicknamed Sample Dan and Demon - were found guilty of murder following a four week trial.

Dr Mullany died almost instantly after she was shot in the back of the head during the robbery, Antigua's High Court in St John's heard.

Mr Mullany, a student physiotherapist and former soldier and policeman, died a week later after he was flown back to Swansea to be placed on a life-support machine.

The following month Martin and Howell were charged with their murders and that of 43-year-old shopkeeper Woneta Anderson.

The pair were given three consecutive life sentences for the murders but the judge rejected calls for them to be executed.

The trial was told how other holidaymakers at the Coco's Hotel and Resort in Antigua heard screams and gunfire at 5am.

Police were called and found Catherine dead and physiotherapist Ben barely alive nearby. He tragically died after being flown home to Britain.

A safe in the couple's chalet had been forced open and a small amount of cash taken.

The couple were married just two weeks earlier in their parish church in the village of Cilybebyll, near Swansea, South Wales, where they are now buried in the churchyard.

A joint statement by their family said: 'We will never be able to comprehend the senseless nature of their deaths, the total disregard shown for human life, and that no remorse has ever been shown.

'Ben and Cath will live in our hearts forever. They made our lives happy beyond measure and enriched every day that they were with us'

Despite their murders in 2008, the bid to keep Ben and Catherine Mullany's memory alive still shows no sign of slowing down.

In
the wake of the killings, their loved ones vowed to carry on the good 
work started by Mrs Mullany, a doctor, and her student physiotherapist 
husband through a charity set up their name.

The
Mullany Fund was launched at the memorial service of the Welsh couple, 
and has won the backing of the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and 
Antiguan cricket legend Sir Vivian Richards.

It
hopes to widen participation in the field of medicine and physiotherapy
by offering grants to UK students, many of whom are facing sharp rises 
in tuition fees.

Mr and Mrs 
Mullany's family say they have been overwhelmed in the way people - from
those who knew the couple to total strangers - have taken the cause to 
their hearts.

Hundreds 
turned up to a fundraising rugby match in the Swansea Valley last year 
despite the tie being cancelled 24 hours in advance.

The
charity has also been backed on a number of occasions by professional 
rugby sides the Ospreys, Scarlets and Cardiff Blues as well as Premier 
League newcomers Swansea City.

Horror in paradise: The couple were executed on the last day of their stay at luxury chalet Cocos Hotel

Last May, friends of Mr Mullany's 
uncle Michael Meredith joined the 59-year-old father-of-two in a 
gruelling 24 hour bike ride from north to south Wales to raise money for
The Mullany Fund.

And in September, Catrin Jones from Carmarthen is to swim two kilometres in the cold waters of Strathclyde Loch to raise funds.

Mr
Mullany's younger brother Adam said the charity had given him, his 
parents and his sister-in-law's family a great deal of comfort.

He
said: 'Ben served his country in the army and he was a police officer. 
He just wanted to help. His whole life had been geared towards his true 
calling - becoming a first class physiotherapist

'Ben's values and optimistic outlook on life will carry on through everyone he ever met and he will be missed forever.

'We can never replace Ben and Cath, but we hope to carry on the good work they had started.

'It's vital that their good work carries on.'

Ben and Catherine Mullany were shot in the back of the head just over a fortnight after they had married.

Friends and family who were at their wedding found themselves attending their funerals a month later.

Here is an overview of the key events over the past three years following and since their murders:

July 12, 2008: Ben and Catherine 
Mullany, nee Bowen, get married in St John's The Evangelist Church in 
Cilybebyll. Their first dance is to the song Somewhere Only We Know by 
Keane - a reference to them spending their first night as man and wife 
camping in a secret location.

July
14: Two days after their marriage the newly-weds leave South Wales for 
Antigua. The honeymoon is a present from family and friends following a 
request from Mr and Mrs Mullany. The couple arrive at luxury hotel Cocos
near the Jolly Harbour area of Antigua's west coast.

July
14 - 26: Ben and Catherine are said to have enjoyed a relaxing time, 
going on a tour of the island as well as enjoying its beaches and warm 
weather. However, other holidaymakers staying at the resort said the 
couple were keen to return home to South Wales. One report claimed Mr 
Mullany was anxious after witnessing a fracas between two men involving a
machete on a nearby beach.

From joy to tragedy: Catherine and Ben on their wedding day. A month later family and friends would be attending their funerals

July
26: On their last night together, Mr and Mrs Mullany have dinner in 
Cocos' restaurant, where they meet the family of fellow Brit Beverley 
Stairs, of Surrey. Mrs Stairs was staying in a chalet a few yards from 
the Welsh couple. She said they talked a lot about going home to start a
family.

July 27: At around 
5am the sounds of gunshots are heard coming from Mr and Mrs Mullany's 
chalet, cottage 15. Mrs Mullany dies instantly after being shot in the 
head. Ben, who was initially conscious, later slips into a coma and is 
taken to Holberton Hospital, near St John's, where he is placed on a 
life support machine.

July 
29: Mr and Mrs Mullany's parents - Cynlais and Marilyn Mullany and David
and Rachel Bowen - arrive in Antigua. The Duchess of York Sarah 
Ferguson is on the same flight as the couple's family and tries to 
comfort them during the eight-hour flight.

July
31: The Prime Minister of Antigua, Baldwin Spencer, issues a plea to 
Britain for Scotland Yard to help his country's police force with the 
investigation.

August 1: Mr 
Mullany is flown home on a life support machine. The journey takes 
around 22 hours after the chartered flight is grounded in Canada because
of a technical fault. Medics make several interventions to keep the 
31-year-old alive on the flight.

August
2: Mr Mullany arrives at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, in the early 
hours of the morning. Doctors say his condition remains stable but will 
proceed with brain-stem testing.

August 3: Mr Mullany's life-support machine is switched off.

August
13: A joint and secret burial for Mr and Mrs Mullany takes place at St 
John's The Evangelist Church in Cilybebyll. Mourners consist of close 
family only.

August 18: Avie
Howell, then 17, and Kaniel Martin, 20, appear in court charged with 
murdering Mr and Mrs Mullany. Also charged is Georgette Aaron, accused 
of accessory to murder.

September
10: A memorial service for the late Mr and Mrs Mullany is held at 
Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff. More than 1,000 mourners attend. Speaking
at the service is the Duchess of York, who says she will become a 
patron of The Mullany Fund - the charity set up in memory of Mr and Mrs 
Mullany.

November 11: 
British detectives fly back to Antigua to assist local officers' 
enquiries with the island's other unsolved murders.

March 8, 2009: Howell and Martin also charged with murdering three other people.

March
25: Howell and Martin's legal team win an adjournment to allow more 
time to review evidence. Case set to resume the following May.

June 16: Judge rules Howell and Martin will stand trial for the five killings. Tentative date of early 2010 is now proposed.

May
11: Defence barrister Maureen Payne-Hyman asks for the four murder 
cases against Howell and Martin to be tried separately as she is 
unavailable for the entirety of a joint trial.

May
23: Judge severs the trial of Howell and Martin. Cases concerning Mr 
and Mrs Mullany, along with 43-year-old Woneta Anderson, are to proceed 
on June 1.

June 1: Trial of 
Howell and Martin finally gets under way at St John's High Court, with a
jury of eight men and four women sworn in. Both of the accused deny all
murders. During the trial, Howell and Martin turn down the chance to 
give evidence as part of their defence.

July
27: Three years to the day of the shooting at Cocos, and at 11pm local 
time, a jury finds Howell and Martin guilty of murdering Mr and Mrs 
Mullany. The pair are also convicted of the murder of local shopkeeper 
Mrs Anderson.

December 16: Martin and Howell are each given three consecutive life sentences at the High Court in Antigua.
