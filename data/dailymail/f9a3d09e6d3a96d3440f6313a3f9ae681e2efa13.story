Former federal MPs have threatened the government with High Court action should they lose their free airfare travel pass. 

The retired MPs have submitted a report to the Senate blasting the government's 'unconstitutional' plans to abolish the 'life gold pass' travel card.

The government announced in May that it would eradicate the travel perk, which allows retired MPs and their spouses to take up to ten, free, return business-class airfares within Australia every year.

However in a new report, former Liberal MP Murray Sainsbury, who is also President of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia, said that the proposal was 'unacceptable', 'disappointing' and 'should not be arbitrated by public opinion.'

Mr Sainsbury also claims that the 'very modest' savings of $1 million for the next five years would be 'minuscule' in the context of the government's Budget expenditure.

He said current pass holders will eventually stop travelling because of age or death and given the closure of the pass to parliamentarians elected after 2012, the abolition of the benefit is not justified.

Members of Parliament need to serve seven terms, or 20 years in Parliament, to qualify for a travel pass.  

Retired MPs have submitted a report to the Senate blasting the government's 'unconstitutional' plans to abolish the 'life gold pass' travel card.

MPs and senators elected since 2012 are not eligible for the pass.

Mr Sainsbury argues in the report that the only justification given for the obliteration of the pass was that retired MPs must be forced 'to make a contribution to the budget repair task'. 

He states that the travel pass was given to parliamentarians as part of their remuneration package and backtracking on the government's part was 'irresponsible'.

Mr Sainsbury says according to public opinion, 'whatever remuneration parliamentarians receive is too much, regardless of how low it may be'.

He also claims that 'parliamentarians' entitlements should not be the subject of political whim or expediency.'

The gold pass  extends to spouses accompanying MPs on official trips. 

Mr Sainsbury alleges that most spouses during his era gave up their chances at a career, claiming therefore that 'the electorate was served by two for the price of one.'

'This appropriately recognises that during the era that most Life Gold Pass holders served in the Parliament their spouses, rather than pursuing their own careers, voluntarily and without remuneration supported the parliamentarian in their day-to-day electorate work, including attending functions in the electorate,' Ms Sainsbury said. 

Mr Sainsbury said the scheme - which was held for MPs elected to parliament before 2012 - was served to parliamentarians 'in lieu of inadequate salaries' and justifications for its removal were 'fanciful.'

He also stated that the government 'are on very shaky ground regarding the constitutional validity of the legislation' and obliterating it would be 'unconstitutional' because it amounts to 'unjust' acquisition of property.

The report, which has been submitted to a Senate enquiry,has now been removed from the Parliament's website following an article which appeared on The West Australian.
