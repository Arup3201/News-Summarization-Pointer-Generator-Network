A real-life superhero has turned down six-figure offers for his home-made Batmobile - so he can continue helping sick children. 

Batman fanatic Zac Mihajlovic, from Camden, south west of Sydney, has hand-built his very own street legal version of the famous batman car from the 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. 

The very inventive 29-year-old turned his comic book fantasies into a high-octane reality by constructing a replica of the iconic vehicle.

And there's no doubt the bat car has received a bit of attention, wherever it goes inciting plenty of reaction from surprised onlookers. 

'The first time I took it out was definitely an experience,' said Zac.

'I can take it down and get groceries if I wanted to, the reaction of the car has just been insane.' 

'I was on a freeway on the way to the Gold Coast and there was this noise, I thought something was wrong with the car, but it was actually the news helicopter from Channel nine chasing me down the freeway. That was pretty memorable.'

Four years ago was when Zac decided to start building the incredible replica with the help of his very own Lucius Fox, grandfather John Greene, a retired engineer along with his friend, Scott Cox.

Parts for a machine like this don't come easy but in the two years it took the team to create the beast, they were lucky enough to be able to get some parts from the car used in the original film.

There are thought to be ten other replicas of the 1989 Batmobile but Zac believes he has the only one that can be legally driven on public roads

'It's got adjustable suspension, it's got a working afterburner, which is from the film - no machine gun sadly, no grappling hooks, no bombs that come out of the wheel, but beyond that, it's pretty close,' said Zac.

And with any hot car comes the female attention with the Batmobile attracting its fair share of attention from the ladies.

But for Zac he's not too bothered, who already has his very own bat girl, girlfriend Annabella Leone. 

'We've been dating for about four years - and can I just say I was with him two years prior to the Batmobile,' joked Annabella.

'I have the passenger seat and if any girl out there wants it, I swear to god, she's dead.'

The best thing it's road worthy with adjustable suspension and a working afterburner

Businessmen from across the world, including a Sheik in Dubai, have offered Zac big bucks for the Batmobile - and he has also seen his share of bizarre requests. 

'I've had a couple ring me up and say 'I know this is gonna sound weird but we want to 'christen' the car', so to speak,' Zac said.

'I sort of said 'I'm not interested' and they said 'we'll pay you what you want – and we'll bring plastic sheets' and I'm like 'you've just made that worse, so no thanks'.' 

And rather than cash-in on his dream machine, the Batman fanatic decided to use his powers for good by teaming up with the Make-A-Wish foundation, who make dream's come true for terminally-ill children.

'It's a brilliant, brilliant charity because it gives kids, sadly, their dying wish.'

'I dress up as Batman and I surprise the kids - sometimes it's knocking on someone's door and surprising them, or sometimes it's taking them out to dinner.'

'Some of them run for their lives and it takes a bit of warming up to get them back, but some are just super pumped,' he said.

Over the last three years Zac has helped more than 40 children meet The Caped Crusader and he has no plans to give up moonlighting as the masked superhero any time soon.

And while he may not be using his amazing ride to battle the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, or even take cat woman for a ride - in the eyes of many he's still very much a hero.
