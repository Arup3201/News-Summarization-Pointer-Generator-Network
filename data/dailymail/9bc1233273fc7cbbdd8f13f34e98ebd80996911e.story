Everton manager Roberto Martinez was at Holland's World Cup training camp checking on Jeremain Lens, Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij on Wednesday.

The Everton manager is in Rio de Janeiro ahead of his commentary role for ESPN when Argentina take on Bosnia on Sunday.

He was spotted deep in conversation with Dutch legend Van Nistelrooy at the Estadio da Gavea - with the pair concealing their whispered conversation behind their hands.

Lens, a 26-year-old attacker has scored eight goals in 22 appearances for Holland including the second strike in a 2-0 friendly win against Wales last week.

Feyenoord defenders Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij have made over 100 appearances for the Eredivisie side at the age of just 22, and are part of the band of young players that Louis van Gaal has brought through.

De Vrij, who has also been linked to Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United, has previously admitted he could leave Holland this summer, saying: 'The chances are that I will leave, I can probably confirm this. I am with the Dutch national team so I donâ€™t know the exact details.'

Martinez is believed to be doubling up his work as a pundit to scout potential signings for Everton as he looks to build on a successful first season at Goodison Park.

After leaving relegated Wigan, the former Swansea manager came close to leading Everton into the Champions League before eventually finishing fifth.
