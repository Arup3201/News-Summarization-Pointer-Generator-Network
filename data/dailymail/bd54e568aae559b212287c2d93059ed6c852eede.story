They are the five 20-somethings who perform sell-out gigs, get flown around the world to perform for their most dedicated superfans and get mobbed by female fans.

No, we're not talking about BRIT-winning boy band One Direction but their tribute act, Only One Direction.

Matt Brinkler, 24, Henry Allan, 23, Jamie Searls, 23, Aaron Foster, 23, and 22-year-old David Ribi have filled concert venues across the country and played to tens of thousands of screaming fans impersonating the famous five.

Heartthrobs:
 (L-R) David Ribi (Niall Horan),  Jamie 
Searls (Zayn Malik), Aaron Foster (Liam Payne), Henry Allan (Harry 
Styles) and Matt Brinkler (Louis Tomlinson), have filled concert venues 
across 
the country and have played to tens of thousands of screaming fans

The boys have just got back from two weeks performing two shows a night in Dubai - where their fans went so wild they stormed the stage.

The boys went from struggling musicians to stadium-filling stars within months - and now see every tour as another boys' holiday that earns them thousands of pounds.

David, who sings as Niall, said: 'I think the best way to describe it is to say it’s like being in a flash mob.

'There’s all this greatness and craziness when you’re on stage and then as soon as you’ve done the meet and greet afterwards - everything goes back to normal.

Spot the difference: The tribute band have been together for two years and were selected from hundreds of hopefuls to be the ultimate 1D cover band

'It’s like you’re famous for a little while and you get the buzz of being on stage - but none of the stresses and pressure - you can just walk down the street like a normal guy.'

The boys have learned every song the boy band have released and perform a one-hour set jammed with 1D’s biggest anthems and latest hits.

They went from on-off relationships at home to having thousands of girls desperate for their attention.

Henry said: 'There is just nothing better than performing - the crowd are always screaming and loving what we do and there is no better feeling than that.

'We perform at festivals, our own gigs and birthday parties for One Direction superfans.'

Like the real 1D - Only One Direction are met at gigs by hoards of screaming girl fans.

Matt said: 'They storm the stage afterwards wanting pictures and autographs, it’s crazy.

'The younger crowds like Niall - he’s the cute one, but the older girls love Harry so Henry gets a lot of the attention.'

The tribute band have been together for two years and were selected from hundreds of hopefuls to be the ultimate 1D cover band.

David Ribi, from Kent, is also a leading man in the West End, Jamie Searls, from Cork in Ireland, was in the original Union J line-up on X Factor before he was booted off, Aaron Foster from Newcastle is a model and dancer, Henry Allan is a barman from London and Matt Brinkler is a solo musician from Cambridge.

The London-based band have travelled from Dubai to Aberdeen and have a continuous stream of gigs.

Lovestruck: The boys have had fans asking them to touch their hands and sign their skin, which they describe as 'surreal'

Jamie said: 'We’re very lucky - we have been on a crazy run of performances all over the country.

'Now we get to perform in places like Dubai, which was amazing - we were performing on this massive stage in this enormous mall halfway around the world.

'We’re a new era tribute band - we all play a character in the band but we are all singers musicians and actors in our own right.'

Matt said: 'We learn the new songs as they are released, in the beginning we just had X Factor covers and singles but now we play songs from all three of the One Direction albums.

'When one of the 1D songs was leaked online we learnt the song and performed it before they did - all the fans already knew the words.'

23-year-old Aaron Foster who performs as superstar Liam Payne said: 'The reaction of people when we perform is crazy.

'It’s mental - when there are girls crying, they want you to touch their hands and sign their skin - its a really surreal experience.'

Henry who plays as 1D heartthrob Harry Styles said: 'We have some girls that will come to all our gigs and we have 5,000 followers on Twitter - which in unheard of for a tribute band.

'We’re on the road travelling to shows a lot of the time but its an incredible experience.'
