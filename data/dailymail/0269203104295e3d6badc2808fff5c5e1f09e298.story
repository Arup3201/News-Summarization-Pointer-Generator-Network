Playboy magnate: Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners, has become notorious for hosting wild parties in the Hamptons

A secretly taped video featuring Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney unfavorably sounding off on President Barack Obama’s supporters was recorded at the house of a playboy hedge fund manager who has gained notoriety for debauched sex parties, according to latest reports.

Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, Florida, hosted a fundraiser for the former governor of Massachusetts in May. During the exclusive $50,000-a-plate event, Romney was caught on video dismissing the 47 per cent of Americans who allegedly support President Obama as freeloaders who depend on the government.

The leaked recording caused an uproar in the media following a report by the left-leaning newspaper Mother Jones on Monday, but it also shone a spotlight on the not-so-private life of the host of the now-infamous fundraiser.  

Leder, a divorced 50-year-old private equity honcho, made headlines last August after hosting what was described by the New York Post at the time as a wild end-of-the-season bacchanal in the Hamptons where guests were seen performing sex acts in public while scantily clad Russian women danced on platforms.

According to the Post, Leder rented a palatial beachfront estate in the town of Bridgehampton for $500,000 a month in July of 2011, where he hosted parties every Friday and Saturday that had become the talk of the Hamptons, attracting celebrities like the hip-hop tycoon Russell Simmons and his ex-wife, Kimora Lee.  

The most outrageous of Leder’s society bashes took place on July 30, involving debauched guests skinny-dipping in the pool and men twirling torches to a throbbing techno soundtrack.

At one point, a party-goer described as a ‘chubby white meathead’ and his ‘tanned’ female companion stripped down and jumped into the pool completely naked before moving to a lounge chair, where they proceeded to have sex in full view of their bewildered fellow guests.

The 50-year-old tycoon, whose personal worth was estimated at 400million, capped off the year by throwing a series of parties called ‘Event Week 2011/2012’ at his estate on the island of St. Bart’s, according to the Post.

During one of the events, Simmons Tweeted that fashion stylist Rachel Zoe, who also attended the party, called it ‘out of control.’

Leder filed for divorced in 2009 after his wife of 22 years had admitted to cheating on him with her 23-year-old tennis coach. With his marriage over, a friend told the Post the magnate 'went wild,' going on a dating binge.

In an interview with the New York Times this past January, Leder criticized the media of mischaracterizing him as a ‘private equity party boy.’

‘I think the portrayal of me as having wild and crazy parties is absolutely incorrect,’ he told the paper. ‘I spend a small percentage throwing some parties, attending some parties.

‘I like music. I like to dance. But rather than reporting on how I spend 340 days and nights of my year, the media likes to report on the other 25.’

In the same January interview with the Times, the Sun Capital co-CEO revealed that he was inspired to go into private equity after paying a visit to Romney’s investment firm, Bain Capital.

‘Mr. Romney was an early investor in some of the deals done by Mr. Leder's investment company, Sun Capital, which today oversees about $8billion in equity,’ the article said.

Blunder: The resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House

The Times noted that Leder’s firm was accused by a federal regulatory agency of pushing the fast food chain Friendly’s into bankruptcy in 2011 to avoid paying pensions – a fate that was shared by some 25 companies in Sun Capital’s portfolio since 2008. 

Before founding Sun Capital in 1995, Leder worked as a senior vice president at the now-defunct Lehman Brothers.

On May 17, Leder organized a fundraiser for Mitt Romney, inviting 150 wealthy donors to his home in Boca Raton for a lavish dinner.

During the party, the Republican nominee was taped telling the guests, among other things, that the nearly 50 per cent of voters who support the president ‘believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.

'That, that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.'

He added that 'my job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.'

The comments set off a firestorm in the media, prompting Romney to hold a late-night press conference in an attempt to minimize the damage from the leak.

The Republican candidate said that Obama believes in 'a government-centred society' whereas he believes in a 'free people, free enterprise, free market' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work.

He added that 'my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility' and 'getting people back to work.'

Romney conceded only that his sentiments were 'not elegantly stated' because he was 'speaking off the cuff.'

Battered: The Obama campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying Romney 'disdained' half of the nation

On its part, the Obama campaign quickly seized upon the controversial comments by the president’s opponent, which came only 50 days before the November 6 election.

In a statement reacting to the secret recordings, Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, said: 'It's shocking that a candidate for President of the United States would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as "victims" entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take "personal responsibility" for their lives.

'It’s hard to serve as president for all Americans when you’ve disdainfully written off half the nation.'

Romney's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a Tax Policy Center report that found 46.4 per cent of American households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government.

But Romney appeared to mix up the 47 per cent of people who did not pay income tax -- many of whom pay state and local taxes and payroll taxes -- with the proportion of core Obama supporters. Many of those who don't pay income tax are Republican supporters -- particularly working class white men and the elderly.
