Unique story: Ben Breedlove, 18, of Austin, Texas, lost his life on Christmas Day from a heart attack after cheating death three times, but his videos of his near-death experiences captured the hearts of viewers

‘They were brought to tears, seeing 
their son again,’ Miss Breedlove told People. ‘Ben told us he wanted to 
go back, of the peace he experienced and how he wanted to go back to 
that place.’

She added that he was ‘ready’ to go and 
thinks he left the videos ‘for us to find’. ‘This was his way of leaving
us with something that we would need,’ the 19-year-old told the 
magazine.

Ben suffered from a heart 
condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - a disease which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood properly.

At last Thursday's funeral service in Austin, 
Gateway Church pastor John Burke said Ben 'loved life and he loved 
God' - and added that he hopes everyone can find a similar peace.

Miss Breedlove said the day was a 
celebration, and wore earrings her brother had given
to her for Christmas - and a blue dress because she wanted to have 
something colourful on.

The service was
streamed live by TV station KXAN on its website, showing the 1,500 
people who had gathered to celebrate him.

The teen captured the world's attention 
in a series of videos in which he offered relationship advice and talked
about his health.

He described three near-death 
experiences. One of which was when he was aged just four - and he remembered seeing a big 
bright light above him while he was being moved on a stretcher down a hospital 
corridor.

Acceptance: He talks about bright lights and feeling at peace and a rapper called Kid Cudi he met

Heaven: Ben said in his video that the feeling of peace was so immense, he did not want to leave

His experiences left him convinced of 
the existence of God and life after death. He had a near death 
experience when he was four, fourteen and then less than a month ago.

A Gallup poll showed around eight million Americans claim to have had a near-death experience.

In the video, Ben talks about the bright
light that brought him peace the first time around and the time he was 
wearing a suit and standing in a white room with his favourite rapper 
Kid Cudi.

Of this experience, he wrote: 'I then 
looked in the mirror, I was proud of myself of my entire life, 
everything I have done. It was the BEST feeling.'

The rapper posted this message on his 
blog after hearing of the death: 'I am so sad about Ben Breedlove. I 
watched the video he left for the world to see.

'Him seeing me in detail, in his vision, 
really warmed my heart. I broke down... To Ben’s family, you raised a 
real hero, he’s definitely mine. You have my love.'

Mother and father: Deanne and Shawn Breedlove were 'amazed' at the depth of Ben's thoughts

Talking about the white light he saw in 
hospital when he was four he wrote: 'I couldn't take my eyes off it, and
I couldn't help but smile. I had no worries at all, like nothing else 
in the world mattered.'

Ben had a popular YouTube channel OurAdvice4You in which he gave relationship advice to peers.

It was in his last YouTube video, 
uploaded on December 18, that he made the heartbreaking video, using a 
series of flash cards to talk about growing up with the heart problem.

He revealed he regrets not being like 
everyone else: 'I was never allowed to play sports that my friends did. 
It kinda sucks that I missed out on that part of my life.'
