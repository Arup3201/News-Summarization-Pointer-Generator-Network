According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2014 is expected to break the current record for the hottest year world-wide, which means temperatures in Australia are only expected to rise.

Recently, towns in north-western New South Wales encountered their first 40-degree Spring day this year, while Tibooburra, in far north-west NSW, broke the record for hottest day in 100 years, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

Sydney's temperatures are expected to surge past 31 degrees this weekend, with thunderstorms developing throughout the day. 

Other capital cities, Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth, will reach highs of 30 degrees over the week.  

Meanwhile, wild weather has caused chaos across Australia's southern states with an electrical storm taking over the sky and a lightening bolt blowing apart a Melbourne home.

Severe weather warnings were issued as thunderstorms swept across South Australia and Victoria late on Sunday, with the electrical storm causing thousands of homes to lose power and major delays to public transport. 

Around 3000 homes in Sydney's west lost power on Monday evening, after winds brought down power-lines and trees, Nine News reports.  

In Paddington, east of Sydney, a tree collapsed and crushed several cars from the strong winds that  occurred during the day. 

Across Sydney, State Emergency Service crews assisted  40 different wild weather reports.   

A family were forced to flee their home in Prahran, south-east of Melbourne's CBD, early on Monday morning after a lightening strike started a fire.

The family of five were woken by the fierce electrical storm about 2am before they heard a loud crash, smelt smoke and saw their home going up in flames. 

It took about two hours to contain the blaze as neighbouring houses were forced to evacuate. 

A witness, Andrew, told 3AW the fire looked 'very fierce'. 

'We all thought lightning actually went through the house because it was blown apart,' he said.

The incredible lightening strikes sent social media into a frenzy with a number of photos capturing the bolts

Severe weather warnings were issued for several areas, including Eastern Eyre Peninsula, Lower Eyre Peninsula and parts of the West Coast

Despite the fierce lightening, rainfall across South Australia was brief

The thunderstorms brought a cool change and pushed down the forecast for Adelaide to a max of 20 degrees

It's understood the lightening strike hit a tree and started the fire, which subsequently spread into the attic of the home. 

But despite the severe storms that lashed parts of central Victoria, the State Emergency Service received less than 10 calls for assistance overnight.

The fierce storm originated in South Australia on Sunday afternoon where severe weather warnings were issued for several areas in the south and south-east.

The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded the severe thunderstorm warning over South Australia early on Monday morning

Despite the electrical storm on Sunday, Adelaide was only expecting a slight chance of a shower on Monday

Possible showers were expected to continue into Monday

The SES has advised people to keep clear of fallen power lines and beware of fallen trees or debris

BoM issued a strong wind warning on Monday for several areas in South Australia, including Adelaide Metropolitan Waters, Central Coast, South Central Coast, Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent

Gusts of up to 90 km/h were expected across parts of South Australia overnight

Social media users commented it was the most lightening they have ever seen

The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded the severe thunderstorm warning over South Australia early on Monday morning but rain was expected to continue. 

The SES has advised people to keep clear of fallen power lines, beware of fallen trees or debris, don't drive or walk through flood water and keep clear of creeks and storm drains. 

Weather conditions in Victoria are expected to calm, with the BoM predicting partly cloudy conditions, showers, moderate winds and a top of 19 degrees for Melbourne.

It comes as temperatures are expected to soar across parts of Queensland.  

Some towns in the central west are expecting temperatures of 40 degrees or more for the week ahead.

In Cunnamulla, in south-west Queensland, a temperature record that had stood for more than a century tumbled on Sunday.

'We saw October maximum temperature records broken at St George, Goondiwindi, Cunnamulla, and even some over nearer to the east coast,' Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Gordon Banks told the ABC on Monday.

Despite the severe storms that lashed parts of central Victoria, the State Emergency Service received less than 10 calls for assistance overnight

The fierce storm originated in South Australia on Sunday afternoon before lashing parts of Victoria

Melbourne can expect showers until Wednesday where its predicted to be mostly sunny

'At Cunnamulla they got 42 degrees yesterday and that's the highest October temperature ever recorded there - and that station has been open since 1907.'

Queensland's heavily populated south-east corner won't be spared the heat, with Brisbane expecting a maximum of 36 degrees on Monday.

Ipswich, to Brisbane's west, is expected to get to 40, which is just off the highest October temperature on record of 41.1 in 1958.
