Justice: Barry Minkow, a former millionaire and convicted con artist pictured here in 2002, pleaded guilty to cheating his San Diego church congregation out of some $3million

Barry Minkow has been a teenage millionaire, a convicted con artist, a fraud investigator and a religious leader - and now he can add 'church thief' to his list of vocations.

On Wednesday, Minkow, 46, pleaded guilty to embezzling funds from the San Diego Community Bible Church over the course of nearly 10 years, a U.S. attorney's statement said.

He was already serving a five-year sentence for a securities fraud conviction in Florida and could get five additional years when he is sentenced for the new conviction April 7.

Under the plea deal, Minkow admitted that he opened unauthorized church bank accounts, forged signatures on checks and pocketed member donations for himself.

'Barry Minkow is again convicted of fraud, this time for stealing money from the parishioners of San Diego Community Bible Church," U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said. 'We stand vigilant against those who cheat and steal without regard to the consequences wrought on their victims and their communities.'

Minkow gained national attention as a teenager in the 1980s by founding the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in Southern California at age 16.

Wall Street prodigy: Minkow, pictured in 1996, rose to prominence in the 80s when, as a 16 year old, he founded a successful carper-cleaning business and became the youngest person in U.S. history to take it public four years later

By the time he was 21 years old, Minkow became the youngest person at the time in U.S. history to take a company public, and he became very wealthy on paper.

The business prodigy was living the high life for a while, buying luxury sports cars and sending money to Israel as the stock of his company soared.

But ZZZZ Best turned out to be involved in a Ponzi scheme in which investors poured $100million into bogus fire and water restoration projects.

In 1988, Minkow was sentenced to 25 years in prison for cheating investors out of $26million by convincing them that his company was making $43million a year, 10News reported.

The incredible tale of Minkow's meteoric rise and fall was told in a 1990 biography by Daniel Akst titled 'Wonderboy: The Kid Who Swindled Wall Street.'

He was released in 1995 on parole, emerging from prison gates as a born-again Christian and evangelist after undergoing a religious conversion. Minkow became pastor of the San Diego church two years later.

He also founded the Fraud Discovery Institute, which helped the FBI and other law enforcement agencies ferret out white-collar crimes around the country.

Minkow’s transformation from a convicted criminal to an anti-fraud crusader and church leader earned him much praise in the media, and his life story was even featured on an episode of CBS’ ‘60 Minutes’ in 2006.

But even while working with the institute, he was engaged in manipulating the stock prices of the companies he was investigating, federal prosecutors said.

In 2011 in Miami, a federal judge sentenced Minkow to five years in prison for involvement in a scam that cost homebuilder Lennar Corp. some $580million in lost stock value.

The judge, Patricia Seitz, said at the time that Minkow was a 'very gifted person,' but he had "no moral compass that says "stop."'
