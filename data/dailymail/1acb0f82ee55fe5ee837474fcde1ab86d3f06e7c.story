1995 and 1998 videos show GOP candidate discussing contents of newsletters

Paul claims he didn't write or read the letters

Ron Paul has denied knowing what was published in racist and homophobic newsletters sent in his name until at least a decade later, but newly resurfaced videos are proving his claims false.

In the latest video to surface, the Texas congressman and contender for the Republican nomination for president appears to take credit for the controversial newsletters.

In the 1995 footage, uncovered by Buzz feed, the candidate said:  'I...do a newsletter, it's called the Ron Paul Survival Report,' he said. 'It's expressing concerning about surviving in this age of big government.'

Contradictions:  Paul is shown in 1995, left, and in 1988, right, discussing the contents of the controversial newsletters, despite claiming he had not read them

Material in the newsletters- named the Ron Paul Political Report, Ron
 Paul’s Freedom Report, the Ron Paul Survival Report and the Ron Paul 
Investment Letter- contained racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic rants.

'I didn't read that stuff, I was aware of it probably 10 years after it was written.' Paul told CNN in an interview this week.

'I didn’t write them. I disavow them. That's it,' he added.

The
 controversial newsletters, which reportedly made Paul $1m, featured a 
series of racist statements, including, 'We are constantly told that it 
is evil to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational.'

Referring to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, another read, 'Order was only restored in 
L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.'

The
 articles called Martin Luther King Jr. a 'world-class 
philanderer,' criticized the U.S. holiday bearing King's name as 'Hate 
Whitey Day', and said that AIDS sufferers 'enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick.'

Paul is currently surging in the polls.

Despite claiming he did not read the 
material until years later, Paul - also appears to be knowledgeable about the contents of the newsletters in
 two much earlier C-Span videos.

A letter signed by Paul in 1993 warning of a 'coming race war' has also been uncovered.

The
 scare-mongering letter written in 1993 lists far-fetched conspiracy 
theories and urges the reader to 'save their family' by forking out for 
the $99 subscription.

A video from 1995 shows the GOP presidential hopeful discussing the controversial newsletters.

In
 the resurfaced interview, Paul - then out of office and trying to 
return to Congress - describes the 'educational' newsletters and appears
 to be aware of their contents.

'It
 covered a lot about what was going on in Washington: financial events, 
especially some of the monetary events, since I had been especially 
interested in monetary policy, had been on the banking committee and am still very interested in that subject,' he said.

'This newsletter dealt with it. This 
has to do with the value of the dollar, the pros and cons of the gold 
standard, and of course the disadvantages of all the high taxes and 
spending our government seems to continue to do.'

The
 video was posted on YouTube by Alexander Kaczynski, a self-described 
'political junkie' who has previously unearthed old videos of current 
presidential hopefuls, reports the New York Daily News.

The
 candidate's spokesman, Jesse Benton, told USA Today that Paul was 
talking about an investment newsletter and that the incendiary comments 
were in others that he did not write.

In
 1996, Paul told the Dallas Morning News that the material was accurate 
but had just been taken out of context, reports the Daily News.

Another clip dated 1988, which was 
uncovered by the Huffington Post, shows Paul talking about spending time
 on his newsletter when he was away from public office.

'I
 also put out an investment type of letter because I've always been 
fascinated with the hard money school, and been interested in the gold 
standard, so I put out an investment letter on those lines,' he said amidst his run for presidency at the time.

It is worth noting, however, that most of the 'racist' text came four years after this C-SPAN interview in the early 90s..

The
 1993 eight-page letter, however, came a year after the most 
inflammatory newsletter was published during the 1992 LA riots, and 
appears to carry Paul's signature at the end.

The
 letter urges readers to subscribe to Paul's newsletters so that he 
could 'tell you how you can save yourself and your family' from an 
overbearing government.

It also warns that the U.S. government's redesign of currency to include different colors - a move aimed at thwarting counterfeiters - actually was part of a plot to allow the government to track Americans.

His Iowa chairman, Drew Ivers, has repeated Paul's claims that he did not write the articles, reports Reuters.

Paul has repeatedly said the articles do not reflect his views, highlighting that his public stances - such as supporting homosexuals in the military -  run counter to the incendiary statements in them..

His campaign claims he also did not write the mailer, although it carries his signature. 

Touchy: Earlier reports made it seem like Ron Paul stormed out of the interview, while the raw footage makes it seem like it was simply over

The letter - written during a period in which Paul returned to Washington after a decade's absence -  claims that Paul - through what isdescribed as a network of 'extraordinary sources' - had acquired information that would help his subscribers to 'neutralize' the plans of 'powerbrokers.'

The letter goes on to describe a number of conspiracy theories that he had 'unmasked', including a 'plot for world government, world money and world central banking.'

It also claims that Paul's newsletters 'laid bare' the 'Israeli lobby, which plays Congress like a cheap harmonica,' and a 'federal-homosexual cover-up on AIDS.'

The letter urges readers to buy the $99 subscription to receive Paul's monthly political and investment newsletters, a copy of his book 'Surviving the New Money', an investment manual and access to his Financial hotline.
