Appeal: DJ Chris Moyles tried to keep his name secret during an HMRC appeal hearing as his lawyers claimed to reveal his identity would infringe his human rights, it has been revealed

Chris Moyles is engulfed in a privacy scandal as it emerged today he fought to keep his membership of a tax-avoidance scheme secret claiming unmasking him would 'infringe' his human rights.

The former Radio 1 breakfast show host, who earned a £500,000 annual salary until he left his job in September, asked a tax tribunal to grant him anonymity in his battle with HM Revenue and Customs.

Mr Moyles was a member of a 'marketed tax-avoidance scheme' which HMRC said did not work, but the broadcaster appealed that decision and asked that the press and public be prevented from knowing the case involved him.

Usually that appeal would be heard in public but the legal team acting for the self-appointed 'saviour of Radio 1' argued he was 'fearful' his career would be damaged should be be exposed as an aggressive tax-avoider.

But the judge considering the case dismissed his plea saying there was 'obvious public interest' in naming him adding the rich and famous should be treated like everyone else.

'If it were to become public knowledge that he availed himself of a tax-avoidance scheme, his career might be damaged and his earning capacity reduced,' Judge Colin Bishopp said when summarising the DJ's arguments.

'He is already the focus of media interest for other reasons, much of it hostile,' he added.

At the heart of the DJ's claim to be protected was that 'adverse media comment' would deny him the 'right to respect for his private and family life'

But Judge Bishopp disagreed, adding: 'The fact that a taxpayer is rich, or that he is in the public eye, does not seem to me to dictate a different approach.

'On the contrary, it may be that hearing the appeal of such a person in private would give rise to the suspicion that riches or fame can buy anonymity, and protection from the scrutiny which others cannot avoid.'

Exit: After years on the Radio 1 breakfast show Chris Moyles, 38, left in September but says his career would be damaged if he was revealed to be involved in the HMRC appeal case

In spite of his ruling, at London’s Upper Tribunal in July, Judge Bishopp made it clear that HMRC did not claim that Moyles had behaved unlawfully.

The Times said yesterday it established that the man referred to as 'Mr A' in the court papers was Chris Moyles.

The BBC has been widely criticised for allowing staff to be paid 'off the books' with at least 120 stars earning more than £150,000 being paid in this way.

It is not clear, however, if Mr Moyles has funnelled his BBC earnings via a tax avoidance scheme but the corporation confirmed he is still under contract with them.

Avoidance: It comes just months after it was revealed that Jimmy Carr was paying as little as 1% tax via a scheme

BBC rules say that their staff must pay 'an appropriate amount of tax' and a spokesman added that aggressive tax avoidance would 'very likely' break those rules. In some cases this could lead to disciplinary proceedings and even get the sack.

MailOnline has attempted to contact My Moyles's representatives but they have not responded.

His claim for anonymity is just another attempt for the rich and powerful to avoid open justice, Mark Stephens, one of Britain's leading privacy lawyers has said.

He added he was astonished Mr Moyles had been advised to seek a gagging order in these circumstances.

'He has effectively made worse a situation which was already bad. For the last five years the courts have provided people in the public eye with a degree of privacy, but many judges are now looking much more rigorously at whether privacy is genuinely needed,' he told The Times.

'If there’s some measure of public interest, as there would be in this case, the courts are starting to re- apply principles of open justice.'

In June comedian Jimmy Carr – who in the past had publicly mocked tax avoidance – was revealed as one of thousands of people using a legal off-shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax.

He is believed to have been the largest beneficiary of the K2 accountancy arrangement, said to shelter £168million a year from the taxman.

He put away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme, it was claimed.

K2 works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based trust, which lends investors back the money. Because the loan can technically be recalled, it is not subject to income tax.
