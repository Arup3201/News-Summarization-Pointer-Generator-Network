More than 100 orphaned seal pups have been saved by rescue workers after they were swept away from their mothers during the recent floods.

The adorable pups, many of them under three weeks old and in need of constant care, were washed up  after a tidal surge hit the east coast.

Each pup is expected to need up to five 
months’ rehabilitation after being separated from its mother, and so 
many of the animals needed looking after that the East Winch Wildlife Centre in Norfolk has now reached full capacity.

Orphaned: This tiny seal pup is one of more than 100 rescued by the RSPCA after they were swept away from their mothers during the recent floods

Alone: The orphaned pups were separated from their mothers in the storm surges that hit the east coast last week

Mission: RSPCA workers help to carry some of the stricken seal pups to safety after they were washed up on the East Anglia shoreline

The centre now needs help from the public to care for the animals, as staff are struggling to cope with the numbers.

Centre manager Alison Charles said: 'We have never had a seal rescue project on a scale as big as this before.

'If it wasn’t for us, these seal pups would starve to death. But we really need the public’s help because without their donations we simply couldn’t do what we do.

'This couldn’t have happened at a worse time for the seals.

Rescue: The pups were taken from the shoreline by RSPCA workers and taken to an animal rescue centre to be cared for

New home: The animals have been looked after at the East Winch Wildlife Centre in Kings Lynn, Norfolk

Help needed: With the centre at full capacity staff have struggled to cope with the number of seals, prompting the RSPCA to launch a crisis appeal

'We are at the height of the grey seal
pupping season, which means most of these poor seals should still be 
dependent on their mother’s milk.'

Seal colonies are a common sight along the Norfolk coast as they come ashore to breed between November and January.

There
had been fears that hundreds of seals would be killed when the highest 
tides on record hit the coast last Thursday and Friday.

Pups cannot swim or survive without their mother’s milk until they have shed their distinctive white fur.

At one breeding ground in Horsey, volunteers counted 440 pups on the beach before the surge and only 177 after it hit.

Disaster: If it had not been for rescue workers and staff at the centre, the seal pups would have starved to death

Feeding time: It costs £22 a week to feed each of the young seals

But National Trust rangers at 
Blakeney Point, one of the largest colonies with about 1,000 seals and 
pups, said they had accounted for the vast majority of the seals.'

It would appear that the majority of 
seals and pups were able to reach higher ground on the sand dunes and 
escape the worst of the surge,' a spokesman said.

The RSPCA has launched a crisis appeal to help care for the orphaned seals, with the charity saying it costs £22 a week to feed each pup.

The eventual aim is to returning the animals to the wild.
