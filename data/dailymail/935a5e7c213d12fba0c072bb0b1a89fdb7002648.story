Evgeny Lebedev, the son of a  billionaire ex-KGB tycoon, has been involved in channelling a financial  contribution to the anti-Press Hacked Off campaign.

The controversy centres on a £20,000 donation made to a body that Mr Lebedev, the owner of the Independent and London Evening Standard, set up supposedly to champion free and independent journalism.

The Journalism Foundation was closed down after only a year when it failed to attract enough donations from outside the Lebedev family. But it has now emerged that Mr Lebedev is planning to transfer the £20,000 donation to Hacked Off.

The move is controversial because Hacked Off – which helped draft a new Royal Charter to bring in State regulation of the Press in a shadowy 2.30am deal in the office of Ed Miliband – does not itself have charitable status.

The fear is that – if it gets the money – there will be no way of checking it is only being spent on charitable work that supports the objectives of the Journalism Foundation. Mr Lebedev, who is a personal friend of Hacked Off director Hugh Grant, has railed against alleged Press intrusion in the past.

The £20,000 was donated to the Journalism Foundation at a ‘gala’ evening attended by celebrity supporters including Mr Grant in May last year.

A spokesman for Evgeny Lebedev said: 'I would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the Journalism Foundation, specifically to be used for supporting the non-Leveson activities of Hacked Off'

The revelations about the money were made by The Times newspaper, which said Hacked Off was yet to receive the £20,000 donation. In a critical editorial, the paper wrote: ‘It may be because some of Mr Lebedev’s colleagues see more clearly than he does the inherent difficulty in using an organisation set up to promote “free and independent journalism” to channel money to one committed to statutory Press regulation. Either way, the solution is obvious: Mr Lebedev should ensure that any funds given to his foundation for Hacked Off are returned. Anyone who wants to help fund the group can still do so, directly and openly. It’s a free country after all.’

Yesterday a Foundation spokesman told The Times the donation was for a ‘public interest defence project’ and its trustees had decided to tell Hacked Off the donation would be honoured.

A spokesman for Evgeny Lebedev said: ‘I would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the Journalism Foundation, specifically to be used for supporting the non-Leveson activities of Hacked Off. In other words, this was not Evgeny’s money and not for funding anti newspaper legislation. And the money will not be given if the donation does not comply with charities legislation.’

Mr Lebedev’s wealth comes from his father Alexander, a former KGB agent who owns a bank in Moscow. The Independent has supported statutory regulation of the Press.

But, last month, Alexander Lebedev apparently contradicted the position adopted by his son. He said: ‘The restrictions of the freedom of the Press in Britain – I would think that would be a very wrong decision. Absolutely. There are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair.’

A spokesman for Hacked Off said: ‘Hacked Off understand that the donation from the Journalism Foundation will be honoured.

‘When it is, the funds will be earmarked for research and campaign work into public interest defences in journalism.’
