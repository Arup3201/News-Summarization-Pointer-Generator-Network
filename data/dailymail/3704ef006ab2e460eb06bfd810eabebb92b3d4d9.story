A brother and sister have admitted to having a sexual relationship after they were caught kissing between their jail cell bars following an arrest for alleged meth possession.

Charlene Ellet, 25, and her brother Cameron Beck, 26, from Houston, Texas, now also face charges of prohibited sexual conduct on top of the drugs charges, according to police reports.

The duo were picked up at a Wal-Mart after Beck drove his sister and her two-year-old twin daughters to the store, where Ellet was caught for allegedly stealing.

Arrest: Cameron Beck, 26, has been arrested after allegedly having a sexual relationship with his sister

Caught: His sister Charlene Ellet, who insisted they had different fathers, told deputies that they had sex in their motel room bathroom while her two-year-old daughters played in the bedroom

As deputies searched Beck's car, they allegedly found a backpack containing a light bulb with burn marks and a cut pen with a crystal substance on it, according to the Montgomery County Police Reporter.

The substance tested positive for Methamphetamine and Ellet admitted that she and her brother had smoked it two weeks before, the Police Reporter said.

They were taken to the Montgomery County and placed in adjoining cells, where deputies witnessed the pair kissing each other on the lips through the bars, authorities said.

One of the deputies asked if they were siblings and Ellet confirmed that they were.

She explained that she had the same biological mother but a different father to her brother and that she had been adopted.

Poser: Ellet said she only struck up a relationship with her brother while he was in prison last year

'Relationship': Beck was allegedly caught kissing Ellet in jail after they were arrested for meth possession

Her brother had been in prison until 
November last year and they had struck up a relationship by writing back
 and forth, she explained.

She told deputies that she had been involved in a sexual relationship with Beck since he was released from prison, police said.

Ellet and Beck had been staying in a motel and they had been sleeping in the same bed as her twin daughters from a previous relationship, police said.

She explained that the room had a partition and the girls would stay on
 the other side while she and her brother had sex, but sometimes they would go to the bathroom for sex, police said.

Her daughters have been handed over to Ellet's sister.

Ellet
 and Beck remain in the Montgomery County Jail for possession 
of controlled substance and prohibited sexual conduct. Ellet was also issued a citation for shoplifting under $50.

On Facebook last year, Ellet wrote: 'So was finally able to talk to my 
bro..havent seen or talked to him in 20 yrs...cant believe how alike we 
r...practically twins!!! Family is all we got in the 
end!!'

On Beck's Facebook page, he has included images of his sister which bear the message: 'Love you baby.'
