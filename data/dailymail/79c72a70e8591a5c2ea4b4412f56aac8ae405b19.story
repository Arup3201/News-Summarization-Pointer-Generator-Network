The family of a Brooklyn man who died during a skydiving jump gone-wrong on Sunday said there father often said if he was ever going to die, he wanted it to be out of a plane.

Arkady Shenker, who would have turned 50 this week, plunged to his death when his parachute failed to open.

A veteran skydiver who had jumped hundreds of times before, Shenker landed in the backyard of a home in southern New Jersey, right next to a family who had been celebrating Easter with an egg hunt for their children.

Shenker's 24-year-old son, Alex, told The Inquirer would have been content with the way he died.

'Whatever hardships he had in life, they just melted away after a couple of jumps,' his son said.

'Whatever hardships he had in life, they just melted away after a couple of jumps,' his son said.

'To him, the danger was just danger.

'He said, if he ever goes, that's the way he wanted to go.

'I guess he got his wish.'

Shenker, boarded a plane with Freefall Adventures in Williamstown, Gloucester County.

He was wearing a 'wing suit' that skydivers use to create a gliding experience before deploying a parachute.

He had already made two successful jumps on Sunday when he went for his third.

His son said he became tangled in the parachute and was unable to deploy a second parachute as he descended at a high speed.

Rescue crews were called to the 100 block of Tuckahoe Road, about 2pm.

Shenker was taken to Kennedy University Hospital in Washington Township, where he was pronounced dead at 3:38 p.m.

Witnesses told authorities they saw the skydiver spiraling in a residential area where skydivers usually are not seen.

Officials say Shenker was an experienced skydiver with more than 350 jumps.

A spokesman for the prosecutorâ€™s office says that federal authorities will investigate.

According to ABC Action News, the Dye family was in the middle of an Easter egg hunt in their backyard in Washington Township when they saw a skydiver fall into a nearby backyard.

'I saw the jumpers. Then I noticed one and he kind of looked like he wasn't conscious, he was just spinning,' Annie Marie Dye said.

The Dyes and other neighbors rushed to help Shenker, who at that stage, they say, was unconscious but still breathing. 

One neighbor told NBC that Shenker was obviously seriously injured.

'He put a dent in the ground that deep,' he said, indicating about a foot with his hands.

The Federal Aviation Administration has said they will investigate the cause of the accident.

In 2011, Scott Shields, the popular Mayor of Rutledge, Delaware County, died while parachuting from the same Gloucester County company; Shields was also an experienced skydiver.

Freefall Adventures continued to take skydivers up to jump just hours after the tragedy.
