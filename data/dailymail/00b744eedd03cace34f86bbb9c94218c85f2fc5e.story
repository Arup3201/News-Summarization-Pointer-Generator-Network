With the Six Nations coming down to a nail biting final week, England will be counting their lucky stars after Wales ended Ireland's Grand Slam dreams and put Stuart Lancaster's side top of the table.

Four score points is what separates the top two, with the Welsh just behind - knowing that if both slip up then the title could well be heading to Cardiff.

England welcome France to Twickenham knowing they're in pole position and Lancaster's side have been working hard at Pennyhill Park in preparation for the pivotal weekend.

The England coach is unlikely to make an wholesale changes and could field the same starting 15 as he did in Saturday's victory over Scotland. 

Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling are pushing for recalls after coming on in the second half during the 25-13 win at Twickenham. 

Courtney Lawes believes England's fitness levels could be the difference when the two sides meet on Saturday.

‘I’ve played against many French sides. They’re always physical. Obviously we’ve got to stay with them and show them they can’t just roll over us. 

'Then we can play some good rugby, get them moving around us and hopefully our fitness will tell come the end.’ 

The schedule has presented England with the significant advantage of knowing exactly what their target will be against France when the last game of the 2015 Six Nations kicks off.

Lancaster will inform his players of the results of Wales' clash with Italy in Rome and Ireland's match against Scotland at Murrayfield.
