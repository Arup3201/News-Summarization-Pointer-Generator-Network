They shot to fame over 20 years ago, but Kate Moss, Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell are still dominating the industry.

The trio, known as 'the supers', are still the three highest earning models in the UK, despite new faces such as Cara Delevigne being catapulted to success.

She may have just turned 40, but Kate Moss isn't letting her age dampen her success with a brand new collection for Topshop, a Burberry fragrance campaign and role at Vogue under her belt.

Still going strong! Despite just turning 40, Kate Moss has topped The Times' model rich list with a reported fortune of £55m

It comes as little surprise then that the model took this year's top spot in the Times Rich list of models.

Her hard work - including campaigns for Rimmel, St. Tropez, Carphone Warehouse and Alexander McQueen - has certainly paid off; the Croydon-born model's estimated fortune is £55m.

Despite fronting some of the most high profile campaigns of the last 25 years, Kate is still mystified by her appeal.

The mother, who has appeared on the cover of fashion bible Vogue 35 times, admits she has no idea why her appearance on the glossy cover causes magazine sales to sky-rocket.

Bigger than ever: At the age of 40, Kate is 
still going strong and one of her most popular campaigns was with St. 
Tropez last year

They just get better with age: Naomi Campebll and Kate Moss, pictured, left, at Kate's Topshop launch this month and, right, at a fashion party in 1999, both started out in the early 90s and have both amassed millions of pounds thanks to their good looks

Speaking in a rare interview with photographer Nick Knight, SHOWstudio founder and long-time friend, she said: 'I know it's weird though, innit? 'Cause I don't understand, I mean…let's not question it!.'

She is closely followed by 43-year-old Claudia Schiffer, who is thought to have a fortune of £50m thanks to her 20-year career.

The German-born model kickstarted her career as a super with a famous Guess campaign in 1993 and has since covered more than 1,000 magazines, fronted global campaigns for luxury fashion and fragrance houses and has her own clothing label.

Now and then: The Streatham-born model, pictured, left, last year and, right, on the catwalk for Donatella Versace in 1999, has a reported fortune of £20m thanks to her modelling duties and TV show, The Face

In third place is Kate's best friend and fellow super, 43-year-old Naomi Campbell.

The Streatham-born model, who is considered to be the first high-profile black mode, has a reported fortune of £20m thanks to her modelling duties, an r&b-pop album, film cameo roles and TV show, The Face.

Other high profile names to make the list include Sudan-born Alek Wek, who fled her homeland in 1977 and has since amassed a £15m fortune thanks to campaigns with the likes of Alexander McQueen and Chanel.

In fifth and final place is Naomi's The Face co-star, 36-year-old Erin O'Connor, who has a reported wealth of £12m.

Contenders: In fourth and fifth place respectively came Alex Wek, with a reported fortune of £15m, left, and Erin O'Connor, who is thought to have £12m in the bank
