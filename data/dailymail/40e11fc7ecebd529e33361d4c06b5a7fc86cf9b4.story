A jilted husband has appeared in court after attacking a double-amputee war hero  after finding him in bed with his wife.

Harry Pattison, 28, of  Scarborough, North Yorkshire, jumped on Tom Lawlor, 24, and began repeatedly punching him after finding him in bed with his estranged wife, Gemma Woodcock.

Mr Lawlor was fitted with two prosthetic leg limbs after being blown up in Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device five years ago when he was a private in the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.

A court heard Pattison, who works in the family fruit and vegetable shop in Scarborough, and Miss Woodcock had been in a relationship for five years and were married for just a year when she threw him out of the £58,400 house they shared two months ago.

The court heard Mr Lawlor and Miss Woodcock, a waitress, decided to go back to her home after a night out and were in bed when Pattison appeared in the bedroom doorway.

Kathryn Reeve, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was very upset she was with another male so soon after him. 

'The defendant jumped on Mr Lawlor and was punching him.' 

Mr Lawlor was on his first tour of duty  in Helmand Province when an IED exploded

Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard Miss Woodcock, who was naked at the time, jumped on Pattison's back and tried to drag him away as Mr Lawlor tried to get to his legs, which he had left downstairs.

In the course of the tussle Miss Woodcock was thrown down the stairs and suffered cuts and bruises. 

Pattison then began smashing up the house, before running away when Miss Woodcock  called police.

Mr Lawlor did not suffer any serious injuries. 

On Friday Pattison pleaded guilty to assault and criminal damage.

Sentencing was adjourned until January 9 and Pattison was given conditional bail - he cannot have any contact with his ex or Mr Lawlor. 

Mr Lawlor said: 'It was just a domestic incident I got caught in.'

He had been on his first tour of duty  in Helmand Province when a concealed device exploded under his feet.

At Camp Bastion's field hospital he was given lifesaving surgery before being flown back to Birmingham's Selly Oak Hospital.
