Britain today woke up to another frosty morning - but temperatures are set to rise later this week, with New Year's Day reaching double figures. 

When revellers see in the New Year in the UK it will be warmer than Istanbul, which will be 4C, and Rome, where it will struggle to stay above freezing.

Temperatures will hit 10C at midnight in Plymouth, and although there is a risk of rain in the West, the rest of the country should stay mild and dry. 

Treacherous road conditions in the cold weather have cost at least six lives since Boxing Day, with the latest two yesterday in Somerset and Sussex.

Benson in Oxfordshire was the coldest place in the UK this morning with a temperature of -7.3C, while Farnborough, Hampshire, was second at -7.1C.
