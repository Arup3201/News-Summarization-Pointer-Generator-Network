Marion Badea has been jailed for five years after he was found trying to smuggle eight Afghan nationals  on an inflatable boat on the English Channel

A Romanian man who made a 'brazen attempt' to smuggle a group of Afghan nationals into the UK on a small inflatable boat has been jailed.

Seven men, aged between 20 and 35, and a 16-year-old boy, from Afghanistan, were discovered on the boat with Marion Badea when a lifeboat was sent out to rescue them because the vessel's engine had failed.

The group were found in the English Channel, just five miles from Dover, and had been trying to enter the UK illegally. 

Badea, 30, was convicted of assisting unlawful entry into the UK and was jailed for five years. He had previously served nine months in a French prison last year for a similar offence. 

Crew aboard a passing P&O ferry alerted the Coastguard after spotting the small craft in difficulty in June this year and the RNLI and Border Force officials went to the scene. 

The 50hp engine on board the boat had failed and the boat was drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes. 

Crews from the RNLI  set up a tow to the  boat and then a Border Force cutter vessel took over and brought the boat and its nine occupants to Dover lifeboat station, with the RNLI crew providing an escort.

Badea was arrested and charged with assisting unlawful entry into the UK. He was convicted after a two day trial at Canterbury Crown Court. 

All those found on board the boat were removed from the UK apart from the teenager who was transferred into the care of social services, according to the Home Office.

David Fairclough, assistant director of the Home Office immigration enforcement criminal investigations team, said: 'This was an unsophisticated and brazen attempt to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK.

'Thanks to the excellent interception made by the cutter patrol boat, and the subsequent investigation by our specialist criminal investigations team, Badea is now behind bars. 

'Anyone thinking of doing the same should be warned that our specialist teams have the capability and resources to catch you and bring you to justice.'

The small boat was seen drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes in the Channel, five miles from Dover

The group of nine were towed to the shore after a boat passing the inflatable craft radioed the Coastguard 

It was towed to the shore by crews from the RNLI and Border Force who then arrested Badea on the shore

The Home Office's immigration enforcement criminal investigations team is a specialist unit of seconded police officers working alongside warranted Home Office immigration enforcement officers to investigate organised immigration crime.

A ship worker, who witnessed the drama, said at the time: 'They could easily have been run over by a large tanker and they must have set off during darkness so it was incredibly risky.' 

None of the group needed medical attention after the incident.
