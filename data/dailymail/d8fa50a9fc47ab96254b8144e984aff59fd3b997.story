Diana, Princess of Wales was as well known for philanthropy and kindness as she was for her unerring sense of style.

And now, one of the late royal's favourite dressers has opened up about working with the style icon.

Jacques Azagury was introduced to the princess by Anna Harvey, who was deputy editor of British Vogue and a style consultant to the royal.

They went on to develop a strong bond and became great friends, working together right up until her untimely death in 1997.

'My favourite memory of Princess Diana was her presence,' Jacques tells us.

'Another great memory was the sheer fun we had together, especially when it came to choosing her next look. 

'Diana had such a modern look rather than being very formal.'

Thanks to his expertise, Moroccan-born Azagury worked with Naomi Watts, who starred as Diana in the recent biopic.

He created  dresses for the film and used the exact same material that he had left over from creating Diana's original pieces for some of the garments.

'Naomi was a delight to work with,' he said. 'From the moment she walked in, she just completely understood I was dressing her like Diana, we worked very fast together and it was such an easy and enjoyable job.'

So would Jacques ever consider dressing the Duchess of Cambridge? 'Like any other designer, I would love to dress Kate,' he said.

Azagury is famed for his red-carpet 'pret-a-couture' and currently dresses some of the most glamorous women in the world - everyone from rock stars to royalty, BAFTA winners to burlesque dancers. 

His current clients include Kelly Brook, Sheridan Smith, Elizabeth McGovern, and Naomi Watts to name just a few. So what's his secret formula?

'I just love making a woman look great. I would never send a women out on the red carpet looking like someone from the army or a Japanese soldier, she has to look glamorous and sexy.

'I love all of the women I dress, they are from all different backgrounds.'

One of his clients, Dame Helen Mirren, has become a postergirl for mature style. 'My advice for looking that good is try not to look like your 15-year-old daughter. Dress age appropriate but not boring,' says the designer.

And it isn't just in the design world that he's made waves; Azagury also has a fragrance range to boast, which he has just added six new scents to.

The Azagury fragrances serve as an extension of his fashion range and aim to reflect the true design philosophy of the brand.

He has spent three years working on the range of fragrances and was inspired, in part, by his travels in France, Italy and Peru.

'This is a natural extension of my couture line, I constructed it in the same way as my dresses.

'The scents are colour coded rather than named so it leaves it up to the wearer to experiment. Sometimes a name might shape and influence what we feel for a scent,' he explained. 

Notable scents in the new collection include Green (with notes of lime, ginger, carnation, vanilla, sandalwood and white musk), and Black, which has rich notes of plum, orange, jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, and sandalwood.

Sharing his top tips for selecting the perfect scent and making it your own, he advised: 'Choose one that doesn't arrive ten minutes before you do.'
