A 92-year-old woman has been left with horrific injuries after being battered with a walking stick by another pensioner at a care home.

Hazel Sanders, from Birmingham, suffered head injuries, severe swelling and bruising after the resident - a man in his 80s - repeatedly bashed her with his stick.

The frail pensioner remains in hospital after the attack at Karam Court Care Home in Smethwick, West Midlands, on Thursday.

Mrs Sanders' daughter Mary has released these pictures showing her mother's shocking injuries as she demands to know how the attack was allowed to happen in the corridor of the care home by a fellow resident

These shocking images showing the extent of her injuries have now been released by her daughter Mary, who is demanding to know  how the incident was allowed to happen.

She told the Birmingham Mail: 'I fear she won't last very long. She is confused, frightened and very fragile. This has really knocked her about. She is a scared lady.

'He approached my mother as she was walking to her bedroom. As he hit her - bang, bang, bang - she was pleading, "if you want money, just take it". There was no one around. He could've killed her.'

The 71-year-old, whose mother was moved to the home in May after suffering from depression, said she is furious with the care home and claims the offender should be sectioned.

She said: 'This has been handled very badly. I have not received an apology. This is a man with issues and they gave him a stick because he refused a zimmer frame.

'Why was he not being watched? Who else is he going to attack?'

Mrs Sanders (pictured left today and right when she was aged 18) remains at Birmingham City Hospital following the attack. Her daughter said she would not return to the care home because she is 'terrified'

Mrs Sanders' injuries were so severe that her wedding ring had to be cut from her finger due to the swelling

Ms Sanders said staff at Karen Court informed her of her the incident at 7.20pm last Thursday and she rushed to the city's Sandwell Hospital to be at her mother's bedside.

She said she was stunned to see the extent of the injuries, which were so severe her mother's wedding ring had to be cut free from her finger due to swelling.

On Saturday, Mrs Sanders was transferred to Birmingham City Hospital and her daughter claims she will not go back into the care home.

'She won't be returning to Karam Court,' she said. 'She is terrified about returning there.'

West Midlands Police confirmed the incident had been reported to the force.

A spokesman said: 'Police were called to Karam Court Nursing Home, Smethwick, on October 23, following a report a woman in her 90s had been assaulted by another resident - a man in his 80s.

'The woman suffered bruising to her wrist, arm and head after being hit with a walking stick.
