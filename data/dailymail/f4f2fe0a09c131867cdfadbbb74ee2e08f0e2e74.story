Desperate: Millions watched the finale of The Missing last night, hailing its ending and the performance of James Nesbitt 

Almost seven million people watched the gripping finale of The Missing last night with many completely enthralled by an incredible twist about the fate of 'abducted' five-year-old Olly. 

By 10pm last night a 1,000 tweets a minute were being sent during the online frenzy about its ending - with many calling it the finest drama of the year and even better than ITV rival Broadchurch.

Viewers called it 'mesmerising' and 'brilliant', with some admitting that they could not sleep afterwards because it was so 'disturbing' and 'chilling'.

Rows broke out as people were upset that the ending was not conclusive because the boy's father Tony, played by James Nesbitt, still believes his son was alive. 

While others were abused because they said that it was better than Bafta-award winning drama Broadchurch, which was broadcast on ITV last year and returns in January.

David Johnstone said: '#TheMissing ending was incredible. So powerful! Better than #Broadchurch sorry'.

Jason McLaughlin added: 'Thought #TheMissing was far better written, acted & directed than #Broadchurch'. 

Chris d'Lacey ‏tweeted: 'I thought The Missing was brilliant overall and very moving last night, far better than the ridiculously-overhyped Broadchurch'.

Benjamin Jones tweeted: 'Plenty of simple people on here complaining that the ending of #TheMissing wasn't spoon fed to them. You don't deserve good tele'.

The eight-part series is being called the 'best drama of the year' and has received two Golden Globe nominations.

ITV's Broadchurch received similar plaudits and will return for a second series starting on January 5. It was watched by 8.8million but The Missing's peak was 6.6million, last night.

The first series dramatically concluded last night on BBC1 as the mystery of who abducted five-year-old Oliver Hughes from a hotel bar in France during a family holiday in 2006 was finally solved.

James Nesbitt and Frances O’Connor, who plays Emily Hughes, starred in the first series as an English couple struggling to come to terms in the present day with their son’s abduction during the World Cup eight years ago.

Tony chased suspects himself, and even murdered a paedophile, as he searched for his missing son, in a tragic case which also cost him his marriage and his mental health.

But in an incredible twist it was revealed that missing boy Ollie was not abducted - he had chased a fox, finding himself in the middle of the road.

The drunk hotel owner, where the family was staying, knocked him down with his car and hid the boy’s unconscious body in his boot believing he was dead.

But instead of being taken to hospital, the boy was moved to a safe house where he was found to be breathing.

The hotel owner's brother the mayor called in Romanian man who found Olly alive in the boot, and he said he had killed him.

While the boy's mother accepts he is dead - Tony continues his search for Olly because a body was never found - and the final scene shows him tracking a boy to Moscow who looks like his son.

But police arrest him and he is taken away with viewers unsure about whether the boy is alive or dead. 

TV presenter Anneka Rice said: 'Fretful sleep last night cos of #TheMissing. Very disturbed by desperate ending'.

Kara Fitzpatrick ‏wrote: 'The Missing finale was perfect - James Nesbitt at his best.

Craig Saphier ‏tweeted: '#TheMissing was an exceptional bit of tele and a proper harrowing ending too. Loved every minute of it'. 

Revealed: Olly was not abducted, he was knocked down by the drunk owner of the hotel, who then hid the body in the boot

Tragedy: Olly appeared to be dead as the cowardly hotel owner called the emergency services and then hung up - choosing to save himself rather than the little boy

Pain: Nesbitt's character heard the hotel owner's side of the story from his death bed but would not accept his son was dead because no body was found

Is it him?The final scenes were in Russia, where Tony finds the boy he believes is his son in a flat, right

Anguish: But police arrive to arrest him and he is pulled away without finding out the truth

Today many viewers are rejoicing after the BBC confirmed its abduction thriller The Missing will return for a second series, with producers promising a ‘new case’.

After the final show of the first series ended producers trailed a cryptic message suggesting a second storyline, with a short advert accompanied by a voiceover from detective Julien Baptiste, played by Tcheky Karyo. 

He said: ‘To lose somebody can destroy a person. But to find them again, when so much has passed… Well, sometimes, that can be worse.’

The second series is expected to keep the show’s overall structure of a story set over two different time frames, but it will be a fresh case with different characters and a different location.

The writers behind the show, London-based brothers Harry and Jack Williams, said: ‘We always knew that the story of Oliver Hughes would have an ending.

‘But in writing the first series we found there were many themes and issues we didn’t have the chance to explore. The response to the show has been fantastic.

‘And we’re thrilled to be telling a brand new story which we hope will surprise and intrigue and tell an even bigger tale on an even more ambitious canvas.’
