Ed Miliband yesterday insisted he can ‘defy the odds’ and win the next election – despite mounting criticism from senior colleagues and dire results in the polls.

The Labour leader admitted he faces a tough fight to take his party to victory next year and said he always knew it would be no ‘walk in the park’.

Launching new welfare proposals that were immediately savaged by both left and right, he claimed he was relishing the prospect of arguing the case for a Labour government over the next ten months.

The latest YouGov survey for The Sun shows just 19 per cent of people think Mr Miliband would make the best Prime Minister, down from 21 per cent two weeks ago 

His optimism came despite a YouGov poll suggesting only one in five voters thinks he is up to the job of being prime minister.

His
 personal ratings have been lagging significantly behind those of David 
Cameron, while a poll for Prospect magazine found voters thought his 
brother David would make a better prime minister.

To
 add to the Labour leader’s humiliation, Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman 
bowed out on Wednesday night claiming polls show he ‘has about as much 
appeal as a flatulent dog in a lift’.

It
 came as a series of party grandees lined up to criticise his 
leadership. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Mr Miliband could 
not connect with voters as well as his brother, and Gordon Brown’s 
former spin chief Damian McBride said there were no ‘fighters’ in his 
top team. Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson appeared to offer 
only lukewarm support, saying he was ‘the leader we have’.

Mr Miliband tried to shrug off the comments, saying: ‘I always welcome advice, whatever source  it comes from.’

But
 he insisted that his party could not act as ‘continuity Labour’, 
picking up from where it left off in 2010. Instead, it must respond to  
problems of inequality and  poverty among those in work, which had not 
been solved by New Labour.

Asked
 about his poll ratings, Mr Miliband said: ‘I knew when I took this job 
on that we were going to have a tough fight, because we are trying to 
defy the historical odds, which are that governments who lose elections 
don’t tend to be one-term oppositions.’

He
 added: ‘In the end, I have a big cause that I am fighting for and it is
 a tough fight, but I am determined that we win this fight.

‘I
 didn’t take this job because I thought it would be a walk in the park, I
 fought for this job because I thought it was important and I thought I 
had something distinctive to say about how we can change this country.

‘I relish the next ten months, I relish the opportunity to fight for my vision for the country.’

Lord
 Mandelson told BBC2’s Newsnight Mr Miliband had brought forward 
eye-catching policies. But he added: ‘Having policies without those 
being drawn together into a convincing vivid narrative, a story about 
yourself, who you are, what you stand for and what you are going to do 
for people in the country, is really not enough.’

Asked
 whether Mr Miliband was the best leader the party could have, he 
replied: ‘In my view he is the leader we have and therefore the leader I
 support, and somebody who I believe is capable of leading the party to 
victory.’

Former Labour minister Lord Mandelson said Mr Miliband was 'confused' on business and lacked the 'narrative' to win over voters

Deputy leader Harriet Harman

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman has been 'shut out' of the election campaign, according to reports.

She is said feel sidelined after complaining about the lack of women sharing a platform with Ed Miliband, the left-wing New Statesman magazine said.

It is said she 'went crazy' at shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander over his running of the general election campaign.

'She feels shut out from it all,' a source said.

Meanwhile, Mr 
Johnson told the New Statesman magazine that the Labour leader was ‘not 
as able to connect (with people) as strongly’ as his brother David. 
‘It’s not his strong point,’ he said.

‘I
 can’t pretend that, knocking on doors, people come out and they’re 
really enthusiastic about Ed.’ In another sign of the discontent in the 
party, the magazine said  deputy leader Harriet Harman feels that she 
has been ‘shut out’ of the  election campaign.

And
 in his blog, Mr McBride said Mr Miliband was ‘guilty of recruiting his 
innermost circle of advisers entirely in his own image’.

‘There
 are many positive things to say about the people managing Ed Miliband’s
 operation and running Labour’s campaign,’ he said. ‘But what they are 
not is fighters.’

Mr 
Miliband’s comments came as he launched proposals to strip unemployed 
youngsters of handouts unless they agree to training in vital skills. He
 called for 18 to 21-year-olds to be given a ‘youth allowance’ instead 
of out-of-work benefits. It would be conditional on them signing up to 
learn key skills, and they would not get it if their parents were 
relatively well-off.

Tory 
chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This is just a recipe for more spending on 
welfare, more borrowing – and more taxes to pay for it. That’s exactly 
how Labour got us into a mess in the first place.’

But
 Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union and Labour’s largest financial 
backer, accused Mr Miliband of using ‘Tory rhetoric of sanction  and 
punishment’.
