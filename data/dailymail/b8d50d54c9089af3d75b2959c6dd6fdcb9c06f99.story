David Cameron yesterday warned Nick Clegg not to split the Coalition by siding with Labour in the Commons over calls for a new Mansion Tax.

The Prime Minister told reporters he would be ‘disappointed’ if his deputy opted to vote for the controversial policy which would impose a swingeing tax on homes worth more than £2 million.

But Mr Clegg refused to rule out siding with Labour to back a policy that has long been a cherished Liberal Democrat goal.

Labour is planning to drive a wedge between the Coalition partners by forcing a Commons vote on the principle of a Mansion Tax in the coming weeks.

A Labour source taunted Mr Clegg yesterday, saying: 'Here is a chance for Nick Clegg to prove he can keep at least one of his promises.'

Downing Street has said all ministers will be expected to back Government policy, which is against a Mansion Tax, in any vote.

But
Business Secretary Vince Cable has indicated he may side with Labour 
and Mr Clegg also suggested yesterday that he might vote against the 
Prime Minister on the issue.

He told ITV News: ‘Neither Vince nor I know what will be put before us so we can’t of course determine in advance how we would vote.

‘But of course the Liberal Democrats for a long time have been the leading advocate of greater fairness in tax.

‘The Conservatives don’t want to do that. They don’t want, perhaps, to offend people in very large mansions.

‘They need to answer for themselves. I’m absolutely sure that what we stand for is the right thing.’

During a round of interviews in India yesterday Mr Cameron suggested that for Lib Dem ministers to vote with Labour on the motion could break the terms of the Coalition deal.

Asked about whether Mr Clegg would vote with Labour, he said: ‘I haven’t asked him the question, but as it’s not in the Coalition Agreement to have a Mansion Tax, I would be rather disappointed if he did.’

Mr Cameron made light of suggestions that the Labour leader’s initiative might tempt Mr Clegg into a future coalition with Labour.

‘That’s a matter for him to answer,’ he said. ‘It’s enough running one coalition, without trying to work out what another one would be.’

Meanwhile, George Osborne moved to rule out any Mansion Tax, describing it as a ‘tax con’ which would quickly be applied to much more modest homes.

The Chancellor said: ‘It’s very costly to implement. It means you have to send inspectors round the country valuing all the homes - not just the homes worth over two million but those worth less... It’s actually a tax con that you know there aren’t that many mansions in the country that can be taxed to pay for some tax cut for millions of people.

'So either it’s a tax con and the money comes from somewhere else or it’s soon a homes tax and they say it’s a mansion tax before the election and then very quickly becomes a homes tax on many people who are not living in mansions at all.’

Meanwhile, Mr Clegg will risk charges of complacency over the Eastleigh by-election by jetting off to Spain on holiday.

His party are facing their biggest by-election test in years as they seek to defend the Hampshire seat vacated by disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne.

They insist they are taking nothing for granted, especially as their Conservative coalition partners are the main challengers.

But the Liberal Democrat leader is pressing ahead with a ‘long weekend’ in Spain. A party source said: ‘Miriam has taken the children for half-term and he wants to be there for their youngest son’s birthday.’
