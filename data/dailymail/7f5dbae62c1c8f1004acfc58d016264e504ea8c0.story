QPR have re-opened contract talks with Wembley play-off final hero Bobby Zamora.

The 33-year-old scored a dramatic late winner as Harry Redknapp's men beat Derby in May, but his future remains uncertain after his deal expired last month.

Zamora has been offered a new contract on reduced terms and has also held talks with Millwall boss Ian Holloway.

However, the former Fulham frontman was back at the club's Harlington headquarters this morning for further talks about his future.

Zamora did not take part in training with the rest of the squad, but the club are hopeful of thrashing out a deal with the experienced striker.

Meanwhile, fellow free agent Gary O'Neil, who is also locked in talks over a new contract at Loftus Road, did take part in the double session, along with Adel Taarabt and Esteban Granero.
