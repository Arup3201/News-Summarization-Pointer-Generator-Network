A great-grandmother in Alabama is nursing numerous injuries after fighting off an armed home intruder who tried to burst into her house early in the morning this week.

But Mary Finch, 77, does not regret going head-to-head with the assailant - she just wishes she struck him better.

The elderly woman was asleep in her Birmingham home when a man tried to get into her bedroom door about 6am Monday.

Fighter: Mary Finch, 77, describes how she fought off a home intruder with a hammer during a TV interview

Scene: Mrs Finch was asleep in her Birmingham, Alabama, home on Monday when a man entered the house

Mrs Finch has lived in the single-story home on Jackson Avenue for the last 52 years.

'He started trying to push in, and me and him wrestled at the door,' Mrs Finch told WMTW.

'But he overpowered me and came on in.'

Mrs Finch described the intruder as a white male of about 17 or 18-years-old.

He was threatening her with a handgun.

The teen demanded money, but Mrs Finch said she didn't have any.

That's when she grabbed a hammer sitting on a nearby end table.

Tough: Mrs Finch was able to grab a hammer from a nearby end table and hit the attacker on his hand

'I said ''If you're going to shoot, you better shoot, because I'm going to get you'',' Mrs Finch told the local network.

'I said it about three times.'

'He made a move toward me and I hit him on his hand. I hit him on his fingers.'

The intruder retaliated and hit Mrs Finch in the head with his gun.

He then fled the house and tried to carjack on of Mrs Finch's neighbors.

Investigation: The male intruder fled the home and tried to steal a neighbor's car. The neighbor was shot in the leg during the ensuing confrontation

During the struggle with the neighbor, the gunman shot the man in the leg.

The intruder then fled the scene.

Both the neighbor and Mrs Finch were taken to hospital.

Both will recover from their injuries. 

Birmingham police are now trying to determine whether a nearby home invasion was connected to this incident.

Recovering: Mrs Finch was hit in the head with the gun and also sustained an injruy to her hand during the struggle with the man, who she described as about 17 or 18-years-old

Mrs Finch is now recuperating at home.

However she does not regret how she confronted her attacker.

In fact, she wishes she confronted him better. 

'I could have got the side of his head,' she told WMTW.

'He would've been no problem (then).'
