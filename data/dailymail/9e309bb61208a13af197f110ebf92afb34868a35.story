A crocodile hunter who spent 17 years in pursuit of the dangerous animals now lives with the biggest captive crocodile in the world.

George Craig, 84, from Green Island, Australia, captured dangerous crocodile Cassius - who is 18ft-long and weighs a tonne - 30 years ago, and the pair have lived together ever since.

As a young man George spent 17 years hunting fierce and dangerous crocodiles, and relocating them to a safe enclosure, where they weren't a threat to humans.

While George is sure Cassius knows who he is, he also believes that Cassius would eat him given the chance

Hello Cassius! The 18 foot, one tonne reptile is the largest captive crocodile in the world

George captured Cassius in 1987 from a river in the Northern Territory, where he was notorious for his huge size - and was under threat of being hunted down and killed by the local population.

Cassisus, who is missing his front left leg and tip of his tail due to vicious fights, was deemed a massive threat to humans after attacking boats.

So George set about capturing him to save his life, and bringing him to live in his sanctuary.

Cassius has lived at George's sanctuary, Marineland Melanesia, for the past 30 years, but even after feeding him every day, George knows Cassius would eat him in a second, given the chance. 

George has long been a brave adventurer. Here he is in Papua New Guinea in the 1970s

The crocodile hunter used just rope and his brave spirit to capture the aggressive animal

Billy Craig, George's grandson who helps run the sanctuary, has now released a series of photographs charting his grandfather's life with Casssius.

Billy, 23, said: ‘George likes to feed Cassius personally and after 30 years of being his caretaker, he does have a soft spot for Cassius.

‘Cassius is aware of who George is but there are no illusions that he would eat him if he had the chance, without a doubt.’

‘Cassius was a problem crocodile with a very aggressive nature. He was becoming notorious and he would have almost certainly been killed if he hadn't been removed and taken to a safe place by my grandfather.

‘He captured him the old-fashioned way - with ropes and brave spirit.

‘He was then transferred by a truck 1850 miles Cairns and then by boat to Green Island. George named him Cassius Clay the boxer.’

Cassius now lives at George's family business Marineland Melanesia, which was set up in 1969, in order to provide a place for the crocodiles to live safely.

It was a long journey to bring Cassius home. George travelled him by truck to Cairns and by boat to Green Island
