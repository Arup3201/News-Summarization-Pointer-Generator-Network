A stampede broke out during an event at a mosque in northern China, killing 14 people and injuring 10 others, a state news agency said Monday.

Worshippers at the Beida Mosque in Guyuan, a city in the Ningxia region, were handing out traditional cakes during an event to commemorate a religious figure Sunday afternoon when a rush for food triggered the stampede, the Xinhua News Agency said.

It quoted a witness as saying people trampled over each other.

This year's event had a record number 
of participants as it fell over the weekend, Tan Zongzhi, the head of 
Xiji county's religious affairs bureau, was quoted as saying.

A
 meeting of the Ningxia Communist Party committee on Monday blamed poor 
organization and insufficient management for the stampede, according to 
Xinhua.

Four of the 10 people hospitalized were in critical condition, Xinhua said.

In 2012, two people reportedly died in the Ningxia region after fighting broke out between crowds of Muslims and police, after a mosque was ordered to be demolished for being an ‘illegal religious place’.

Violence erupted in the town of Hexi after 1,000 officers arrived to help police the knocking down of the building.

More than 50 protesters were injured and 100 arrested after several hundred members of China's Muslim Hui minority tried to stop the demolition.

Sources from the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy  said two people died in the clashes.

An employee who answered the phone at the town police station confirmed officers had fought with protesters and said 80 people were detained, but denied any deaths.

The Communist government closely monitors religious activity and is said to be worried that mosques and other houses of worship might become centres for anti-government agitation.

The Hui, who mainly live in Ningxia, are one of several Muslim minority groups in China.

They include descendants of Muslim immigrants from Central Asia, members of China's majority Han ethnicity who converted to Islam and several other groups.
