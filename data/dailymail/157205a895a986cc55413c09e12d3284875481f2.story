Contender: Jackie Green - formerly Jack - hopes to win the Miss England 2012 contest

A teenager who was the youngest person in the world to have a sex change at the age of 16 is edging towards the title of Miss England.

Jackie Green, now 18, was born Jack, but became the youngest person to undergo full gender reassignment surgery on her 16th birthday.

Jackie has now successfully clinched the public vote to secure her place in the semi-finals of the national beauty pageant.

From being a toddler Jackie always acted like a girl and insisted on wearing feminine clothes and playing with girls’ toys.

Her parents came to terms with Jackie’s feelings after she made four attempts at suicide and decided to pay for her to have 28,000 pounds of treatment.

Jackie, who won the public vote in a heat of the contest, impressed a panel of

judges to become the first transgender teenager to go through to the Miss

England semi-final.

The teen, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: ‘I’m ecstatic to get through, I never expected it.

‘It’s been lovely to see the support from everyone and I have had so many

people contacting me saying they hope I win.

‘I have come this far and now I am in it to win it.

‘Lots of people have been in touch and it makes me blush to think I have

inspired others. I never thought I would be able to inspire anyone.’

Mother Susie, 43, said: ‘I’m really proud of her. She’s been through an awful lot but she has chosen to put herself out there and at risk.

‘There is a lot of prejudice out there but she is trying to make people understand this isn’t a choice and it can be OK.’

Miss England semi-finals will be held later this month.

Jackie's life turned from one of misery to the happy girl she is today after the sex change. At her lowest point, the teenager even threatened to cut off her own genitals with a knife.

She underwent a seven-hour sex change operation in Thailand, where under 18s can have the surgery, two years ago.

After years of bullying and torment, she now claims to lead a normal life and has a boyfriend.

Now she hopes to work as a model.

She said: 'It’s a little strange because there are so many other really gorgeous girls in the competition.

'It would be amazing to win and I just hope it makes other people see that there is a lot more to life than getting bullied.'

She added: 'When I was younger I never really 
had anyone else to look up to in the same position. I would have never 
imagined this, not in a million years.'

Her supportive mother Susie added: 'If she went on to win I would be very proud of her.

'She has stuck herself out there and knew she would get flak for it. Some comments on websites haven’t 
been very kind but she is aware of that and thinks why should that stop 
me, I’m the same as anyone else.'

A spokesman for the competition said: 'There's not much we could do legally to stop her entering.

'We did agonise over it, but as she is a woman she fits the bill and is an affable young lady.'

Contender: Weightlifter Sarah Davies has won Miss Leads

A stunning weightlifter has turned Miss England hopeful after combining beauty and brawn.

Sarah Davies, 19, is the current British Universities weightlifting champion - just five months after taking up the sport.

But now, after being persuaded to enter the beauty pageant while working in a bar, Sarah is on the verge of being crowned Miss England.

The Leeds Metropolitan student, from Bilsborrow, Lancashire, said: ‘I wanted to show that it is possible to be fit and healthy while still be glamorous.

‘At the regional heats, I think the judges thought the weightlifting was something a bit different.

‘But I still couldn’t quite believe it when they announced I’d won Miss Leeds and would be going to the finals.’

Sarah wowed judges with her lifting skills - defeating more than 200 applicants to bag a place in the finals, set to be held in Leicester on June 26.

The teenage beauty, who is training to be a PE teacher, added: ‘I work in a bar on Saturday nights and they were coming round asking for people to enter.

‘I did it for a laugh really, I have no ambitions to be a model - and when I saw all these tall leggy blondes at the auditions I didn’t think I’d have any chance.

‘I’ve never been interested in being a model and have had my heart set on being a PE teacher, but it is all good fun and I’ll take it in my stride.’

If things don’t work out, Sarah may still have a career in sport, having set her sights on a place on the GB weightlifting squad for the Commonwealth games.

Sarah, who lifts at the 63kg weight after being introduced to the sport by her boyfriend, is already tipped as a future world champion after a whirlwind rise in the sport.

A spokeswoman for Miss England said: ‘We have had an eclectic mix of contestants this year - from a busker to a footballer.

‘We hope it represents our nation in its diversity and talent.

‘Sarah will be one of 60 national finalists competing for the Miss England title in Leicester in June.

‘The finalists will compete in a boot camp, front top model, fundraising and interview rounds as part of the contest.

‘The winner receives £25,000 and a place in Miss World, where the winner gets $100,000 and a trip to Mauritius to promote the shopping fiesta at the end of June.’
