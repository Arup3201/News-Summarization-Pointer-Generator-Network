It boasts the same grand buildings and landscaped lawns as the original elite British boarding school.

But this version of Wellington College is not nestled in Berkshire's rolling fields, but in a bustling business district in one of China's biggest cities.

Wellington College is set to open an international campus in Shanghai to cater to the children of expats working in the city.

The artist's impression is the first glimpse at the school's plans for its second Chinese branch, located in the Pudong Qiantan business area.

It reveals a grand design echoing the original building built as a monument to the Duke of Wellington in the Berkshire village of Crowthorne more than 150 years ago.

The school signed an agreement with the financial zone's authority paving the way for the establishment of Wellington College International Shanghai yesterday, according to a report on Shanghai Daily.

Enrollment is expected to open in August 2014. Initially, Chinese children will need international passports in order to attend the fee-paying school.

Tuition is expected to be on a par with other leading international schools in Shanghai.

Fees at Wellington College's Tianjin campus stand at approximately 200,000 yuan (around Â£23,500) per year.

The school will cater to 1,500 pupils aged between three and 18.

Local authorities are to negotiate with the college to have enrollment opened to Chinese children that do not hold international passports in the future, officials in Shanghai said.
