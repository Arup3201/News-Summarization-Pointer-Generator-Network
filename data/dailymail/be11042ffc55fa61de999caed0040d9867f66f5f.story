When Nick Knight asked Eoin Morgan, moments after the defeat by Bangladesh, whether England were obsessed with stats, you half-expected Morgan to hit back with: 'Yes, but only 23.54 per cent of the time!'

Not long after, a shattered-looking Peter Moores told Nasser Hussain: ‘We’ve got to have a look at the data’. And, hey presto, England’s latest World Cup fiasco had its epitaph.

The raw data of this World Cup – four humiliations sandwiching a win against Scotland – confirm what most non-ECB observers worked out a long time ago: England are not naturally inclined towards the one-day game, and make things worse by talking about a ‘brand’ of cricket that bears no relation to the one they play or to the players they select.

Mike Atherton said that England were not as reliant on stats as some claim. This may be so. But even if the truth lies somewhere between Morgan’s denial and Moores’s unwitting revelation, it seems clear that no other team talks numbers with as much pseudo-religious relish.

And if it is true that England encourage the players to trust their gut instinct, why then do they bat as if they’ve been told it’s OK to score at 4.5 for 20 overs?

If Moores can’t see that this is a team frightened by their own shadow (and, no doubt, by their own shadow’s bowling average), then things are going to get worse before they get better.

Moores insisted he was still keen on the job, and Paul Downton – the man who once called him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ – later declared ‘I’ve got every faith in Peter Moores’, as if the chairmanship of a football club was the job that got away.

But will the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves and chief executive Tom Harrison share Downton’s faith – or even have any faith in Downton himself?

The case for Moores’s defence revolves around the fact that England have been mainly hopeless at one-day cricket since the 1992 World Cup. And one-day cricket is all England have been playing since they won three Tests in a row against India in July and August.

His advocates also argue that he inherited a shambles born of an Ashes whitewash, just as he did when he first got the job in 2007. Unlike Andy Flower, he did not have Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen or Graeme Swann at his disposal. It was, his supporters argue, never going to turn around overnight. All this is true.

But Moores is nearly a year into his second stint, and England are going backwards. In all formats they have won 13 games out of 36 (forgive the stat), including two victories against Scotland. Their one notable success – a 3-1 Test win – lost much of its lustre because of India’s hopelessness.

Moores is a genuine and decent man, as ego-free as any coach on the international circuit. It is not his fault that county teams only recently reintroduced the 50-over format. He didn’t write the ECB’s strategic plan, which cited winning this World Cup as one of its ‘key measures’. And we hope he has been tearing his hair out at the failure of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to impose themselves on this competition.

But Ashley Giles’s coaching ambitions paid the price for a single result – the World Twenty20 defeat by Holland. For Moores, the results are beginning to look as wasteful as an EU butter mountain.

And there are some crucial areas in which he must surely be accountable. Moores was one of the selectors who last summer backed Alastair Cook as one-day captain, robbing Eoin Morgan of the chance to acquaint himself with the job during the home series against India and the trip to Sri Lanka.

That stubbornness meant Morgan was learning on the job. Is it any surprise that his batting has disintegrated?

Then there was the tinkering for England’s tournament opener against Australia. What possessed Moores and Co to demote James Taylor from No 3, and replace him with Gary Ballance, who had just returned from injury, rather than with Alex Hales, a proven match-winner in limited-overs internationals?

Moores is due to rouse the likes of Stuart Broad for The Ashes in the summer - but will he still be in a job?

And what of the tendency to err on the side of caution? Against Bangladesh, five of the top seven were out caught in the slip cordon, as if they were playing Test cricket. If these things are not Moores’s department, what are?

Graves must now decide whether England can risk giving the Downton/Moores ticket a crack at the Ashes – victory in which, by the way, also forms part of the ECB’s strategic plan.

Waiting in the wings is Jason Gillespie, a figure Graves admires from their time together at Yorkshire, where Gillespie also worked with Paul Farbrace, Moores’s No 2.

Graves may be unimpressed with England’s out-of-date tactics in Australia, and equally concerned to hear Downton tell Sky Sports: ‘What has struck me has been how much influence T20 is having on one-day cricket, and a lot of our players don't play much T20 cricket, so that is clearly something we have to look at.’

Well, who’d have thought it!

The sadness is that no non-England fans will lament their absence from the World Cup quarter-finals. They played dull, fearful cricket, stuck between a rock and a time warp. Even factoring in the global schadenfreude that usually accompanies an England defeat, they have re-entered the realms of laughing stock.

If Colin Graves is happy with that, then God help English cricket. Watch this space. 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS 

KP on the money

Kevin Pietersen’s views may not be welcome at High Command, but he had a pertinent point to make after England’s 15-run defeat by Bangladesh. ‘DO NOT SAY WE HAVENT PRIORITISED ODI CRICKET!’ he tweet-screamed. ‘We played a back to back Ashes to make sure England played 6 months of ODI's before this WC!’

And he’s right. Far from helping England in either event, the rejigged schedule has, in successive winters, produced the joint-worst Ashes defeat in history and their most miserable exit yet from a World Cup. A home loss to Australia this summer and the ECB will have presided over quite the hat-trick.

Respectfully yours, the BCCI

Speaking of laughing stocks, the BCCI press release that followed Virat Kohli’s invective-laden outburst against an Indian journalist (the wrong one, as it turned out) was a classic of its genre. Having already issued a peremptory – and entirely wrong – statement, in which it was claimed Kohli hadn’t sworn and had apologised to the journalist in person, the Indian board then issued another.

The takeaway line was this: ‘The BCCI respects the role played by the media in covering and popularising the game of cricket, and acknowledges the support of the media, in its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in India.’

So respectful are the BCCI of the media that press releases on tour routinely read: ‘Monday: no media activity. Tuesday: no media activity. Wednesday: no media activity.’ Thank goodness for the respect…

Reporters, not supporters

Then again, perhaps it’s just a misunderstanding. As the Indian board sought to manage the damage, they wheeled out Ravichandran Ashwin, the thoughtful off-spinner.

‘Media here are here to support us,’ he said. ‘It’s very heartening to see the media turn up in huge numbers and try to support us.’ It’s not known whether Ashwin handed out pom-poms and tutu skirts to the assembled hacks, but then he clearly thought he didn’t need to.
