Guilty: Charles Napier admitted 28 indecent assault charges and one indecency offence on a child

The half-brother of a senior Conservative MP pleaded guilty today to a string of historical sex offences on young boys.

Charles Napier, 67, who is related to Maldon MP John Whittingdale, admitted 28 indecent assault charges and one indecency offence on a child at London's Southwark Crown Court.

Napier, of Newland in Sherborne, Dorset, admitted abusing 21 boys under the age of 16 between September 1967 and April 1972.

Wearing glasses and dressed in a checked shirt with a tweed blazer, Napier said ‘guilty’ as the court clerk read each of the charges to him.

The court heard he faces a further two separate indecent assault charges involving two other boys, for which he has yet to enter pleas.

Napier was remanded in custody as Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith adjourned sentencing to December 23.

The judge said: ‘It will enable those victims who wish to be here to be alerted and they can be here.’

Mr Whittingdale's office said he would not comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

One charge involved a boy who was indecently assaulted on eight occasions by Napier between September 1969 and April 1972.

The indecency offence involved a child who was forced to commit a sex act on Napier, the court heard.

Napier was arrested last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of a wider investigation launched following claims by MP Tom Watson.

In 2012 Mr Watson used parliamentary privilege to claim that a file of evidence used to convict Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang.

He wrote to Scotland Yard, who launched criminal investigation Operation Fairbank, which has since spawned two more inquiries - Fernbridge, which is looking at claims linked to the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London, in the 1980s, and Cayacos.

When his half-brother was charged, Mr Whittingdale said: ‘I am aware that my half-brother has been charged with an offence alleged to have occurred over 35 years ago.

‘I have no knowledge of this, particularly as I had only just left school at that time. However, obviously I recognise that this is a serious matter and that the law must take its course.’
