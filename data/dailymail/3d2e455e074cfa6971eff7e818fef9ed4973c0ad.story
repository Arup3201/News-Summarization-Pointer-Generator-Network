Caitlin Gaylard, 12, has received compensation after a botched operation as a child left her unable to smile

A 12-year-old girl left unable to smile after surgeons severed a nerve during a botched operation been awarded compensation.

Caitlin Gaylard developed a non-cancerous tumour on the right size of her neck shortly after her birth in 2002.

The haemangioma rapidly grew to the size of a fist and she had to have an operation to remove the growth.

But surgeons at University Hospital Wales, in Cardiff, severed the nerves in one side of her face during the operation, causing severe paralysis on the right side of her face.

This left Caitlin, who lived in Magor, South Wales, without the ability to smile and despite attempts to correct the problem, the nerve couldn’t be repaired.

Her parents Kim, 38, and Ian, 40, instructed lawyers at Irwin Mitchell who secured a full admission of responsibility from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.

Yesterday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London the judge, Master Roberts, approved a settlement from the health board to fund Caitlin’s on-going treatment.

The family, who now live in Houston, Texas, were initially seeking £100,000, although the final figure is undisclosed.

Mr and Mrs Gaylard were initially told by doctors that Caitlin’s facial palsy would be temporary.

But over time it became clear the nerve had been completely severed rather than damaged.

They were told that the facial palsy could be corrected, but they would have to wait until Caitlin was older for the surgery.

Shortly after her birth, Caitlin developed a large non-cancerous tumour on her neck. It was during surgery to remove it that a nerve in her face was severed

When she was four-and-a-half she had a nerve removed from her calf which was grafted onto the good nerve in her face. 

The second stage of the procedure was performed in 2009 but the surgery did not work.

At a hearing last year, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board admitted full responsibility for failing to safeguard the seventh cranial nerve - the nerve which controls facial expression - before removal of the growth.

They admitted severing the nerve during Caitlin’s operation and failing to carry out appropriate surgical treatment during the procedure to attempt to repair it.

The hospital also failed to attempt 
to repair the smiling nerve within reasonable time of discovering 
Caitlin had developed facial palsy.

Caitlin has had surgery to try and repair the damage but it was unsuccessful

Caitlin now has multiple scars on her face and body and has suffered bullying as a result of the facial palsy.

The brave little girl has decided she will undergo another procedure to try and rectify the damage from her first operation and is hoping to have the operation next summer.

Mrs Gaylard, a full-time mother, said: ‘I am in complete awe of my daughter and how much she has overcome in her short life.

‘She has really struggled through the years to come to terms with her facial palsy.

‘Facial palsy can be extremely isolating and while friends empathise, they can never truly understand the depth of emotion or effect it has on your life.

‘I think of the importance people place 
on a smile, about her graduation photo, her wedding photo and all the 
first impressions she will have to face in her future and my heart 
breaks over and over.

Caitlin is now considering having further surgery in a bid to enable her to smile

‘As a family we have felt like we have been on a rollercoaster, so many ups and downs, but we are stronger because of it.

‘Caitlin is the bravest, kindest person I know and hopefully the next operation will work, but if it doesn’t I know she’ll pick herself up again and I’ll be right beside her every step of the way.’

There are around 100,000 in the UK who suffer from facial palsy with at least 30 different causes, according to the charity Facial Palsy UK.

Julie Lewis, a partner and medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell, represented Caitlin’s family.

She said: ‘We are pleased for Caitlin and her family that we have secured an admission of responsibility from the Health Board.

University Hospital of Wales has accepted responsibility for the damage to Caitlin's facial nerves

‘From such a young age, Caitlin has suffered a series of painful procedures and has bravely coped with facial disfigurement which the Board admits, could have been avoided.

‘Not only has Caitlin suffered from physical ailments, she has also endured many years of bullying at school due to her facial palsy which has been heart-breaking for her parents to see their daughter suffer at school amongst her peers.

‘The settlement will cover the cost of future medical treatment, future loss of earnings and the pain and suffering caused to Caitlin and we hope the Board will also offer the family an official apology given the severity of the impact the errors have had.’

A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'The health board is very sorry for what has happened and we would like to offer our sincere apologies to Caitlin and her family.

'The board accepted liability in this case shortly after receiving the claim and we are pleased that the legal process is now complete.

'We appreciate this settlement will never undo the harm caused but we hope it helps Caitlin and her family in some small way.'
