The classmates of a six-year old boy who died after contracting meningitis could be on track for a Christmas number one in his name.

Caden Beggan, from Cleland, Scotland, died last month despite a desperate fight by doctors to save his life from deadly blood poisoning, which saw him undergo several operations and have both legs and his left hand removed.

His brave battle saw him win a legion of well wishers from as far afield as Australia, the USA, Spain, France, New Zealand,
Ireland, Italy, Canada, Germany, Sweden and Hong Kong after his parents shared his condition updates on a special Facebook page dedicated to him.

Worldwide support flooded in for Caden Beggan after his parents shared his battle against meningitis on Facebook. He has since died and his schoolfriend have stormed into the download charts with a single in his honour

Caden's classmates at Ladywell Primary School, Motherwell, have peaked at number nine inthe iTuens charts with their rendition of O Holy Night. They want to raise money for meningitis research in his name

Now school friends of the little boy, described by his family as a 'warrior', have released their rendition of the classic carol Oh Holy Night to benefit the Meningitis Research Fund in his name.

The single by Ladywell Primary School, sold quickly after its release on November 21 and broke into the top twenty downloads on the iTunes chart soon after, peaking at number nine.

The track, which costs 79p, has so far been downloaded almost 10,000 times, raising £3,680 for charity and £409 for the school.

Pat Ashworth, the school’s head teacher, said they had only hoped to sell a few hundred downloads to parents and family and never expected it to go so high into the charts in such a short time.

Mrs Ashworth told the Wishaw Press: 'It’s absolutely incredible and is due to the tremendous public support shown to Caden’s family through Facebook and in the media.'

After recording the song as part of a Christmas CD, the forward thinking year two pupils suggested the track be uploaded onto iTunes. 

Another song recorded by the school children for the CD, If I Were a Butterfly, was one of Caden’s favourites and was played at his funeral.

The choir at Ladywell Primary School have rocketed into the top 10 on the iTunes download chart after releasing the song in tribute to their much missed friend

The majority of the funds raised from sales of Oh Holy Night will go towards researching meningococcal septicaemia, and the remaining 10 per cent will go towards helping school funds.

Caden died at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow on November 20, after a four week struggle against which saw him undergo several operations and have both legs and his left hand removed in a bid to increase his chances of survival.

Messages of support and prayers were sent from people around the world after his parents, David and Angela, set up the Facebook page, to keep friends and family up-to-date on his condition.

It attracted more than 30,000 followers from well-wishers - the majority of them strangers - eager to know how he was getting on.

The sparky little boy was obsessed with pirates and mourners at his funeral heard how he loved to sing and draw pictures, of cowboys, his beloved dinosaurs, and, of course, pirates.
