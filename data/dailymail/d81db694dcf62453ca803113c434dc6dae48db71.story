It's the modern Tinderella story. New York girl, unlucky in love, harnesses the power of technology to find her Prince Charming.

Photographer Kirra Cheers braved the awkward, intriguing and sometimes hilarious world of online dating for her latest photography project titled Tinderella.

In a bid to see if it possible to find a genuine 'match'  with someone you met on the app, Kirra chose to use the most modern form of online dating, Tinder.

The mobile app which shows you other users in your immediate area and users can select and dismiss partners based on physical appearance. For this reason it has earned a reputation as a 'hook up' app.

The 26-year-old, who is originally from Australia went on a total of 17 dates over two months and decided to photograph all of the dates she had in New York.

Kirra is also the co-founder of the Brooklyn Collective, and explains that she drew inspiration while curating.

'I was curating and showing in a group show depicting 'Modern Romance'. I wanted my take on the theme to have more of a personal approach, putting myself into the project and documenting my experience with online dating, more specifically with Tinder.

Kirra said the the purpose  was not necessarily the resulting images but more a documentation of the journey

The project included images of the dates as well as shots of the messages Kira received on her mobile. Alex, 25, took her for drinks at The Wayland in Alphabet City

'The purpose of the project was not necessarily the resulting images but more a documentation of the journey.'

Kirra describes Tinder as like a takeaway for dating. It's quick and easy but somehow leaves you feeling guilty - like you cheated the process.

'Although I would suggest it's not healthy to 'shop' for a partner, I believe Tinder can be used as a platform to find a real connection.'
