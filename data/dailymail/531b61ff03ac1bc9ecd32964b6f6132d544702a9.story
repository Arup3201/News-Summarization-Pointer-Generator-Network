Caroline Wozniacki's family support network can help her shut out any private-life battles to secure her first Wimbledon quarter-final, according to Laura Robson.

Wozniacki has claimed 'I'm not a victim' at Wimbledon, rejecting suggestions her tennis suffered after the public breakdown of her engagement to golfer Rory McIroy.

The Danish 16th seed bombed out of the French Open in the first round as the fallout from her break-up with McIroy hit home, but the 23-year-old has looked far more composed at SW19.

Wozniacki will face Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in Wimbledon's fourth round on Monday, with a quarter-final against sixth seed Petra Kvitova or China's Shuai Peng at stake.

Injured British star Robson said friend Wozniacki has been helped to focus back in on the tennis by father Piotr and brother Patrik, who have been on hand at the All England Club.

'I think she's happy with how things are going when she has her dad and her brother with her,' said Robson, speaking at an HSBC event.

'When she's off the court she's got so many people asking her and reminding her about the rest, but to me she seems very focused right now.'

Wozniacki laughed off the idea of internet dating during Wimbledon's first week, also remaining coy about links with Feliciano Lopez.

Robson, currently recovering from wrist surgery, said aside from press conferences, Wozniacki will be shelving the personal issues to chase grand slam success.

'You have to shut almost everything that you can out when you go into a grand slam tournament, or really any tournament,' she said of Wozniacki, who has never reached Wimbledon's last eight.

'I'm sure that's what Caroline will be doing.

'I think she's definitely separating pretty much everything, so she can be entirely focused purely on her tennis when she's on court.

'All she will be thinking about is working out how to win one point at a time.

'She has a pretty decent draw to start the second week and she'll be happy with that - but she'll know she's got to play her best tennis at the same time.'
