Nicolas Anelka has denied the Football Association charge over his quenelle gesture and requested a personal hearing in a move which could bring a premature end to his career.

The West Bromwich Albion striker has previously insisted that his goal celebration was not anti-Semitic and has requested a hearing into the charge of making a racially aggravated gesture, which carries a minimum five-match ban.

But if Anelka is still found guilty after the appeal, the ban could be doubled.

A club statement issued after 
Thursday's 6pm deadline read: 'West Bromwich Albion can confirm that 
Nicolas Anelka has denied an FA charge regarding the gesture he made 
after scoring his first goal against West Ham United on December 28.

'The striker has requested a personal hearing. The club will make no further comment until The FA’s disciplinary process has reached a conclusion.'

As the player has just 16 games in which he can feature for West Brom between now and the end of the season, a 10-match ban could lead to West Brom seeking to cancel his contract for gross misconduct — or pay it up early — as he would be little use to head coach Pepe Mel in the fight to avoid relegation.

At the age of 34 and with just two goals to his name this season, it is highly unlikely he will be offered another deal elsewhere in the Premier League.

Anelka earlier pointed to comments made by a Jewish group in France that the quenelle could not be regarded as anti-Semitic in the context in which it was made. But later the same group clarified its stance, leaving Anelka looking increasingly isolated.

Playing with fire: If Anelka ends up with a 10 game ban then West Brom could choose to terminate his deal

Roger Cukierman, president of the Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said: ‘It (the charge) seems severe to me because this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connotation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or memorial to the Holocaust.

‘When it is made in a place that is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it is a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment.’

Anelka has highlighted Cukierman’s words on Facebook, saying: ‘I therefore ask the English FA to kindly remove the charge made against me. And I repeat: I am not anti-Semitic or racist.’

Cukierman was then asked to confirm his stance in a later interview but said the gesture was initially conceived as anti-Semitic and that the player’s sympathy for it was ‘clearly suspect’.

French comedian Dieudonne M’Bala M’Bala, who originated the quenelle gesture, has been questioned by police after bailiffs alleged they were fired on with rubber bullets at his house west of Paris.

Distanced: West Brom sponsors Zoopla have decided not to extend their deal at the end of the season

Meanwhile, two more of West Brom’s commercial partners may follow the example of sponsors Zoopla - a property website and part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline - who officially ended their two-year deal. German clothing company Jack Wolfskin and Holler Watches are both monitoring the situation.

A statement issued by Jack Wolfskin read: ‘We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or certain group of people.

‘We are now awaiting the judgement of the Football Association before taking further steps. Depending on what West Brom say... we would consider ending our sponsorship as one option.’

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

Defiant: A group performs the 'quenelle' salutes in front of a theatre where Dieudonne is performing

When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:

'Quenelle' means 'scoop' or 'dumpling' and is performed by holding one arm straight by one's side while touching that arm's shoulder with the opposite hand.

It has been described by its critics as a 'Nazi salute in reverse' and, thusly, as an expression of anti-Semitism.

Forty-seven-year-old M'Bala M'Bala, who goes by the stage name of Dieudonne, has turned the 'quenelle' into something of a viral trend since first performing it four years ago.

Once a committed anti-racism campaigner, Dieudonne has since been linked to the political far right in France.

French interior minister Manuel Valls is considering banning all public performances by the comedian. In the wake of Anelka's public use of the gesture, which the player stated was simply a 'special dedication' to his good friend Dieudonne, French minister for sport Valerie Fourneyron described his actions as 'shocking' and 'disgusting'.

Anelka has previously been photographed performing the gesture alongside Dieudonne but Saturday's events brought the debate to England while provoking further outrage and debate in France, where the match was televised.

Dieudonne, who has past convictions for making anti-Semitic remarks, insists the 'quenelle' is merely 'an anti-establishment gesture' but his critics are concerned about its motivation.

When Dieudonne insulted Jewish radio presenter Patrick Cohen this week, French interior minister Manuel Valls vowed to use any legal means necessary to ban any future public appearances by the comedian. Valls told newspaper Le Parisien: 'Dieudonne has been repeatedly condemned for defamation, insult and incitement to racial hatred. He is a repeat offender and I intend to act with the greatest firmness, under the law.'

The English Football Association is considering opening an investigation into the possible connotations of the salute. FIFA rules state: '1. a) Anyone who offends the dignity of a person or group of persons through contemptuous, discriminatory or denigratory words or actions concerning race, colour, language, religion or origin shall be suspended for at least five matches. Furthermore, a stadium ban and a fine of at least CHF 20,000 shall be imposed. If the perpetrator is an official, the fine shall be at least CHF 30,000.'
