As the most popular search engine in the world, Google has its fair share of web competitors eager to find a flaw in the company's online make-up. 

So the need for a whiz-hacker, trained in batting off threats from billions of criminals, has never been so big. 

The woman in charge of such tasks is 31-year-old Parisa Tabriz - head of security at Google Chrome.

Tabriz gave herself the title of 'Security Princess' while on a conference in Tokyo

As one of the few women in such coveted roles within the company, the Iranian-American has aptly chosen the title Security Princess.

'I thought Information Security Engineer sounded so boring. Guys in the industry all take it so seriously, so security princess felt suitably whimsical,' she told the Telegraph. 

Born to an Iranian father and Polish mother, Ms Tabriz grew up in Chicago with her two younger brothers. 

Surprisingly, she didn't own her first computer until her first at the University of Illinois where she studied computer engineering. 

When she's not at work, Tabriz enjoys making gelato, blowing glass and amateur photography

Not just a big brain: Tabriz also enjoys rock climbing near Google's campus in Mountain View, California

After graduating in 2007, Ms Tabriz started working at Google straight away and in 2012 was listed in Forbes Magazine's 30 people under 30 to watch in the technology industry. 

Among her daily tasks at Google is giving seminars to less experienced 'white hat hackers', working to protect the search engine. 

In her first class, she asks students how they would hack into a vending machine for chocolate without using technology. 

And while hacking may seem like a dark-art carried out by society's trolls, Miss Tabriz insists there is a more moralistic side to her role. 

Speaking of the person responsible for stealing and leaking nude celebrity photographs, she said: 'What he did was not only a violation of these women but it was criminal, and as a hacker I was very saddened by it.

'I feel like we, the hackers, need better PR to show we're not all like that.' 

Google offers cash rewards of up to $30,000 for tips about bugs on Chrome. To date, the company has paid up $1.25 million to fix more than 700 issues with the web.
