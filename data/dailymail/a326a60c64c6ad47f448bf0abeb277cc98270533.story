Photographs allegedly show Bali Nine drug trafficker Scott Rush using drugs in prison, following his recent claims he is clean.

The pictures allegedly show Rush holding and inhaling from drug paraphernalia and were taken in January, the Herald Sun reported.

An unnamed source told the newspaper the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties.

'He has been telling people he has been clean of drugs for ages and that just isn't true,' they said.

In June, Rush proposed to his successful London banker girlfriend who said she would only marry him if he turns his life around and is not doing any drugs.

During a prison visit Rush dropped to one knee and asked 38-year-old mother-of-two Nikki Butler to marry him, more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of heroin strapped to his body.  

Ms Butler had lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration, but reunited with him in April after she recognised an image of him on British TV which referenced the Bali Nine.

Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east.

'Rush was moved in February this year because he was getting beaten up and getting some serious threats over a drug debt of about $5000,' the source told the Herald Sun.

Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs.

At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after his  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body.

After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011. The couple hope that sentence will be reduced to between 15 and 20 years.
