Mitt Romney today stands on the brink of becoming the Republican candidate to challenge Barack Obama for the presidency of the U.S.

But it could have been so different for the former Mormon missionary when he was almost killed in a car accident in Bernos-Beaulac, France, in 1968.

The 21-year-old was driving from Pau to Bordeaux when he was hit by a car driven by a Catholic priest, which killed one of his own passengers.

‘We were all talking about how dangerous how the highways were and the French highways,’ Mr Romney said, reported the Boston Globe in 2007.

‘Literally as we were having that conversation, boom, we were hit. It happened so quickly (that) there was no braking and no honking.’

Mr Romney drove Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson and others to Pau, where a small Mormon congregation was in dispute.

There were six people in total going back to Bordeaux when the car was hit and Mr Anderson's wife Leola was killed, reported the Boston Globe.

Mr Romney, who has always insisted he was not at fault, was seriously injured and even feared dead for a moment after the crash.

A policeman who first responded wrote ‘Il est mort’, or ‘he is dead’, in Mr Romney’s passport. But at hospital he came out of a coma.

He was left with a swollen face and fractured arm. Mr Anderson, who died in 1995, suffered injuries to his chest, ribs, lung, liver and spleen.

The incident happened on a curving two-lane road on which Mr Romney passed another accident just before his crash, reported the Boston Globe.

Witnesses did claim Catholic priest Albert Marie, 46, of Sireuil, France, was drunk when the crash happened but this was never verified.

Mr Marie was driving with his mother Marie-Antoinette Marie and a woman named Marguerite Longué, 48, reported the Boston Globe.

Mr Anderson never sued after the accident as he was worried about a religious run-in with the French government or the Catholic Church.

Local police don’t have any records of the accident because their documents are destroyed after ten years, reported the Boston Globe.

The other passengers in Mr Romney’s car were French Mormon couple Suzanne and Bertin Farel and staffer David Wood, 21, of Salt Lake City.

Mr Romney, Mrs Farel and Mr Wood, who now teaches in Natchitoches, Louisiana, are the only three people still alive from his vehicle.

‘I was frightened of driving a car (and) had a sense of vulnerability that I had not experienced before,’ Mr Romney said, reported the Boston Globe.
