A beloved counselor was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend as she moved out of their home - before he turned the gun on himself, according to reports.

Monica Van Laer, 33, and some of her family members were collecting her belongings from the apartment in Raleigh Hills, Oregon on Sunday when her ex pulled out a gun and shot her, her devastated sister told a neighbor, who spoke to The Oregonian.

'He shot my sister!' the woman screamed as she ran outside, the neighbor said.

The ex-boyfriend, who has not been identified, shot himself below the chin but survived. He is recovering in hospital.

Authorities have not confirmed the version of events, but they have said the death is being classed as a homicide and that they are not looking for any suspects.

Loss: Monica Van Laer, 33, was killed inside her Portland-area home on Sunday afternoon. Friends and neighbors say she was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend, who then shot himself, but survived

The neighbor, Mike Peerman, told the Oregonian that the woman had arrived at the Broadmoor Apartments in the Southwest Portland with her sister, her sister's fiance and her parents on Sunday.

The shooting occurred just 10 minutes later, he said, although he did not know how many shots were fired.

Officers were called to the apartment around 2pm and found a chaotic scene of several people in and around the apartment, KOIN reported.  

The woman was found dead inside and the man was taken to a nearby hospital. No arrests have been made and authorities have not named the man who was injured.

Van Laer's close friend Matt Chorpenning told the Oregonian that she had met her boyfriend while working in California and then he moved back to Oregon with her.

Peerman said that the couple had moved in over the summer but that he never heard them arguing.

Irreplaceable: Friends called Van Laer, left and right, 'a self-proclaimed geek' with a great sense of humor

In September, Van Laer told Chorpenning that she had just broken up with the man and had moved in with one of her sisters.

He dedicated a blog post to his friend and appeared to confirm the neighbor's version of events. 

'My friend was murdered by someone who has set foot in my home,' he wrote.

'My heart is completely broken... She was a truly beautiful person who made life seem more beautiful.' 

Hundreds of friends paid tribute to Van Laer on Facebook, while others raised thousands of dollars on gofundme to donate to her high school music and theater programs in her memory.

An obituary pays tribute to a talented, enthusiastic young woman, a 'self-proclaimed nerd' with a 'one-of-a-kind sense of humor' who 'loved to bring others joy through laughter'.

It explains that after high school - where she was a prominent member of the school band and theater productions - she studied technical theater at Chapman University in California.

She worked on rigging plays before joining Starbucks for 10 years, eventually becoming a store manager.

Investigation: Police, pictured swarming the scene, have released little information about the case

'Monica was someone who loved being near and being of service to her fellow human beings,' the obituary said. 'Monica truly had a special ability to connect with and engage with people in a positive way.'

A former customer, Jim McCormack, in La Mirada, explained to the Oregonian: 'She took over a store that had a miserable atmosphere and turned it into a joyful place to visit.'

In 2013, she started working as a family service and cemetery counselor, first in California and - after the role reminded her of the importance of family - she moved back to in Oregon.

There, she worked at Skyline Memorial Gardens & Funeral Home in Portland as a family service counselor.  

'She made everyone around her happier,' Chorpenning said. 'She just made us laugh and inspired us.'
