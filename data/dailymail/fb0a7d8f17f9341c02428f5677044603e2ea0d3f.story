Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore has defended the proposed $3.5m sculpture which has been described as everything from dental floss to a space noodle, saying the 'Cloud Arch' will be an iconic tourist attraction.

'Tim Williams from the Committee for Sydney ... said people will want to make love under it,' Ms Moore Triple M's Grill team.

'When we’ve had the millionth visitor we’ll stop having this conversation.  But I think he [Tim Williams] was making the point that this will put Sydney on the map, another reason for putting Sydney on the map as well as our Harbour Bridge and our Opera House and people will want to come,' she said.

'People will come to see it. People will want to see it and want to be photographed under it. This will put Sydney on the map ... as well as the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.'

In the face of widespread ridicule of her proposed $9m sculptures, Clover Moore (pictured, launching the proposal) told Radio MMM people from around the world would flock to Sydney to be photographed under the Cloud Arch which would define the Sydney CBD. MMM's Gus Worland told Ms Moore it was the equivalent of him designing a giant garbage bin for Hyde Park and expecting to be paid millions.

Sydney is set to get a new Cloud Arch sculpture, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, which will be erected on George Street near Town Hall

Ms Moore said the sculpture would unify the Sydney CBD's main road, George street, and underscore the city's 'wonderful relationship with the blue sky and the Opera House'.

Triple M's Matty Johns and Gus Worland asked Ms Moore whether the City of Sydney's $9 million sculpture proposals, which include not only the Cloud Arch, but 60 bronze birds and a giant blue milk crate in a park,  was the equivalent of them designing a large garbage bin for Hyde Park and demanding it be paid out of taxpayers' money.

'There are economic arguments about art,' Ms Moore said, 'I hope people will respond and this this is a great thing to do to celebrate Sydney.

'What we did wasn't just a matter of Clover Moore saying these are great works. We got some really eminent people from the art world and they decided. [We got] 700 responses from 28 different countries.'

Ms Moore said the council's expert art committed had culled the 700 entries down to ten and then selected the milk crate, cloud arch and the birds from those.

The release of images of the three finalists has sparked a storm of mockery on social media from people who compared the Cloud Arch to dental floss, a rubber band and Mr Burns from The Simpsons.

The City of Sydney plans to install the 50-metre sculpture above George Street, in front of its council chambers in Sydney's Town Hall.

The council will spend $9.3 million on the Cloud Arch, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, and the giant fibreglass milk crate, to be installed near Central Station, as well as a set of 60 bronze bird sculptures which will be perched around the Kent Street underpass.

A $2.5m pavilion by Hany Armanious, that has already been dubbed the Milk Crate, will stand in Belmore Park near Central Railway Station

Controversial British artist Tracey Emin has been given the nod to create a $2.1m corridor of bird installations in the area near Wynyard

Twitter users dubbed the Cloud Arch the #spacenoodle and compared the curvy steel sculpture to Jessica Rabbit, dental floss and a rubber band.

Others noticed out a likeness to Mr Burns as an alien in the Simpsons, and a giant car yard balloon.

But some people on social media were quick to point out that other Australian capital cities have been given much stranger public artworks in the past, such as Canberra's Skywhale or Adelaide's pig and giant ball sculptures. 

The Cloud Arch sculpture will be built with steel plates to rise diagonally across from the Queen Victoria Building to the Woolworths building.

In his artist's statement, Mr Ishigami said the Cloud Arch would evoke 'comfort, openness and freedom' and embodied the characteristics of 'Green, Global and Connected', which is Clover Moore's slogan for what she wants to make Sydney.
