Bristol Rovers midfielder Lee Mansell has revealed he decided to give JJ O'Donnell a kiss to 'avoid doing something silly' during his side's win against Gateshead.

Mansell and O'Donnell were involved in a brief confrontation during Friday's Football Conference encounter at The Memorial Stadium.

However to avoid losing his rag, Mansell decided to plant a kiss on the face of his opponent.

The 32-year-old received a yellow card for the part he played in the incident and received some stick from his wife and his team-mates.

Mansell, speaking to the BBC, said: 'We either clash heads and he goes down or I end up doing something silly.

'I did it to defuse the situation. It's the first time I've been booked for kissing someone.

'I got in the car to go home and saw Twitter had lit up and my missus said: "What the hell were you thinking?"

'But we had a laugh and a joke about it with the lads afterwards. It's another thing to add to the list of daft things I've done on the football pitch.'
