A third grade teacher couldn't hold back the tears as she laid in her hospital bed, recounting how she tried to calm her nervous students while holding them down with her arms when the devastating tornado headed straight for their school.

Jennifer Doan was holding two of her students down with her arms when the storm hit Plaza Elementary School, and now she is being treated for sternum and spine fractures.

'We told them to get down, there weren't any lights on and already and they were all scared,' she told CBS News from her hospital bed.

Reliving the moment: Teacher Jennifer Doan tried to protect her third grade students using her arms

Rescue: Jennifer was finally found alongside her unharmed students by rescuers, but she still can't remember how long they were hidden in the rubble

Her eyes welled up with tears as she told how she put her 'arm over the ones next to me and I looked up at the door and I put my head down and it just hit'.

'I was telling them to keep calm and that they would come. He just kept telling me that he couldn't breathe and he didn't want to die,' she said of the student who was laying next to her in the rubble.

Ms Doan is not the only teacher telling her story in the aftermath of one of the most devastating tornadoes in the country's history. Seven children from the school are confirmed dead after the drowned when the water mains broke.

 said: 'One of my little boys just kept saying, "I love you, I love you,
 please don't die with me, please don't die with me." And when it

Damien told Today: 'We were in class... we went in the bathroom, then they [sirens] went off again.

Then we heard the tornado, it sounded like a train coming by.
