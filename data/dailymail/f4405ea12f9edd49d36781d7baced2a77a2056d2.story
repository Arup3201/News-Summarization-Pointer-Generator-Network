The family of a biker hit by a Range Rover that was trying to escape a swarm of motorcyclists in New York City on Sunday claim he may never walk again as another rider has turned himself in following the violent altercation.

The injured biker, Jeremiah Mieses, 26, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, was among a group of motorcyclists knocked down by Alexian Lien, who was trying to protect his family after he was pursued by the group.

A
Facebook group set up to support Mieses, a father, and his family 
claims that he is paralyzed from the waist down and in a coma - despite police claiming no one apart from Lien had been hurt in the incident. They say 
he also suffered broken ribs and crushed lungs.

'My son is out of surgery thank God,' Mieses' father, the Rev. Edwin Mieses, wrote on his own Facebook page. 'Now comes dealing with him not able to walk again.'

Meanwhile, police sources confirmed to MailOnline on Tuesday afternoon that another motorcyclist has turned himself in.

The biker, Allen Edwards, 42, of Queens surrendered after police released a photo of him. He was being questioned Tuesday night but hasn't yet been charged.

Sources told the New York Daily News said Edwards was the biker shown in an online video pounding on the rear window of Lien's Range Rover while another enraged motorcyclist bashed in the driver's-side window using his helmet.

Police were still searching for other motorcyclists who dragged Lien out of the Range Rover and beat and slashed him.

The chase came after a biker, 
Christopher Cruz, was allegedly driving erratically, causing him to be 
hit by 33-year-old Lien, who was driving his Range Rover with his wife 
and child inside.

When
other bikers pursued and cornered him, he plowed through them -
breaking the legs of two of the riders. But they eventually caught up 
with him, smashed the window of his car, pulled him from the vehicle and
punched him and sliced him with a knife.

Police
said they believe he panicked as he feared for the safety of his wife, 
Rosalyn Ng, and their two-year-old child, who were both inside the 
vehicle during the daylight chase.

On Tuesday, Cruz, 28, from Passaic, New 
Jersey, was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and 
endangering the welfare of a child.

Fears: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him

Sources told the New York Post that Cruz's driving had sparked the hour-long chase as he was driving erratically, causing Lien to rear-end him.

They also said the group of riders was at first trying to slow Lien down so they could get in front of him and take over the West Side Highway.

Cruz, who is not believed to be among the swarm of bikers who followed the terrified father, was briefly hospitalized and released for minor injuries, including lower back pain, authorities said.

Lien, a Columbia University graduate, was taken to Columbia University Medical Center, where he received stitches. He was later released.

Police
said Lien is not expected to be charged, but the investigation is 
continuing and they are seeking information about the other bikers 
involved.

Lien, who has a 
luxury apartment near The New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan, 
received a 1.30pm bouquet of yellow calla lillies from his colleagues at
Credit Suisse.

The 
Manhattan-based florist, Park Avenue Floratique, confirmed to MailOnline the arrangement was sent
was sent by colleagues from financial firm to the 'gentleman who is 
sick' and said: 'They were beautiful. People are commenting about them.'

Hurt: Mieses, who also uses the rap name Jay Meezee, is the real victim in the incident, his family have claimed

The
footage of the run-in was captured on a helmet camera of a motorcyclist during an 
annual bikers' event in New York City, at around 2pm on Sunday.

A police spokesman said that Lien recalled how a large number of 
motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' and he 'accidentally collided 
with one'.

The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.

He
pulled over but some of the bikers started to damage the vehicle, he said. The 
NYPD spokesman told MailOnline the driver drove off 'to avoid an 
impending assault'.

The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.

The footage shows them following the vehicle for several minutes, at times getting close and intimidating the driver. Eventually the bikers surround the vehicle, blocking its path.

Fearful: The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans - Christopher Cruz - braked

Intimidating: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with the family inside

Seizing
an opportunity to confront the driver, one biker dismounts and tries to
open the door, but the SUV speeds off again, knocking down at least one
more motorcyclist.

The
family are eventually brought to a standstill in Manhattan traffic and 
immediately bikers run to attack the vehicle, smashing the driver's 
window with a helmet and attempting to smash the rear door window, where the child was sitting. The footage then stops.

The
video was posted by a biker, under the name GIXXARDR on Liveleaks, from
Melbourne, Australia, this morning. He claims one biker was killed, 
which the police said was not true.

Already it has received numerous comments, most are in support of Lien.

One
person, whose profile name is Sgt Pepper, says:Â  'I would do exactly 
the same thing. They're intimidating him and he's probably fearing for 
his life.'

Altercation: Apparently intimidated, the driver then accelerates away knocking down bikers in its path

Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet

Another, known as 'zacarra' says the driver acted in 'self defense'.

'Did
you see the biker break (sic) check him in the beginning. This poor guy
was running for his life from the start,' zacarra writes.

'charlesferg' says the NYC has now banned the riders' annual event.
