A 4,000-year-old burial chamber containing human remains, chariots and an armchair, has been unearthed by archaeologists in Georgia.

The Early Bronze Age discovery provides evidence of the rich burials traditions of the nomadic people from the Eurasian steppes.

During this time, the nomads were thought to be interacting with the region’s farming communities near the south Caucasus, leading to some individuals being given special status and elaborate burials.

The burial chamber was found within a 12 metre (39-foot) high mound called a kurgan near the municipality of Lagodekhi in the south of the country.

Within the chamber were a variety of treasures, including two chariots, ornamented clay and wooden pots, flint arrowheads, carnelian and amber beads, an armchair and 23 golden artefacts.

Remains of seven ancient humans – three within the chariot - were scattered, and researchers believe they may have been disturbed by a robbery.

Among the treasures was this necklace which signals the wealth and status of those buried alongside it

From around 3400 BC to 2000 BC, cattle and sheep raising led to economic stability in early Georgia.

The local chieftains appear to have been men of wealth and immense power. Their burial mounds, such as the latest discovery, have yielded finely wrought vessels in gold and silver.

A number of these are engraved with ritual scenes suggesting Middle Eastern cult influence.  

At the end of the 3rd millennium BC, there is evidence of considerable economic development and increased commerce among the tribes. 

In western Georgia, the unique Colchian culture developed between 1800 and 700 BC.

In eastern Georgia the Kurgan culture of Trialeti reached its zenith around 1500 BC.

‘The burial was robbed twice but as it became obvious the robbery took place after the falling the roofing down that partially saved the grave goods,’ said Zurab Makharadze, head of the Centre of Archaeology at the Georgian National Museum.

One of the skeletons belonged to that of a chief and others should be the members of his family, sacrificed slaves or servants, according to a report in LiveScience.

The burial dates back to a time before domesticated horses appeared in the area, however researchers believe the chariots would have been pulled by oxen.

The wooden armchair symbolises the power that individuals like the chief, according to Mr Makharadze.

‘The process of restoration of the artefacts obtained from the kurgan is in progress at the moment,’ he added.

‘During this process a row of interesting information is revealed like the fact that the bones of the dead people were kept in honey that is an indication to balsaming.’

Mr Makharadze is hopeful that further investigation will reveal a great deal more about Early Bronze Age people in this area.
