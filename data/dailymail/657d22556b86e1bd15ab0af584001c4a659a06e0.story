Imagine the scenario: you’re at work, when your smartphone tells you some of the vegetables in your fridge at home have gone off, letting you know to pick more up on the way home.

That’s one of the potential uses of a new technology developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Using a simple sensor that can be read by a smartphone, they have devised a way to wirelessly detect hazardous gases and pollutants.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have developed a method to detect hazardous gases and pollutants. They modified NFC chips (shown) to make them detect things in their environment, and the information could then be sent to your phone

The sensors are made using modified near-field communication (NFC) tags.

These tags, which receive the little power they need from the device reading them, function as wirelessly addressable barcodes.

Among their many uses they can be used to make wireless payments with an NFC-enabled smartphone.

NFC tags can be read by any smartphone that has near-field communication capability.

These phones can send out short pulses of magnetic fields at radio frequency (13.56 megahertz), inducing an electric current in the circuit on the tag, which relays information to the phone.

To adapt these tags for their own purposes, the MIT team first disrupted the electronic circuit by punching a hole in it. 

Then, they reconnected the circuit with a linker made of carbon nanotubes that are specialised to detect a particular gas.

The team refers to the modified tags as Cards (chemically actuated resonant devices).

When carbon nanotubes bind to the target gas, their ability to conduct electricity changes, which shifts the radio frequencies at which power can be transferred to the device.

When a smartphone pings the Card, it responds only if it can receive sufficient power at the smartphone-transmitted radio frequencies, allowing the phone to determine whether the circuit has been altered and the gas is present.

But now the researchers have found that with a small modification, the chips can be used to detect the presence of gases.

To adapt them for their own purposes, the team disrupted the electronic circuit by punching a hole in it.

Then, they reconnected the circuit with a linker made of carbon nanotubes that are specialised to detect a particular gas.

Using this system, the researchers have demonstrated that they can detect gaseous ammonia, hydrogen peroxide and cyclohexanone, among other gases.

For now, the technology must rely on the phone being within five centimetres of the sensor.

But the researchers are working on a Bluetooth technology to expand the range. Senior author of the paper and Professor of Chemistry at MIT Dr Tim Swager told MailOnline this could have a variety of uses.

‘It is ideal for large volume applications wherein consumers can check for example freshness of food for themselves,’ he said.

‘You could have a NFC system in your fridge that reads the sensor and then uploads data to a device that you can read from a distance.

‘Alternatively you could imagine consumers putting up their own sensor networks to monitor, for example air quality in a building.’

In a video detailing the technology it’s also shown how it could be used to detect explosives in packages.

The demonstration shows the direct detection of peroxide explosives while cyclohexanone, a vapour that is typically given off from plastic explosives, can also be detected.

Dr Swager added in a separate news release from MIT: ‘The beauty of these sensors is that they are really cheap. You put them up, they sit there, and then you come around and read them. There's no wiring involved. There's no power.

‘You can get quite imaginative as to what you might want to do with a technology like this.’

The researchers have filed for a patent on the sensing technology and are now looking into possible applications.

Because these devices are so inexpensive and can be read by smartphones, they could be deployed nearly anywhere: indoors to detect explosives and other harmful gases, or outdoors to monitor environmental pollutants.

Once an individual phone gathers data, the information could be uploaded to wireless networks and combined with sensor data from other phones, allowing coverage of very large areas.

The research was published in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
