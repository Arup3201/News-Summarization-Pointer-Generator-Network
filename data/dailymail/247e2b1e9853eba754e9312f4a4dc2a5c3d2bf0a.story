'Eye-watering salary': Lloyds chief spin doctor Matt Young

The chief spin doctor for bailed- out Lloyds Bank enjoys a pay package worth up to £1.3million, it was revealed yesterday.

Details of the extraordinary awards paid to the state-backed lender’s corporate affairs director Matt Young emerged in a leaked memo.

The full package – paid if he hits certain targets – is almost ten times the £142,000 salary paid to David Cameron.

The revelation is sure to embarrass Lloyds’ Portuguese boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, who counts Mr Young as one of his closest lieutenants.

The two previously worked together when Mr Horta-Osorio ran Spanish-owned bank Santander.

Insiders say Mr Horta-Osorio insisted his former colleague join him when he was poached by Lloyds in 2010.

The bank says Mr Young is not merely a PR man but is a key member of its top  management team who sits on its most senior executive committee.

A leaked document attempts to justify Mr Young’s ‘proposed remuneration’ by  saying ‘Matthew is significantly underpaid for his current role’.

It also claims that he was about to be promoted at Santander when he followed his old boss to Lloyds.

The lavish package includes a £350,000 basic salary, a bonus of as much as £525,000 and a long-term performance-related shares award of £350,000.

On top of this, he receives an £87,500 pension contribution – or a quarter of his basic salary – and a £12,000 car allowance.

Lloyds last night refused to confirm the figures. It does not have to disclose Mr Young’s annual package because he does not sit on the board.

Lloyds, which received a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008, broke into profit in the first three months of this year

But details released to the stockmarket in March reveal Mr Young is set to receive up to £940,000 in bonuses by 2016.

The news sparked a furious reaction from campaigners last night.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Not even a spin doctor on a million pounds could paint the bank bailouts as a good deal for taxpayers.

‘Until Lloyds pays back taxpayers, and our stake is sold off, we’re on the hook for these eye-watering salaries.

‘It isn’t well-funded PR that is going to return Lloyds back to full ownership though, it’s a focus on delivering shareholders value for money.’ Mr Young is said to be one of the few people that really ‘gets’ Mr Horta-Osorio. Both men are fiercely driven, work long hours and are obsessed with detail.

Lloyds' Portuguese boss Antonio Horta-Osorio has refused to bow to pressure to give up his bonus

Mr Horta-Osorio’s tendency to 
micro-manage is said to be one of the reasons why he had to take two 
months’ sick leave at the end of 2011 after a severe bout of insomnia.

Mr Young made himself indispensible to his boss, helping to steer him through the crisis.

But Luke Hildyard from the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a ridiculous amount of money for a PR man – Lloyds should be paying people to achieve value for money for the taxpayers who bailed them out, not fobbing us off with more spin.’

He added: ‘Cashiers, who face daily abuse from members of the public angry at the bankers who crashed the economy, receive  barely 1 per cent of what Matt Young is allegedly rewarded.

‘They would be more fitting recipients of Lloyds’ largesse.’

The bank, which received a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008, broke into profit in the first three months of this year.

But it plunged to a loss of £570million last year and its compensation bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance – which occurred before Mr Horta-Osorio joined – has climbed to £6.8billion.

Unlike the bosses of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, Mr Horta-Osorio has refused to bow to pressure to give up his bonus, receiving a £1.5million  payment for 2012 as part of his £3.4million package, although he will only received that bonus in 2016 and it is linked to the the bank's share price after it returns to private hands.

Last night Lloyds defended Mr Young’s pay. A spokesman said: ‘Matt is part of the new management team brought in to turn around the bank.

‘A significant majority of his pay is in shares, deferred and will only pay out if the transformation of Lloyds is successful over many years.

‘The new management team will only do well if the taxpayer does well.’
