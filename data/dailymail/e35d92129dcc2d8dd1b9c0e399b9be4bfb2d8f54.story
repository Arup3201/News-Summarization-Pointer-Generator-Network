A portrait of controversial Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has been bought by the British National Portrait Gallery, which relies on taxpayers' money to run.

Words taken from IRA terrorist Bobby Sands - who famously died in a hunger strike in protest of his treatment as a criminal by British authorities - are inscribed in the image.

The London gallery, which is partly funded by grants from the government, has confirmed it has purchased the painting by Cumbrian artist Conrad Atkinson who is a Catholic of Irish descent.

Mr Adams has, in the past, insisted he is proud of his association with the IRA terrorist group, but has stopped short of admitting membership of the paramilitary organisation.

His portrait is set to go on display in the gallery, which also has portraits of the likes of Margaret Thatcher.

Mr Atkinson said its purchase was a 'really good and important initiative' by the gallery.

He said: 'I think they are quite brave to do it. There may well be no controversy but there may well be.'

Mr Adams, leader of the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, has been a  key player in the Irish peace process. He has always denied being a member of the IRA.

Sinn
Fein - Irish for 'We Ourselves' - used to be widely regarded as the 
political wing of the IRA but is now considered completely separate. 

The party wants to end British rule in Northern Ireland and make Ireland an independent state.

But
Mr Adams could soon be sharing a wall space with British politicians 
including Lady Thatcher, who was widely disliked by Irish republicans.

Lady
Thatcher was Prime Minister during the 1981 hunger strike in which 
Irish-Catholic militant Bobby Sands starved himself to death after 
refusing food for 66 days.

He was protesting his treatment as a criminal rather than a political prisoner by British authorities.

His death immediately touched off widespread rioting in Belfast, as young Irish-Catholic militants clashed with police and British Army patrols and started fires.

Thatcher was criticised for her 
'uncompromising policies' but it was recently revealed she personally 
sanctioned concessions aimed at ending the hunger strike at the Maze 
Prison, Long Kesh, but the deal was rejected by the IRA.

The death of 10 republican prisoners in 
two IRA hunger strikes marked a turning point both for the IRA and Sinn Fein.

The portrait of Mr Adams, who was an important figure in the peace process from the 1980s, is made with acrylic, watercolour and oil pastel.

It was created when the artist met Mr Adams in 
2007 and 2008 and previously appeared in an exhibition in Belfast’s Grand Opera House.

In 1978 the Ulster Museum refused to hang one of the artist's works which commemorated 
the victims of Bloody Sunday.

A spokesman for the portrait gallery told the Irish Times the sale had just been approved so a date had not yet been set for 
its display.

He said: 'It’s early days yet as it’s still going through the 
process of acquisition.'

The London gallery was founded in 1856
with the aim of using portraits to promote an appreciation and 
understanding of people who had made British history and culture. It is said to hold the most extensive 
collection of portraits in the world.

It relies on grants in aid from the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as donations.

It has many images of Lady 
Thatcher, as well as portraits of key political figures such as William 
Gladstone and royalty such as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles.

Conrad Atkinson, a Catholic, was born in Cleator Moor, west Cumbria in 1940, and is of Irish descent.

He has worked as a teacher and artist throughout his life and uses a varied range of media.

He gained degrees from Carlisle College of Art, Liverpool College of Art and the Royal Academy Schools between 1957 and 1965, and later won a Granada Fellowship.

Mr Atkinson showcased his work extensively in a variety of different galleries in the 1970s.

He has had a great deal of his work shown at solo exhibitions, including in New York, Belfast and London.

In 1972 and 1974 he held solo shows at Institute of Contemporary Arts, in 1975 at Belfast Arts Council Gallery, in 1977 at Northern Arts Gallery and many others. 

His work, which often refers to social or political themes, has often been considered controversial.
