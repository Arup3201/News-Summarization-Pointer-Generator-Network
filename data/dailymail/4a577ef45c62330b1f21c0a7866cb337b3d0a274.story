Behind all the reports about Google’s Android Wear, and the countless Apple iWatch rumours, Microsoft’s own smartwatch has slipped under the radar a little.

But two patents published this week suggest the firm is definitely still on track to launch its own range of wearable tech - and it could be released as soon as October.

A source close to the plans confirmed the release date, said it would be cross-platform, and added the watch could also have its display on the inside of the wrist.

Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim:

The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It will be made of oxynitride aluminium - a translucent form of the metal.

Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8.

Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet. 

A source close to the plans has said the 
device will launch in October, and it could have its display on the 
inside of the wrist.

It is also expected to work across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows PC.

This would make the watch more 'natural' to use, and the screen would be visible by turning the wrist upwards.

The source also said the gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's range of smartwatches, or the Moto 360.

Instead, it is expected to be sleeker, thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband.

Both the patents published earlier this week were originally filed back in 2012.

The first is titled Discreetly Displaying Contextually Relevant Information on a display device, and shows a smartwatch displaying notifications and GPS navigation.

It was filed on 24 December 2012.

The second, called Dynamic User Interfaces Adapted to Inferred User Contexts, shows how Microsoft plans to add sensors to track the level of activity the wearer is doing - from sitting down to running.

The source also said the gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's watch range, or the Moto 360. Instead, it is expected to be sleeker and thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband (pictured). Both the patents published earlier this week were filed back in 2012

Both patents show wrist worn devices that connect with a phone, and are fitted with built-in heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units (pictured)

This second patent also explained that the interface would react to varying activity levels in different ways.

It was filed on 26 December 2012.

Both patents show wrist worn devices that 
connect with a phone or other smart device, and are fitted with built-in
 heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units. 

Although this technology is not new, Microsoft's patents pre-date current devices on the market and there may be patent infringements filed as a result. 

The rumours about an October launch originated from website Tom’s Hardware, which stated that a ‘trusted source with knowledge of the development’ confirmed the release, and that the phone will work across multiple platforms.

At the moment, Samsung’s range of smartwatches only work with its own handsets, and its expected that any watch Apple releases will be similarly proprietary.

Last month, a similar patent was published that revealed Microsoft was working on sports watch, with built-in heart rate monitor.

According to the latest rumours, there will be 11 sensors inside the firm’s watch including accelerometer, GPS and microphone.

Apple is expected to launch its own smartwatch in September.

Microsoft's watch is rumoured to work across platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows. At the moment, Samsung's Gear and Gear Fit work with its own handsets. The Gear Live (pictured) will work with any Android device running the latest software, and its expected any watch Apple releases will be similarly proprietary

Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch.
