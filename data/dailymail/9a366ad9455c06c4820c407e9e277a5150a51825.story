Los Angeles beach goers out enjoying the holiday weekend were reminded of the sacrifices that are sometimes needed to safeguard our independence.

Stretched out on the sands of the city’s main beach, Santa Monica, were rows and rows of painted wooden crosses, set up by volunteers with Veterans for Peace.

Group member David Troy said: ‘This is about the human cost of war, both sides,’ as he squinted from the glare of the beach under his blue visor.

Memory: Each red cross represents 10 lost American soldiers, while each white one stands for one

Every Sunday for the past seven years, Mr Troy, 67, has been coming out to this California beach, just north of the world-famous pier and its amusement park.

Mr Troy and other volunteers with Veterans for Peace hit the beach around 2 am each Sunday, when they plant hundreds of wooden crosses in the sand, setting up what they call Arlington West, a nod to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

Mr Troy has a well-trimmed white beard, and wore a shirt that read ‘1,500 and counting. How many more?’

Except he had placed a sticker that reads ‘6,100’ over the 1,500.

‘One out of two Iraqis have been killed or displaced, but they don’t tell us that’, Mr Troy rattled statistics off to passersby, most of whom were decked out in bikinis and flip flops, ready for a fun day at the beach.

‘We’re sending $924million a week to Halliburton’, he told a group of young women who wandered by, and stared back blankly.

Mr Troy said he joined Veterans for 
Peace just two months after it was founded in 1985, as a group that 
brings together veterans interested in working toward alternatives to 
war.

Memorial: More than 6,000 American servicemen and women have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan

Some of the crosses have personal notes and photos to remember specific soldiers. A plaque points out that it would take more space to recognize Iraqi deaths

Mr Troy pointed to the rows of crosses in the sand, and said, ‘This is welfare for the rich, that’s what this is’.

He said he thought the Iraq War was all about oil.

‘I’m 67 and I bike and rollerblade as much as I can. But do they?’ he asked, pointing to the throngs of happy beach goers.

‘Wake up people!’ he shouted.

Mr Troy explained that each red cross represents 10 dead American soldiers, while each white one stands for one man or woman.

That makes for hundreds of crosses, because some 6,026 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan to date, according to the Washington Post’s Faces of the Fallen project.

That’s 4,442 deaths in Iraq and 1,584 in Afghanistan.

Our hero: Snapshots and a touching note honour a fallen soldier

Many faiths: Some sickles are used to represent Muslim soldiers, while stars represent Jewish soldiers

This man in soldier's garb said he was 'observing' the memorial, and that he hoped it would make people think

‘We started with crosses, but maybe we should have done tombstones’, Mr Troy said.

‘It’s not a Christian memorial, it’s meant to honour the cost of war’.

To help make the point that the U.S. military is increasingly diverse, Veterans for Peace also sets out sickles for Islam and Stars of David for Judaism, in place of some of the crosses.

The group sets up representations of flag-draped coffins to represent the military dead for the week.

Last week, when we visited, there were four coffins to stand in for the 14 service people who died that week.

Mr Troy added: ‘We’d need a whole lot more crosses if we were going to represent the Iraqi dead’.

Passerby Pete Maughan, 30, said: ‘I think it’s really cool they are expressing how they feel about the war. My brother is in Iraq. It’s crazy.

‘One of these crosses could potentially be him. But I feel confident that it’s not going to be, not at this stage’.

With many children playing on the beach, one wonders if they ask their parents what the memorial means

Tearing down: Volunteers remove the crosses for storage, until the following Sunday, when they are reused

A man in U.S. army fatigues walked by the crosses, and said he was ‘observing’.

He asked not to be named for security reasons, but said, ‘All memorials are good. People may get a better understanding of war’.

The man in fatigues said he had served three months in Afghanistan, but that he was currently serving civilian duty locally.

When the shadows got long on the beach, volunteers began to stack up the wooden crosses, sickles and Stars of David.

No one knows how many they will have to set out next week, but everyone hopes it won’t be any more.
