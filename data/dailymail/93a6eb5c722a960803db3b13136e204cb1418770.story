As abbreviations go, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's has got to be among the most unfortunate. 

But this didn't stop members of the former Muslim rebel group from patrolling the jungles of the Philippines today ahead of the country's contentious general elections.

MILF joins countless other organisations with unfortunate acronyms - such as BAAPS, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.

MILFS: Members of the armed group Moro Islamic Liberation Front take a rest inside a hut as they secure the perimeter to help maintain a peaceful election against other lawless elements in Shariff Aguak, Philippines

But despite the associations that may come with its abbreviated name, MILF is a deadly serious organisation.

MILF is a splinter group of Muslim rebels from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) formed in the 1960s to achieve greater Bangsamoro autonomy in the southern Philippines.

It has used terrorist tactics to try and force greater independence on the region and declared a jihad against the government, its citizens and supporters.

MILF, which was officially formed in the 1980s, has also been linked to Al Qaeda and a bombing incident in Davao Airport in 2003.

In March 2007, the Philippine government offered to recognize the right of self-determination for the Moro people which it had never done in three decades of conflict.

But later that year in July, Islamic militants in Basilan in the southern Philippines killed 14 marines. MILF denied responsibility for the murders.

This delayed the start of the peace process but MILF and the Philippine government took the first tentative steps last year toward ending one of 
Asia's longest-running insurgencies.

Both parties signed a 
preliminary peace pact with a roadmap to a final peace settlement expected by 
2016.

As part of the arrangement, MILF is responsible for maintaining peace on Mindanao island to prevent civil unrest during the congressional and local elections in the Philippines.

More than 52 million voters registered to elect 18,000 officials, including half of the 24-member Senate, nearly 300 members of the House of Representatives and leaders of a Muslim autonomous region in the south, where Islamic insurgents and militants are a concern.

Despite scattered killings and fears of 
fraud, the polls were relatively peaceful as soldiers and police secured
stations in potentially violent areas.

The
outcome will determine the level of support for President Benigno 
Aquino III's reforms in his remaining three years in office. Aquino has 
been praised at home and abroad for cracking down on widespread 
corruption, backing key legislation and concluding an initial peace 
agreement with Muslim rebels - including MILF.

But he cannot run for re-election and a
choice of his successor, who will be expected to continue on the same 
reform path, will depend on the new political landscape.

Candidates 
backed by Aquino are running against a coalition headed by Vice 
President Jejomar Binay and deposed President Joseph Estrada.

Peace keepers: MILF has helped keep election day violence down to an all time low

Although 
officially No. 2 in the country, Binay has emerged as the 
administration's rival and may be positioning himself for the 2016 
presidential race.

Among 33 senatorial candidates are two of 
Aquino's relatives, Binay's neophyte daughter, Estrada's son, a son of 
the sitting chamber president, a son of a late president, a spouse and 
children of former senators and there's a possibility that two siblings 
will be sitting in the same house. Currently, 15 senators have relatives
serving in elective positions.

The race for the House is even more 
of a family affair. Toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos' widow, the 
flamboyant 83-year-old Imelda, is expected to keep her seat as a 
representative for Ilocos Norte province, the husband's birthplace where
the locals kept electing the Marcoses despite allegations of corruption
and abuse during their long rule. Marcos' daughter, Imee is seeking 
re-election as governor and the son, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., is
already a senator.

Boxing star and incumbent Rep. Manny Pacquiao is
running unopposed and building a dynasty of his own: his brother 
Rogelio is running to represent his southern district and his wife 
Jinkee is vying to become vice-governor for Sarangani province.

Estrada,
who was ousted in a 2001 'people power' revolt on corruption 
allegations, is running for mayor of Manila, hoping to capitalize on his
movie star popularity, particularly among the poor masses.

Philippine
elections have long been dominated by politicians belonging to the same
bloodlines. At least 250 political families have monopolized power 
across the country, although such dynasties are prohibited under the 
1987 constitution. Congress - long controlled by members of powerful 
clans targeted by the constitutional ban - has failed to pass the law 
needed to define and enforce the provision.

Geared up: Members of the armed group MILF will continue top patrol throughout the day. The election results will return within the next two days

Critics worry that a single 
family's stranglehold on different levels of government could stymie 
checks against abuses and corruption. A widely cited example is the 2009
massacre of 58 people, including 32 media workers, in an ambush blamed 
on rivalry between powerful clans in southern Maguindanao province.

In
the latest violence, gunmen killed five people and wounded two mayoral 
candidates in separate attacks over the weekend. Last month, gunmen 
fired on a truck carrying a town mayor and his supporters in southern 
Lanao del Norte province, killing 13 people including his daughter.

The
125,000-strong military has helped the government in urging candidates 
to shun violence. An army general took off with his troops aboard two 
helicopters and dropped leaflets calling for peaceful elections in 
Masbate, a central province notorious for political killings.

Results are expected within a day or two.
