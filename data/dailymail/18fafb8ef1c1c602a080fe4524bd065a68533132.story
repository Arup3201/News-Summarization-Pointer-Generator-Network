South Africa followed up their win over England with a 22-6 success against Italy, though they were made to work harder than expected in Padova.

Tries from Coenie Oosthuizen in the first half and Cobus Reinach in the second took the Springboks out of reach of an Italy side who competed well in the scrum and battled until the end but could not break down the visiting defence.

Bryan Habana added a third score in the last minute, his 57th in 105 Tests, to ease any nerves and ensure his side head to Wales next weekend in winning form.

Italy fly-half Kelly Haimona left his opening penalty attempt just short from long range but opened the scoring in the 12th minute after strong scrummaging forced another opportunity from the tee.

Pat Lambie levelled, play having been brought back for the penalty after an excellent move ended with Habana held up short of the line.

South Africa scored the first try when Italy stole line-out ball five metres out but were adjudged to have knocked on, and from the resulting scrum Oosthuizen ploughed over.

Lambie missed the conversion and an Oosthuizen knock-on ended another promising attack, allowing Haimona to cut the half-time deficit to 8-6 with a second penalty.

A South African penalty in kicking range was instead knocked to the corner by Lambie, but the line-out went awry.

But another Haimona penalty failed to reach and South Africa quickly went 15-6 up, Reinach finishing a move involving good work by Du Plessis and Carr before Handre Pollard converted

An Italian response was thwarted when the Boks stole line-out ball and the hosts' desperation was clear. As they tried to attack through the phases late on, Duane Vermeulen nicked the ball and sent Pollard racing upfield.

The replacement fly-half fed Habana, who touched down and Pollard's conversion gave the scoreline a more comfortable look.
