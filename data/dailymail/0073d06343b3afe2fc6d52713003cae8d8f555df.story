A quick dip in the pool can sound appealing - until you realise you’ll be left wearing dripping swimwear for the rest of the day.

Now one Toronto-based entrepreneur has come up with a range of swim trunks that means you can avoid leaving a trail of puddles in your wake.

Inventor, Franky Shaw, has set-up a Kickstarter fund for a swimwear range which is made from hydrophobic material - a fabric that repels water.

It looks like ordinary swimwear from the outside, but when it is covered in liquid, the garment instantly repels water.

‘We were tired of having to change shorts every time you leave the beach, having car seats soaked and not being able to go from the beach to a restaurant,’ Mr Shaw said.

Created by Toronto-based entrepreneur, Franky Shaw, the swim trunks are made from a unique polyester-based hydrophobic material with prices starting from $47 (£28)

‘We decided to look at different topical applications for use but shortly found out they changed the texture of the fabric and had no way of being used on garments.

‘We decided to scrap the idea and look for the perfect alternative.’

What Mr Shaw and his team came up with was a polyester-blend hydrophobic nanomaterial technology.

The technology is thought to work by bonding billions of nanoparticles to individual fibres on a microscopic level.

When water-based liquids hit the surface of this material they form a 150-degree sphere and roll off.

‘This fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry-times by up to 95 per cent in contrast to regular 100 per cent polyester swim shorts,’ the company claims.

Hydrophobic nanotech clothing has been around for a number of years, but it always has a limited lifespan.

For instance, the Silic water-repelling T-shirt, was released last year but can only maintain its properties for 80 washes.

The ‘Frank Anthony’ swimwear, however, promises that its water-repellent abilities last for the last-time of the shorts.

The range comes in a variety of different colours and patterns, with trunks starting from $47 (£28). If the Kickstarter campaign is a success, Mr Shaw expects to begin shipping in July.

If you're clumsy and constantly spilling food down yourself, or just lazy and don't like washing your clothes, a student has invented the answer to your problems - a T-shirt that is impossible to stain.

The tops can resist any spills and splashes including Coca-Cola, tomato ketchup, mustard, milkshakes, beer, ink and even red wine.

The clothing is made from polyester, which has been infused with a combination of chemicals that make it resistant to water.

Despite this, the T-shirts are said to feel ‘no different to any other items that could be found in a clothing shop.’ 

University student Patel from San Francisco made a prototype using a spray-on chemical, but realised it would only last for one wash. He then began looking at ways to incorporate the technology into the fabric.

He created a fabric that has the nanotechnology bonded to the fibres on a microscopic level.

This means they won't irritate the skin.

According to Patel: ‘Most liquid molecules will not be able to touch the fabric because of a microscopic layer of air that forms between the liquid and fabric.

‘This is because the fabric is layered with billions of silica particles. Water based liquids will form a 150 degree sphere and roll right off! As a result, this barrier protects your shirt from potential accidents.’

The material in the Silic shirt, pictured, created by San Fransisco-based student Aamir Patel, has billions of silica particles bonded to the fibres. Water-based liquids form a 150-degree sphere on this material and roll off
