The FBI has launched a task force to reexamine a series of unsolved murders that took place south of San Francisco in the first four months of 1976 that agents believe could be linked to a similar crime in Nevada.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Gerald Bessette said Thursday that the task force would be looking at ties between the slayings of five women in San Mateo County dubbed the 'Gypsy Hill Murders' with the murder of Michelle Mitchell, a 19-year-old University of Nevada-Reno nursing student who also was killed in 1976.

FBI spokesman Peter Lee says law enforcement officials think the same individual is may be responsible for the killings.

The victims were all young females with brown hair parted down the middle. They all appeared to have been raped and stabbed.

The first victim was 18-year-old Veronica Cascio. She was last seen January 7 walking from home to a bus stop before her body was discovered dumped at the Park Golf Course in Pacifica the next day, reports ABC 7. She had been stabbed 32 times and raped.

Tanya Blackwell, 14, was last seen January 24 when she left her home for a local 7-Eleven store. She was found in the Gypsy Hills area months later and had almost identical wounds to Cascio.

Paula Baxter, 17, was last seen February
 4 leaving Capuchino High School after school play rehearsal in San 
Bruno. Her body was found behind a local church, her car was dumped 
nearby.

Twenty-six-year-old
 Carol Booth was last seen walking from a bus stop on El Camino Real 
towards her home on March 15. Her body was found months later in a 
shallow grave near Kaiser Hospital in South San Francisco.

The final California victim was Denise Lampe, 19, who was found stabbed to death in her car in a parking lot of Serramonte Shopping Center in Daly City.

Now the FBI believes that Mitchell's murder in Reno, is linked to the California crimes.

'The Reno murder occurred in between the time frame of our five murders and recent evidence that's been uncovered leads us to believe that the Reno murder is linked to several of our murders,' Bessette said.

Mitchell was last seen on February 24 when her car broke down around 8pm. Someone assisted her in pushing the vehicle off the road and into a parking lot and she called her mother to give her a ride home. But when her mother arrived, Mitchell was nowhere to be seen.

Her body was found later that evening in the garage of a local home. Her throat had been slashed and her hands were tied with twine.

Mitchell's case was believed solved in 1979, when a woman named Cath Woods confessed to her murder and was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

Now, investigators believe Woods was responsible for the murder, but that she had a male accomplice who committed the five California murders.

Authorities say any tips on the case should be directed to the FBI San Francisco field office at 415-553-7400.
