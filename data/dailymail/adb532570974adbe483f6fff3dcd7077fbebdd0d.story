The veil was made from ribbon and tulle from the gift shop, wedding music played from an iPod through borrowed speakers and an elastic hair tie from one of the nurses was strung around the bride's wrist to signify 'something blue'.

A North Mississippi couple have been treated to a special wedding after almost three decades together thanks to the generosity of some hospital staff and in light of some grave circumstances.

Annie Turner was diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer five months ago and, having spent 28 years with her partner Charles Nicholson, decided the time was finally right to say their 'I do's'.

'He asked me a long time ago, but I said no,' Annie told WMC TV.

Wedded bliss: After 28 years with her partner, Charles Nicholson, cancer patient Annie Turner decided there was no other time like the present to get married, and did so from her hospital bed at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, North Mississippi

Annie was pushed from her room and down the hall to the lobby where her groom was waiting. The whole service was planned by hospital staff who had been 'touched' by the couple

'He had been so good to me all those years.

'He asked me again, and I said yeah.'

But as Mr. Nicholson tried to make arrangements for the nuptials, he couldn't get any confirmation about when his bride-to-be would be discharged from Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, with doctors saying her status was 'day-to-day'.

As word of their wishes spread on April 10, many members of the Baptist staff expressed a desire to help the couple plan their special day.

During Annie's hospital stay, the pair made an impression on many — from nurses to patient-care associates to social workers.

'They’re just really sweet, humble people,' head nurse Brittney Goolsby told Hotty Toddy.

'She never imagined anyone would want to do something like this for her. It made us want to do it for them that much more.'

'Life happened and they never had the chance to get married.

'They just wanted to make that commitment to each other.'

When the pair agreed to be married in the hospital, the staff excitedly started planning the occasion - for the next day.

The gift shop prepared the veil and lent some speakers, staff members purchased a delicate shawl and arranged for a bouquet and a boutonniere.

The bride’s Baptist caregivers served as her attendants, helping her get ready for the ceremony.

After being contacted by the hospital, an employee at the Yalobusha County Courthouse volunteered to drive the marriage license to Oxford after she finished work for the day. She arrived with the legal document around 7 p.m.

With the last piece in place, the ceremony could begin.

As the music started, Annie was pushed from her room, down the hall, and into the fifth-floor lobby, where her groom, their son and the hospital chaplain were standing ready.

The hospital gave Annie this wedding gift - a gold necklace with the letter 'C' engraved it on it for her husband, Charles

The bride of course carried a beautiful bouquet of flowers

'We are still talking about it how nice it was, just the way (the staff) put their hearts into it,' Mr. Nicholson said.

'It was just uplifting, especially for her.'

The vows were toasted with raspberry lemonade and the newly-married couple cut a strawberry cake - Annie's favorite - prepared by the cafeteria.

As a gift, staff bought the bride a necklace with a charm marked with the letter 'C' for Charles.

Not long after the wedding, Annie Turner Nicholson was moved to a rehab facility in Water Valley, where her husband stays by her side.

'I’ll never be able to be grateful enough,' Mr. Nicholson said.
