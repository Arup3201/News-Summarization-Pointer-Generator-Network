Now Boris Johnson has donned a hairnet and yellow gumboots to pose as a fishmonger presiding over a spread of fresh fish and seafood, including a vast yellowfin tuna.

The Mayor of London tried his hand at tuna loining, salmon filleting and ‘pin-boning’ - the art of removing fish bones using tweezers - as he launched National Apprentice Week yesterday.

Mr Johnson met apprentices working at the New England Seafood factory, where he confirmed plans for a £1.8million scheme that will create more than 3,500 new apprenticeships across the capital.

He said: ‘Our new programme will reach out to those companies yet to dip their toe into the rich pool of talent contained in our capital.’

The London-based New England Seafood has taken on 12 apprentices since 2012, five of whom have gone on to take up full time positions.

The company supplies fresh and frozen fish and seafood to leading supermarkets including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose.

Around 190,000 16-24 year-olds have become a London apprentice since 2010.
