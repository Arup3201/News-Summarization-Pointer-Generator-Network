A restaurant owner has caused outrage by telling customers they can no longer share meals when in large groups and demanded they order individual dishes and drinks.

Martin Duncan, owner of Freestyle Tout, which boasts the 'best desserts in Brisbane, took to Facebook on Monday to inform patrons of the rules during peak business times - but his post sparked anger among some regulars.

'We would really really appreciate each individual guest purchasing a meal or dessert and a beverage,' he wrote.

'We would like to reserve table space for paying customers.

'Sorry to put it plainly but large groups not eating or drinking does not pay our rent or the wages of our fabulous staff. If you must share please purchase a drink.'

But some diners were not happy with being told what to do and said the business would lose customers if they weren't more welcoming.

One diner responded: 'Don't tell me what to do Freestyle? I will purchase what I want! What an absolute joke! This guy is going to lose all his business'.

'I always share a dessert when I go places simply because I can't eat that much food. I don't think it's healthy or fair to force people to eat when they are not hungry. It's such a waste of money for me to eat a meal and send half of it back when I go out, so my partner and I usually share,' another patron wrote.

Others were more supportive of the new move.

'It is a reasonable request, I am with the owners,' one person said.

Following the reaction, Mr Duncan said his message may have been a 'little misconstrued'.

'To help set the record straight there are no "rules" regarding dining at Freestyle Tout,' he wrote in a latter post.

'There is no issue with people sharing meals, after all, the sharing of food is one of life's great joys.'

But Mr Duncan continued to explain the reasoning behind his original plea.

'The issue I am speaking out about is when large groups of say, 10 or 20 people share for instance, 2 meals/desserts, or share 4 coffees or even worse, try bringing in their own food from home, especially when there are customers waiting for a seat,' he wrote.

'This is an issue not just limited to our business, many of my fellow restaurateurs have shared similar stories with me.

'Many people are watching their pennies in this economy and this is understandable. Our meals start at $8.90 and that's why we try and make dining out an affordable experience for all.'
