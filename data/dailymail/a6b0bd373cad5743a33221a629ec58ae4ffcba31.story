A child tax credit inspector stole £50,000 in welfare handouts by making bogus childcare claims to pay off a 4,000 per cent interest Wonga debt.

Mother-of-two Caroline Bryon, 34, from Greater Manchester, swindled the money over four years and thought she could avoid detection as she knew only a certain number of claims were checked.

She was unmasked as a fraudster and has now been given a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to pay just £100 to cover court costs.

The inland revenue officer was in debt due to her love of socialising and illegally pocketed double the child tax credits and working tax credits she was entitled to when she moved in with a partner who had a full-time job.

She began spinning three different lies to obtain the cash from 2010 even tried to involve a babysitter in the scam when she realised she was under investigation, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Bryon narrowly avoided immediate custody on the basis that she didn't use her job to obtain the cash - because 'if she had applied her mind she would have realised she was always going to get found out'.

The mother who has two sons aged 10 and five was working in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs office checking other benefits claims during the four years from 2010 to 2014.

Prosecutor Jonathan Rogers said Bryon began submitting claims saying her circumstances were correct when they had, in fact, changed.

He said: 'In January 2011 she telephoned HMRC to say her child care costs were £300 per week. This was while she worked for the HMRC processing and checking claims.

'One of the childcare providers cites the defendant, knowing there was an investigation into her claim, had asked her to tell tax credits that she had paid the childminder almost double what she had and asked her to backdate a claim but the childminder refused.

'The defendant had a greater knowledge than average members of the public on the street would have. She would know what checks took place because she carried them out herself.'

Bryon claimed she had taken out a payday loan with Wonga - only to be left facing interest rates of 4,000 per cent.

Defence counsel Andrew Evans said: 'It stems from debt. The name Wonga appears. Interest rates of 4,000%. It was a debt spiral. She separated from the father of her eldest child and decided to use payday loans to bridge the gap, not only her own outgoings but socialising.

'What she has realised is this is a problem with alcohol that she uses in periods of stress. The stress was she was going to move from home and away from her family and from Lancashire to Manchester to move in with her new partner.

'She had been hiding this debt. She will be a very unlikely candidate to darken the court's door again. She has paid off huge interest rates to those people who prey on people in crisis.'

Judge Andrew Thomas said Bryon had 'lived beyond her means' and had cheated hard-working taxpayers.

He said: 'There came a point when you positively told lies in applications you made. The offending involves lies told over a period of two years but the claims persisted for five years. I regard it as a significant aggravating factor that you were employed by HMRC throughout the period, carrying out work processing tax credit claims yourself.

'I recognise you didn't use this position in order to interfere with your own claim. You of all people know what the system is. You of all people know that our revenue system, both payment of taxes and payment of benefits, depends on trust.

'People in your position know that we rely on the honesty of people submitting their forms when you process payments and you know the proportion of forms routinely checked. We all know those who cheat the system aren't cheating the State, you are cheating all honest people who work hard and pay taxes and don't claim benefits to which they aren't entitled.

'You were cheating your own colleagues, friends and neighbours by stealing in that way. This is a case of someone who lived beyond their means and got into debt for that reason.' 

Bryon from Ashton-under-Lyne was also given 200 hours unpaid work and ordered to undergo six months of supervision after pleading guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation.
