New Year's Eve has always been a time for fresh beginnings, but for one 62-year-old from Darwen, Lancashire, midnight on December 31 was especially sweet. 

Steph Holmes rang in 2015 as a fully-fledged woman – 59 years after she started dressing as a girl.

Steph, who is a retired computer sciences teacher, was handed strappy black heels as a Christmas present when she was just three years old, but only built up the courage to have full gender reassignment surgery earlier last year.

For years afterwards, she secretly dressed as a woman, coming home from work and throwing on a dress and heels. 

But she never told anyone, not even her closest family. 

Now Steph is finally living openly as a woman after having the surgery last April. 

She has also set up a support group for other women called Chrysalis Transsexual Support Group.

During her childhood as a boy called Stephen, Steph wore pretty dresses and always favoured pink over blue but when she hit her teenage years she reverted to boys' clothes.

Steph as Stephen - as a young man, he tried desperately to fight his urges and engaged in manly hobbies 

Steph said: 'My journey began when mum Lilian gave me a pair of black high heels for Christmas, 59 years ago.

'I hadn't even asked for them, she knew me so well.

'It might seem strange. I was a three-year-old boy. But I'd always been a bit different - I preferred pink to blue and dolls to toy cars.

'But mum couldn't care less and when we went shopping she'd let me choose the clothes I wanted.

'My father also turned a blind eye as I danced around in my new outfits.

'At primary school I had to wear a boy's uniform but as soon as I got through the front door though, I'd change into something pretty.'

It wasn't until Steph started senior school that she began to realise she was different to most boys her age. 

She said: 'When I went to an all boys high school that I noticed how different I was.

'I stopped wearing girls' clothes and tried to lock away the urges.'

After quitting the army aged 18, Steph, who was then still Stephen, grew his hair long 

Steph used to dress as a woman even before her operation. Here she is, right, walking along Douglas seafront in the Isle of Man in 1962 with her mother, left. 

Keen to fight her natural urges, she even joined the army at 18 but quit two months later after realising she couldn't go through with it.' 

She said: 'That was when I grew my hair long. 

'Mum loved it, often coming round to braid my hair, she called me "the daughter I never had".' 

Then, at the age of 19 Steph lost her virginity but it did not feel right, so she did not do it again.

Relationships were few and far between. In her late 20s, she met a woman and wore her clothes in secret but when the lady found out, their romance ended.

Steph said: 'From then on, I decided to be honest with future girlfriends and confessed on first dates.'

This new attitude was a success and Steph went on to get married in her 40s.

However, a few years later she finally realised she was transsexual.

She said: 'I decided to tell my wife my dream of becoming a woman and she said, "I can't support you".

'I had to make the hardest choice of my life. My wife or life as a real woman.

'But I knew I couldn't keep living a lie.'

Steph is now happier than she has ever been. She has even met a woman and they are engaged

So in March 2010, she visited doctors to undergo full gender reassignment surgery. 

In 2012, she met a a 58-year-old woman called Fran, 58, from Stockport and the two women started a relationship. 

They are engaged but have not yet set a date for the wedding.

Steph said: 'I feel complete.' 

'I've got a wonderful partner and the body I should have been born into.

I just wish mum could see me like this, but sadly she passed away a few years ago.'
