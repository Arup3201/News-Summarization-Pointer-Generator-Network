Morale in the Armed Forces has plummeted in the last three years as jobs losses and pay cuts take their toll.

New figures show the number of soldiers in the British Army reporting low morale has doubled since 2010 to 30 per cent.

Ministers admitted deep cuts to the Defence budget and restructuring was having an ‘inevitable’ impact on the mood among troops.

Uncertainty: Jobs losses and restructuring forced by spending cuts have had the sharpest impact on morale in the Army

The coalition's dramatic reductions in the size of the regular Army, ordering several rounds of redundancies to cut troop numbers from  102,000 to just 82,000.

At the same time there are plans to increase the size of the reserves from 15,000 to 30,000.

But the combination of pay freezes and job insecurity is having a devastating impact on those who remain.

New figures released to Parliament show 30 per cent of soldiers in the Army now have ‘low’ morale, up from 15 per cent in 2010.

At the same time the number reporting high morale has fallen from 59 per cent to just 40 per cent.

Inevitable: Defence minister Anna Soubry said cuts were bound to impact on morale

Kevan Jones, Labour's shadow defence minister, said: 'With the compulsory redundancies and uncertainty about future numbers, these statistics are hardly surprising.

'The way in which this government are treating servicemen and women and their families is shocking and is counter to all the promises they made at the last election about bigger armies and looking after members of our Armed Forces.'

Morale appears to have been least affected in the Royal Navy, with low levels reported by 28 per cent, up just three points since 2010.

Among Royal Marines, low morale is now reported by one in four, up from one in five three years ago.

Some 46 per cent of Marines said their morale was ‘high’ – the highest level of any of the forces.

In the RAF 29 per cent said morale was ‘low’ and 38 per cent said ‘high’.

The figures, released in Parliament to Labour MP Gemma Doyle, were drawn from the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey.

Defence minister Anna Soubry admitted spending cuts were to blame for the slump in spirits among the armed forces.

‘The recommendations of the Strategic Defence and Security Review have necessitated a series of difficult decisions, including reshaping our armed forces as we move towards “'Future Force 2020”,’ she said.

‘While issues such as headcount reductions and pay restraint have inevitably had an impact on morale, I continue to be impressed by the absolute dedication of our military personnel.’

The results of the survey are used by the Ministry of Defence to overhaul terms and conditions of service.

Criticism: With emotions running high, retired Colonel Ian Brazier (left) and Captain Joe Eastwood heckled Britain's Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond as he spoke to the Conservative party conference last week

Miss Soubry added: ‘It is a key function of the chain of command to know their people, including levels of morale and performance.

‘Each of the services has mechanisms in place to ensure that issues are identified and acted upon.’

Cuts to the forces have raised emotions among serving personnel and veterans.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was heckled by a retired officer during his Tory conference last week.

Colonel Ian Brazier accused Mr Hammond of betraying members of the Royal Fusiliers by cutting the regiment back.

But Mr Hammond insisted the cuts were ordered by Army chiefs and not ministers.
