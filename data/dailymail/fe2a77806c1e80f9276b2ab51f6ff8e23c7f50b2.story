A four-year-old's death is being linked to this year's flu epidemic, which would make him the 21st under-18 to have died from the illness this flu season.

The death of Hunter Ewert, 4, of Boardman, Ohio, comes as flu vaccine stocks are put under increasing pressure by people now rushing to 
protect themselves from the illness.

The Ohio Health Department is investigating whether influenza caused the death of Hunter, who was discovered dead on Saturday, it was announced today.

He was found unresponsive in his parents bed after joining them on Friday night complaining of a sore throat and fever. 

'The doctors at the hospital said his lungs filling up would have happened very quickly and the only way they would have been able to catch it was by doing an x-ray every hour," Shannon Ewert told wytv.com.

'At some point during the night, he made his way from his bedroom to ours. It appears he crawled into our bed and collapsed face down,' Mrs Ewert, who is a nurse, told the broadcaster.

Victims: 20 children have been killed in the flu epidemic this year. More than 3,500 people have now been hospitalized in the epidemic since October 2012

She attempted to perform CPR but couldn't save her son.

'I am glad he came into our bed and did not die in his bed alone,' Ewert said.

Further tests will be carried out to determine whether he died from the flu.

If they are positive, he will be the 21st child fatality - one of the highest death tolls on record.

The child victims of the epidemic also
include a 6-year-old girl from Maine, a 15-year Michigan school-band 
star, and a six-foot-four Texas high school senior Max Schwolert, who 
grew sick in Wisconsin while visiting his grandparents for the holidays.

It is one of the worst pediatric death tolls since the government began keeping track of flu among children in 2004.

The 
youngest victim is believed to be a 2 month-old baby from Delaware.

Loving: Avery Lane, 6, is one of the 20 children killed in this year's flu epidemic. She was described as 'very kind and very loving' by her grandmother

Tributes have been paid to the victims
by families, friends and school teachers shocked and saddened by how 
the ferocious nature of this year's outbreak has claimed the lives of so many
young and healthy children.

Avery Lane, a healthy first-grader at Benton Elementary School, Maine, was just six years old when 
she died from the illness last month.

She was described as a 'little angel' by 
relatives on Facebook and her grandmother Pam Souzer said she was 'very 
kind and very loving'

Principal Suanne Giorgetti sent a letter to parents that said the school had 'experienced the unthinkable' last month.

Her family have now set up a fund 
supporting the Somerset Animal Shelter called 'Avery's Kitties' in her honor. Avery loved the animals and had a collection of stuffed cat 
toys.

'Avery's favorite stuffed kitty was 
named China. When she got the little stuffed cat. She asked my sister to
read the tag "Made in China" ...Avery thought China was the perfect 
name,' her mother Tabitha Souzer wrote on Facebook.

'How she loved that stuffed kitty. 
This has helped our family knowing Avery is being remembered in a way 
that would bring a bigger smile to her sweet face.'

Tomorrow in Fenton, Michigan, a 
funeral will be held for Joshua Polehna, a 15-year-old freshman at Lake 
Fenton High School with a passion for the school's marching band, track 
and robotics

The Manhattan Soccer Club has put out a notice to parents and their elementary school members advising against handshakes and high fives

The club has advised members 'touch elbows' before and after games rather than touching hands

Catholic Churches are also reportedly taking precautions.

Congregations have been told to verbally exchange words of peace rather than shaking hands

'He was always caring and polite and always thinking about others,” Dave Polehna, Josh’s father told Michigan Live.

'Like any kid, he liked video games. 
He was in track (a hurdler) and did baseball. He was in the percussion 
section in the marching band. He worked hard and was very proud of 
that.'

'Every teacher that had him…they said he was a joy to have in class, absolute joy to be around and always made you smile.'

According to The Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, many states may have seen the peak of the flu 
epidemic for this year but others are yet to suffer the worst.

In its latest briefing, which covers the week up until January 5, it found 24 states were reporting high levels of flu. 

That number was down from the 29 
states reporting a high level of outbreak over Christmas but seven
unaffected states were dragged into the epidemic for the first time. 

Within states, the illness is also becoming more widespread.

Tragic: Tahila Johnson, six, died last week after visiting hospital with flu-like symptoms while, in Michigan, 15-year-old Joshua Polehna died two weeks ago after suffering flu-like symptoms

Tragedy: Little Avery Page was one of the victims of this year's flu epidemic. The healthy little girl from Maine has been mourned by family and friends

Loss: A Facebook page called "Gone but Never Forgotten R.I.P Carly Christenson" was created last week. The school basketball star had received a flu vaccine

Six more states said they were dealing 
with widespread flu compared to the week ending December 27 and a 
startling 1,443 extra people were hospitalized with it.

The flu vaccine is the main means of preventing against flu but is only effective in about 60 per cent of cases.

Dr. Margaret Hamburg, 
commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today reported 
'spot shortages' in the vaccine which they were ' monitoring'.

She added they were 'working with manufacturers to increase supply' with 130million vaccines already distributed. 

Ohio doctors urged parents not to panic following the death of Hunter Ewert

'When to worry really is your child is coughing, high fever, temp not dropping. They're not drinking. Not peeing is something for children. They are fluid monsters. If they're not drinking, something is wrong,' said Dr. John Cox, a pediatrician told wkbn.com.

Other groups are taking radical measures to try and halt the spread of the flu. According to Yahoo Sports a Manhattan Sports Club is banning its players from high-fiving and Catholic Churches are advising against shaking hands, according to NBC.

Michigan has one of the highest pediatric rates for any state in the country. 

There have been four child flu deaths 
there this winter including that of Polehna, a 6-year-old child, a 
13-year-old and a 5-month old baby have also died.

Shortage: Health officials today admitted they had been told of 'spot shortages' of the vaccine but are monitoring the situation and liasing with manufacturers

Necessary pain: Roughly 130 million doses have been distributed this season, compared to 83 million in 2008

State health officials said yesterday that though they have had 'unusually high demand' there were still plenty of flu vaccines available. 

One of this year's young victims, popular athlete Carly Christenson, 14 is known to have received the shot but died January 8.

The popular basketball star has been remembered by thousands in her town with two tribute sites established on Facebook.

Others have accused health workers of not acting on flu cases.

Earl Johnson took his daughter, Tahlia
Johnson, 6, to Dallas Regional Medical Center in Mesquite. He said they
waited for four hours and doctors told him she didn't need a flu test. 
She later died of the illness.

Medics still urge 
people to get the vaccine and seek medical assistance if concerned at 
their children's symptoms.

3710 people have been hospitalized with flu since October - 46 per cent are aged 65 and over.

On average, an estimated 24,000 Americans die each flu season.

Another
young case is that of Max Schwolert, 17, of Flower Mound, Texas, who 
was taken ill on Christmas Eve on a visit to his grandparents home in 
Amery, Wisconsin. He'd been accepted to Oklahoma State 
University before the Christmas trip. And an acceptance letter from the 
University of Minnesota arrived in Texas while Max was sick in 
Minnesota, his uncle said.Nearly 1,400 people attended a memorial service for Max two weeks ago in Texas.'He exuded care and love for other people,' His uncle Phil Schwolert said.'The bottom line is take care of your kids, be close to your kids,' he added.
