Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis appeared in court today to face 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.

The 68-year-old, who is to face trial next year, spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood his bail conditions at the 20-minute preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey.

He has indicated that he will plead not guilty to the charges, which are said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007 against nine alleged victims aged between 15 and 29.

Former DJ Dave Lee Travis has appeared at the Old Bailey to face 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault

Travis has indicated that he will plead not guilty to the charges, which are said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007 against nine alleged victims aged between 15 and 29

Travis, who wore a grey suit, white 
shirt and patterned tie for the hearing, has denied any wrongdoing since
he was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in November last 
year.

After the short hearing, Travis told reporters inside the court building that he would not talk about the case.

He said: 'Iâ€™ve got nothing to say.'

Earlier, Travis, whose real name is 
David Patrick Griffin, had made no comment as he walked past a large 
pack of television cameramen and photographers on his way into court.

Travis spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood his bail conditions at the 20-minute preliminary hearing

He was released on bail on condition that he lives at his home in Mentmore, Bedfordshire, and does not contact the alleged victims.

Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned the case for a plea and case management hearing on October 21 and fixed a trial date for March 4 next year.

The trial is expected to last four to five weeks.

After the hearing, Travis got straight into a taxi without acknowledging the waiting media.

Travis
was charged last month as part of Operation Yewtree, the police 
investigation prompted by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, but the 
accusations against Travis have no connection to the disgraced 
television presenter.
