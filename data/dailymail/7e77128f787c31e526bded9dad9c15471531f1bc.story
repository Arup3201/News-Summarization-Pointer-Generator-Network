 Moooove over, Ben Roethlisberger. There's a new No. 7 in western Pennsylvania.

The folks at Vale Wood Farms in Loretto have named a calf Baby Ben after the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback because the cow has a marking that looks like a Number 7 on its head.

The farm has posted the calf's picture on its Facebook page, and WJAC-TV visited the farm about 70 miles east of Pittsburgh to see what all the fuss is about.

Lucky number seven: A baby calf with a marking of a number 7 on its head has been named Big Ben in honor of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger who wears a seven on his jersey when he plays

Look familiar?: Baby Ben is named after Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger (pictured) who wears a number seven on his jersey and is nicknamed Big Ben 

Since being posted on Facebook the photos got over 1,100 likes and over 100 comments.

Carissa Itle-Westrick, the director of business development for the family-owned food-and-grocery farm, is hoping Roethlisberger won't mind.

She says, 'Baby Ben is awfully cute, so hopefully Big Ben won't mind sharing his namesake.'

The farm plans to display the calf when it opens its pumpkin patch for business next month.

Itle-Westrick told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that she's seen a variety of cow patterns over the years such as a state, a continent, and once even a Nike's swoosh.

She said that when she saw Baby Ben for the first time she immediately thought of the Steelers.

'He turned to face me, and I said, "Wow, it’s a perfect little 7," ' Ms. Itle-Westrick said. Taking the quarterback’s namesake

'was kind of a natural for us. We’re out here in Steelers country.'

Even Ben Roethlisberger's website Bigben7.com acknowledged the furry doppelganger in a blog post.

The post said that if you visit the farm, 'don’t forget to say hello to Baby Ben while you’re there (who is probably gonna milk this new-found fame for all it’s worth!)'

The Post gazette reports that Baby Ben will be on display during the farm's pumpkin patch event October 1-19.

Vale Wood Farms has been around since 1933 and while it processes its own milk and dairy, it doesn't use any meat from the cows.

Head in the game: Even Ben Roethlisberger's website acknowledged the furry doppelganger and he wrote in his blog of visiting the farm, 'don’t forget to say hello to Baby Ben while you’re there'
