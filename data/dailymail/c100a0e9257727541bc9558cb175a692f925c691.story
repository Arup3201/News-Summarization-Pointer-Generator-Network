Manchester United will offer a new contract to Tom Cleverley this week.

The 25-year-old, who missed United’s opening Barclays Premier League game on Saturday due to illness, has been the target of abuse from certain sections of United’s support who cite him as an example of the club’s fall in standards.

Yet the central midfielder’s attitude and determination in the face of such criticism has drawn admiration from senior figures within the club, not least from new manager Louis van Gaal.

New deal: Tom Cleverley is to be offered a contract extension by Manchester United this week

Staking his claim: Cleverley challenges Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during a pre-season match in Miami 

Cleverley was handed the captaincy for the pre-season friendly with Roma and Van Gaal sees his versatility and short passing game as qualities that can fit into his system. 

Although Cleverley is not necessarily first choice, Van Gaal wants him to stay and the player is keen to extend a current deal that has one year left to run.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez has a strong interest in £10million-rated Cleverley and will consider a bid should the two parties fail to reach an agreement, but following preliminary talks United will offer a three-year extension on terms of around £70,000 per week.

Midfield general: Cleverley has been given a second chance by new United manager Louis Van Gaal

Second chance: Van Gaal wants Cleverley to remain at Old Trafford despite poor performances last season

Meanwhile, Sporting Lisbon are interested in taking United winger Nani on loan.

The Portuguese came on as a substitute at half time yesterday but he is one of a number of players thought to be on his way out of Old Trafford, and Sporting want to give him the chance to play regularly.

United are continuing negotiations over a deal for Sporting defender Marcos Rojo. Nani could be included in that transfer but so far the 27-year-old has shown a reluctance to return to Portugal, preferring a move to Italy or Spain instead.
