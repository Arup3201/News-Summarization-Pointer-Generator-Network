Gone: Police say Matthew Van Waus, 38, and his wife, 31, pictured, drove to a secluded cemetery in Victor, Iowa, parked and killed themselves

A married couple who spent their final hours together before shooting themselves in a tragic double suicide in a small town cemetery will now be buried apart.

The deaths of Matthew Van Waus, 38, and his wife Leah, 31, have shocked the tight-knit community of Victor, Iowa, after their bodies were discovered by police after 6am on the morning of Friday 11 May.

Although the couple were married for seven-and-a-half years the families have separated them.

The mother of Leah Van Waus spoke out for the first time about the terrible ordeal, telling MailOnline: 'We just feel fortunate that we were able to bring Leah home to celebrate her life. It's still very much a shock.

'The saddest deaths are untimely deaths. This is a loss for our family.'

Mrs Olsen said their deaths came as a complete surprise.

'It's the loss of the promise of the future and the companionship and joy she brought us in the present,' she said.

Mrs Van Waus will be buried separately from her husband, causing speculation of a rift between the families.

'Sometimes families don't get along,' an employee at the funeral home that arranged Mr Van Waus's funeral said. 'Her family stepped in and took her.'

Mrs Olsen refuted the sentiment, saying if there was an issue between the two families, she didn't know anything about it.

Mrs Olsen said that in the weeks before her daughter's death, she hadn't noticed anything strange about her moods and that she didn't appear to be depressed.

Respects: Services for Mr Van Waus are to be held at St. Bridget Catholic Church in Victor

The deaths have stunned residents of the small town which has a population of less than 1,000 people.

Relatives of the couple found their unoccupied vehicles parked in a Victor cemetery and, after a search of the area, police discovered the bodies.

Police are still investigating the incident.

Mr Van Waus was a former assistant administrator at Eldridge City Hall, where he oversaw business projects to create jobs in the city.

Current assistant administrator James Martin told MailOnline: 'He was a good man, well-liked and respected, and he will be greatly missed in Eldridge.

'We were all saddened and shocked to hear of his and his wife’s deaths.'

Mr Van Waus was the assistant city administrator for seven years until last May.

'Matt is the last person I would have picked for doing something like this,' former colleague John Dowd told the North Scott Press.

Mr Dowd said that after Mr Van Waus left his position with the city, he lost touch with him.

'We were all surprised when he left Eldridge, and after he left he really didn’t keep in contact with us.

'We never had any real personal news from him.'

Mr Dowd said that Mr Van Waus enjoyed hunting, and would use bows, shotguns, pistols and rifles.

The couple were both psychology graduates

For the last nine years of her life, she worked as human resource and telecommunications executive for Shaw Electric in Davenport.

Services for Mr Van Waus are to be held at St. Bridget Catholic Church in Victor.

Mrs Van Waus’s funeral is to be held at Linn Grove Church, Mount Vernon.
