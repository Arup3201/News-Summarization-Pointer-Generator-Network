A fearless daredevil rolls the dice hundreds of feet above Las Vegas on his way to setting a new world record.

Thrill-seeker Andy Lewis from Moab in Utah, USA, upped the stakes as he carefully edged 360ft across the one-inch wide line 480ft above the hustle and bustle of the famous party strip below.

The walk broke the world record for longest distance walked on a slackline in an urban environment.

Fearless Andy Lewis adjusts his arms and thrusts his hips to the left as he balances precariously on a one-inch wide line hundreds of feet above the ground in Las Vegas. Cars and trees look like tiny models from the lofty position above the city's airport

Thrill seeker Andy Lewis plunges from the slackline and is left dangling upside down with just a rope, clips and a harness preventing him from crashing to the ground below. The dramatic tumble happened as he made a number of attempts to cross a 360ft line installed above an airport in Las Vegas

Despite the buzzing drones, constant planes taking off at McCarran International Airport and swirling wind, Mr Lewis was able to make it across the line without falling on his third attempt.

He said: 'The lifestyle behind slacklining has all the metaphors - one step at a time, keep in balance, control your fate... it directly translates to life.

'People don't want to watch you do things like that but it's horrible in life today there's no respect for skill anymore - people are too afraid to take risks.

The frightening extent of thrill-seeker Andy Lewis's challenge is laid bare in this photograph as he inches across the slackline in Las Vegas. Much of the busy McCarran International Airport is visible down below the 480ft line as he makes another attempt to set a new world record and make the crossing without falling

'Risk isn't bad you can be the safest person on the planet and still crash your car any day.'

Slacklining typically uses nylon or polyester webbing installed between two anchor points. Whereas tightrope walking involves walking along a rigid line, slacklines involve more bounce and stretch and can be adjusted to suit the user.

Mr Lewis's incredible skill was captured by keen photographer Dan Krauss who said: 'Slacklining is all based on concentration and mental discipline - as soon as you lose your focus you will lose your balance.

'In the desert you're usually alone with yourself, your friends and nature with not much to distract you except your thoughts.

'But with an urban line there are countless distractions making it extremely difficult to concentrate on your balance.

'People seemed pretty shocked and couldn't believe what was happening up there - they seemed excited.'

Easy does it: Andy Lewis pauses to correct his balance on another crossing. He eventually broke the world record for walking the longest distance on a slackline in an urban environment when he completed the task without falling on his third attempt
