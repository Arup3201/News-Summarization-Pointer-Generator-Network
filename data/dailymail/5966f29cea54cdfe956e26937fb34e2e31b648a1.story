Father-of-two Lloyd Butler, 39, from Birmingham, died after having a heart attack in his cell in August 2010

Police custody officers were watching porn online when they should have been keeping ‘constant watch’ on a father who had a heart attack in his cell and died, an inquest heard.

Lloyd Butler, 39, from Birmingham, was supposed to be monitored every 15 minutes but officers were ‘distracted’ by a ‘website about women offering sex’, according to his family’s barrister, Stephen Cragg QC.

PC Dean Woodcock had also been making personal telephone calls on the station’s landline and his mobile phone, while Sergeant Mark Albutt was viewing Sky Sports and Next clothing websites while the father-of-two was in their care, it was claimed.

Mr Cragg claimed officers had gathered around PC Woodcock’s screen and laughed as they loaded the X-rated website.

But PC Woodcock denied the claims when he appeared to give evidence at the inquest held at Birmingham Coroners' Court.

He told the hearing: ‘I genuinely can’t remember what that website was. You don’t have sites like that on West Midlands Police computer. They are blocked.’

Mr Butler was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable and taken to Stechford Police Station, West Midlands on August 4, 2010.

The 39-year-old was supposed to be ‘roused’ every 15 minutes but officers regularly left him longer.

PC Woodcock was also heard on CCTV joking that one way of rousing Mr Butler, whose trousers had fallen down, would be to ‘hit him round the backside’, according to Mr Cragg.

Despite classifying Mr Butler as ‘high risk’, officers sent custody nurse Ian O’Hara to assess another prisoner first.

There was a 38-minute gap from the last time PC Woodcock checked on Mr Butler until Mr O’Hara entered the cell and immediately spotted he was in trouble.

‘He was struggling to breathe, that was obvious from the hatch,’ Mr O’Hara said.

‘I checked for a pulse and got one and asked for PC Woodcock to get an ambulance straight away because someone in that condition shouldn’t be there.

‘Next, a minute or a minute and a half after that, he suddenly stopped breathing and I could feel no pulse. It was there and then it wasn’t.’

The inquest continues.
