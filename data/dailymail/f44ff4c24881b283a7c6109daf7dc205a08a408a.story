Billionaire casino mogul James Packer has been declared unwelcome in Sri Lanka, with the country's new Prime Minister announcing that the Australian should not 'come to the country in this lifetime'.

The strong backlash from the Sri Lanka's new government come after Packer withdrew from long-standing plans to build a $350 million luxury resort in the country's 'commercial capital', Colombo.

Packer scrapped his development plans in the wake of the government's ban on new casinos.

'Packer says he will not come. Who asked you to come?' Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a statement.

'Please don't come - not in this lifetime.'

Sri Lanka's new government blocked three casinos approved by the former administration, among them Australian gaming mogul James Packer's Crown Resorts Ltd.

Packer is unwilling to construct the resort without a casino and has also been deterred by the incoming government's choice to revoke tax concessions which had been approved under a former regime.

The previous government, then led by president Mahinda Rajapaksa, had plans to turn Colombo into a regional gaming hub in the hope of boosting tourism.

However, on Thursday the government revoked the 5 per cent tax rate that had been granted to Mr Packer.

The deal would have seen Packer save up to $1bn in 10-year tax breaks.

Mr Packer's project had been approved in December 2013 but construction was yet to commence.

President Maithripala Sirisena was elected on January 8 this year and appointed Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on January 9.

During their election campaigntook a firm anti-gaming stance . 

As a result, they received strong support, particularly from the Buddhist monks who have great influence in the country and have been vocal in their opposition of casinos.

Today Packer was seemingly unphased by the announcement, grinning widely a press conference at the newly-opened City of Dreams mega-casino in Manila on February 2, 2015.
