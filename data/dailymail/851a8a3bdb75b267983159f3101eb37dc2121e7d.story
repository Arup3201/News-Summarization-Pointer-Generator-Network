Lewis Hamilton came to the oil-and-rags track at Spa-Francorchamps via the glitziest address in Washington DC.

Ahead of Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, the British driver recalled meeting President Obama and told how Stevie Wonder had to wait in the queue while the leader of the free world lingered to talk about Formula One with him.

But after the summer break, part of which Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate and only title rival Nico Rosberg spent hunting for the best pizza in Naples, there is a growing sense that the intensity of the world championship fight is heightening.

The niggle is sharper. The barbs carry more weight.

‘I am not hiding anything from Nico,’ said Hamilton. ‘He has all my data. I never, never ever have asked my guys, “Don’t show that to Nico.” Actually I want him to be at his best, because it is more painful when you are at your best and getting beaten.’

Hamilton first has to overhaul Rosberg’s 11-point lead before worrying about rubbing the German’s nose in the gravel trap.

This weekend presents an opportunity for each of the title combatants to prove his worth. Spa is a true racer’s track. At 4.3 miles, it is the longest of the year, a rollercoaster of high-speed straights and fast corners hidden among the high trees of the Ardennes forest.

Its glory is the plunge-and-climb corner, Eau Rouge. The new twitchier cars of 2014 will be a handful through there, so much so that Jenson Button, the veteran McLaren driver, admitted he ‘let out a few screams inside my crash helmet’ during practice on Friday.

At the head of the time sheets were the Mercedes duo, predictably. Hamilton set the fastest time of the day, with Rosberg six-tenths of a second tardier.

Determined: Hamilton is hoping to life his second world title this season but he is second in the championship

Competition: Rosberg leads the drivers' championship by 11 points heading into the Belgian Grand Prix

Hunger: German driver Nico Rosberg spent the F1 break travelling around Napoli finding the perfect pizza

‘It stayed dry throughout both sessions but the forecast is wet for qualifying tomorrow, so it was important to maximise track time as this may be our last dry running before the race,’ said Hamilton.

‘We’ve seen rain so often here in the past and that can really mix things up — particularly when it’s wet in places and dry in others.

‘I want to keep my head down like a bull — nothing can really stand in the way of a bull. But my team-mate wants to be the wall that gets in the way, so I will try to manoeuvre it the best way I can this weekend, and win.’

It felt as though Bernie Ecclestone was back in control. In fact, the sport’s supremo had hardly been away, but merely distracted by his bribery trial in Germany. He paid £60million and the case was dropped, with no implication of guilt in official wording of the court.

He was in typically feisty form here during a series of interviews. On the inaugural Russian Grand Prix planned for October 12, he told the BBC: ‘I asked somebody the other day, “have they decided who shot that plane down?” Nobody seems to know, do they? So what’s the link?

‘In England, for example, we have sent guns and things to people that have been used, and we’re responsible? Doesn’t sound right does it?’

Two Maxes - Chilton, of Marussia, and Verstappen, who is destined to race for Toro Rosso next year aged 17 - also left their marks on the day.

As of Thursday night Chilton, a British racer who pays for his drive, was due to step aside for this race. It appeared his funding had got clogged up. Yet, mysteriously, he was reinstated on Friday morning. Why the U-turn? ‘I can’t tell you,’ was the gist of Chilton’s non-explanation, ‘but it’s not what you think.’

So what did we think it was, we asked? ‘I’m not saying,’ he said. How absurd can you get?

As for Verstappen, the son of the former Dutch F1 driver Jos Verstappen, he was unflappable when he appeared in front of the media for the first time. He revealed that he has not completed his schooling yet and will fit lessons and exams around his racing schedule.

‘Excuse me, sir,’ one imagined he might say come next May, ‘but can I leave class early - I’ve got to race in the Monaco Grand Prix?’
