Five million of the country's pensioners will be hit by an 'outrageous' £3billion 'Granny Tax' hidden in today's Budget.

The Chancellor announced that he will phase out the higher income tax allowance enjoyed by around half the country's pensioners, already struggling with record-low interest rates on their savings.

From next year, people turning 65 will no longer qualify for the higher rate of £10,500-a-year.

Instead, they will qualify for just a standard income tax allowance which was raised today to £9,205.

The raid on Britain’s pensioners, worth £3.3bn over the next five years represents the biggest money spinner for the Treasury from the Budget - and removes an old age tax relief that has been built into our system since 1925 - when the then Chancellor Winston Churchill introduced it.

Individuals affected will pay an extra £260-a-year extra in tax more than they would have done.

The backlash against Mr Osborne’s plans to penalise millions of pensioners was gaining force this afternoon with ‘Granny Tax’ currently the most trending subject in the world on Twitter.

Age charities united in opposition to the measure.

Dr Ros Altmann, Director-General, Saga said: 'This is an outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners.

'This
Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. Over the next
five years, pensioners with an income of between £10,000 and £24,000 
will be paying an extra £3 billion in tax while richer pensioners are 
left unaffected.

'There is nothing in this Budget for savers, 
there is nothing to improve the annuity market, nothing to appease the 
damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support ISA changes and 
shelter older people’s money in cash. This Budget is terrible news for 
pensioners.

'It is good to hear that we will be able to harness
the power of pension funds to improve UK Infrastructure but in short, 
this Budget is another shocking example of the Government’s attack on 
poorer and older people. It is dramatically unfair.'

The Treasury have calculated the measures will raise £1billion a year by 2015 rising to £1.25 billion by 2016.

In total, the so-called ‘simplification’ measures will cost pensioners £3.3billion over the next five years.

Mr Osborne insisted that no pensioners will lose out in cash terms and that the move would help simplify the system.

However, Labour leader Ed Miliband said it amounted to a ‘hidden tax’ rise on millions of pensioners.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander claimed the move would result in a ‘fairer’ and ‘simpler’ tax system.

He insisted: ‘There will be no cash losers.’

But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘The decision to freeze the age related personal tax allowances effectively means around five million pensioner tax payers will no longer get additional reductions in their tax over the coming years – whilst those on the top rate of tax will see their bills reduced.

‘Many older people will feel they are being asked to forego their reduction in tax to help out the super rich. There’s no fairness in that.’

Mike Warburton of accountants Grant Thornton said: ‘The Chancellor is allowing age allowances to wither on the vine. He is effectively phasing them out but there is always a price to pay for simplicity.’

Mr Osborne said the move to scrap age-related personal allowances was the result of a recommendation from the Office for Tax Simplification which said 150,000 pensioners every year must fill out self-assessment tax returns due to the separate allowances.

Mr Osborne also confirmed that the government will introduce a single-tier state pension above the level of means-tests at an estimated £140.

The new system will be introduced 'early in the next Parliament' with final decisions to be made by the next spending review.

The new system will provide a flat level of support, which is greater than the amount people currently receive through the basic state pension and means-tested pension credit.

It will still be based on contributions and will not cost more than the current system. The reforms will not apply to today's pensioners and are likely to take years to come into effect.

TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'The Chancellor's decision to raise more than £1 billion extra in tax from pensioners by freezing age allowances will come back to haunt him. It's already being dubbed "the granny tax".

'Pretending that pensioners will be grateful because it will simplify their tax is a vain hope. Instead they will see that they are being asked to pay more while the super-rich have kept all the pensions tax relief - a heavy burden for ordinary taxpayers.

'And with ever more increases in the state pension age threatened in a new White Paper - a burden that falls more heavily on the poor, the regions and those with manual jobs - older workers and pensioners are paying a heavy price for a pro-rich Budget.'
