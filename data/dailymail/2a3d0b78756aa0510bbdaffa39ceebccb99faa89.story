Odell Beckham Jr makes stunning touchdown catch for New York Giants against Dallas Cowboys 

The New England Patriots continued their dominant winning streak as they thrashed the Detroit Lions on Sunday to strengthen their hold on the No 1 seeding in the AFC.

Tom Brady threw for 349 yards and two touchdowns as the Patriots tore apart the league's tightest defence in a 34-9 victory for their seventh straight win.

It was a third consecutive win against a divisional leader for New England as they moved to 9-2.

For the second straight game, Detroit failed to score a touchdown, and they surrendered their NFC North lead to the Green Bay Packers.

Eddie Lacy rushed for a season-high 125 yards as Green Bay held on to beat the Minnesota Vikings 24-21.

Lacy scored twice, on a run in the first quarter and a catch in the fourth, and then secured two vital first downs late in to run down the final 3:23 on the clock.

Rodgers threw two touchdown passes and again avoided a turnover for the Packers, who moved to 8-3 ahead of their showdown against the Patriots next Sunday.

In the late game on Sunday, Tony Romo threw two touchdown passes to Dez Bryant, the winner from 13 yards with 1:01 remaining, to lift the Dallas Cowboys to a 31-28 victory over the New York Giants.

Romo threw for two TDs in the third quarter. But the Giants (3-8), trailing 24-21, staged a 93-yard drive capped by Adrien Robinson's first career TD catch, from one yard with three minutes left.

Back came Dallas on an 80-yard march in which Romo never was pressured. He found Bryant in the back of the end zone to win it, setting up an NFC East showdown with Philadelphia on Thanksgiving Day for first place.

Both Dallas and Philadelphia hold 8-3 records in the NFC East ahead of that crunch meeting in Arlington on Thursday.

Josh Huff returned the opening kick-off 107 yards and LeSean McCoy ran for 130 yards as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Tennessee Titans.

Mark Sanchez threw for 307 yards and one touchdown in his third start for the injured Nick Foles. He has 300 yards passing in three straight games, tying a team record.

Elsewhere, Peyton Manning threw three of his four TD passes to Demaryius Thomas and CJ Anderson ran for 167 yards as the Denver Broncos got back to winning ways against the Miami Dolphins.

Anderson's 10-yard run with 5:01 left gave the Broncos (8-3) their first lead of the game at 32-28. TJ Ward's 37-yard interception return of Ryan Tannehill's pass set up Wes Welker's insurance TD catch.

The Broncos needed it after Tannehill drove the Dolphins (6-5) on another scoring drive, hitting Jarvis Landry from a yard out with 1:34 left. Lamar Miller's 2-point dive made it a 3-point game.

Manning became the third player in NFL history with touchdown passes in 50 consecutive games, joining Drew Brees (54) and Tom Brady (52). He completed 28 of 35 passes for 257 yards and no interceptions on a cool Colorado evening.

In the NFC West, the Seattle Seahawks clawed their way back into contention with a 19-3 victory over division leaders Arizona.

Seattle moved to 7-4, two games behind Arizona, alongside the San Francisco 49ers.

The 49ers beat the Washington Redskins 17-13 in Santa Clara, helped by a Carlos Hyde touchdown with 2:59 remaining.
