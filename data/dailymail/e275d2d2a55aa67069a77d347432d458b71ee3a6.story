The A&E unit at the birthplace of the NHS will be axed, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt confirmed today

The A&E unit at the birthplace of the NHS will be axed, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt confirmed today.

Campaigners have fiercely opposed the closure of the A&E unit at Trafford General Hospital in Manchester.

But following a review of the plan, Mr Hunt confirmed that the closure can go ahead - provided that nearby A&E departments consistently meet national waiting time targets.

Last week celebrations were held at the 
hospital to mark the 65th anniversary of the NHS. Trafford General is 
known as the birthplace of the health service as it treated the first 
NHS patient in 1948.

But health bosses said the hospital has the 
second smallest A&E department in the country, with an average of 
six to 12 people using the service between midnight and 8am.

At its busiest hour on an average day the unit is only treating seven people.

The minister told the House of Commons that changes are 'necessary to provide safe and sustainable healthcare in the North West'.

Health bosses in the region said the way services are delivered in Trafford and Manchester needs to be fundamentally resigned.

The plans involve the removal of A&E services at Trafford General between midnight and 8am, and for the rest of the time the unit will be downgraded to an urgent care centre. It will eventually be downgraded to a minor injuries unit.

Emergency surgery will no longer be provided at the site and the intensive care unit will shut.

Campaign group Save Trafford General has said the move makes 'no sense'.

Local councillors also appealed to Mr
Hunt to review the decision, saying they were concerned the plans were 
'principally financially motivated' and could put pressure on other 
hospital sites.

Mr Hunt referred the matter to the independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP), which concluded that the 'clinical case for change is clear', MPs heard.

The New Health Deal for Trafford, the consultation document outlining the changes, says most patients with life-threatening illnesses or injuries are taken directly to Salford Royal Hospital, Wythenshawe Hospital or Manchester Royal Infirmary.

It also says some services at the hospital are 'not clinically sustainable' and could 'become unsafe in the future'.

It says that a safe intensive care unit needs to treat a minimum of 200 patients each year, but Trafford General Hospital only admitted 93 patients for intensive care in 2010/11.Â
