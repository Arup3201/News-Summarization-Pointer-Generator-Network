Claims: Paul Gascoigne (pictured at court last month) reportedly blew £4,000 on football bets in one session

Paul Gascoigne reportedly spent £4,000 in only a few hours during a drunken betting spree.

Witnesses said they saw the troubled England legend dropping bundles of £20 notes at a bookmakers following a two-day drinking bender.

Staff at the Coral shop in Boscombe, near his Bournemouth flat, eventually had him ejected, according to reports.

Gascoigne, 46, was with a number of apparently drunk friends during the session on Wednesday.

One member of staff even warned workers at a BetFred shop over the road about the former footballer's state in case he tried to continue gambling there.

An onlooker told the Daily Star Sunday Gascoigne was 'swaying' and a worker behind the counter said he had spent thousands.

He said: 'He is known as a legend, especially around here. But things are going too far now.

'He was surrounded by his entourage of drunken hangers-on, which was no surprise but God knows where he is getting all that cash from.'

The former Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur and Lazio star Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for many years and was sent to rehab in America in February.

The £100,000 stay was organised and paid for by his host of famous friends including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani.

The move came following a charity appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Battle: The England legend has battled alcoholism for years and was treated in rehab in February

This apparent setback comes after he has been seen looking healthier in recent months.

This month he was pictured shirtless cleaning the windows of his flat in Bournemouth.

However, last week he was seen drinking on his balcony, according to the Daily Star Sunday.

Gascoigne was arrested after police were called to Stevenage station in Hertfordshire at around 10.30pm on July 4.

Last month, he was fined £600 for one charge of assault and £400 for a drunk and disorderly charge.

His solicitor told magistrates he was making progress during one-to-one session at a rehabilitation centre near his home.

Mail Online has attempted to contact Gascoigne's representative.
