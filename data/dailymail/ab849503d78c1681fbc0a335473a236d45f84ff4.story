At the end, Grigor Dimitrov fell to his knees. For most of the five sets he played against Alexandr Dolgopolov on Friday night, the 11th seed looked like he was down on them and crawling home.

It was ropey and inconsistent, rough and erratic. In short, it was not the graceful tennis  typically associated with a player known as Baby Fed and considered to be the ‘best of the rest’ in men’s tennis.

But he came through, scrapping for a 6-7, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1  victory that carries him into the fourth round here for the first time.

Good game: Dimitrov battled for five sets with Alexandr Dolgopolov before emerging victorious

The 23-year-old had his share of luck along the way, at one stage drawing an animated flapping of the arms from Dolgopolov after his fourth favourable net cord in a matter of minutes.

Ultimately it was his superior nerve that made the difference, not to mention the fitness that has come since he linked up with coach Roger Rasheed last October.

He was out of sorts in the first set, which Dolgopolov took on a tiebreak, and continued to struggle to find his range as he levelled in the second.

‘The Dog’, gifted but temperamental, took the third before Dimitrov found his reserves of extra strength. He broke in the ninth game of the fourth 
and the Ukrainian’s spirit vanished, as the 25-year-old coughed up three
 breaks in a 20-minute fifth set.

Dimitrov said: ‘Alex is a great competitor, especially on grass. He started pressuring me from the start with great serves.

‘I couldn’t do much in the first set but I got my act together and in the end I was just too strong.

‘I have put in a lot of work and I knew nothing would go to waste. I really wanted it. I knew that even though I was not at my level, I had the fuel. I am into the second week so let’s see what happens.’

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, can finally have a day off. The No 14 seed played from Monday through to Friday because of two five-set matches suspended overnight for bad light and rain — so he could do with a breather.

A 6-2, 6-2, 7-5 victory over qualifier Jimmy Wang from Taiwan elicited his trademark twirl of celebration and permits him the opportunity of a weekend’s rest.  

In action: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has played on every day of Wimbledon so far

He will probably need it, because up next comes Novak Djokovic, the man who has done most to deprive Tsonga of a Grand Slam title.

Their maiden meeting came in the Australian Open final of 2008, when Djokovic broke his major duck. No sooner had Tsonga delighted SW19 with his celebration dance after defeating Roger Federer in the quarter-finals three years ago, than the Serbian snuffed out his joy, winning their semi-final on route to the title.

Tsonga has promised to dance again if he beats Djokovic on Monday. But he is 29-years-old, and even though cracks are appearing in the Big Four’s dominance, the chances for Tsonga to make that ultimate breakthrough are becoming slimmer.

Almost: Lleyton Hewitt battled back from two sets down but fell to Jerzy Janowicz in the fifth

The Frenchman said he would draw on his victory over Federer here in 2011, which required a comeback from two sets down.

‘I will use this whole match to remember in which mind I was and try to do the same,’ he said. ‘Of course, for me the goal will be to make my dance at the end.’

Lleyton Hewitt looked like he might stage an overnight comeback from two sets down against 15th seed Jerzy Janowicz. The Aussie saved two match points in the third-set tiebreak but ran out of steam in the decider.  Janowicz will meet 23rd seed Tommy Robredo today.

Elsewhere, 20th seed Kevin Anderson beat 16th seed Fabio Fognini in another five-setter, with the erratic Italian appearing to give up in the final set.
