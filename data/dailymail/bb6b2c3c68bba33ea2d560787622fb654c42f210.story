A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'.

Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour.

She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear.

They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly.

Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children.

Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims 

Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly

She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman.

Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month.

She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes.

'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' 

She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on.

'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life.

'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 

'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.'

Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. 

Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29.

The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss.

It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people.

At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse.

Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. 

When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse

Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. 

The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people.

HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. 

Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. 

However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting).

People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. 

These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages.

What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. 

Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. 

These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. 

They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine.

Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 

'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was.

'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while.

'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode.

'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.'

Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home.

She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes.

'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers.

'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' 

She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly.

'When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. 

'When my son sees me laughing he says "Mummy's having one of her turns," and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened.

'It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. 

'I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mother having seizures multiple times a day.

'My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage.

'To him, it must be like living with three children.

'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.'

Because of the debilitating condition, Mrs Lyon also struggles to hold down a job.

The seizures often leave Mrs Lyon incontinent, and she says they are dangerous. Once she had a seizure and got onto a bus and when she 'woke up' she had no idea where she was. She is pictured undergoing tests in hospital with Vivian Gattoc, who founded the Hope for Hypothalamic Hamartoma charity

For a brief period she was employed at a supermarket but left after one of her episodes.

She said: 'I have no idea what happened but I could tell my colleagues were scared by me afterwards.'

Mrs Lyon's rare condition can be treated using keyhole surgery to destroy the tumor. 

But the procedure is currently only available in the United States and costs £95,000.

Mrs Lyon said: 'I'm desperate to find a way to beat this tumour. 

'It would mean the world to me if I could just take my kids to the park without needing constant supervision.

'I'm trying to raise money for the expensive procedure in America – one day, I'll beat this and be seizure free.'
