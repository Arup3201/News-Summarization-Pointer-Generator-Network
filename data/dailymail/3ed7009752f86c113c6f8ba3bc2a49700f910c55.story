A 33-year-old man who fled from police in a boat following an alleged domestic dispute attempted to use a baby as a human shield when he was finally captured.

Child endangerment: Ryan David Krueger, 33, was arrested following a boat chase that put his nine-month-old child in serious danger

The dramatic boat chase, which lasted over 15 minutes, unfolded on Lake Minnetonka in Minnesota over Fourth of July weekend.

Ryan David Krueger was finally arrested, but not before holding up his nine-month-old baby in an attempt to stop police pepper spraying him.

The incident started about 8.30pm on Crystal Bay, where police were called following reports of a domestic dispute and a female falling overboard, according to KMSP.

A woman had been seen in the bay, with a boat erratically circling her in the water.

The lake has a 'no wake' law, so the situation was in violation of the high water declaration.

When officers with the water police approached the boat, they found a baby with no life jacket sitting in Krueger’s lap.

The child’s mother, Jamie Schneeweis, had jumped out of the boat to get away from Krueger.

Both parents appeared drunk, police said.

As Schneeweis spoke to police, Krueger started to slowly pull away in his boat.
