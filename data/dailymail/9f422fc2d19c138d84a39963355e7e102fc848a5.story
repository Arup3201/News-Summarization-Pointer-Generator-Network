A 21-year-old man has been hospitalized after catching fire on top of a New York City-bound commuter train in Connecticut.

Brian McClellen, an avid skateboarding stuntman, was found ablaze on the roof of the Metro-North service shortly after 5am on Sunday in Greenwich.

It has been suggested he was attempting a skating trick when an electrical wire fell on him and he became engulfed in flames, causing the train to lose power.

Crew members who went to investigate the fault rushed to douse McClellen with a fire extinguisher before paramedics took him to the burn unit at Westchester Medical Center, where he was still being treated on Sunday night. 

'He is conscious and holding on. [His mother] is there now,' a relative wrote on Facebook at around 10pm ET.

The North Royalton High School graduate who grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, describes himself on social media as an actor and a model based in New York City.

His YouTube channel features numerous skateboarding stunts over buildings and railings. 

The train was meant to arrive at New York's Grand Central Station at 6.19 am. 

A Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman said McClellen was electrocuted and burned as the train entered Riverside station and he was hit by a pantograph, a mechanical arm on top of the train that collects power from the overhead wires.

Investigation: MTA police are now investigating how McClellen, an avid skateboarder, got on top of the train 

It is possible there was an explosion before he caught fire, MTA police said. 

His condition is unclear but he is believed to be alive.

MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan says MTA police are investigating how McClellen got on top of the train and why. 

The 20 passengers aboard the service were escorted off and directed onto another train toward New York.

According to News 12 Connecticut, the train was taken back to Stamford station for inspection.
