Ross Barkley has spoken of his dream of succeeding where hero David Beckham failed by lifting a trophy with England.

The Everton midfielder revealed his first memory of international football was watching Beckham fire in the late free-kick against Greece to qualify England for the 2002 World Cup.

Barkley, 20, is back in Roy Hodgson's squad after recovering from a knee injury and is aiming to become a regular in time for Euro 2016.

But the ultimate ambition is to win a major competition. 'To lift a trophy for England,' he said. 'To win something – because that's what every player wants to do. It would be a dream come true if that happened.' 

Barkley, who has won nine caps already, maintained he is keeping a level head despite praise from the likes of Barcelona maestro Xavi, who said he could easily grace the Nou Camp in future years.

Wayne Rooney, who like Barkley burst onto the scene as a teenager at Everton, has been providing words of advice and encouragement – especially on how to cope with the pressures of high expectation.

'He's been helpful to me and the other youngsters like Raheem (Sterling) and Luke Shaw,' said Barkley. 'He's always been there for a bit of guidance and to pass his experience on to us. He gives some good advice to us.

'He's just said he coped with (the pressure) easily, it just came naturally to him. That's the way I look at it, I don't want to get big-headed, I just take it as it comes.

'There are still loads of pictures of Wayne at the Everton Academy, and memorabilia of him when he was at the club. There are clips of him down in the video room.

'When I was younger I saw Wayne breaking through at 16, scoring cracking goals. Then for him to go and make his England debut, while he was still at Everton, was good to see. He's gone on and had a tremendous career and I've always looked up to him.

'I've always had my feet on the ground and I've never forgotten where I come from. It's great be compared to Paul Scholes and the Wayne Rooneys of this world. But I'm just focused on being myself and playing my own game and hopefully getting better.

'I haven't really felt any expectation. I just focus on getting better and doing things right on the pitch. Everything else takes care of itself.'

Barkley appeared in all three of England's World Cup games in Brazil and was one of the few to leave with his reputation enhanced.

'I found the World Cup experience really good for me,' he added. 'Obviously we didn't do the best. But for me and the other younger lads it was good for us to get a game. Hopefully in the future we will get plenty more World Cups under our belt.' 

'It's really exciting because we've got a good mixture of young lads and the experienced lads like Bainesy and Wayne and Phil Jagielka.

'At the moment I've just got to try and get into the team and I've got to do well with my club. I've got to do everything right off the field and hopefully everything else will take care of itself.' 

Illustrating his age when asked for his earliest England memory he said: 'It's got to be that David Beckham free kick against Greece. It was a great moment at the time and I was celebrating on the couch. At that moment I really wanted to play for England.'
