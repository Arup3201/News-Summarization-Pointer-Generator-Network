Detectives investigating the disappearance of a mother-of-two have found a body in a car after she went missing in the early hours after attending a New Year's Eve family party.

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of her murder after Janelle Duncan-Bailey went missing in the early hours of January 2.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers attended Mayfield Crescent, Thornton Heath this afternoon following intelligence received. The body of a woman was found in a vehicle parked there.

Janelle Duncan-Bailey, 25, of Thornton Heath was last seen between 5am and 5.30am on Wednesday, January 2

'While formal identification awaits, we 
are confident the deceased is Janelle Duncan-Bailey, 25, of Thornton 
Heath, Croydon. Next of kin have been informed.

'A post mortem will be scheduled in due course.'

Ms Duncan-Bailey, of Thornton Heath, Croydon, was last seen between 5am and 5.30am on January 2.

She had made arrangements to leave her two children with a friend in Bromley whilst she attended a family function.

She left her friend's address at around 4am on 2 January to return to Thornton Heath.

Her friend believed Janelle would collect the two-year-old and seven-year-old boys later that morning.

However, her friend reported Janelle missing at 4.22am on January 2 when she had failed to collect the children.

The mother was last seen walking down Limpsfield Avenue, in Thornton Heath before she disappeared

At around 4.30am Janelle had visited her former partner's home in Thornton Heath on January 2.

Police were called following a report of a domestic incident and Janelle agreed to leave the address with police.

It is believed she asked to be taken to another friend's address in Thornton Heath.

She was last seen walking towards flats in Limpsfield Avenue, and was wearing a distinctive short-sleeved leopard-skin print dress - she was also not wearing any shoes at the time.

Detective Chief Inspector Charles King of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command leads the investigation and is appealing for witnesses who may have seen Janelle.

He said: 'I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the Limpsfield Avenue area between 05.00hrs and 06.00hrs to make contact with us.

'Lots of people would have been out and about at that time of the morning, either on their way to work or walking dogs - they may have noticed a woman dressed so distinctively.

'Did you see a black woman around that time wearing a leopard-skin print dress and no shoes? If so, we want to hear from you.'

Last night, a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody.

Janelle has never been missing before and her disappearance is totally out of character.

She is described as a black woman, 5' 5" in height, of medium build and with shoulder length black hair which could possibly be enhanced with hair extensions.

Police are urging anyone who knows of Janelle's whereabouts or has information that may assist the police investigation to contact officers.

Anyone who can assist is asked to call detectives from the Specialist Crime Directorate based at Sutton police station on 020 8721 4054. To remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
