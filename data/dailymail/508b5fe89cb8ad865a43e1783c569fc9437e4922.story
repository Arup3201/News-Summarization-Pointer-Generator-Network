A UKIP candidate is facing calls to resign after claiming the solution to crime in Britain is sharia law and thieves should have their hands cut off.

Self-employed builder and UKIP activist Dean Perks, prospective candidate for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, shocked supporters at a rally when he suggested the brutal punishment as a legitimate way to tackle crime. 

Mr Perks is due to stand for the party at the next general election but leader Nigel Farage is now facing a barrage of calls to get rid of him.

Controversial: Dean Perks, pictured on a video from his YouTube channel, is facing calls to resign after claiming sharia law works at preventing crime

Speaking at a meeting with supporters in Coventry, West Midlands, earlier this year Mr Perks made the shocking claims.

He said: 'In my opinion, sharia law works as a prevention - and prevention is better than cure.

'If you think you are going to get your hand chopped off for pinching something, you won't pinch it.

'I recently had a conversation with someone who asked what I thought of Sharia law.

'I said: "Well in all honesty, I do agree with part - but by no means all - of sharia law". That's my view - my opinion. I ain't going to defend myself. I do agree with it.

'Sharia law, in my opinion, works as a prevention.'

The potential candidate is no stranger to controversy, earlier this year he faced a backlash when he praised the Enoch Powell, claiming he was 'well liked in the Asian community' and labelling him 'a visionary'.

He was also forced to admit calling someone 'retarded' via social network Twitter.

The controversies were a far cry from a statement he gave on launching his campaign, claiming he would never bad mouth other candidates.

In launching his campaign for the hotly contested Halesowen and Rowley Regis seat, Mr Perks said: 'I hope to show people a new type of politician.

'It is not my intention to bad mouth or attack any other candidates as I believe we should all be in the running for the same purpose.'

However on he was involved in the ugly Twitter spat which resulted him writing: 'I just asked the question but he will not answer, I think he may be retarded.'

This followed on from an argument with Labour councillor Dave Branwood who asked Mr Perks whether he thought Enoch Powell, whose 1968 Rivers of Blood speech caused his own downfall, was racist.

Mr Perks replied: 'No. It's a fact he was very well liked amongst the Asian community. I'd say he was a visionary.'

This led to anti-facist, left wing politicians, including Dudley North Ian Austin MP and several other outraged Twitter users to round on Mr Perks calling him racist.

However, Mr Perks, denied he is racist.

While Mr Perks admits he believes sharia law works, he insisted he was against it being introduced in the UK

He said: 'I have never studied Enoch Powell. I'm not racist because I'm not afraid to have an opinion. I have a Muslim godson, a Sikh brother-in-law and three mixed race cousins.'

Now he is facing more calls to resign from MPs. John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley, said the comments were typical of the party.

He said: 'Once again this shows the bizarre sort of candidate that UKIP is attracting.

'People from all communities will be astonished and appalled that Mr Perks want to bring such barbarity into Britain.'

'The real question is how did he ever get to be a candidate in the first place. I challenge Nigel Farage to throw him out immediately.'

Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: 'Sharia law can only be applied in Muslim states.

'There is no way sharia law could be introduced in the UK and Muslims who live in countries where there isn't a predominance of Muslims, like here, follow the law of the land.

'Mr Perks seems to be very confused, you can't pick and chose with sharia law, you either believe in all of it, or none of it'

Mr Perks did not make clear which parts of sharia law he agrees and disagrees with and could not be contacted for comment yesterday.

But on his Twitter page he insisted he is 'against sharia law in the UK'.

Prospective candidate for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, Dean Perks, is hardly the first UKIP candidate to come under fire for his controversial views...

UKIP candidate Alex Wood is pictured apparently 
making a Nazi salute (left) and clenching a knife between his teeth 
(left). He said he was reaching for a camera and denies being a racist

Somerset candidate Alex Wood 
was suspended from the party pending a police investigation into a 
series of allegedly racist postings on his Facebook page.

In
one picture he was photographed apparently making a Nazi salute 
although he said: 'The supposed wrong hand salute is actually me 
grabbing after a friend's phone.' In another image, he was pictured in 
front of a Union flag holding a dagger between his teeth.

He said: '‘I am completely against the Nazi beliefs, I am a democratic libertarian.’

Rob
Fraser, a former Tory councillor before becoming a Ukip candidate in Leicestershire, 
is no stranger to racist controversy having already been investigated 
twice in the past three years.

One
was for using the phrase ‘n***** in the woodpile’ and the second for 
saying Romanian travellers would ‘stick a knife in you as soon as they 
look at you’.

He was 
suspended for a month in 2009 and sent for ‘intensive’ diversity 
classes. He said at the time: ‘I regret using the phrase but I wasn’t 
using it in a racist manner...You have to be so careful what you say 
these days but I can’t stop being me.’

Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile to a Halloween party

This year's Hampshire
candidate Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile 
to a Halloween party last year. A photo was posted online.

He told The Sun: 'It was meant as a harmless joke. I'm in no way endorsing Savile — what he did was disgusting.'

UKIP candidate Richard Delingpole was forced to defend posting online this picture of himself standing next to Adolf Hitler

Richard Delingpole, 46, stood for UKIP in Blackmore Vale, Somerset, earlier this year. He posted a photo mock-up
on Facebook of himself stood next to Adolf Hitler.  Opponents said the 
stunt was ‘shocking and abhorrent’ but he said it was a joke to 
highlight how Tories were trawling social media accounts to embarrass 
UKIP candidates.

He said: ‘It's clearly a picture I have Photoshopped, it shows we've got a sense of humour.’

Chris
Scotton, another candidate in Leicestershire this year, was exposed as an activist
for the far-right English Defence League, which has been linked to 
violent demonstration in Leicester and elsewhere.

The 24-year-old was suspended by ULIP for expressing his support for the group on Facebook in 2010.

He
also ‘liked’ a site called ‘I hate [it] when I lose my black friend in 
the dark’, dismissed racism as ‘just ethnic banter’ and ‘liked’ a number
of sexist pages on Facebook, including one which derides ‘fat slags’.

John Sullivan posted these comments online where he appeared to suggest physical exercise 'released boys tensions and thus avoided homo-sexuality'

John
Sullivan, a candidate in Gloucestershire, was investigated for 
homophobia, after apparently claiming on Facebook that regular exercise 
in schools can prevent children becoming gay.

In
comments which have since been removed, claimed regular exercise for 
children ‘released tension and thus avoided homosexuality’, according to
a website. He also said supporters of gay marriages were ‘termites’, 
and congratulated Russia for banning gay pride marches. He is still 
standing for election.

UKIP candidate Anna-Marie Crampton (left) posed with party leader Nigel Farage but was suspended for online comments about the Holocaust

Anna-Marie Crampton, 
who represented the party in East Sussex, was suspended after claiming that 
the Holocaust was caused by the Jews.

Web
comments made in her name in February said: 'The Second World Wide War 
was engineered by the Zionist Jews and financed by the banksters’.

And
went on: ‘It was thanks to them that six million Jews were murdered in 
the war along with 26 million Russians’. She claimed her account had 
been hacked.

She was suspended pending an 
investigation.

But she still wrote a song urging people to vote for UKIP. She said: 'I still 
endorse UKIP they are the way forward. I am not the only member that has
been the victim of a dirty tricks campaign.'

Ken
Bell, a candidate for Pendle Central in Lancashire, attracted 
attention for his unsavoury views since joining Twitter earlier this 
year, at one point describing Margaret Thatcher as ‘an old w****’, and 
declaring his admiration for Joseph Stalin.

Mr
Bell, who trumpets the fact his wife is from Mexico in campaign 
literature and describes himself as a socialist and ex-Labour member, 
has been accused of ridiculing the disabled, being homophobic and making
lewd attacks on political opponents. He said he had ‘no regrets’ but 
has now stood down.

Zoe
Philpson, who ran for Northumberland County Council, listed her 
activities on Facebook as a ‘general hatred for most humans’.

She
has also ‘liked’ comments such as ‘God made every person different then
he got to china and thought F**K IT’ and ‘Two chavs jump off a cliff. 
Who wins?...society.’
