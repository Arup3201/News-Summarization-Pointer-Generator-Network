A homewares shop that has not changed since it opened in 1895 has closed down after being beaten by ‘the modern age’.

The Period House Shop in Warwick, Warwickshire has incredibly survived through six different monarchs, two World Wars and rationing only to be forced to close its doors because of the recession and the popularity of internet shopping.

The shop has traded six days a week since it opened but on October 18 it will shut its doors for the last time.

Closing after 115 years: Shop manager Charlie Collett blames 'the modern age' for forcing him to close The Period House Shop which opened in 1895

Still with original shop bell, the old-worldly shop has sold polish, door knockers, old-fashioned lights and tradition ceiling roses from a Grade II listed building that dates back to the 1840s.

Staff still wear the same brown leather waistcoat uniforms as the original staff.

Charlie Collett, 50, who has managed the shop for 20 years, blamed the ‘modern age’ for the shop’s closure.

Original: The shop has not changed since it opened and staff still wear the original uniforms. The shop is located far right in this picture from the 1910s

To close its doors: The shop will close for the last time on October 18 after trading six days a week

He said: ‘While our stock is made in the company’s own brass foundry or fashioned by our blacksmith, most of the shop fittings haven’t changed since 1895.

‘We are closing because it seems to us all the shopping happens in nearby Leamington and the council keeps digging up the roads.

‘Sadly the modern age has finally caught up with us and we can no longer compete with modern shopping methods.’

No change: The shop's stock comes from the company's own brass foundry and most of the shop's fittings have not changed since 1895

Astonishing history: The old-worldly shop sells various homewares but Mr
Collett says 'we can no longer compete with modern shopping methods'

Old-worldy: Stock is fashioned by the company's blacksmith in what Mr Collett said was the 'best preserved Victorian shop' he has ever seen

Mr Collett bought the Victorian shop after the previous owner tried to modernise the business.

He said: ‘I fell in love with the shop the moment I saw it. 

‘Some people say this place looks a bit like that shop used in the Two Ronnies’ television sketch where Ronnie Barker is trying to buy four candles.

‘The old owner came to me and offered to sell me the fittings as they wanted to turn it into a modern shop.

‘When I arrived there I just said “you cannot do this” it was the best preserved Victorian shop I have ever seen.

‘I didn’t do any market research, I just said I’ll take the lease and leave it just the way it is there and then.

Town in decline: Blaming the recession for the shop's bad business, Mr Collett said the town of Warwick has struggled since nearby 
Leamington became a spa town, making it a more popular destination

But Mr Collett said the town of Warwick had struggled for a very long time.

‘In recent years the Warwick business has dwindled and we are now only taking about a third of what we need to take.

‘Warwick has been in decline since the 1820s to be honest, ever since Leamington became a spa town and it became more fashionable to shop there.

‘It kills me to shut down the Warwick shop, but I just cannot keep it open any longer.’

The three storey building was first opened for business as an iron mongers in 1840.

There are various businesses in the UK which have an astonishingly long history including butcher's shop RJ Balson and Sons in Bridport, Dorset which opened in 1535.

Bakers Wine Merchants in Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire was forced to close last year because of the threat of a new supermarket and high rent. It opened in 1671.

Modern methods: Selling old-fashioned tools and homewares has meant that the historic shop could not survive

Fork handles or four candles: The shop has been likened to the hardware shop used in the Two Ronnies for the hilarious skit where Ronnie Barker tries to buy four candles
