Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle want state delegate Joe Morrissey to resign but he may commute to work soon from jail as part of a work-release program.

Morrissey began serving a six-month jail sentence on Friday after accepting a plea deal in a criminal case that could have sent him to prison for 41 years.

Prosecutors said he engaged in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female office assistant, who is now pregnant, and sent a naked photo of her to a friend.

Part of the evidence against him, which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in July, was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third-party, reading: 'OMG, I just f***ed my boss.'

He claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24-year-old female named Brittany McKinney who grew jealous after the now-18-year-old college freshman rejected her lesbian advances.

HANDS UP, DON'T JUDGE: Joe Morrissey, a Democratic state lawmaker in Virginia, said Sunday that he doesn't know it he will resign or commute from jail during his sentence related to an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl

MUG SHOT: Morrissey has been in and out of jail for decades, in between suspensions and revocations of his law license

No one seems to want Morrissey to stick around in state government, but he's been politically battered by scandals of his own making before.

The 57-year-old has seen his law license suspended and revoked, has paid a $500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999, lost a job teaching law in Australia for hiding his disbarment, and earned his nickname – 'Fightin' Joe' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991.

And the noted gun-control advocate brandished an AK-47 rifle during a 2013 debate in the Richmond, Virginia statehouse. 

That brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an Uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned Morrissey, then a prosecutor, for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence.

All that was before he police found him and a teenage girl at his townhouse. 

Special prosecutor William Neely told the Richmond Times-Dispatch at the time that Morrissey 'had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.'  

Morrissey, who has three daughters including a toddler with three different women, faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor, possession of pornographic images of an underage female, and solicitation to obtain the images.

The young woman, now 18 and pregnant, has been identified publicly by Morrissey only as 'Kayla.'

She had been on the job as an assistant in Morrissey's office for less than two weeks, court records show, when he began taking her with him to official events.

Both Morrissey and the younger girl denied engaging in sex, and her mother and grandmother both backed her up.

At the time he was charged with the felonies, Morrissey vowed that there was 'not a snowball’s chance in hell' that he would resign his House of Delegates seat.

That hasn't changed, even though he sits in a county jail. 

Morrissey entered what's known as an Alford plea on Friday, acknowledging that the government had sufficient evidence to convict him of a single misdemeanor charge. He did not admit any specific wrongdoing.

His 6-month sentence will likely be over in just 90 days if he maintains good behavior behind bars.

And a judge has approved a work-release arrangement that would allow him to leave the jail with an ankle-monitor in order to perform his official duties for 10 hours each day.

 

Some of Morrissey's colleagues are howling.

Republican Delegate Gregory Habeeb tweeted on Friday that 'Joe Morrissey should IMMEDIATELY resign his seat in the House of Delegates and disappear. FOREVER!'

Democrats in the state legislature are more guarded, with one telling the Times-Dispatch that they might pressure him to quit.

Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, however, wants no part of him. On Saturday he called for Morrissey's 'immediate resignation.' 

On Sunday the embattled lawmaker said he's asked his lawyer to examine the Virginia Constitution to see what his options are. He's also planning to sue his accusers, including Special Prosecutor William Neely, who persuaded a Grand Jury to indict him in 2013.

Neely unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of Morrissey's law license in 2011, claiming he 'completely lacks any moral compass' and engaged in 'notoriously unethical practices.'

That opinion came with a litany of evidence.

He landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl, landing in jail. In 1993 the Virginia State Bar Association yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge.

That case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $25,000 to get himself off the hook, and another $25,000 to a list of charities Morrissey chose.

Charges against Morrissey in that case were later dismissed.

NOT SHOOTING STRAIGHT: Morrissey brandished an AK-47 during a floor debate about gun rights, but had earlier admitted losing track of an Uzi that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches

Five years later, his license was suspended a second time after a 90-day stint in jail for contempt of court, for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters. A judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years.

In 1999 Morrissey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor.

According to a legal brief filed by the home contractor's attorneys, Morrissey shouted, 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to beat your head in,' before beating the victim and 'smash(ing) his head into the corner of a brick wall.'

In 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court, which he paid off with a $500,000 check in 2007, The Daily Caller reported.

But Morrissey wasn't as diligent with his community-service sentence: A court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off, and sent him to jail for another 90 days.

The bar association 'disbarred' him for that offense, tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012. 

But meanwhile, Morrissey made headlines for losing his job teaching law in Australia when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the U.S.
