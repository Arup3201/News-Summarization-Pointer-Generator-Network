An Oregon dad of disabled children creates larger than life Halloween costumes for his children and with help from DreamWorks and generous donors, other disabled children can shine too.

Whether he's making a medieval knight or a dragon, Ryan Weimer's unconditional love for his sons Keaton, 9, and Bryce, 2, has lead him to create sensational costumes for his children every year.

Sadly Ryan and his wife Lana Weimer, who live in Keizer, lost two other children to the rare form of muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, the same disease plaguing Keaton and Bryce.

Fire breather: Ryan Weimer started a Kickstarter to create a dragon costume for his son and after raising four times the amount he expected to he is starting a non-profit costume organization for disabled children

Their daughter Addison just days before her third birthday; and a third son, Eston, died at birth.

Ryan has now decided to create a non-profit organization called Magic Wheelchair to design costumes for children with special needs all over the world after quadrupling his fundraising goal on Kickstarter. 

He was also inspired after touring the DreamWorks facility that created the How to Train Your Dragon character that inspired his son's costume.

Ryan had an original Kickstarter goal of $1,500 but when he reached the September 30 mark he raised $6,454 for a costume that later became his cause.

This year Keaton will be Toothless, a character from the How to Train Your Dragon movies.

When looking to design the costume, Ryan Weimer found the Stan Winston School of Character Arts website which shows web visitors how to build their favorite characters.

Their studio is responsible for the characters in Jurassic park and The Terminator.

When the arts school caught wind of his inspiring idea for a costume following media coverage of his story, they invited him to tour the studio and DreamWorks Animation and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment paid for a weeklong vacation in Los Angeles.

'That was absolutely once-in-a-lifetime visit,' Ryan Weimer said of the family's recent trip, which included tours of DreamWorks and classes at the Stan Winston School.

'It was truly amazing for all of us.'

Ryan's costume making for his children began with a simple idea that turned into a huge creative project.

'It's just like the same thing anybody would do for their kids: dress them up for Halloween,' Ryan Weimer told TODAY.com.

Feeling strong: Keaton loves the costumes his father makes him and will shine as Toothless the dragon on Halloween thanks to generous donors on his dad's Kickstarter 

Animal instinct: Ryan Weimer has the creative urge to make costumes like this elephant for his disabled kids 

'For me, it's just what we do, but for other people, it's this really amazing thing,' he added.

Ryan who describes himself as being a 'nerdy nurse with an imagination' first started the creative endeavor in 2008 when he created a wooden pirate ship for his son Keaton to wear.

In 2009 Keaton was a dinosaur, in 2011 he was a Power Ranger, and in 2012 he was a Pokémon character.

'Every year, I ask my son what he wants to be,' Ryan Weimer told Today,

'Immediately, I'm like, Holy crap. How am I going to make that?'

Ryan Weimer said all donations beyond the $4,500 mark will be the basis for a new non-profit organization called Magic Wheelchair.

'I want people to look at my kids, not because they're different, but because they're amazing,' he said.

'And whatever I can do to try to create those opportunities [for other children] is what I want to do. And I'd love for other kids to be able to have that same experience. ... It's just an awesome opportunity for [kids] to be flying around on the dragon of their dreams.'
