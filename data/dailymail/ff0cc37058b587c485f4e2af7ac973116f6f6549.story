Atletico Madrid's comedown from being seconds away from winning last season's Champions League final only to concede in the 90th minute and finish up losing 4-1 will reach a new low on Tuesday night if they go out of this year's tournament at the hands of Bayer Leverkusen.

Coach Diego Simeone is counting on the spirit that got them to last year's showpiece in Lisbon to pull them through and for the Mario Mandzukic Antoine Griezmann parternship that produced 14 goals and eight assists in January and February before hitting something of a wall in March to fire them into the last eight.

If those two fail he will have to call on Fernando Torres who insisted in an interview in El Pais on the eve of the game that he did feel part of Chelsea's Champions League success in 2012.

Atletico Madrid have not been at their best of late, but need to bounce back against Bayer Leverkusen

He said: 'I had made some important contributions. I scored in the semi-final against Barcelona and I come on for the last eight minutes of normal time against Bayern in the final and I think I played my part in the comeback. I am very proud to have won the Champions League.'

He would dearly love to repeat his success for Chelsea with a repeat run to the final for his hometown club but Atletico have given themselves a difficult job after a poor first leg performance that ended with Bayern Leverkusen winning 1-0.

The failure to find an away goal three weeks ago makes them outsiders tonight despite the battle cry from Simeone that there should not even be so much as a minute of quiet in the Vicente Calderon before and during the game.

Simeone has never won a knockout tie after losing the first leg, but must turn that around on Tuesday 

Despite the motivational magic of Atletico's charismatic manager, the Argentine has never over-turned a first leg deficit since he has been at the club.

Under his stewardship Atletico have won 16 of 19 knockout matches but the three times they have suffered first leg defeats they have been eliminated.

The coach's biggest concern will be that in the pusuit of goals they will concede. They have gone five Champions League games without letting in a goal but there are cracks appearing in their defence.

Karim Bellarabi, Hakan Calhanoglu and Son Heung-min will provide a serious test for out of sorts holding midfielder Gabi, veteran right-back Jesus Gamez – filing in at left-back in the absence of any better alternative – and central defensive partnership of Jose Gimenez and Miranda forced on Simeone through Diego Godin's suspension.

Around 1,300 supporters have travelled from Germany to Spain for the game. 'We know they have a strong mentality,' says Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt of Atletico. 'But we have to keep a cool head in what will be a very hot atmosphere.'

The sparks are sure to fly after first leg when Schmidt clashed with Simeone's number two Mono Burgos. 

'Atletico will provoke, bite, scratch and kick us,' Bayer director Michael Schade was quoted as saying in the Madrid press while Marca called for 50,000 Simeones on its front page on Tuesday.

When Atletico Madrid reached the European Cup final in 1974 and lost in a reply to Bayern Munich having been just seconds from winning in the first game before a late equalizer, it took them 40 years to get back to another final. 

They don't want the same fate this time. Tuesday night will be as biggest test as Simeone and his players have faced since winning La Liga last season.
