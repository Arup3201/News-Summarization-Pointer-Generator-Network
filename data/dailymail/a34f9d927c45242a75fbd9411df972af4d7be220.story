A prisoner was brain dead after being restrained at a jail run by 'America's toughest sheriff' Joe Arpaio, according to a senior police officer.

Lieutenant Mike Stauffer, a rival of Arpaio's for county sheriff, wrote on Facebook: 'We received news from an inside source that a Latino inmate at the 4th Avenue Jail is brain dead due to excessive force by detention officers.'

Ernest M. Atencio, a 44-year-old Gulf War veteran, was being booked into the jail in Phoenix, when he was Tasered and suffered a heart attack, his family claimed.

They told local TV station Channel 5 that he was a 'loving and sweet boy' who suffered from a mental illness and is now fighting for his life.

Lt Stauffer also wrote on Facebook that homicide detectives were reviewing video from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO).

Mr Atencio was arrested on assault charges on Friday at around 3am.

Phoenix Police Department spokesman 
Steve Martos told the Phoenix New Times: 'Once he got down to the jail, 
there was some kind of scuffle of some sort.'

Mr Atencio was put in a cell by himself to calm down, according to MCSO.  Around 15 minutes later, medical staff checked on the 44-year-old and had to begin CPR when he was unresponsive.

Mr Atencio was taken to St Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix and remains in a critical condition.

Mr
Atencio's family claim that he was Tasered by police and suffered a 
heart attack but was not given proper medical care soon enough.

An MCSO spokesman Christopher Hegstrom added in a statement: 'The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is releasing the name and photo of Ernest M. Atencio D.O.B. 2/22/67 who was arrested by Phoenix Police Thursday night.

'He is at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. He is listed in Critical Condition at this time.'

Last week, the U.S. Justice Department condemned Sheriff Arpaio for committing civil rights violations
against Latinos through his immigration and jail policies.

Latino inmates who didn’t understand commands in English were punished by up to 23 hours a day of solitary confinement, investigators found.

Arpaio slammed the 
report as a political attack by the Obama administration that will keep 
illegal immigrants on the streets of Arizona.

The Justice Department's expert on 
racial profiling said it is the worse case of profiling in the 
U.S. he has seen.

Sheriff Arpaio has built a reputation on jailing inmates in tents and dressing them 
in pink underwear, selling himself as unceasingly tough on crime.

Racist: The report said some jail officers used racial slurs for Latinos when talking among themselves and speaking to inmates

Last week an Associated Press article exposed his office's bungling of sex crime
and molestation cases in a predominantly Hispanic Phoenix suburb.

His office said more than 400 sex-crimes probes had to be 
reopened after they learned of cases that hadn't been investigated 
properly.

Officials discovered at least 32 reported child molestations - with 
victims as young as two-years-old - where the sheriff's office failed to
follow through.

There were also complaints of deputies using excessive force 
against Latinos and Hispanic communities receiving insufficient 
policing.
