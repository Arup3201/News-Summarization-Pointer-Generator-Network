A fresh racism row engulfed Ukip tonight after it emerged a candidate described Islam as a 'totalitarian ideology' that is 'against everything modern Britain stands for'.

An email sent by Heino Vockrodt to the London council he wants to be elected to also claimed a row of shopping looked like ‘Helmand Province now’ street and referred to cases where ‘Muslims are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities’.

Labour condemned the 'deeply offensive' views which emerged after repeated attempts by Nigel Farage to stress that Ukip is not a racist party.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been stung by claims his party is racist, as the latest remarks from candidate Heino Vockrodt emerged

Ahead of European and local elections next week, Ukip has sought to draw a line under offensive comments made by some members and candidates.

Sanya-Jeet Thandi, a youth member who was previously put up to defend the party in television interviews, quit this week accusing Mr Farage of playing the race card to win votes.

The latest row centres on comments made in an email by Mr Vockrodt complaining about an alleged planning breach by 'the Afghan community' in Brent, north London.

He wrote: ‘Being Muslims, they ignored both refusals and did it anyway.’

He claimed political correctness was preventing the council taking action 'for fear of being called racists, when, just like in all the other cases where Muslims are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities, the council does nothing'.

The row follows the resignation of Sanya-Jeet Thandi who quit Ukip this week, accusing Mr Farage of playing the race card

He claimed the neighbourhood was 'already exploding under the weight of segregation' and shopkeepers had been 'squeezed out by Muslims'.

'The entire parade - once lovely owner/occupier shops - resembles Helmand Province now. Time to call in MI5 and MI6 for sure,' he added.

'Islam is a mono-cultural, totalitarian ideology. It is NOT a religion. It is against multi-culturalism and only promotes its own culture. It is against everything modern Britain stands for.'

In the message, sent in the early hours of the morning to the planning enforcement department, he said that while he supported a multi-ethnic society, 'the only culture applicable to this country is British' and warned the council not to ignore the 'winds of change'.

The Labour leader of Brent council, Muhammed Butt, said: 'Mr Vockrodt’s odious comments are deeply offensive.

'Nigel Farage keeps claiming Ukip isn’t a racist party, but that’s a hard pill to swallow when its members have put forward an individual with such plainly bigoted views for election to public office.

'In Brent we draw strength from our diversity and the vibrancy it brings, and our community deserves better.'

A Ukip spokesman said: 'Ukip is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values. Where evidence is produced to indicate a breach, it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the national executive committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.'

It is a fresh embarrassment for Ukip as it tries to fend off racism allegations following a series of scandals involving candidates, and a controversial poster campaign warning about Europeans coming to take UK jobs.

Party leader Mr Farage has sought to dispel the image, accusing the media of stirring up hatred against Ukip and appearing on a platform alongside a number of the party’s black and ethnic minority candidates.

'I don’t care what you call us but from this moment on, please, do not ever call us a racist party. We are not a racist party,' he declared.

But Miss Thandi, of the party’s prominent British Asian Ukip supporters resigned this week saying the party's current direction was 'terrifying'.

Mr Farage expressed 'surprise' at Ms Thandi’s departure, suggesting she might have been 'intimidated' into quitting.

'She may have been intimidated, I don’t know quite why she changed her mind,' he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One.

'We hadn’t changed in seven days, had we? Nothing had changed in seven days... She changed in seven days, we didn’t.'
