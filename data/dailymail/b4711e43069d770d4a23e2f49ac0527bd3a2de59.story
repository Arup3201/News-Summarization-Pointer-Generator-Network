British boxer Amir Khan has been forced to pull out of training with whiplash injuries after being hit by a suspected drunk driver while being driven to his gym in California.

The 26-year-old, who is reportedly being lined-up for a lucrative showdown with Floyd Mayweather Jr next year, confirmed on Twitter that he had suffered pain to his neck and back in the collision in Hayward, near his San Fransisco training base.

His promoters Khan Promotions also 
confirmed the news via the site, indicating Khan and his driver had not been 
seriously injured but were 'shook up'.

Shook up: Amir Khan after the crash which forced him to cancel training suffering whiplash injuries

Damage: Police examine the car which collided with Khan's vehicle. Khan tweeted that the driver had been arrested for being drunk

Khan said they were waiting at traffic lights when a car hit 
their vehicle from behind. Khan also confirmed a man had been arrested 
at the scene.

The boxer also tweeted this picture allegedly showing the driver of the other car being arrested

Khan said: 'We was 
parked up at the lights and a car banged us from behind. He was arrested
for being drunk. I cancelled training. Back and neck hurts.'

In 2006 Khan was banned from driving for six months after he was involved in a crash in his hometown of Bolton.

Khan ploughed his £65,000 BMW into a 55-year-old foundry worker Geoffrey Hatton who suffered a badly broken broken leg. 

A trial heard that Khan had been 
driving at up to 47mph in the moments before he hit Mr Hatton. Khan was 
cleared of dangerous driving but convicted of driving without due care 
and attention.

Mr Hatton died two years later. His 
widow Moyra he had been 'a broken man' following the accident after 
spiralling into depression and being forced to sell his home.

Khan was given a second driving ban 
after a court heard he had driven along a motorway at up to 140mph nine 
months after hitting Mr Hatton.

Khan is training in San Francisco 
while talks continue over a megabucks clash in May with the world's best
pound-for-pound fighter.

No-one has come close to beating Mayweather in his 45 fights.

However, former two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton is convinced that Khan, who has won 28 of his 31 contests, can push the American all the way.

Stateside: Amir Khan is currently training in America and is reportedly being lined up for a lucrative showdown against Floyd Mayweather Jr

He told the Daily Star: 'Amir has the style that could cause Floyd problems and give him a real headache.

'You would get good odds on Amir winning and he would definitely be worth a punt.

'Amir is probably the only one around who can match him for speed,' said Hatton, who lost to Mayweather in August 2007.

'Floyd can attack but he prefers to defend and sit on the ropes. Staying low is his trademark.'
