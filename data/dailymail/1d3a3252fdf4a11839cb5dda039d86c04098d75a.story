Murderess: Dana Chandler was given the maximum penalty of two 50-year terms in prison for the 2002 murders of Karen Harkness and Mike Sisco

An Oklahoma woman was sentenced to two consecutive 50-year prison terms on Monday for shooting to death her ex-husband and his fiance in 2002.

The sentencing comes five months after Dana Chandler, of Duncan, Oklahoma, was found guilty of gunning down 47-year-old Mike Sisco and 53-year-old Karen Harkness as they slept in their Topeka, Kansas, home.

Chandler was convicted of two counts of premeditated murder. Prosecutors said the 52-year-old woman committed the crimes after Sisco told her he planned to marry Harkness.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Chandler decided to represent herself at her sentencing on Monday. Chief Judge Nancy Parrish denied her request for a new trial or acquittal.

Prior to the sentencing, six of Sisco and Harness' family members who attended the hearing gave emotional victim impact statements, and two crime scene experts presented evidence.

The judge could have sentenced Chandler to two concurrent life terms with parole eligibility after 25 years, two consecutive life terms with parole eligibility after 50 years, two concurrent 50-year terms, and two consecutive 50-year terms, which is the maximum sentence in Oklahoma.

Harkness and Sisco were found shot to death on July 7, 2002, in the woman’s southwest Topeka apartment. Police spent years investigating the murders, but the trail had gone cold.

The FBI became involved in the probe and the case was even featured on the CBS show '48 Hours' in 2009, which sparked a renewed interest in solving the mystery. 

On July 25, 2011, nearly a decade after the deadly double homicide, Sisco’s ex-wife was arrested in the parking lot of a fast food eatery in Oklahoma and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

The judge elected to subject Chandler to the harshest punishment because she said the murders were committed in ‘an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner.’

Crime scene: The couple's bullet-ridden bodies were discovered by their relatives in a downstairs bedroom of Harkness' duplex in Topeka

Sisco and Chandler married in 1982 and lived in Colorado, but their relationship began unraveling after the husband moved the family to his hometown of Topeka, Kansas. His wife was miserable there, which eventually led to a serious drinking problem. 

The couple’s son, Dustin, told '48 Hours' in 2010 that his mother would drink often and a lot, which caused her to behave irrationally, ‘like she had no mind.’

Eventually, the feuding couple decided to split, but the divorce process was slow-going and fraught with acrimony.

The court found that Mike Sisco was the more stable parent and awarded him full custody of Hailey and Dustin, and Chandler was ordered to pay child support.

The divorce was finalized in 1998, but Chandler appeared reluctant to let her ex-husband go.

Sisco’s sister, Cathy Boots, told '48 Hours' that Chandler would frequently harass and stalk her ex and his new girlfriend, Harkness, lurking around their neighborhood and watching them from an alley behind their home.

According to testimony presented during the trial, in early July of 2002, Chandler became upset after learning that her ex-husband was planning to marry Harkness.

On July 7, she drove from Denver to Topeka, broke into her rival’s duplex where she ambushed the sleeping couple, shooting them 10-12 times as they slept.

Chandler then got back in the car and drove back to Denver. Her cell phone use, which would have showed her location when she made calls, and her credit card use dropped to zero when the victims were killed and before and after the murders.

In the morning, the couple’s bullet-riddled bodies were discovered in a downstairs bedroom by Harkness’ parents and Sisco’s mother, who arrived at the apartment for a Sunday fish fry.

During Monday’s sentencing, Sisco’s and Chandler’s daughter, speaking for herself and on behalf of her brother, said their father was the parent who taught them to have strength while he suffered pain from his ex-wife.

‘We’ve been robbed of 
security, love and support of the person who took care of us and raised 
us for our whole lives,’ Hailey Sisco said.

The
judge called Chandler ‘selfish’ and accused her of emotionally deserting 
her two children, who were in their mid-teens at the time of the 
murders, after their father’s death.

‘Your acts were extremely self-centered,’ Parrish said. ‘You weren't thinking of anyone but yourself.’
