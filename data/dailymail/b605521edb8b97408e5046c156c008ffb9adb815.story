A prisoner waiting for his case to be heard in court landed himself in even more trouble when he tried to snatch a police officer's gun from her holster.

Robert Lewis Bridges III, 24, has been in jail since February charged with four crimes in connection with a burglary.

But he will face an additional two charges when he finally gets his day before a judge after attempting to grab the .40-caliber gun from a Deputy at the Hillsborough County Court, Florida.

Dramatic CCTV footage taken from court cameras shows the moment Master Sgt Tracey Wallace managed to prevent Bridges from grabbing her weapon.

Audacious attempt: Handcuffed Bridges uses both hands to try and grab the .40-caliber gun from the Sergeant's belt

Defence: But the quick thinking officer is prepared for Bridges's attack and manages to slap his hand away from her holster

The footage shows Bridges and two other prisoners sat on a side bench waiting for their case to be heard by Circuit Judge Martha Cook, when Master Sgt Wallace walks across the courtroom in front of them.

Despite being shackled and handcuffed, Bridges manages to leap up from the bench and attempts to grab the gun from Sgt Wallace's belt holster with both hands.

But the quick thinking officer manages to evade Bridges lunge slapping his hand away from her belt.

Two other officers then rush to her aid and pin Bridges down before he is led away to a holding room.

Sgt Wallace said after the incident that she was prepared the audacious attempt at grabbing her gun because she had spotted bridges eying up her holster.

Sheriffâ€™s office spokesman Detective Larry McKinnon told NBCMiami: 'Her quick thinking and defensive actions, along with the type of equipment that she had on her belt, and of course with the other deputies restraining, we feel prevented a really tragic incident in that courtroom.

'When he pounced, she was already predisposed to react because she saw that he was acting strangely.'

Bridges has already been in jail since February charged with burglary, third degree grand theft, obstructing or opposing an officer and tampering with electronic monitoring equipment.

But he has now been charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and depriving an officer of means of protection following the courtroom drama.
