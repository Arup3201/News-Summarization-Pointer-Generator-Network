Alan Pardew fully expects to be in charge of Newcastle when they face Leicester City a week on Saturday.

The United boss has no intention of quitting his position and Sportsmail understands owner Mike Ashley remains fully supportive of his manager.

The Magpies still reside in the bottom three despite twice coming from behind to claim a 2-2 draw at Swansea on Saturday – Papiss Cisse with both goals – and Pardew believes his players showed their commitment to the cause.

‘We showed so much character and were determined to try to win,’ he said. ‘One thing you have to analyse as a football manager is – is the team giving you everything?

‘I don’t think our worst critic could argue they didn’t give me everything. We wanted to push for the win and had the chance to do that at 2-2.

‘It’s obvious we’re not playing the way that I would like. We’re a little bit tight in the way we’re playing. For now we have to grind ourselves a win and then the confidence will come back.’

And, looking beyond the international break, Pardew added: ‘My attention now turns to the next game. Hopefully I can now look forward to that game – and a win.

‘We know that the tension in the stands and the stadium isn’t going to go away. In the short-term we must focus on a performance and we’ve got a bit to lean on after this.

‘We can take the positives in to the next game, where a win would settle everyone down.’
