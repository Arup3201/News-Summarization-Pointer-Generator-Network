A baby who was born struggling to breathe was saved after doctors raced 140 miles to treat her.

Alina Ahmed was battling severe lung and heart problems after her arrival at Burnley General Hospital, Lancashire.

Doctors told her worried mother Naseem, 25, the only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).

Fight for life: Alina Ahmed was born with severe lung and heart problems. The only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which works in place of the heart and lungs

Only three hospitals in England have the machine, and the nearest, in Leicester, had no beds available.

So doctors at the ECMO centre in Leicester travelled up to Burnley with a machine which could stand in for Alina’s heart and lungs - which were failing to pump oxygenated blood around her body.

Ms Ahmed said: 'I was in a lot of pain and I’d lost hope. A doctor said she was very poorly and I didn’t think she’d pull through. I really thought I was going to lose her.'

ECMO therapy would normally only be available for babies at three hospitals in England.

Worried: Before doctors dashed 140 miles to save Alina, her mother Naseem (pictured) was told hope was fading fast

After the Leicester team attached Alina to the machine in Burnley they took her to Newcastle - which also has a specialist centre.

One senior doctor at the hospital said the case showed the NHS working ‘at its best’. 

After her birth on January 15 and the journey north, Alina spent nine days in Newcastle before being transferred back to Burnley General, where she spent the next six weeks. 

Now her jubilant family have been told she is well enough to go home. 

Naseem, whose husband Muhammad Jahanzaib is currently in Pakistan, said: 'When they said I could come and take her home it was just the most amazing feeling ever.

'That’s when I felt I’m going to be a proper mum now. 

'I’m just so grateful to the doctors, No matter how I say it there’s no words I can use to thank them. “If it wasn’t for them I don’t think I’d have my daughter today.

'Before this I had negative thoughts about the NHS, that they don’t care about the patients. But after what they did for my daughter it’s completely changed. 

'She was dying and they did everything they could to keep her alive.'

Aside from having high blood pressure, 
which should ease, Alina has made a speedy recovery and Naseem praised 
all the staff, in Burnley, Leicester and Newcastle who were involved in 
her case.

Dr Meera Lama, neonatal clinical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “Alina was very sick and on the night in question we thought we were going to lose her.

'The Leicester team, despite having no beds, were amazing in their support. Their quick response and stabilisation has resulted in Alina coming through a very critical period and she has now been discharged and continuing to recover at home. This was the NHS at its best.'

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used when a patient has a serious condition which prevents the lungs or heart from working normally.

The ECMO equipment is similar to heart and lung machines used during open-heart surgery and uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body.

The three centres that can provide the treatment for children and babies are in London, Leicester and Newcastle.
