A teenager was killed when he crashed a jet ski into his twin brother, an inquest has heard today.

Simon Satchwell, 14, from Hertfordshire, was riding the ski while on a Christmas holiday with his family in Abu Dhabi, along with his twin brother Lucas and father Christopher.

The family had been riding near Al Lulu Island on New Year's Eve, the last day of their two-week stay in the United Arab Emirates capital, for around half an hour when Mr Satchwell and Lucas headed back to the coast, an inquest heard.

Simon Satchwell, 14, was killed when he crashed a jet ski into his twin brother in Abu Dhabi, an inquest has heard today

Hertfordshire Coroners Court heard the father and son stopped their skis and had a drink of water as Simon carried on by himself around 300 yards away.

Mr Satchwell told the inquest he then saw his son turn to head towards them but momentarily lost sight of him as he passed behind Lucas' stationary jet ski.

Moments later, the inquest heard that Simon, a talented science student, crashed into his twin at high speed. 

The impact threw both him and his twin from their machines and into the water.

Simon was taken to shore by his father, who tried to resuscitate him as Lucas sought help from the local coastguard. 

Simon was believed to have died instantly. 

Mr Satchwell described seeing his son riding in circles to create small waves to jump over, around 300 yards from him and Lucas moments before the crash.

'He was aimed back towards us and I was still chatting to Lucas,' he said.

'When Simon hit the jet ski, I couldn't see him over the top of Lucas' jet ski at the point of impact. I was looking straight at Lucas as I spoke to him.

'There was no shouting and the engine note (of Simon's jet ski) didn't change at all until the point of impact.' 

When interviewed at the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital, hours after the death of his twin, Lucas told authorities: 'While I was talking with my father I felt a strong blow against my jet ski and fell in the water.

'I saw my brother come off his jet ski. My father took him toward the coast and we tried to give him first aid but to no avail.'

Edward Thomas, senior coroner for Hertfordshire, heard that the family had also hired two jet skis on Boxing Day, five days before the accident. He rode one with a son as a passenger, allowing the other son to ride the second jet ski alone for 10 minutes at a time before swapping.

Mr Satchwell said they had also previously ridden with him on jet skis during holidays in 2012 and 2013 to Tunisia and Lanzarote, and they 'fully understood' how to ride them responsibly, despite not having any certification or formal training for their use. 

Mr Satchwell said he had spoken with a forensic scientist in Abu Dhabi, five days after the death of his son, who had suggested that Simon may have been unconscious when the crash occurred. 

He said an emergency stop lanyard, attached to Simon's wrist as a safety precaution, had not been pulled before the crash.

'It was just a freak accident.'

He said the sea conditions were very calm in that area and a small wave could have taken Simon by surprise, causing him to hit his head and lose control.

The inquest heard that the jet skis had been hired at around 3.30pm on the same day. Mr Satchwell claimed he had hired a 1200cc turbocharged machine, with his two sons each riding 900cc models.

However, the documentation from the hire company recorded that only two jet skis had been hired, a 1200cc model and an 1800cc model. Mr Satchwell told the inquest this was incorrect and said they appeared to have been altered after he had signed them.

A public prosecutor in Abu Dhabi launched an investigation and spoke to Lucas, Mr Satchwell and emergency services before closing the investigation, with no technical report examining the jet ski ordered.

Mr Satchwell said he had not requested one as it would have meant 'at least six months' in the country and the jet skis had all appeared to be in perfect working order.

Mr Thomas said he would be writing to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to highlight differences in legislation governing jet ski hire in foreign countries and suggest that the Royal Yachting Association's guidelines - which require riders aged under 15 to be accompanied on jet skis at all times and formal certification for riders aged 15 to 17 - be adhered to.

'I can't imagine how awful this has been for all three of you, in particular Lucas,' he said.

He recorded a narrative verdict, stating that Simon died of injuries sustained while riding a jet ski on his own in Abu Dhabi.

Following his death, Simon's friends posted tributes on Facebook and Twitter, while Sir John Lawes School named an annual science lecture in his memory.

Simon's parents declined to comment after the inquest.
