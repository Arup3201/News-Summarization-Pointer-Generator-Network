The Archbishop of Canterbury today recalls a 'grim' childhood Christmas when he was shunned by his alcoholic father and forced to 'scrounge' around in the fridge for food.

In a candid and emotional interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Justin Welby reveals how he was forced to wander the streets alone while his father was in bed.

The Archbishop, whose parents divorced when he was three, said: 'I did think this was a pretty bad day.

'I think I went out once or twice but, you know, everything was closed. I didn't know really what to do with myself. I suspect I watched telly a bit and sort of scrounged around the fridge for something to eat. A sandwich? I can't remember. But it was a grim day.'

He told the programme he was 'around 12' when he realised his father had a drink problem. A Lambeth Palace spokesman last night said the Archbishop would have been the same age at the time of the Christmas he was speaking of.

During the interview, the Archbishop contrasts the happy summers he spent with his mother and her family in Norfolk with the 'rather more complicated times' with his businessman father who had custody of him in London.

He said: 'As I grew up he was always unpredictable. Sometimes very full of rage and anger and expressing that very loudly.

'It [childhood] felt very painful at times. But I didn't know anything else. So it felt that that's what happens in life. It's one of the bad bits.'

Almost lost for words, the Archbishop recalls the death of his seven-month-old daughter Johanna in a car crash in France in 1983, revealing he and his wife Caroline always celebrate key moments, including the anniversary of her death, her birthday and Christmas.

He said: 'Whether there is a faith or not is irrelevant. I think the most helpful thing is to celebrate the person to remember them with love, to remember what they gave, what you gave them. Attack the day so it doesn't attack you.'

Welby's mother Jane worked as Sir Winston Churchill's secretary for six years.The Archbishop recalls a meeting with an 87-year-old Sir Winston, at the age of five, in 1961. At the time, Churchill was battling with depression and his health had deteriorated following a series of strokes.

The Archbishop said: 'I remember a very, very old man and he cried. I don't know why and because he cried, I cried, and we sat and had tea. I have talked to my mother about it since and she said, 'Well he cried quite a lot.' '

Explaining his Christian beliefs took root during his second year at Cambridge University, the Archbishop said: 'I prayed and something changed. There was a presence and Christ came into my life.'

Welby revealed he sometimes wondered if he was up to the job of Archbishop of Canterbury and admitted he often worried about the future of the Anglican Communion. He said: 'I still do [have doubts] most of the time. Imposter syndrome is a constant companion.'

The Archbishop declined to talk about his opposition to same-sex marriage but he defended the right of the Church to speak out on issues even when it comes a 'cropper' by doing so, citing the revelation the Church had a £75,000 holding in payday loan company Wonga as an example.

And, speaking of the horrific massacre of 148 schoolchildren and teachers at a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, the Archbishop said the inhumanity of man was 'mindboggling' but it was important not to blame religion for all the evils of the world.

He said: 'My experience is that in many conflicts, religion is a very good and very simple hook to hang extremely complex conflicts on.'

On a lighter note the Archbishop said that ironing was a good time for contemplation and prayer, and when asked if he is a competitive person, admitted: 'I try not to let it get out of hand – unsuccessfully.'

On the show, his song selections include The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens, because he often performs it when his family are playing the 'noisy' card game Racing Demon, and You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry And The Pacemakers.

He chooses The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon as his book and the complete box set of the West Wing as his luxury item.

Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am and will be repeated on Friday at 9am.
