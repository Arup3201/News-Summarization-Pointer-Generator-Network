The step-father of a young boy who died after an accident in a park near his home has spoken for the first time since the tragic incident; declaring 'I have nothing to hide'.

Nearly two weeks ago three-year-old Joey Woodcock, from Oberon, west of Sydney, was apparently knocked over by the family dogs while walking with his mother Lupe Naa and step-dad Andrew Woodcock.

He suffered serious head injuries and died the following Wednesday evening in Westmead Children's Hospital. Now, the family are at the centre of an investigation into the child's death.

Mr Woodcock told Nine News on Wednesday he thinks police don't believe his version of events.

Andrew Woodcock has said he has nothing to hide when it comes to the death of his stepson last week

Joey's mother Lupe Naa and Mr Woodcock gave their version of events to police on Wednesday

'The detectives don't believe my story. I've always said to the detectives I'll tell you whatever you wanna know. I have nothing to hide', he told the program.

Mr Woodcock and Ms Naa showed police their version of events via a reenactment, and maintained the accident happened when they were playing in the park.

'They were just playing in the park. The dogs were on the rope. They pulled it out of my hand. It got him by the legs and flipped him backwards', Mr Woodcock said.

Despite maintaining their innocence the parents are at the centre of the investigation into the little boy's death

He revealed the moment he was giving Joey CPR, saying he checked the boy's pulse and tried to revive him but his eyes had glazed over.

Joey's stepfather also admitted he had hit the toddler before, 'when he's been naughty' but he didn't know anything about the additional injuries the boy suffered, nor did he have anything to do with his death.

When asked if the three-year-old's mother was involved - he answered 'not that I know of'. Ms Naa was taken to hospital on Wednesday after police questioning and was treated for stress.

When police were called to the home ten days ago, the three-year-old had suffered head injuries while walking with his mother and stepfather at around 1pm on Sunday. Paramedics were called after he collapsed at home and they performed CPR.

The NSW homicide squad and a strike force have been established to investigate the child's death.

Chifley Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Luke Rankin said police were told the boy had been 'knocked' down and 'struck' on his head as a result of the incident.

Police were called to a home in Oberon, west of Sydney, where Joey Woodcock, 3, was found unconscious and not breathing

Det Insp Rankin said police were told the boy's injuries were caused after he got tangled in the leads of an Alsatian and a husky when the animals became loose, reported the Western Advocate.

'Our prominent line of inquiry is we are trying to establish if the child has injuries consistent with what the parents have told us,' he said.

His mother and step-father have been at the hospital and were questioned on Monday.

A crime scene was set up at the home where forensic police officers examined the inside and outside of the premises as well as an area of the park.

On Monday, police also seized items from the property including multiple boxes of ammunition.

Officers are also working with the NSW Department of Community Services. A husky dog has since been taken from the family's home, reported the ABC.
