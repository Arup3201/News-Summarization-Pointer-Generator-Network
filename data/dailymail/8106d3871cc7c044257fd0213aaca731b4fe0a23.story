The police and FA are investigating a youth football team over claims managers and coaches repeatedly subbed a nine-year-old boy because he is Asian.

Fehnez Khan, of Solihull, claims her son was taken off and substituted on race grounds during a match while playing for Knowle Juniors.

The Birmingham FA is investigating the claims, which have been strenuously denied by the club, established in 1926.

Police were called in by the Khans following a touchline verbal exchange between the boy's older brother Mohysn, 22, and other parents.

Mrs Khan, who has asked for her little boy's name to be withheld, said 'My son is devastated and upset. He was substituted more than any other child.

'I want an apology to my son and a refund of the Â£160 subs I paid because the club did not benefit him.'

Members of the Khan family and club 
representatives have now attended a meeting overseen by police officers 
at Shirley Police Station.

The claims are being investigated by the FA, while police say they hope to 'resolve this locally'.

Knowle Juniors, who are in the Warwickshire League, which runs 22 teams, denies the race claims.

A spokesman said 'We are very upset 
by these allegations. We have taken statements from nine parents, 
including those of an Asian player.

'They have all said this is a football, not racial, issue.

'The
manager has had so much support from parents. Mrs Khan wants the 
manager and assistant removed. There is no way that is going to happen.'

Mrs Khan claims her boy, a club member for two years, has been criticised and forced to sit on the subs bench.

The police station meeting on March 20th has done nothing to calm troubled waters, she said.

'The
club are in denial. The club's child welfare officer said he found 
nothing substantiated, but no-one spoke to me or my son.'

Knowle FC recently received Community Club Charter status from the FA - an acknowledgement of its good work in the area.

The club said Mrs Khan's son was not the only player to be subbed.

'There are two other children who have got less game time' said the spokesman.

'One of our major concerns is the effect
this is having on the child. He is confused, makes mistakes and, when 
we say something, now sees it as us getting at him.'

A Birmingham County FA official said 'We have received a complaint and are currently investigating it.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said 'We are aware of the situation and hope to resolve this locally.'
