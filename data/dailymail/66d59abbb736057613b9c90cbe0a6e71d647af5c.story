A 12-year-old boy at a Boy Scout camp in San Diego has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head Monday morning, and police were investigating whether the shooting was intentional.

Police received a call Monday morning that a boy had shot himself at the camp on Fiesta Island, Officer Matt Tortorella told The Associated Press.

Officers found a gun in the boy's tent. It's not clear yet where the gun came from or how it got into the camp.

Crime scene: Police say the 12-year-old shot himself in the head in a tent at Fiesta Island Youth Camp and Youth Aquatic Center

Shut down: Police have closed the camp to visitors while they investigate the tragedy

The tragedy unfolded after police were called to a suicide attempt at Fiesta Island Youth Camp and Youth Aquatic Center in Mission Bay at about 7:36 Monday morning, reports NBC San Diego.

Police said that when they arrived, they found a 12-year-old boy in a tent with at least one gunshot wound.

They tried to revive the child, but he died on the scene.

The boy was part of a Boy Scout troop from Las Vegas that arrived at the camp on Sunday intending to stay until July 5.

There were no firearm programs or activities available, and Boy Scouts of America policy does not allow personal firearms at its events, organization spokesman Deron Smith said.

Summer holiday: The boys were to spend the week sailing, kayaking and swimming but a shooting in a 12-year-old's tent has cut the camp short

'This is an extremely sad day for our entire scouting family,' Boy Scouts of America said in a statement.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and all those who experienced this tragedy. Our top priority is providing support to our community and for those in the grieving process.'

The organization said grief counselors were sent to the camp.

The boy's father was a chaperone for the troop, and about 20 Scouts were at the camp, Lieutenant Mike Hastings said.

The weeklong summertime program allows Scouts to camp among sandy dunes on Mission Bay in San Diego. They can sail, kayak, and do other activities while earning merit badges.
