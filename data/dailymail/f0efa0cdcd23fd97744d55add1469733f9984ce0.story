The British father who died with his son on Mont Blanc was  yesterday criticised for going on a perilous hike with the wrong equipment.

Peter Saunders, 48, plunged to his death with 12-year-old Charlie after trekking along a precipitous, snow and  ice-covered path on Western Europe’s highest mountain.

They fell up to 1,000ft after slipping on the treacherous trail overlooking the vast  Bossons Glacier, near Chamonix.

The bodies of the father and son were found after a photo taken of them earlier in the day was used to locate them

Yesterday professional guides questioned why the pair, from Buckingham, ventured out without ropes, crampons and ice axes.

Robert Beale, a British mountain 
guide based in Chamonix, said: ‘You’ve got to ask yourself, “Would you 
really want to take your 12-year-old son up a trail covered in snow and 
ice to look at a glacier? Is it a sensible thing to do?”

‘The father was foolish at best to attempt that ascent with his son. Things can go wrong very quickly on the mountain.’

Mountain expert Jean-Louis Verdier 
added: ‘They should have had crampons, ice axes and been roped together 
to make their way across the hard-packed snow that covers these slopes.’

The pair had arrived only hours earlier, flying into Geneva and then hiring a car, for a ‘weekend of adventure’.

Earlier this month no fewer than 10 people - including mountaineers and off-piste skiers - died in the Mont Blanc area

Tragedy: They plunged down a mountain at 
Chamonix-Mont-Blanc

Mr Verdier, a professional guide and a
Chamonix councillor responsible for mountain security, described the 
pair’s footwear – summer hiking boots – as like ‘trainers with modified 
soles’.

He added: ‘The father, Mr Saunders, 
made a terrible error. They simply got off the plane and raced straight 
up the mountain without asking advice and without the right equipment.’

Chamonix Mayor, Eric Fournier, added:
‘They should not have attempted that hike which is not sign-posted in 
winter. If they had taken the trouble to ask for advice from the 
mountain centre, we would have told them not to go. We would have 
offered them a different route.’

The trail they were attempting to 
follow – ‘La Jonction’ – begins in the valley close to the entrance of 
the Mont Blanc tunnel and climbs through thick woodland.

Captain Patrice Ribes of the French Mountain Police said: ‘This is the real mountain.

The tragic pair died in the popular skiing destination of Chamonix in the French Alps

‘There is no rope to hold on to and the signs, which are clearly visible in the summer, are now completely covered in snow.

‘It is inconceivable that someone 
would attempt this route in winter. There is ice everywhere and it is 
impossible to stick to the trail because of the snow.

‘No one uses this trail until the end of spring – when the snow has melted.’

He added that accident investigators were examining the theory that the pair had turned back after getting into difficulties.

Mr Saunders, a businessman, rang 
police at 2.55pm on Saturday to tell them Charlie had fallen into a 
gully and he could not see him.

The father is believed to have lost his own footing minutes later as he frantically searched for his son.

The Britons’ bodies were found on Sunday morning, lying 150ft apart in the deep Couloir des  Pyramides gully.

Charlie’s mother, Sandra, 44, and his sister Kate, 15, paid tribute to the pair in a statement released by the Foreign Office.

It said: ‘Charlie was always full of life, had a really happy temperament and loved spending time with his father.

‘Peter was fantastic at making things happen, resourceful, with a positive approach to life.
‘They will both be sorely missed by friends and family alike.’

At 15,780ft, Mont Blanc is notoriously dangerous and features some of the most technically difficult climbs in the world.

So far, ten skiers and mountaineers have been killed in the area this month.

The father and son are thought to 
have reached a high altitude by taking the chair lift from Bossons 
village to the approaches of the Bossons Glacier, at 1400m.

From
there, they are thought to have set off on the well-known La Jonction 
(Junction) hike, which is hugely popular with tourists, especially in 
the summer months.

La 
Jonction is a rocky spur from which hikers can look out towards the 
Bossons and Taconnaz glaciers. It was is on the route taken by the 
Frenchmen who first ascended Mont Blanc in 1786.

The
slopes around Mont Blanc, the highest peak in western Europe, are 
notoriously dangerous, with scores of mountaineers, skiers and hikers 
dying on them every year.

Not
only is the fabled ‘White Mountain’ 15,780 feet high, but the climbs 
around it are some of the most technically difficult in the world.

Despite this, it is often mistakenly claimed that people can enjoy an easy stroll up the slopes.Hundreds
set off on paths every day without ice axes or crampons, let alone 
other basic equipment like extra food supplies and tents. 

Many of the 20,000-plus people who attempt to reach the summit each year are inexperienced or completely novice climbers.

Earlier this month no fewer than 10 people – including mountaineers and off-piste skiers – died in the Mont Blanc area.
