Ray Rice plans to appeal the indefinite suspension that the NFL handed down after a video surfaced showing him punching his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino elevator.

Rice, who was released by the Baltimore Ravens last Monday shortly after TMZ released the video, must file the appeal by 11:59pm on Tuesday, three business days after the NFL officially notified the players' union of the suspension.

The NFL Players Association hasn't yet finalized its basis for the appeal and is considering multiple ideas, ESPN reporting, citing unidentified sources.

The league had in July suspended Rice for just two games but extended it after the video came to light and the Ravens acted. 

Criticism over the two-day suspension led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with commissioner Roger Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. 

The release of the video, which showed Rice punching his now-wife Janay Palmer, caused widespread public outrage, leading the NFL to issue the harsher punishment for Rice. 

After the blow, Palmer hit her head on a railing inside the elevator and was knocked unconscious. 

Though the NFL and the Ravens both insist they didn't see the video footage until last Monday, an anonymous law enforcement officer told the AP that he personally sent the tape to an NFL executive in April.  

A social media campaign has since emerged aimed at forcing Goodell to resign over his handling of domestic violence cases. 

Even the president has apparently waded into the issue, with his chief of staff saying Barack Obama was 'shocked by what he saw' and considers the indefinite suspension appropriate.

Rice on Saturday made his first appearance in public since the video was released by attending a football game at his high school in a New York City suburb. 

His wife and their daughter were at the game with him. 

New Rochelle High School has removed Rice's jersey from its wall of fame and took down a placard honoring him. 

The school's superintendent said in a letter emailed on Thursday that 'our community stands united in the belief that physical violence to settle differences cannot be condoned'. 

But the coach indicated ties would remain.  

'The New Rochelle football program is a very strong program, and once you're a member of that program, you're a member of that program for life,' Lou DiRienzo said, according to The Journal News. 'Ray is a part of our family and a part of this program, and that's why I'm very happy that he's here today. He made a mistake — and he made a very terrible mistake — but I know the character of the man, and he will rise from this.'
