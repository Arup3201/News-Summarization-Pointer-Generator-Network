His great-grandfather dropped the family name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha during the First World War because it sounded too Germanic.

But Prince Charles wasn't given the chance to dodge his Teutonic roots yesterday when he was presented with a large freshly-baked pretzel.

He was handed the pastry by Stuttgart-born delicatessen worker Petra Braun from the creatively-named Hansel and Pretzel shop in Ham, Surrey.

Prince Charles is given a large pretzel as he visits the Ham Close Estate near Richmond on behalf of the Prince's Foundation for Building Community - but he doesn't look too impressed!

As she showed him the gift, Miss Braun, 47, joked: 'You might as well have this because you are German.'

Charles
 looked a little  surprised by the remark – but soon regained his 
composure, politely remarking: 'Well that was a long time ago.'

The
 Saxe-Coburg-Gotha name came to the British Royal Family in 1840 with 
the marriage of Victoria to Prince Albert, who was the son of Ernest, 
Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Victoria
 herself remained a member of the House of Hanover, which had ruled 
Britain since the accession of King George I in 1714.

The only British monarch from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was Edward VII, who reigned for nine years at the turn of the last century. His son, George V, replaced the royal house's title with that of Windsor in 1917 when anti-German sentiment was at its peak.

Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a glass of rose as she participated in a wine tasting class.

Camilla was paying a visit to the new Wine Research Centre at Plumpton College, East Sussex.

Earlier in the day she praised the 'wonderful, uplifting feeling' she gained as she officially opened an £11.5 million hospice in a seaside town.

Camilla toured the bright, modern facilities at St Wilfrid's Hospice in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where she was serenaded by a 40-strong school choir.

She spoke to patients, staff and volunteers, visited the physiotherapy gym, and toured its 20-bed in-patient unit.

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall was out and about to officially open St Wilfrid's Hospice in Eastbourne

There she met prostate cancer sufferer Ray Boylan, 55, who recently re-married wife Lyn, 53, after they divorced and years later rekindled their love for each other.

On being told of their recent nuptials, Camilla remarked: 'That's very nice. I feel as if I should have come with flowers or something.'

She works out! The royal visitor, who grew up in Sussex, watched Val Herlihy, 69, as she used weights to build up her strength in the gym

The Duchess went on to pick up one of the pink dumbbells Mrs Herlihy was using before telling her with a smile: 'I think I'll hand that back to you'

Camilla then went on to watch Audrey Martin, 69, on an exercise bike.

Afterwards, Ms Martin said: 'I joked to her that I was on my way to Brighton, and she said "How far have you got?"

'It was nice to see her here. It's a fantastic place. Everyone is friendly and it's not the type of place that you don't want to come to.'

After unveiling a plaque, she told the 
gathering: 'As a native of Sussex, it's always a real treat to come back
 here again, and especially to see this wonderful hospice'

The hospice was completed last August and saw patients move from its old base in Eastbourne in November.

Staff care for more than 1,000 ill people each year, and the hospice has provided services in the area for over 30 years.

All of the care at St Wilfrid's is free, but its £10,000-a-day running costs are only partially met by the NHS. The rest comes from donations.

After listening to a choir from independent Eastbourne College and meeting more staff and volunteers, Camilla spoke of her fondness for the hospice.

After unveiling a plaque, she told the gathering: 'As a native of Sussex, it's always a real treat to come back here again, and especially to see this wonderful hospice.

'I would just like to congratulate everyone who was involved. It's the most wonderful place, with a wonderful, uplifting feeling, which is what all hospices should have.'

Among the guests was BBC broadcaster David Dimbleby, a new patron of the hospice, who spoke afterwards about the change in how cancer is treated nowadays.

Camilla seems intrigued by Derrick Platt's badges of honour during her visit

Mr Dimbleby, whose own father died from the disease in 1965, said: 'Everything that is behind a wall is losing out because it's not connecting.

'The great thing about here is it connects - people feel part of what's going on. We are all going to die.

'There is no mystery behind it, and many of us die of cancer. My father died of cancer. Many people have got grandparents or parents with cancer.

'To have this change in the way in which it is treated from when my dad died in 1965 and now is just extraordinary.

'The word cancer wasn't used - the Big C. Now people talk about it. The thing is to make it part of all our lives and part of living and I think that's what this place achieves.

'It has just such a good atmosphere.'

'I would just like to congratulate everyone who was involved. It's the most wonderful place,' she said
