At least 12 people have been killed in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk following a day of bloody clashes between pro-Russia separatists and government forces.

Two people were killed when a mortar shell exploded near a bus stop, with another five killed outside a community centre whilst waiting for humanitarian aid.

Another five people died as the city suffered heavy artillery bombardment on a day of chaos in the Ukraine.

Dead bodies lay strewn across the city's streets as locals tried to go about their normal daily business amid the shelling.

Pictures showed scenes of chaos in the city, as terrified locals were forced to run for their lives after battle erupted on the streets.

Full-blown fighting between the rebels and government forces erupted anew earlier this month following a period of relative tranquility. 

Tonight, it was not immediately clear if the shells that caused the deaths had been fired by government troops or pro-Russian separatists.

Hostilities now seem to be focused around Debaltseve, a railway hub which could prove a crucial link between the rebels in Donetsk and in Luhansk to the northeast to it.

While clashes in east Ukraine rage, hopes are still being invested in reviving a peace process that has been undermined with every new day of fighting.

Two rebel representatives went to Minsk in Belarus for peace talks today, but went back to eastern Ukraine a few hours later after the Ukrainian representative failed to turn up.

Donetsk rebel representative Denis Pushilin insisted that the rebels' ongoing offence is a way to protect the civilians from Ukrainian artillery fire and said they will go ahead with it unless Kiev stops shelling the rebel-held areas.

He said: 'The situation has worsened and it is forcing us to go on offensive. New victims are inevitable, I'm afraid.' 

It was also revealed today that United States Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Ukraine next week to show  support for the government as Ukrainian troops fight pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that Kerry will be in Kiev for talks with senior Ukrainian officials and lawmakers on February 5. Kerry will then to head to an international security conference in Munich, Germany.  

The US and Russia have been at increasing odds over the situation in Ukraine with Washington routinely accusing Moscow of supporting the rebels with heavy weaponry, including tanks and artillery, as well as military advice and personnel. 

Moscow denies those allegations and charges that US and European support for the government in Kiev is fueling the fighting.

The violence has intensified again in recent days. UN estimates say that more than 5,100 people have been killed in the conflict so far.
