This chilling CCTV footage shows a jilted lover stalking his ex-fiancée and her new boyfriend moments before slashing their throats because she had refused to marry him.

Bharat Soma, 26, knifed 17-year-old Darshana Narotam and Prashant Govinde, 22, in broad daylight after Ms Narotam 'dishonoured him' by fleeing from their arranged marriage.

Ms Narotam and Mr Govinde had left their homes in Wembley, London nine days earlier so the teenager did not have to go through with the forced marriage.

But Soma managed to track the couple down in Leicester, where he carried out the so-called 'honour' attack in front of horrified shoppers on a Sunday afternoon.

The footage shows Darshana Narotam, 17, her new boyfriend Prashant Govinde, 22 and another 15-year-old victim walking through Leicester, moments before they were attacked in an attempted so-called honour killing

Ms Narotam's jilted lover Bharat Soma is seen walking in the same spot as the victims less than a minute later, before carrying out a 'revenge' attack which involved slitting the victims' throats

Soma tracked down the couple after Ms Narotam fled from her home in Wembley to escape their arranged marriage 

In the footage, Soma is seen following the victims along the busy street, just seconds after they have passed the same spot.

Soma then slit Ms Narotam's throat while holding her from behind, before stabbing Mr Govinde through the neck with the same knife.

He then repeatedly screamed 'my wife, my wife', as the weapon was prised from his hands by one of the victims. 

The defendant, from North Evington, Leicestershire, has now been jailed at Leicester Crown Court for 23 years after being found guilty of two charges of attempted murder.

Soma was also convicted of unlawfully wounding a 15-year-old boy who was with the couple and eventually managed to disarm him. The teenager was left with a badly-cut arm. 

Sentencing, High Court Judge Mr Justice Saunders said: 'The attack was intended by Mr Soma to be a cold-blooded murder, committed to prevent Darshana from marrying anyone else.

'He grabbed hold of Darshana Narotam round the neck and while holding her from behind he slit her throat from one side to the other with a knife.

'He stabbed Prashant Govinde through the neck with the same knife, pushing the knife right through his neck from front to back.'  

The jury had heard Ms Narotam's family and Soma were originally from Dui, a small island off the west coast of India. They had moved to England in 2009.

In 2012, the two families agreed that Ms Narotam would marry Soma after she turned 18.  

But Ms Narotam did not want to go through with the marriage.

Instead, she planned to marry Mr Govinde and left home with him on January 10.

The defence counsel said that, after discovering she had fled, Soma was 'disturbed, troubled and depressed'.

But he soon received a tip off about the couple's location from a family friend. He then 'acted on impulse' in carrying out the frenzied attack, the court was told. 

Prosecutors said Soma had tried to kill the pair because he considered they had 'dishonoured him'.

But Soma had said he carried out the attack because his 'mind wasn't working' and he was a victim of black magic. 

During the eight-week trial the jury watched footage from body cameras worn by the officers which captured the aftermath of the attack. 

Sentencing, Mr Justice Saunders told the court that, if it were not for the quick actions of police, both victims could have died.

He said: 'Fortunately the police were on the scene very quickly and took appropriate steps to stem the two victims' bleeding, which was considerable.

'They cared for the wounded until an ambulance arrived to take them to hospital. It may well be that the prompt police action saved the lives of these two young people.'

He added: 'Both the jury and I were impressed with the efficient, calm and highly professional way in which the police carried out their duty.

'Because the police were carrying cameras, which recorded what was happening, we saw some very shocking scenes but it brought home to us the true nature of these events.'

Earlier this week, Ms Narotam's father, Narotam Deugi, 40, from Wembley was found guilty of common assault against his daughter and given a 12-month conditional discharge.

He was found not guilty of false imprisonment, along with her mother Parvati Natu, 42.

Deugi was originally charged with conspiracy to murder his daughter and served 100 days on remand in custody before that allegation was dropped.  

During the attack, Soma slit Ms Narotam's throat while holding her from behind, before stabbing Mr Govinde through the neck with the same knife (pictured)

Three of Ms Narotam's uncles Jignesh Devgi, 31, Harshad Jagdish, 25, and Shanitlal Natu, 37, and a cousin Kaushik Meghji, 18, all from Wembley were also cleared of kidnapping charges. 

Ms Natotam and Mr Govinde have since married and are living at a secret address, due to threats from other members of the family, the court was told. 

Mr Justice Saunders said: 'The background was that Bharat Soma was engaged to be married to Darshana Narotam, which was arranged by her parents and I'm satisfied Darshana never willingly agreed to it.

'She never told Soma she wanted to marry him although she agreed to the engagement because she felt she had no option but to go along with her parents' wishes until she was old enough to be able to marry Prashant without their consent.

'On January 10 this year, Darshana ran away with Prashant, intending to marry him and not Soma.

'When Soma discovered Darshana wasn't going to marry him he became very upset.

'I accept it may be that he was in love with her and developed a fixation about her, but I don't believe he ever had grounds for believing Darshana was in love with him.

'Mr Soma said in evidence he had wanted to marry Darshana since she was 11, although they didn't meet until she was 16 after they became engaged.'

He continued: 'After Prashant and Darshana were seen out on the street (in Leicester) by a family friend on January 19, he informed Soma he had seen Darshana. 

'After being given that information Soma went off to purchase a knife and I'm satisfied the reason for that was to use it to kill Darshana.

'I can't be sure he was intending to kill Prashant, who he may not have realised was with her at the time.

'He went around the streets looking for Darshana so he could kill her. Immediately after the attack Soma was repeating 'my wife, my wife'.

The couple had left their homes in Wembley, London to live in Leicester in January this year, so Ms Narotam would not have to marry Soma 

The pair left their homes just nine days before the brutal attack. They are now living at a secret address 

'The defendant told the police he lost his mind, because he believed that a curse had been put on him.'

Soma was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the attempted murders, as well as three years for wounding with intent, which will run concurrently. 

The judge said he was not imposing a life sentence, because of Soma's previously good character. 

Although they have been left permanently scarred from their injuries, the judge also said it was believed that the victims had not suffered 'serious long term harm'.

He added: 'That's not to underestimate the ordeal they've gone through and the considerable difficulties they still have.

'It's hoped they'll make a good long term recovery.

'They've had to move away from family, friends and jobs because they're under threat of reprisals from other people - which is not attributable to Mr Soma.

'I very much hope those threats will now cease.'

He said that the mitigating factors were the defendant's good character and the fact he was suffering from an 'adjustment disorder with prolonged depressive reaction'. 

Soma's defence counsel, Jo Sidhu QC said that, although Soma was not suffering from a 'classified mental illness', the trigger for the offending was when Darshana eloped.

Mr Sidhu said: 'It made him feel low and he felt very hurt. He had nightmares, he was seeing ghosts.

'He got a tip off about where they were and acted on impulse. He feels bad about the effect of his actions and many times he's cried about it.

'He's not wired the same as other people because in his family there's an unfortunate pattern of suicide; both his father and paternal grandfather killed themselves.

'In the defendant's mind he'd been rejected without a reason. His feelings for Darshana remained strong, right up until the day of this attack.'

Police at the scene of the crime shortly after the attack. The judge praised officers for their quick actions in dealing with the attempted murders 

The officers were carrying cameras, which recorded what was happening. The judge said the footage brought home 'the true nature of these events'

After the case, Detective Inspector John Farndon from Leicestershire police's serious crime team, said: 'These were dreadful crimes, and could easily have caused the deaths of two young people who had harmed no-one.

'Crimes like these are very rare, and are sometimes called honour based violence. However, this has nothing to do with culture or religion, this is simple criminality.

'Leicestershire Police took this case extremely seriously and carried out a thorough investigation to put those responsible before the courts.'

He added: 'During our initial enquiries this case was quickly identified as being one of honour based violence and concerns regarding a possible forced marriage.

'This case demonstrates that we take crimes of this nature incredibly seriously and we hope it gives potential victims the confidence to report it to the police or other agencies.

'Anyone who fears they may be subjected to honour based violence or have concerns about someone else should contact us at the earliest opportunity. There are a range of criminal and civil powers we and partner agencies can put in place to keep you safe.'
