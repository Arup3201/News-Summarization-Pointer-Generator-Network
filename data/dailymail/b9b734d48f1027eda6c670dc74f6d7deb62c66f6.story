A historic tall ship, one of only 60 of its kind ever built, has sailed on to the market with a price tag of £2million.

The Kathleen and May liner, which is considered a national treasure by the Government, has been berthed on Hartley Quay in Liverpool since 2010.

More than 60 dedicated sea-lovers volunteer to keep her afloat but it could now leave Britain after more than a century in our waters.

Her owner, Stephen Clarke OBE, has been taken ill and is now making plans for her future, and needs to sell the vintage voyager.

At the request of the Arts Council, auctioneers Bonhams of London has valued the ship is £2million.

After being built in 1900, the Kathleen and May joined the National Historic Ships Register along with a core collection of fifty ships.

The 113-year-old vessel was built at Connahís 
Quay in Deeside, Scotland, and has already attracted interest from the Far East 
with an offer of £2.3million.

Classed as a National Treasure by the Secretary of State for Culture, the ship is used by the Liverpool Maritime Museum education department in its work with local children.

The Duke of Edinburgh has been associated with the ship since 1972, and at his request she attended the Queen's Jubilee Celebrations on the Thames.

Since the patriotic celebrations last year, she has attended the Brest Maritime Festival and so completed a sailing season of more than 2,000 miles.

So far an offer has been received from a foreign buyer, however the sale must be subject to scrutiny by the Arts Council, who have to issue an Export Licence before it can proceed.

Because the Kathleen and May is on the Historic Ships Register, this has been refused temporarily.

It will be granted in coming months if funding cannot be raised to keep her in the UK. The deadline for expression of interest in achieving that is February 19.

Any sums of money raised towards the £2million asking price will be gap funded by the Arts Council.

Because of the way this is calculated, raising considerably less than half this sum would ensure her future as a Liverpool attraction or elsewhere.

If such interest is forthcoming, a business plan will be produced for the ship’s future management and it will probably stay where it is or go to another UK port.
