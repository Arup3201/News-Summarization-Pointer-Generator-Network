These are the forgotten relics of a Christmas dream, all in dire need of Santa's help - they were created in his honour after all.

Once bustling beacons of festive cheer, these 'Santa lands' now lie derelict after the elves went home and the laughter stopped.

Now mould creeps up the grotto's walls and Santa's sleigh lies empty, fused to the earth by rust and moss.

From Arizona to Brazil, they went out of business after failing to attract enough visitors all the year round, in a painful lesson to their once-merry owners on why it can't be Christmas every day.

Goodbye Christmas: Santa appears to cry tears of mould on this swing in Park Albanoel in Brazil

Gone-under land: This is an eerie reminder of how even Christmas has its hard times

Overgrown: Park Albanoel was reportedly conceived in 2000 and was intended to be the largest tourist entertainment attractions in Brazil - the size of 460 football fields

Reindeer oh dear: But the park shut down after its owner, Albano Reis, who had previously run for mayor of Rio de Janeiro, was struck and killed on the highway near the complex in 2004

Big plans: Also in the works were other projects including a Ruins Water Park, a western city, a rustic little farm, a ship-hotel, a concert hall and a ten-story tower

Down the pan: The water slide at Park Albanoel has dried up and is caked in dirt in the park which is surrounded by picturesque mountains

The once busy theme parks are now deserted, their happy Christmas jingles 
replaced by whistling winds and rustling leaves.

They include the 460-acre Park Albanoel in Brazil, which shut down after its owner was killed in a car accident in 2004, and the town of Santa Claus in Arizona built in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert spot.

North Hole: Nina Talbot founded the town of Santa Claus in Arizona, in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert location. It featured several Christmas-themed buildings and visiting children could meet Santa Claus at any day of the year

Vandalised: But the town is now empty and its rides are covered in graffiti

All aboard: Santa Claus did become a popular tourist destination but no one ever bought land there, and the only people living there were the ones working in the town

This is it! The last gift shops and amusements at Santa Claus went out of business in 1995, leaving a few vandalized buildings, a wishing well, and the 'Old 1225,' a derailed, pink children's train covered with graffiti

Retreat! Now the elves have laft Santa Claus, mold creeps up the grotto's walls and Santa's sleigh lies empty, fused to the earth by rust and moss

No toys: This was once a toy shop in the centre of Santa Claus that was once filled with laughing children

Famous: One of the places in town that was genuinely successful was its local restaurant, the Santa Claus Inn

Desolate: In the early 1990s, the restaurant offered Dasher and Dancer omelette and Santa Claus burgers and oil portraits of John Wayne could be purchased from the shops

Big attraction: Santa's Village was a winter-themed amusement park in the Skyforest section of Lake Arrowhead, California, opened in 1955

Popular: Santa's Village in East Dundee, Illinois is silent and overgrown. During its heyday, between 1959 and 2006, more than 20 million people passed through the front gates

Winter woodland: Santa's Workshop in Negaunee, Michigan, and Santa's Village in Lake Arrowhead, California, have both been left to rot in the woods

They are in Brazil, California, Arizona and Illinois and were all once popular tourist destinations
