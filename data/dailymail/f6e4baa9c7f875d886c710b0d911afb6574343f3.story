Weightlifting is more commonly associated with brawny men but a new breed of female gym goers are making fitness fashionable.

Indeed, according to a new survey, men find women who lift weights more attractive.

The research revealed that 63 per cent of men said they’d rather date a girl that weightlifts than one that heads straight to the treadmill. 

In fact, 74 per cent of men polled say watching a girl using the squat bench in the gym is their favourite spectator exercise.

Lifting fever is spreading fast across the UK, no doubt thanks to celebrities such as Millie Mackintosh, Chloe Madeley and Cameron Diaz, who all preach the benefits of weightlifting.

In fact, the study witnessed a 58 per cent increase in bootcamp enquiries specifically asking about weight training methods as part of the programme.

Over half of the women polled said they now train like a man - and with the men - with free weights and bars. 

It was also revealed that 75 per cent of women who use weightlifting as part of their fitness regime get their inspiration, confidence and techniques from social media app, Instagram, searching for hashtags such as #liftingladies, #fitfam and #squats.

Jen Selter, who found fame on Instagram and has 4.8 million followers, came out as the number one social media star in the poll.

Fitness fanatic Cameron Diaz, was named the most desirable celebrity weightlifter.

The 42-year-old Hollywood star, who was also recently voted the best slim figure by Women's Health, and who is a renowned weightlifter, beat the likes of Mel B, Madonna and Fergie to the top spot. 

Steve Cody, personal trainer to X Factor’s Mel B and her husband Stephen Belafonte, and lead trainer at Wild Planet Bootcamps, who commissioned the research, said: 'Weight lifting is for everybody and it is great to see certain female celebrities pioneering this style of training.

'We have noticed our female clients are keen to start lifting but are not sure where to begin, they are coming to us to learn then hitting the weights in the gym with confidence when they return home.'

Speaking about the growing popularity of weightlifting for women, Rich Sturla, Owner & Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance, near High Wycombe, said:

‘Lifting weights is one of the best ways women can improve their health and physique. Strength training, weightlifting, resistance training - whatever you want to call it - helps women get stronger, leaner, more athletic and develop a balanced, healthy and toned body.’

Here are Rich’s Top 7 Lifting Tips for women.

Top tips: Rich Sturla, Owner & Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance , near High Wycombe, shares his tips for women

1. Bust the ‘Bulky’ Myth

Excess body fat is what makes women appear ‘bulky’, not having lean muscle. Lifting weights will not make you big (the exception being women who use anabolic steroids).

The way women are naturally designed hormonally means that when you lift weights intelligently, you will burn fat from the areas you don’t want it, and keep toned muscle in the areas you want it. The more lean muscle a woman maintains, the more calories she will burn at rest. In short, lean muscles speed up your metabolism, resulting in more effective fat loss. Most women simply do not possess the level of testosterone necessary to support a bulky physique. Ask any man that is trying to bulk up – it’s hard!

2. Learn Proper Exercise Form

This is crucial - devote time to it up front. It’s much easier to learn proper form now than to ingrain poor habits and try to fix them later. I highly suggest working with a knowledgeable coach or learning from reputable demonstration videos.

3. Master the Basics

If you’re just getting into strength training, stick with a few exercises to start with. Why? Think about it this way - what would be easier to solve quickest; 6 riddles, or 20? Don’t be fooled into thinking you need to ‘keep your body guessing’, or that you must work every muscle individually with isolation exercises.

For the best results, master your form and get stronger (more on that next…) in fundamental, compound human movements:

· Squat (or squat variation)

· Deadlift (or deadlift variation)

· Push Up (or a similar horizontal press)

· Inverted Row (or a similar horizontal pull)

· Overhead Press (or a similar vertical press)

· Chin Up (or a similar vertical pull)

If you have mobility issues/equipment restrictions/other concerns that don’t allow you to properly perform certain exercises, use appropriate exercise substitutions. For example, Goblet Squats can be a great alternative to Barbell Squats. Likewise, if you can’t Deadlift a straight bar off the floor, try Hex-Bar Deadlifts, Rack-Pulls, or even Single-Leg Deadlift variations.

4. Follow A Great Training Program

If you’re just getting into lifting weights, you need a well-structured, balanced program. Don’t make the mistake of following a training program for an intermediate or advanced lifter. While it may sound attractive, you’ll get the best results by following an appropriate training program for your experience level. My program at the end of this Femail article is a great place to start.

5. Focus On Getting Stronger

Almost everyone should focus on getting stronger, no matter what their primary goal is. It’s especially important for new lifters to develop a base level of strength. Focusing on building strength is the best way for a beginner to get results - seeing the numbers go up is highly motivating and a great way to love your workouts as you progress week after week.

Think of strength as a glass, and the water inside the glass as all the ‘qualities’ we train for: athleticism, health, physique improvement, etc.

The smaller your glass, the less ‘qualities’ you’re able to express or improve. You can’t be ‘athletic’ (or perform day-to-day physical tasks) without having a foundation of strength. You can’t boost your metabolism or burn more fat in your training without building the strength to progressively work harder and smarter.

The larger you make your glass (strength), the more water (physical qualities) you’re able to place inside your glass. Strength is the foundation for improving performance and physical qualities.

Guru: Rich says: 'Lifting weights is one of the best ways women can improve their health and physique. Strength training, weightlifting, resistance training - whatever you want to call it - helps women get stronger, leaner, more athletic and develop a balanced, healthy and toned body'

6. Set Motivating, Performance-Driven Goals

Spending an hour on the treadmill 3 or 4 times a week is about as motivating as sticking pins in your eyes for most women. It’s one reason why long-duration cardio is inferior to strength training for building a stronger, better looking and healthier body.

Even if you just want to lose body fat and look better in your clothes, I highly recommend setting motivating, performance-driven goals like ‘Perform 5 Push Ups’ or “Deadlift my Bodyweight’. You will be more motivated to train consistently. All of my clients with the primary goal of losing body fat focus on getting stronger and improving their performance in the gym. They have more fun, enjoy training, increase their confidence, and within a short period of time realise their clothes are too big and they love the way they look.

7. Start Today

Don’t ‘Start on Monday’ or ‘Get back on it in the New Year’. Take action today.

What does your first step need to be? Perhaps you should find a coach who can teach you proper exercise technique and set challenging goals. Maybe you need to get a great training program. Or possibly, you just need to get in the gym.

Whatever first step you need to take, do it today.
