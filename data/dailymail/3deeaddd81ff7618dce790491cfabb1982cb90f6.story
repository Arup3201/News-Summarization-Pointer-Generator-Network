Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward endeavoured to explain on Tuesday that the fallen Barclays Premier League club remain a huge draw to players – by highlighting their social media standings.

Woodward will be laughed at in some quarters by trying to big up his club by revealing, for example, that new signings Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao saw their Twitter, Facebook and Google standings rocket on the day they signed for United in August.

With United out of European competition for the first time in years this season and currently struggling to impose themselves on this term’s Premier League, many fans would rather see some points on the board than listen to stories of social networking increases.

However, Woodward’s comments came in a conference call with United investors to coincide with the release of the club’s quarterly figures this morning and, as such, were meant to illustrate to shareholders perhaps frustrated by lack of progress on the field that, in global terms, the Old Trafford club remain as prominent and high-profile as ever.

Woodward said: 'I want to share the impact on players' profiles around the world by joining Manchester United.

'Manchester United commands more than 51 per cent of the Premier League’s entire global TV audience, which is in 200 countries worldwide.

'Di Maria saw a 12-times increase on Google searches on the day of his transfer from Real Madrid and Falcao saw a 10-times increase in searches compared with the day he signed from Atletico.

'When Daley Blind signed from Ajax in August his Twitter following increased by 72 per cent, with his daily increase up an incredible 50 times. 

'We have six million followers on Facebook. 3.8m Twitter followers and have accumulated 87m followers across all social media. We are directly in touch with over 100m fans.

'The club’s media reach is further illustrated by research that shows for every article on our own website - and there about 150 of those every month - a further 160 articles about Manchester United are written elsewhere and 13,500 social media posts are made about the club.

'This impressive multiplier effect shows the popularity of the club around the world.' 

The Old Trafford outfit have announced a 10 per cent drop in income for the first quarter of the financial year

United released their financial quarterly results for the three months ending on September 30 at lunchtime on Tuesday, revealing a £9.8million drop in income due to the fact they are not participating in the Champions League or even the Europa League this season.

Commercial, broadcasting and matchday revenue came to £98.5m for the same period last year. This time that figure is down 9.9 per cent to £88.7m.

United's debt is also seen to be up slightly from £361m to £362.2m although the club has been quick to point out that the last quarter has also seen them sign the largest kit manufacturer deal in sport - £750m over 10 years – amid five other sponsorship deals across the globe.
