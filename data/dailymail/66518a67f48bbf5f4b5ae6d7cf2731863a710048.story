A lawyer representing Las Vegas 'road rage' suspect Erich Nowsch is raising questions about the story the victim's family told police as more details continue to emerge about the case. 

Conrad Claus, an attorney representing Nowsch, 19, is calling into question whether the shooting of 44-year-old Tammy Meyers was a case of road rage or a neighborhood dispute gone terribly wrong.

Nowsch is being held on charges of suspicion of murder, attempted murder and firing a gun from a vehicle after he allegedly shot and killed Meyers just after the mother of four finished giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson.

Claus believes the story the Meyers family told the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has changed multiple times and questions the way the family supposedly acted, ABC News reported. 

He also said a suspect sketch done before Nowsch's arrest does not remotely resemble his client.

Nowsch also has a 'strong argument for self-defense,' according to Claus. 

The lawyer told ABC 13 he has issues with the questioning of his client since police 'allowed him to get high before he surrendered to SWAT teams' and 'the statements he made to police may be inadmissible since he was under the influence of drugs'.

A police report giving a more detailed account of the February 12 incident revealed Nowsch didn't tell his friends he was angry about a traffic encounter, but he did think someone was after him.

The suspect also said he wasn't driving, a detail which would conflict with the road rage narrative. 

Conrad Claus, an attorney representing Nowsch, is questioning whether there was any 'road rage' involved 

Claust said this sketch of the man who was initially wanted in the shooting looks nothing like his client 

Daily Mail Online has learned Nowsch is believed to have been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. In a number of his Instagram pictures, he appears to be smoking marijuana

Police said Nowsch told his friends after the shooting he was a passenger in a silver Audi and saw a gun waved at him from a green car in a  school parking lot and thought the occupants were after him.

He said: 'Got those kids.

'They were after me, and I got them.'

Earlier that night, Ms Meyers had taken her daughter, Kristal, to the school parking lot to practice driving the family's green 1993 Buick Park Avenue sedan.

After Kristal tried her skills on some nearby residential streets, Ms Meyers hopped back into the driver's seat at about 10:50pm to drive home.

That's when a silver car sped up behind them and then pulled alongside, according to the police report.

Kristal told authorities she reached over to honk the car horn as her mother kept driving.

The silver car cut in front of them, but Ms Meyers turned down another street.

The silver car popped up again, passing in a bike lane next to the curb and spinning out sideways in front of them, forcing the Buick to stop, according to the report.

Kristal told police later that a six-foot-tall man got out and warned: 'I'm gonna come back for you and your daughter.'

Nowsch is about five-foot-three and 100 pounds.

Meyers was taken off life support after she failed to recover from the injuries she sustained in the incident 

Kristal said her mother hit the gas, sped around the silver car and headed home.

The daughter told police she thought she spotted the silver car again before they reached home, where her mother told her to run in and get her 22-year-old brother, Brandon.

Brandon told police he grabbed his Beretta 9mm handgun, but told his mother she should call 911. 

He said he got in the car when she told him to come with her or she was going alone.

Claus said he found it odd that Meyers and her daughter would not have gone to the police immediately after being threatened. 

Ms Meyers then drove to where the silver car had blocked their Buick to show her son, then began heading toward home when they spotted a silver car that sped off.

They followed for several blocks, passing the school again, before the silver car stopped diagonally in the road and Brandon  told police someone on the passenger side starting shooting.

Ms Meyers backed up and sped toward their home, Brandon told police. As they pulled up, Brandon said he saw headlights approaching and he silver car turned onto their street.

Brandon  told police a person leaned out the passenger window and opened fire and he fired back.

The silver car drove away and Brandon  found his mother lying on the ground, bleeding from the head and called 911.

Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting  and had fired 22 shots at a single location

February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time.

February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day.

February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs.

February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante.

February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man.

Later that night, Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting — unloading several shots at one location and 22 shots at a second spot. 

Nowsch said he thought the people in the car in the school parking lot were looking at him so he called a friend with the silver Audi to come and pick him up, according to the report. 

He displayed a handgun and .45-caliber ammunition to his friends.

Nowsch was questioned five days after the shooting while he was being held in juvenile custody on unrelated charges. 

Police reported finding six .45-caliber bullet casings at the first shooting location and eight near the Meyers home. 

The police report doesn't name the driver of the silver Audi. 

Authorities have said they are looking for another suspect.

Ms Meyers and Nowsch knew each other and she counseled him after the death of his father five years ago. 

Police said they only learned about that personal connection hours before they arrested Nowsch.  

Claus questioned why the family wouldn't have told the police Ms Meyers was familiar with the suspect.
