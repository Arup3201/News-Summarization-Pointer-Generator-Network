Plans to build the controversial high-speed railway line linking London to the North of England were approved in a Commons vote yesterday.

The High Speed Rail Preparation Bill was passed by 350 to 34 votes, giving a clear Government majority of 316 – despite the efforts of 17 rebel Tory MPs.

The Bill, which would allow ministers to buy property from residents and businesses on the proposed track route, will now progress to the House of Lords for further scrutiny.

HS2 was hailed as an ‘essential’ railway by David Cameron ahead of the vote.

He said: ‘The fact is our West Coast mainline is full. Every day between Birmingham and London there are thousands of people standing on trains that need to be able to sit down and work.’

He added: ‘The question is, do we build an old-style rail line or one of these new-fangled high-speed ones like they are building in China and France? I think we should go for high speed.

‘The cost of high speed is only  9 per cent more. I hope Labour will see sense and stop talking about pulling the plug.’

The rebellion is smaller than the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the Bill at second reading.

Labour’s threats to oppose the bill evaporated last night when they finally hinted they would back it, if the government could rein in the spiralling costs.

The high speed rail line will only go as far north as Leeds and Manchester. But last night ministers announced a study to try and increase the benefits Scotland gets from HS2, pledging to slash journey times between London and Edinburgh and Glasgow to just three hours.

Travel times between London and Glasgow or Edinburgh are already set to reduce from 3 hours 38 when the final phase of HS2 is operational in 2032.

Transport Minister Baroness Kramer Westminster had instructed HS2 Ltd to improve rail capacity and journey times for passengers and freight to Scotland.

She said: ‘Scotland will already benefit from day one with reduced journey times to and from London and once the full network is open these times will be reduced by up to an hour. However, we want to see if more can be done and so we are commissioning this study.’

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: ‘Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. The goal of delivering a genuinely national network with high-speed services shows this Government is serious about promoting economic growth right across the UK.’

He added: ‘Tourism on both sides of the border will also be supported as the UK is opened up to faster travel.’

The HS2 Paving Bill approved in the Commons yesterday by 350 votes to 34 against will release the funding for the project, if its backed by the House of Lords.

Funds will be used to buy property and compensate evicted families along the route, which runs through the picturesque English countryside.

Tory MPs whose constituencies fall along the proposed railway have been largely opposed to the project while others have criticised the spiralling costs, which have already hit £50 billion including the cost of rolling stock.

Despite their concerns, only 17 Tories ended up rebelling, including former Tory leadership hopeful David Davis. Many sceptics want to hold their fire until parliament votes next year on whether construction can begin.

Opposition: An anti-HHS2 rail project sign stands outside the clubhouse of Whittington Health Golf Club, which sits on the planned route of the rail link, in Whittington. Many rural communities oppose the development

Stewart Jackson, the Tory MP for Peterborough, abstained on voting last night, saying: ‘The case for the project is threadbare and at the moment I’ll oppose the substantive legislation next year.’

Despite threats by Labour to withdraw their support for the project, the party lined up behind it because the bill is only paving legislation for funding.

Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour would back the Bill after all.

‘Labour supports HS2 because we must address the capacity problems that mean thousands of commuters face cramped, miserable journeys into Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London,” she said, outside the Commons.

‘However, government mismanagement has pushed up costs. Our message to David Cameron is clear. Get a grip on this project, get control of the budget and get it back on track.’ Her remarks are in contrast to other signals coming from Labour, including from shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who said he would not be writing blank cheques for the project if Labour wins the next election.

This week it emerged that the expected benefits of HS2 compared to the costs had been lowered. The ‘benefit-cost ratio’ was reduced from £2.50 to £2.30 in benefits for every pound spent.

This was mostly due to the increase in the total expected cost earlier this year.

Rebels: Prominent Tory backbenchers Nadine Dorries and David Davis oppose the HS2 project

Nadine Dorries, Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire and opponent of the rail link said the money could be better spent on other projects.

‘There are other infrastructural priorities such as housing in our constituencies which are in desperate need and in areas of regeneration,’ she said.

HS2 ‘actually deprives finance from those valuable projects’, she said.

But fellow Conservative and former transport minister Simon Burns told MPs that Maidstone in Kent, which had opposed having the first high speed rail line in its patch was now ‘begging’ for a new station.

The MP for Chelmsford said: ‘There was one town in Kent that successfully lobbied not to have a station in its place and that was Maidstone and they stopped it.

‘It was put at Ebbsfleet and now they are begging for a station at Maidstone because they are missing out on the regeneration and improvements to the economy that Ashford and Ebbsfleet are having.'
