The woman jilted at the altar by celebrity chef Todd English stole from Bergdorf Goodman  eight years before she confessed to stealing $52,000 of merchandise from Ralph Lauren, it has been alleged.

Erica Wang, 36, who worked at the Ralph Lauren she stole from, is accused of also shoplifting from the Fifth Avenue franchise of Bergdorf Goodman on 23 February, 2004.

Sources told the New York Post about the previous arrest but details were not available as the court documents are sealed.

It comes after reports that the 36-year-old was caught 
taking almost $6,000 of clothing last Wednesday from Ralph Lauren. When she was caught by a coworker, she then confessed to 
swiping another $46,000 in merchandise.

She had been working at the designer's flagship shop, on Madison Avenue at East 72nd Street, for nearly eight months.

According to a criminal complaint 
that cited a witness, Wang stuffed nine items, worth $5,944.25, into a 
black shopping bag last week.

She was apprehended by a colleague after trying leave through the employee exit.

At this point, Wang not only confessed to the crime but also admitted her earlier theft from the shop, the complaint said.

Wang,
a former Peninsula Hotel concierge, said: 'I stole $46,194 worth of 
merchandise, not including the $6,000 I stole today,' according to the 
complaint.

She added that she 'did pay for said items and had a receipt that [she] was going to retrieve'.

But 'instead of getting said receipt, [Wang hid the] items inside of a storage room'.

She returned to the storage room the next day and hid the clothing in another location in the same room.

Wang was charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.

The source told the New York Post: 
'She’s obviously a troubled girl, and after Todd English, I don’t think 
her life has ever gotten back on track.'

English, 51, has overseen a number of eateries including The Plaza 
Hotel Food Hall in New York, Figs in Florida, and Olives in Boston and 
Las Vegas.

The restaurateur is divorced from his first wife, Olivia, with whom he had three children.

He had planned to marry Wang in October 2009 in a lavish $150,000 wedding at the St Regis Hotel in New York.

But
just hours before the ceremony, Mr English phoned Wang and told her: 'I
know this call is long overdue, but I can’t marry you today.'

'Todd English is lucky he didn’t 
marry her,' a source told the Post.

A friend said he 'wasn’t surprised' 
to hear about Wang’s latest shoplifting arrest. 'It shows that he’s not 
the biggest ass on the planet.

'She’s always been crazy and has 
always been a loose cannon,' the pal said, adding that English 'had his 
reasons' for dumping Wang.
