After five months stranded on the moon, China's Jade Rabbit lunar rover is still alive and functional, it has been reported.

Chinese state media said on yesterday that technical problems and bitterly cold lunar nights have 'weakened considerably' the buggy's ability to operate.

Despite hanging on for so long, the troubled rover could soon be heading for an icy-death, the reports said.

Jade Rabbit, named after a lunar goddess in traditional Chinese mythology, landed on the moon in December to great national fanfare. 

The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme.

The
 moon is believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral 
resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power 
generation.

'China wants to 
go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said 
China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security
 affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

'With
 the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to
 be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still 
has more, and more advanced, assets in space.

'The landing was a 
key step forward in Beijing's ambitious military-run space programme, 
which include plans for a permanent orbiting station by 2020 and 
eventually sending a human to the moon.

The buggy, which began experiencing 'mechanical control abnormalities' in late January, is on a mission to conduct geological surveys and hunt for natural resources. 

The rover is still able to send data back to Earth using the Chang'e 3 probe that delivered it, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing Li Bengzheng, deputy commander-in-chief of China's lunar programme.

But the rover's wheels and the solar panel designed for thermal insulation during the frozen lunar nights no longer work, Li said. 

The craft's functionality is progressively deteriorating 'with each lunar night,' he added.

China has been moving to develop its space programme for military, commercial and scientific purposes but it is still playing catch-up to established space powers the United States and Russia.

The Jade Rabbit and the Chang'e 3 probe marked the first 'soft landing' on the moon since 1976.

Beforehand, both the United States and the Soviet Union accomplished the feat.

'Exploration of outer space is an unremitting pursuit of mankind,' China's space agency, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said after the rover was deployed on the moon.

The mission reflects 'the new glory of China to scale the peaks in world science and technology areas,' it said, adding it was committed to exploring and using space 'for peaceful purposes'.

The lunar mission, which comes a decade after China first sent an astronaut into space, is seen as a symbol of the country's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation.

Beijing has said it plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon.
