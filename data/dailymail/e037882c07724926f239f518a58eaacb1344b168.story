Conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan insists that God is now on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s side.

The bombastic pundit's claims in a rambling diatribe posted to a conservative website that Russia is the 'third Rome' and the West ‘is Gomorrah.'

‘Putin is planting Russia’s flag firmly on the side of traditional Christianity,’ Buchanan wrote in the op-ed published by Human Events, adding that his recent speeches echo those made nearly 20 years ago by Pope John Paul II – in which the pontiff also criticized the West.

The 'third Rome': Former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan (left) believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) and God are on the same page in their fight against Western hedonism and opulence

Buchanan’s pro-Putin essay claims that Moscow is ‘the third Rome,’ a claim that goes back to the 12th century and the Byzantines, and the West is the source from which evils such as gay marriage tolerance, abortion acceptance and devil worshiping emanate.

‘Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values,’ he writes Putin said in a recent speech.

‘Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation,’ Putin espoused.

Buchanan also claims that Russia’s hostile takeover of Crimea is also part of the divine plan.

‘Western leaders who compare Putin’s annexation of Crimea to Hitler’s Anschluss with Austria… believe Putin’s claim to stand on higher moral ground is beyond blasphemous,’ writes Buchanan.

‘But Vladimir Putin knows exactly what he is doing.’

The former-Republican-presidential candidate explains that Putin is ‘entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.’

The fired former MSNBC commentator’s latest defense of the former Soviet strongman is using religion as the cloak for Russia’s military dagger.

‘The West’s capitulation to a sexual revolution of easy divorce, rampant promiscuity, pornography, homosexuality, feminism, abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, assisted suicide,’ are the evils Buchanan believes Putin is fighting against.

Moscow is the base from which the ‘cultural, social, moral war’ with the West is to be waged, claims Buchanan.

‘Where Russia’s role, in Putin’s words, is to “prevent movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state,’ he argues.

Russia’s ‘flag planted firmly in the ground,’ according to Buchanan, is ‘a ban on homosexual propaganda, a ban on abortion advertising, a ban on abortions after 12 weeks and a ban on sacrilegious insults to religious believers.’

Proof of Russia’s new role as the arbiter of taste, according to Buchanan, is that the ‘World Congress of Families VII will be held in Moscow, Sept. 10-12.’

He even suggests Putin, despite rumors of marrying his mistress and having a secret family, might even give the keynote speech.
