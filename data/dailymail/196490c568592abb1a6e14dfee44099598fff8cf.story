A woman is suing her former bosses for not letting her start work later and leave earlier to avoid the rush hour.

Andrea DeGerolamo has brought the lawsuit against Fulton Financial alleging it violated New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination by forcing her to drive to work in heavy traffic.

The lawsuit claims busy roads worsen her anxiety and depression and that bosses at Fulton failed to meet a request for a reasonable accommodation of her disability.

Stressful: Trucks and cars drive down the New Jersey Turnpike. A woman is who is suing her former employer after bosses failed to accommodate her request to start later and leave earlier to avoid the heavy traffic

It puts Camden County's federal court in the bizarre position of having to decide whether traffic jams are not just an inconvenience, but a trigger for mental health problems.

The Courier-Post reports that the lawsuit also accuses Fulton Financial of firing Ms DeGerolamo in May 2013 in retaliation for her complaints about its alleged failure to meet her medical needs.

Ms DeGerolamo took medical leave from the company in August 2012, court documents say, when she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression aggravated by 'crowded roadways'.

So acute was her traffic-induced anxiety, the lawsuit says it 'qualified her as being disabled' and, after her return to work three months later, she asked for a change to her working hours so she could 'come in after morning rush hour and leave prior to evening rush hour'.

It is alleged that Fulton Financial only accommodated the request for a short period and then changed her job, downgrading her responsibilities.

Ms DeGerolamo was fired in May 2013, shortly after she complained about to the company's ethics review board about her alleged treatment.

Attorneys for Fulton Financial have not yet made any comment on the case.
