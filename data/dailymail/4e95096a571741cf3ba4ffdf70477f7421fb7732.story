Liverpool's players trained at a snow-covered Melwood this morning ahead of their clash with high-flying West Ham United on Saturday.

Brendan Rodgers and his squad know that a win at Anfield would move them above Sam Allardyce's side, and they could find themselves in sixth if other results go their way.

Daniel Sturridge looked in full-flow during the session and the striker could be included in Rodgers' squad at weekend as they look to bounce back from the disappointment of losing to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final.

The England striker hasn't appeared for Liverpool since August and his return is a welcome boost for the Merseysiders.  

The players appeared relaxed, taking part in a number of drills and enjoying themselves in the freezing conditions

Despite all the recent speculation regarding striker Mario Balotelli's future, he was seen chatting to his manager and will be hoping that he can break his Premier League duck at the weekend.

Other big names such as Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson were all involved in the session and appeared to be showing no sign of fatigue from Tuesday night.

Liverpool will be hoping that the curse of former player comes back to haunt them, when the in-form Stewart Downing returns to Anfield with the London club.

Downing, signed from Aston Villa, spent two seasons at the Reds before being sold to this weekend's visitors.

With that in mind, Rodgers' knows that his side are in for a tough test on Saturday, in a game which could well be a turning point in their season.
