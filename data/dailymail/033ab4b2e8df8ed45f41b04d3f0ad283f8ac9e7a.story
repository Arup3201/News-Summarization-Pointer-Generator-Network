Lee Rigby’s mother yesterday called for a memorial to be built where her soldier son was brutally murdered.

On the first anniversary of the Afghanistan hero being hacked to death by cleaver-wielding Islamic fanatics, Lyn Rigby said a permanent monument would mark his ‘sacrifice and pain’ in a proper way.

But council chiefs and MPs have rejected calls for a site of remembrance.

Some cite fears that it will inflame racial tensions and become a focus for Islamic and far-Right extremists.

Lee Rigby's mother Lyn has called for a memorial to be built where her soldier son was brutally murdered

Mrs Rigby, 47, spoke out as she described being ‘trapped in hell’ by grief since her son was killed in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks, South-East London, a year ago yesterday.

‘A year on and you would never know Lee’s murder had happened,’ she said, fighting back tears.

‘There is nothing there to represent the sacrifice and pain my son suffered.‘The concerns that a memorial would attract extremists are a little late now. The terrorists did their worst when they killed my son.

‘By refusing to honour his memory in a dignified fashion, they are creating a platform for further political hatred and unrest.

‘Lee was a peaceful boy and we will never let his name be tarnished.

‘I only wish the politicians blocking his memorial could see the damage they are doing. They should be getting behind the wishes of most British people and honouring our heroes, not forgetting them.’

Lee Rigby, 25, of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had served his country courageously on the dusty battlefields of Afghanistan, risking his life facing Taliban bullets and roadside bombs.

But, having survived the deployment unscathed, the father-of-one was murdered on the supposedly safe streets of London on May 22 last year.

In scenes of almost unimaginable horror, he was run over then stabbed to death in front of horrified onlookers in a gruesome attack by two Al Qaeda-inspired maniacs.

The pair, known to the security services, shouted ‘Allah Akhbar’ – Arabic for ‘God is great’ – as they mercilessly killed the defenceless serviceman.

Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were later convicted of the murder and jailed for life.

A bronze memorial is being built in Fusilier Rigby’s home town of Middleton, near Rochdale, and his name will be inscribed on a monument for fallen servicemen at the National Memorial Arboretum, Lichfield.

But nothing has been planned to commemorate the soldier in Artillery Place, where he died.

More than 12,000 people have signed a petition organised by the Memorial For Lee Rigby campaign to raise money to build a plinth there.

A number of religious groups, including the Islamic Society of Britain and the Conservative Muslim Forum, have supported the campaign.

But local Labour MP Nick Raynsford has warned that a memorial could attract ‘undesirable interest from extremists’.

Far-Right groups could use it to stir up hatred against Muslims and it might provoke jihadists into recruiting more terrorists, he said.

The local council, the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and the Army have said the family are ‘not seeking an additional memorial’ in Woolwich.

But they have been dealing with Fusilier Rigby’s next-of-kin, his wife Rebecca. They later split up and the soldier had found new love with fiancee Aimee West, a military policewoman.

Yesterday a council spokesman said it had conducted its dealings through the Army after receiving a number of bogus letters claiming to be from Fusilier Rigby’s relatives.

The spokesman added: ‘The leader of the council is writing to Lee’s family today to establish direct contact with them and to ensure we can work alongside them as they continue to remember Lee and the sacrifice he made for his country.’

As crowds gathered in Woolwich, a private event was being held by Mrs Rigby, her partner Ian – Fusilier Rigby’s stepfather – his sisters Sara McClure and Chelsea Rigby, and widow Rebecca, with whom he had a son Jack, three.

In an interview, Mrs Rigby said she was haunted by visions of her son’s death and had paid a midnight visit to his grave as she fought grief.

She said: ‘No parent should ever have to bury a child but the nature of Lee’s death was so violent that I can barely sleep at night, haunted by the images of my child lying bloodied and fatally wounded on the street

‘If I close my eyes I see Lee covered in blood. And when I do fall asleep I have nightmares in which I am running to try to save my son.

‘I wake up in cold sweats with my heart thumping and feel like I am going to die. The grief is so intense it makes my body hurt physically. I don’t think I will ever get over my Lee’s murder.’

She described walking to his grave one cold and rainy night for the comfort of being close to the soldier.

‘I sat for half an hour beside his tombstone and sobbed in the dark. I talked to him as if he were still alive and told him how much I loved him. It was a very bleak and lonely time because the pain just wouldn’t go away.

‘Every day is like being trapped in hell and it doesn’t get any better.’ 

Mrs Rigby last saw Fusilier Rigby on Easter Sunday, March 31 last year - and seven weeks later he was dead.

She said: ‘I still keep thinking Lee is going to burst through the door with a huge grin on his face.

‘Then I remember he has gone for ever. And I recall how he met his death and another giant wave of pain and sorrow engulfs me.’
