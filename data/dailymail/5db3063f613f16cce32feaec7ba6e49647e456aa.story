We are used to her trust up in a corset, and floor length aristocratic attire as the Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey.

But
 dressed down actress Elizabeth McGovern told of her ‘bipolar’
 lifestyle and how she still hangs on to her sexuality as the lead 
rock-chick vocalist of Sadie and the Hotheads.

Lifting
 the lid on being comfortable in her own skin, the 52-year-old performer
 dismissed raunchy singers such as Madonna claiming it isn’t ‘stilettos 
and corsets’ which make a woman of a certain age sexy.

The
 mother-of-two – who married British film director and producer Simon 
Curtis in 1992 – said she wished to silence the ‘myth’ women over 50 
couldn’t be sexy, arguing this is actually when women are at their peak.

But
 when it comes to what influences her daughters, Miss McGovern told how 
she is unimpressed by young music artists who use ‘vacuous’ sexuality 
within their music – describing it as  ‘a meal with no nutrients.’

The Downton star, said: ‘I feel bipolar at the moment I keep jumping from Sadie to Lady Crawley.‘But in terms of me, I don’t put any strain on myself to be anything other than I am.

‘I
 don’t feel like I should try to be younger but having said that I feel 
very passionate about his idea that because I’m 52 years old it doesn’t 
mean I’ve left my own sexuality behind.

‘I
 think there’s a myth that if you are a woman in your fifties and you’re
 not Madonna or if you’re not wearing stiletto heels and a corset that 
you are kind of settled in to middle age.

‘But
 I want to be the one to stay that just isn’t the case, I feel your 
sexuality and the expression of that is at its peak for a woman in her 
50s.

‘I’m really happy to be embracing that in my look and my music – not in a ‘hey I’m 20’ kind of way but in loving being my age.

‘Just
 because you’re 50 it doesn’t mean it’s not happening for you any more, 
you have every right to express your sexuality. I think for someone 
younger it’s a very different thing.’

However
 the American-born star, who started singing with Sadie and the Hotheads
 in 2008, told how as was sometimes made ‘uncomfortable’ by singers like
 Miley Cyrus when she thought of her daughters Matilda, 20, and Grace, 
16.

Miss McGovern admitted she
 would rather they looked up to women who have ‘put their brains’ into 
their work –preferring them to look up to musicians like country singer 
Taylor Swift.

The performer, 
who opened for Sting at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July, added: ‘I 
don’t mind explicit sexuality in young women if it is married to 
something with some kind of depth, or meaning of some kind.

‘But
 sadly so much of music is enthralled with lyrics and image which is so 
sexually vacuous, it’s just without any depth what so ever and that’s 
what makes me so uncomfortable.

Grooving: The actress and singer threw some shapes on the London stage

‘I think being provocative in an empty way is actually rather boring.

‘I
 don’t think it’s had a terrible effect on my kids, but I hope they see 
it like I do in that there is no meat there. It is a meal with no 
nutrition, it’s just something to look at rather than there being any 
real muse or idea behind it.

‘I
 actually if I look for inspiration I look to someone like Taylor Swift.
 She is very authentic and classy.

She has managed to inject her brain 
into her music and her ideas and I think she is a wonderful example for 
women, especially for young women, for them to see another woman 
building it from scratch and being successful.’

Miss
 McGovern actress first appeared in 1980 film Ordinary People and won an
 Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress in the film 
Ragtime.

She joined the cast of Julian Fellowes’ Downton Abbey in 2010, cast as Cora Crawley in the ITV1 period drama.

Starting
 a tour with Sadie and the Hotheads this month, the band’s latest album 
‘Still Waiting’ is available now and described as ‘European Americana’ 
folk rock in style. Fellow Downton star Michelle Dockery, who plays Lady
 Mary, has also previously been known to join the group on stage.
