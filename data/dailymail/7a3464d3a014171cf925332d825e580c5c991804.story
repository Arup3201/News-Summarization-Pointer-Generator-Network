The husband of a woman accused of murdering her newborn baby unknowingly threw the remains in a hospital garbage can before authorities made the gruesome discovery.

Housekeeper Santos Elena Ruiz Solano, 26, secretly gave birth to a baby girl last month at her millionaire boss's mansion in West Islip, Long Island.

Solano was ordered to be held without bail on Wednesday. She was indicted on both intentional murder and depraved indifference murder counts by a Suffolk County grand jury.

Solano pleaded not guilty in court today, claiming the baby was stillborn. She is being held without bond and is due back in court on April 1.

She was arrested last month after prosecutors say she gave birth in her employer's West Islip bathroom. She allegedly killed the newborn, put her in a bag, and brought the remains to Southside Hospital in Bay Shore while seeking post-birth treatment.

It was at the hospital where she asked her unknowing husband Selvin Adonis Hernandez to throw the bag of her daughter's remains away. He claims to have not known that the baby's body was in the bag.

Solano, who entered the country illegally from Honduras, says she was raped while crossing the border.

Solano's attorney Michael Brown says he will hire an independent 
medical examiner to determine his client did not murder her child, according to Newsday. Brown reiterated that the baby was stillborn and cited 
his client's lack of criminal history prior to her arrest.

According to the autopsy, the baby was alive at birth before suffering blunt impact injuries to the skull.
