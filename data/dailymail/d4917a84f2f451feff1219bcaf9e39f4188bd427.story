Trainer Ralph Beckett will not employ a new stable jockey after deciding his policy of using the best rider available will continue into next season.

Beckett has booked his former No 1 Jim Crowley to ride Dutch Law at Kempton (3.10) on Monday afternoon, the first time the jockey has ridden for Beckett since abruptly ending his five-year stint in August.

But Beckett said he had decided against a permanent replacement after a recent ‘Damascene moment’ when employing four different riders produced career bests.

Beckett said: ‘I am going to be using the best available and who suits a horse best.’

Beckett used Oisin Muphy on heavily eased winner Air Pilot on Saturday. The gelding is now as short as 6-1 favourite for this weekend’s Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket.

Trainer Charlie Hills is considering an entry in the Prix de L’Abbaye at Longchamp on October 5 for Cotai Glory, who unseated jockey George Baker when easily winning the Flying Childers Stakes at Doncaster.
