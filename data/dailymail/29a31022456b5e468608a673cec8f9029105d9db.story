Crippling staff shortages and a failing system to screen criminals have left Britain’s borders in a state of chaos, officials warn today.

Terrorists and offenders are slipping through the net, while tens of millions of passengers are arriving on flights and ferries without proper background checks, they say.

In a devastating report, Westminster’s spending watchdog highlighted massive security flaws at the country’s ports and airports.

Chaos: Officials were more worried about queuing times than rigorous checks

Open border: Crippling staff shortages mean that officials are being pulled off key checks for drugs, weapons and illegal migrants

The inquiry by the National Audit Office found the database used to stop terrorists, dangerous criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain – the Warnings Index system – is deeply ‘unstable’.

Border security is being undermined by staff shortages, with immigration officials being pulled off checks on drugs, weapons and illegal migrants to help hit passenger queue targets, it said.

It also uncovered a ‘culture of fear’ within the agency that prevents staff from raising the alarm over border lapses.

Meanwhile, personal details on one third of the 106million people entering Britain every year are not handed over in advance, meaning nearly 40million do not undergo background checks before they land.

Flying visit: MPs warned that border checks are so lax that so-called 'easyJet criminals' are flying into Britain and out again on the same day

The audit’s results came as MPs warned border checks in Britain are so lax that the country is at the mercy of ‘easyJet criminals’ who fly in and out on the same day without detection.

In an evidence session with police, Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said foreign nationals with convictions overseas can enter the UK, go on a crime spree and then leave hours later without being caught.

Even if police are hunting them, they are not stopped because border guards are not checking people as they leave the country.

Of the criminals who are being trapped by Britain’s biggest force, an astonishing 28 per cent a year – or around 70,000 – are born overseas.

Half of them are from inside the EU, where cheap flights to Britain on budget airlines are readily available.

Some 35 per cent of the foreign criminals have convictions at home but nothing was done to stop them entering the UK.

Incredibly, 8 per cent of the foreign nationals picked up by the Met in London were wanted by police in their homeland but still arrived here unhindered.

Police commander Allan Gibson replied: ‘That is a matter for the UK Border Agency because I don’t police people leaving the country.’

The NAO inquiry focused on the Warnings Index system to check for foreign criminals. It was set up in the early 1990s and was designed to last just seven years, but it has now been running for more than 20.

Fed by intelligence from immigration authorities, police, security services and foreign governments, it will raise a ‘red flag’ when a suspect trying to enter the country has their passport scanned.

This should prompt immigration officials to detain them for questioning.

John Vine, of Borders and Immigration, has described it as the ‘single most important electronic check carried out by the Agency on passengers arriving in the UK’.

But the NAO said the Warnings Index system ‘contains a great deal of out-of-date information’.

Officials warned that as well as duplicate data it also contains a raft of errors such as the misspelling of a name which could allow a wanted criminal to waltz into Britain unchecked.

The whole system is ‘now unstable and at risk of collapsing’, they said.

As part of the £1.2billion e-borders scheme to check those entering Britain, airlines and ferry companies are meant to send information about their passengers in advance of flights arriving in Britain.

Labour ministers had intended the scheme to cover 95 per cent of flights by 2010 but the report revealed they are only collecting information on 63 per cent of passengers, meaning nearly 40million out of 106million arrivals are not advance checked before they reach Britain.

Furthermore, a ministerial edict to hit queue targets, combined with staff shortages, meant there were not enough officials to carry out lorry searches for illegal stowaways or to search for weapons, drugs, counterfeit goods and cigarettes, the report said.

Auditors said lorry searches were suspended 22 times in three days in April this year to deal with queues or to allow staff to take meal breaks.

Staff were also ‘too busy’ to properly interrogate arrivals suspected of intending to remain in Britain illegally – allowing in hundreds every month who should have been turned away. In April last year the numbers refused entry fell to 64 per cent of the target.

MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee, said it was ‘deeply worrying’ that the Border Force drive to cut queuing time came ‘at the expense of its other responsibilities’.

Between 2010 and 2012, some 500 staff were cut out of the 8,000 Border Force workforce, as its budget fell by nearly £50million.

Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘The Border Force must be able to check both goods and passengers at the same time – border security cannot be an ‘either/or’ choice.’ 

Immigration minister Mark Harper said: 'The UK operates one of the most secure borders in the world and I am pleased the National Audit Office recognises the success of Border Force in implementing full passenger checks while also reducing queue times.

‘We inherited an organisation with significant challenges and, while some of these remain, I am confident that under the long term leadership of the new director general, Sir Charles Montgomery, Border Force will continue to build on its many areas of excellence.

‘We have recruited more Border Force staff, established command centres to deploy those staff more flexibly and effectively and are reforming working practices.’
