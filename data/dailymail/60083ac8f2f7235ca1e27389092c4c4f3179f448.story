Martin Skrtel is set to become the second Liverpool player banned for stamping in the defeat to Manchester United after he was charged with violent conduct by the FA..

The Slovakia defender is alleged to have deliberately trodden on goalkeeper David de Gea towards the end of United’s 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday, leading to an angry confrontation between the two players after the final whistle.

The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. Skrtel, 30, has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge.

Liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when Skrtel followed through on David De Gea but Atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win. 

Teammate Steven Gerrard has already been hit with a three-match ban after he was sent off for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. It would be a further blow to Liverpool’s hopes of overhauling United in the race for a top-four finish if Skrtel is suspended as well.

The centre-back was pushed forward in search of an equaliser and trod on De Gea as the United goalkeeper slid in to gather the ball at his feet.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted that the video footage did not look good in slow motion, but insisted that Skrtel was going for the ball.

He said: ‘The ball has been played through and it looks like, when it is slowed down, that he has caught him with intent. I didn’t see it like that. He is trying to get the ball.’

But a statement from the FA read: ‘Martin Skrtel has been charged by the FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.

‘In Premier League matches, if an incident has not been seen by the match officials, a three-man panel of former elite officials will be asked by the FA to review the footage independently of each other.

‘For an FA charge to follow, all three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence. In this instance, the decision by the panel was unanimous.’

Liverpool will already be missing Steven Gerrard for the next three games, after his red card on Sunday

Martin Skrtel has been charged by The FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.

The charge is in relation to an incident involving the Liverpool defender and Manchester United's David de Gea which occurred in the 95th minute of Sunday's game.

The player has until 6pm on 24 March 2015 to respond to the charge.

In Premier League matches, if an incident has not been seen by the match officials, a three-man panel of former elite officials will be asked by The FA to review the footage independently of each other.

They will then advise what, if any action, they believe the match referee should have taken had it been witnessed at the time.

For an FA charge to follow, all three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence.

In this instance, the decision by the panel was unanimous.
