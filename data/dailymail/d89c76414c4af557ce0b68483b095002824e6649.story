A British adventurer is planning to spend an entire year living on the tip of an iceberg off the coast of Greenland.

Explorer Alex Bellini hopes to stay on the iceberg for up to a year so long as it does not melt too quickly.

His stay will begin in spring 2015 and will take place North West of Greenland.

Alex Bellini plans to spend a year living on an iceberg and says finding the right one will be an adventure in itself

He hopes to identify an iceberg to live on that is flat and measures 60metres long by 20metres wide

Due to icebergs' varying lengths of existence, Mr Bellini and his team are yet to identify the exact iceberg on which he will live.

They will also examine other survival factors, such as how the 36-year-old will gather or store food and the water he will be drinking.

Mr Bellini's previous feats include running more than 14,000 miles, rowing more than 21,000 miles and spending 560 days in isolation.

He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control.

His latest venture was inspired by Italian pilot Umberto Nobile who in 1928 flew over the North Pole.

Mr Bellini says he is aware of the risks involved but is confident he will be home in 12 months' time

But on his return his airship crashed leaving 11 individuals stranded on ice for 40 days.

Mr Bellini said: 'This adventure will force me to survive and teach me important lessons about this issue.

'Finding the right iceberg - size, shape, position and safety - will be an adventure itself as well as minimising the risk.'

While he has not yet identified the exact iceberg which will become his new home, he knows he will require one that is flat and is approximately 60metres long and 20metres wide.

He said: 'There is no way to predict the date which the iceberg will have completely melted - it depends on many factors.

'The iceberg we choose could be either a new one or an old one, carved in the past, but whatever happens, after 12 months I'll be back home.'

Should the iceberg melt to a size that is too small to continue accommodating him, he'll use his shelter as a life raft to go adrift and await rescue by a passing ship - which he expects to take seven to 10 days.
