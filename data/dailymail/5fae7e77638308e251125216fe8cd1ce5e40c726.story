If they weren't already dreaming of another title in May - they will be now.

Manchester City players have had bedrooms at their new £200million training complex fitted with sleep-inducing wallpaper.

The Premier League stars will drift off to the sight of walls patterned with light green ever-decreasing circles.

As well as the rest-aiding designs, £150,000 has been spent on special mattresses and luxurious pillows. 

The new 80-bedroom base, which sits alongside the football club's stadium, also features pool tables, arcade games and a social area.

Man City's Argentinian defender, Pablo Zabaleta, told the Sun: 'It's better than being in a hotel. It's more private here, we don't see people around - it's more comfortable for the team.

'The facilities - the dressing room, the spa, even the canteen is fantastic - everything you can imagine is there.

Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta said the new training complex is 'better than being in a hotel'

'As a player you come here each day thinking: 'I'd rather be here than my house!''

The Premier League champions have been based at the state-of-the-art City Football Academy (CFA) since October, but officially opened the doors last month at a glitzy ceremony attended by club greats and Chancellor George Osborne.

Former player Patrick Vieira, who runs City's elite development squad, said: 'When we started training here with the boys I looked around and said "how amazing". 

'I think this is one of the best, if not the best, facilities in the world,' he said of the 80-acre base that was previously a polluted brownfield site.

'If we go into the market and we compete to bring young players or first team players in, having a facility like this can only help.

The training complex is linked to the club's Etihad Stadium by a long bridge that straddles Alan Turing Way

'When you are a young, talented player from Manchester - or worldwide - you want the best possible facilities to challenge and improve yourself.'

The complex is connected to the Etihad Stadium by bridge and houses all of the club's teams, from age-group sides to men's and women's senior squads - a total in excess of 450 individuals weekly.

The first team will stay on site the night before home matches, while Vieira's elite development squad team and Manchester City Women will play at an integrated 7,000-capacity stadium.

City have won two Premier League titles since Sheikh Mansour took over - and now boast world-class facilities
