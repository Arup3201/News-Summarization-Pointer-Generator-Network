Floral pattern: Detectives investigating the discovery of a woman's body in a university lake have released this photograph of a dress she was wearing

This is the floral dress found on a woman’s body that was discovered in a university lake.

Detectives released the image of the dress, having not been able to identify the mystery woman since her body was recovered from the beauty spot at the University of East Anglia.

They launched a nationwide investigation following Thursday's discovery, after concluding she was not a university  student or employee and finding no links to any missing people inquiries in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridgeshire.

The 'distinctive' dress found in Norwich, which is black with a large peach or cream rose pattern and a slightly gathered neckline and hem, is size 10 and has ties on the shoulders but has no labels indicating where it was bought.

Detective Inspector Richard Graveling of Norwich CID said: ‘This is a fairly distinctive dress and we’re keen to hear from anyone who may have seen a woman matching the description and wearing this item in the area around the university in the early part of last week.

‘We are unable to establish where the dress was purchased and would be keen to hear from any retailers who believe they stock the item.’

The woman, who was spotted floating face down in the water by an angler, was 5ft 7ins, slim and in her late 30s or early 40s.

Discovery: Norfolk Fire and Rescue search the Broad on the campus of the University of East Anglia after the body of a woman was recovered from the water on Thursday

Investigation: Police cordon at the Broad on the campus of the University of Anglia where the body of a woman was found floating face down near a small beach area

Search: The woman's body was recovered from the beauty spot at the University of East Anglia last week

Probe: Police have launched a nationwide search after concluding she was not a student or employee at the university and finding no links to any missing people inquiries in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridgeshire

She had short dark brown hair with a natural wave, which had been dyed auburn or dark red.

A post-mortem examination has so far failed to establish the cause of death and further tests are being carried out.

Mr Graveling said: ‘There is no evidence at this stage to suggest the woman was the victim of violence or that a third party was involved.

‘However we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the discovery.’
