Thirteen people have been taken to hospital after they were exposed to a hazardous lab chemical at a Colorado university.

Colorado Springs firefighters and hazmat crews rushed to Colorado College's Olin Hall at around 3 p.m. yesterday after reports that students and school staff had been exposed to titanium tetrachloride.

According to student newspaper The Catalyst, the incident happened when a group of chemistry students were drilling into a pressurized container to obtain the substance.

Exposed: Emergency personnel help a victim to the ambulance Wednesday, April 10, 2013, after a chemical spill in a science building at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colo.

The building was evacuated and two people who were suffering severe respiratory issues in different parts of the hall had to be rescued by firefighters because they couldn't get out on their own.

'That was their first priority,' fire department spokeswoman Sunny Smaldino told The Gazette.

'When they arrived here, they heard people were down. They went in, and they made sure that everybody was out of the building.'

Titanium tetrachloride is 'highly 
irritating to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes in humans,' according 
to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Short-term exposure 'may result in surface skin burns and marked congestion and constriction of various sections of the upper respiratory tract in humans. Acute exposure may also damage the eyes.'

The 13 people exposed to the chemical were decontaminated before they were sent to hospital.

Firefighters said only one person - a
Colorado College employee - remained in serious condition on Wednesday 
evening but is expected to recover.

The fire alarm went off just hours after the school tested its emergency mass notification system, according to The Catalyst.

This confused some students who thought the second alarm was part of the exercise. 'This is not a drill,' the system warned students after the exposure.

All campus buildings and nearby roads were shut down after the evacuation but most were reopened by around 8 p.m. last night.

Monika Rozkowska, a senior, told KOAA.com that students became worried after smoke started filling the building.

'Some of my friends in the anatomy class a few doors down said all they saw was just smoke everywhere and then everybody had to be evacuated,' she said.
