A U.S. engineer has created an electric superbike made of lightweight carbon fibre that can reach speeds of 150mph and go from 0 to 60 in just three seconds.

His aim is to create the ultimate eco bike that outperforms traditional, petrol guzzling superbikes on performance and driving experience.

The Mission RS bike features a two-wheeled electric propulsion system and claims to the the most advanced and fastest street-legal electric motorbike in the world.

The bike has a 120kW electric motor combined with an 'InfiniteDrive' powertrain, which gives the vehicle 160 brake horsepower.

The company, based in New York City, says the bike has 'unprecedented levels of control and performance never seen before in any electric vehicle.'

But it also has as hefty price tag of $72,499, or £44,700, and only 40 are being produced.

The super bike also boasts 'MissionOS' - a user interface that lets a driver access an on-board GPS system, Bluetooth and an image-stabilised HD camera, as well as the usual readings (pictured) via an HD touchscreen

The super bike is devoid of pistons, crankshaft, clutch and other mechanical parts rotating at thousands of rounds per minute and is almost silent.

Without the inertial forces created by hundreds of heavy spinning machine parts, the Mission RS 'drops into corners' easily and its linear power delivery system means the driver does not need to bother with using a clutch and gearbox.

A custom-built chassis means the bike can be as agile as a superbike, while still having 'straight line stability'.

The super bike also boasts 'MissionOS' - a smart user interface that integrates mobile phone applications and has a high resolution touch screen.

It lets a driver access an on-board GPS system, Bluetooth and an image-stabilised HD camera.

The company said: 'Seamlessly integrating turn-by-turn navigation, communications, controls, track mode and ride telemetry data, MissionOS rewrites the current expectations of motorcycle and rider interaction.'
