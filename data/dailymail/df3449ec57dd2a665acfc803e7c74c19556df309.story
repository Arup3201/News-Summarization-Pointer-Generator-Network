The owner of a school bus that exploded into a fireball on a Queensland highway on Tuesday has warned that this could happen to more buses due to engine manufacturers being forced cut emissions.

Passengers included students and teachers who managed to escape in time, minutes before the bus burst into flames on the Sunshine Coast, north of Brisbane.

The bus was engulfed by flames when firefighters arrived.

Paul West, of West National Coaches, says there had been a rise in the number of bus fires in not only Australia but also around the world.

He believes such incidents could be the ramifications of a new environmental rule which forced engine manufacturers to reduce emissions.

'Because of the change, there is an enormous amount of pressure put on diese,' Mr West told The Queensland Times.

'Aviation fuel normally can't burn, but under pressures it burns beyond belief.'

Michael Apps, executive director of Bus Industry Confederation, agreed with Mr West's comments.

He says there's no doubt that newer low emission vehicles operate on higher temperatures.

Consequently this increases the risk of the vehicle to catch fire after there has been leaking fluid such as coolant, he said.

The 61 high school students and three teachers were on an excursion when the bus caught alight on the Bruce Highway, near Chevallum, before 1pm on Tuesday.

The bus was taking a group of year 10 students from Maroochydore High School back to their school from a careers expo, the Sunshine Coast Daily reported.

One of the students, Mason Hope, described the moment he called his grandmother to tell her why he'd be late home.

'[I told her] the bus is on fire. We just heard bang after bang and explosion after explosion. It's crazy,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily.

When the fireball subsided the bus was nothing but a charred shell

Pictures show the large coach fully engulfed in flames and the charred remains as firefighters attend the scene.

Plumes of black smoke can be seen billowing out from the site of the crash, backing up traffic for miles along the highway.

Paramedics treated five passengers at the scene, including two who suffered smoke inhalation, a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said.

The investigation into the cause is ongoing.
