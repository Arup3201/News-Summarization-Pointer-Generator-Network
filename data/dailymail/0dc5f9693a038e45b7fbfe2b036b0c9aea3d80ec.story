The convicted killer of a lottery winner won't be able to keep the million-dollar home he bought and 'sold' to her.

A judge in Lakeland, Florida ruled Wednesday that an expensive home and other assets be returned to the estate of deceased lottery-winner Abraham Shakespeare.

Judge J Dale Durrance wrote that there was no evidence Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore ever purchased the home on Red Hawk Bend Drive from Abraham.

Moore swindled the home and other assets from Shakespeare when she was pretending to write a book about the people taking advantage of him.

Shakespeare paid $1million for the house when he bought it in 2007.

Shakespeare's sons have been fighting to get the assets back since Moore was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison last December.

Luck, then tragedy: Mr Shakespeare collected his massive lottery check with his family by his side in 2006. His body was found buried behind a house in April 2009

Stephen Martin, the lawyer representing Shakespeare's sons, told The Ledger that they expect to sell the home and will attempt to collect on the mortgages.

Moore killed Shakespeare in April 2009, after he won a $30million lottery jackpot in 2006.

Prosecutors
said the 41-year-old Moore befriended Shakespeare in late 2008, 
claiming she was writing a book about how people were taking advantage 
of him.

They claim Moore later became his financial adviser, eventually controlling every asset he had left after his death, including an expensive home, the debt owed to him and a $1.5 million annuity.

'She got every bit of his money,' said Assistant State Attorney Jay Pruner in closing arguments. 'He found out about it and threatened to kill her. She killed him first.'

Shakespeare's body was discovered under a concrete slab behind a home detectives say was owned by Moore's ex-boyfriend in Hillsborough County. He had been shot twice.
