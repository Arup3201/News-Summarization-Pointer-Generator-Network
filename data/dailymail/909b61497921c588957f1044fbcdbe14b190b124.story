It marks the end of innocence in America’s last trusting city.

Police in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have advised local residents to stop leaving keys to their cars inside their unlocked vehicles.

Vehicle thefts are up more than 110 per cent in the city with a population of 127,000 since the start of June, compared with April and May.

‘The Cedar Rapids Police Department requests that citizens not leave the keys to their car in the car,’ said Cedar Rapids Sergeant Cristy Hamblin.

‘When you exit your car, take the keys with you and lock the car.’

Owners of almost two-thirds of the 34 stolen vehicles told police they left their keys in an unlocked vehicle, reported the Des Moines Register.

Police have recovered more than half of the stolen cars - and the 18 they discovered were taken from all across the city.

Cops say the problem is such an issue in the area that they have come up with a top 10 list of reasons why it happens.

They include: ‘That way, I know where they are’, ‘my husband always loses them’ and ‘I didn’t think this happened in my neighbourhood.’

Others were: ‘There was only a little bit of gas in it’, ‘I didn’t think anyone would want it’ and, more simply, ‘I forgot’.

‘From an insurance standpoint, it’s still a covered loss,’ Cedar Rapids insurance agent Doug Valentine told thegazette.com.

But he added that car theft rates in the area are still far below the national average and theft claims are rare.

‘Most of the companies have special investigative units and that, sometimes, there are reasons the keys are left in,’ he added.

‘People may be upside down in their loan and think the insurance will pay off.’

An informal thegazette.com survey conducted by walking around the area spotted seven vehicles out of 400 with keys still in the ignition.
