Outstanding student: George Huynh seen here in a recent picture has gained admission to Yale next year and his success was announced today by the reporter who first told his and his brother's story in Boston two years ago

On Monday Twitter began to buzz with the story of two young Vietnamese Americans who have defied their poverty stricken upbringing to win admission to two of the nation's top colleges and define the American Dream.

Despite their abusive father's suicide, their mother's mental illness and a life of near-destitution in one of Boston's toughest neighborhoods, Boston teenagers Johnny and George Huynh have become straight A students

Their tale of how they used their god-given talent to better themselves first came to light in a 2011 report by Boston Globe journalist Billy Baker.

And now, almost two years to the day since it was published, he live-tweeted the satisfying news that George, 17, had gained admission to Ivy League college, Yale.

Recounting the boys story through Twitter, Baker revealed to those unfamiliar with the Huynh's struggles how difficult it was for them to rise from one of Boston's most impoverished neighborhoods to find themselves at Yale and UMass Amherst - where Johnny, 19, is now studying.

Their father, David Huynh, had fought with the United States during the Vietnam War, but was put through traumatic 're-education' by the communist victors - a chilling synonym no doubt for brutal torture.

Their mother, Nhung Bui, four years younger than David, had not wanted to marry him, finding him slightly unhinged.

However, her parents pressured her to - reminding her that for his service with the Americans they would find immigration to the United States easier.

But, despite promises of 'money falling from the sky', Nhung Bui and David struggled after arriving in Boston in 1992.

Their two sons and one daughter were born in the States, but they had precious little money and Nhung Bui endured 'private horrors' from her husband in addition to battling her own mental problems.

Their father left their home in the rough neighborhood of Dorchester and when he died he left a wife who could not speak English and children who could barely speak Vietnamese.

However, the sliver of hope for Johnny and George was that they found themselves attending the famous Boston Latin School - the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States, where Founding Fathers, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin studied.

Prestige for the hardworking: Boston Latin School has seen students such as JFK's father Joe Kennedy and five of the 65 Founding Father's walk its halls

Their academic excellence carried them to the notice of Baker, who became intrigued by the daily dedication of Johnny, then 17 and George, then 15, to making the most of the slim opportunities afforded them.

In addition to their brilliance at school, Baker painted a portrait of normal teenagers, struggling with adolescent problems.

'I’m jealous,’ Johnny told Baker in his Boston Globe piece, describing a North Face jacket that many of his schoolmates owned.

'But I’m only jealous because I have to work to get the bare necessities. That’s my only option.’

So poor were the boys when the article about them was published that they worried they would not be afford to buy that days paper.

Setting the Twittersphere alight: Billy Baker live tweeted the admission of his protegé into Yale University today and couldn't have been prouder

Admitted: George Huynh took to Twitter to announce that he had indeed made it to Yale - after years of hard work with encouragement only from one or two others - including his brother and reporter Billy Baker

Baker took them to the presses to be handed the first edition and realized after the piece that he could not now leave them to their lives.

'I stayed close to the boys, party out of an obligation, but mostly because I cared about them. They inspired me. And they were fun,' said the father-of-two.

Becoming something of a mentor to the boys, Baker paid for dinners where he caught up with their lives and even helped bring a fridge to the dorm of Johnny when he became a freshman at UMass Amherst.

Next step: While his brother is currently studying at the no-less prestigious UMass Amherst - George is to start courses next year at Ivy League school Yale

The story did not stop there. Baker assisted George with his school work and encouraged him to aim as high as his grades and ability suggested he could go.

And then today, in an emotional volley of tweets, Baker revealed that the youngest Huynh had gained admission to Yale and as icing on the cake - had his braces removed.

Admitting to crying on Twitter, Baker then revealed he was to take out George for a slap-up meal to celebrate.

'And we've ended up at Wahlburgers! Seems fitting for a Dorchester kid made good to celebrate with a burger cooked by a Wahlberg.'
