A couple have completed a 'bucket list' they put together for their severely disabled unborn son.

When Jenna Haley was 13 weeks pregnant, their son was diagnosed with anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull - many newborns with the condition die soon after birth.

That is when Jenna and her husband Dan from Philadelphia came up with the idea of a 'bucket list'  - a list of places they wanted to share with their son - vowing to do as many as possible during Jenna's pregnancy.

After the diagnosis the couple came up with the idea of a 'bucket list' - a list of places they wanted to share with their son - vowing to do as many as possible during Jenna's pregnancy

'Most families wait until their baby is born to start making memories and traveling to places with them,' Dan said to ABC 13.

'We understood what it was and knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him.'

The couple have named their son Shane Michael Haley and created a Facebook page so they could keep all their family and friends updated - it now has more than 100,000 people following.

Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. 

During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus.

This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp.

Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. 

They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer.

The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. 

The couple wrote on their Facebook page:  

'On April 10, 2014 Shane was diagnosed with a terminal neural tube defect called anencephaly. 

'This occurs roughly in every 1 out of 5,500 pregnancies. 

'The life expectancy of infants with anencephaly ranges from hours to days, with a few cases where children have survived more than a year. 

'We are asking for your prayers and support and that God grants us as much time as possible with our beautiful son. 

'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing. 

'Follow us through our various adventures as we take Shane to some of our favorite childhood places.'

Their travels took them to sporting events to beaches to New York including visiting landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Times Square and the Empire State Building.

Their son is due October 12 and the couple have been so busy they completed the list by September 8.

'We truly value every minute that we have with our son,' says Dan,

'We thank God every night for blessing us with such a special little boy.'
