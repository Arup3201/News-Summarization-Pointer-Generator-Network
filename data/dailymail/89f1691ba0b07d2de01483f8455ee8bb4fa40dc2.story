Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has shocked Twitter followers by offering £50,000 to anyone who could identify - and break the arms of - a sinister tweeter who threatened to harm his daughter.

The self-made millionaire became embroiled in a row yesterday afternoon after receiving a string of anonymous threats via the micro-blogging service.

The messages threatened to 'bring hurt and pain' to his family unless he handed over £35,000.

Reward: Duncan Bennatyne sent out this message to his 372,000 followers

And although Mr Bannatyne later withdrew his threat, the entrepreneur said 'I'd gladly do my time' to get revenge on the anonymous tweeter.

The TV star received a series of tweets from someone calling himself Yuri Vasilyev, linking to a message threatening to harm Hollie Bannatyne, 25.

He responded by posting: 'I offer £25,000 reward for the capture of the coward who calls himself @YuriVasilyev_ Double if his arms are broken first'.

Although this tweet was soon deleted, Mr Bannatyne posted another message saying: 'OK £30,000 reward for info leading to his arrest'.

The drama began yesterday, when he 
received a message from the Twitter account @YuriVasilyev_ which linked 
to a message about Holly.

It read: 'Dear Dragon. My name is 
Yuri Vasilyev and I'm looking for a £35,000 investment to stop us 
hurting your Hollie Bannatyne. We will bring hurt and pain into your 
life.

'We are watching her. She is very attractive. Want photos? Tweet using the hashtag £4money to confirm payment will be made.'

A
later message said: 'Duncan Bannatyne - Hollie is going to get hurt. We
will bring pain and fear. You should have expected us. We are the men 
of Belarus.

'We do not give up. We will stand 
tall. You should have paid. £35,000 to stop it. Contact us to pay. We 
are watching. Expect us. We are the men of Belarus.'

Despite Vasilyev's claim to be from Belarus, Mr Bannatyne has said that he believes him to be in Moscow.

His latest message to Vasilyev reads: 'Go home to your mum and cry we are closing in on you little boy'. That message was also later deleted.

Mr Bannatyne's threats have met a mixed reaction from Twitter users.

Many have helped to try to locate Vasilyev, although this is unlikely to be successful without tracking him down electronically, as 'Yuri Vasilyev' is a common name in Russian-speaking countries.

But one user, speculating that Vasilyev was using a fake name, told Mr Bannatyne: 'Whoever the real Yuri Vasileyev is I hope hijacking his identity & ur call to vigilantes doesnt end in his injury or death.' [sic]

Mr Bannatyne said in a statement: 'My family is well protected, but I take any threat to them very seriously and will do all I can to ensure the person or people involved are caught.'

Last night, police issued a statement saying: 'Durham Constabulary can confirm Duncan Bannatyne has reported a number of threatening messages he had received via email and Twitter in which threats were made against a member of his family.

'These appeared to originate from an email address based in Russia.

'We have been liaising since then with Mr Bannatyne and conducting enquiries into the credibility of these threats.'

Mr Bannatyne contacted the Durham Constabulary because his family have long been based in the North East.
