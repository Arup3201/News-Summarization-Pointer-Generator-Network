Charlie Rose interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at his palace in Damascus this morning and will air the entire interview tomorrow, just one day before President Obama is set to address the nation.

While Congress debates whether or not to carry out military strikes against Syria, President al-Assad told Mr Rose that he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on August 21 that killed 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children.

Speaking from Beirut, Lebanon on Face the Nation, Mr Rose relayed some of what President al-Assad said in their interview.

Denial: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad spoke to Charlie Rose in an exclusive interview where he said that he had no knowledge of a chemical weapons attack and that no such attack could be proved

While he insists he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on the suburbs of Damascus last month, 'he does accept some of the responsibility'.

Mr Rose asked the president whether or not he felt any remorse.

'He said "Of course I do," but it did not come in a way that was sort of deeply felt inside. It was much more of a calm reaction of anybody who's a leader of a country would feel terrible about what's happened to its citizens,' Mr Rose said. 

Mr al-Assad said 'there's not enough 
evidence to make a conclusive judgement' about whether the attack 
happened or not, but also suggested that the rebels might have had 
something to do with it.

Sit down: Excerpts were aired Monday morning and the full interview will come Monday evening, the same day that President Obama will be trying to convince members of Congress to support a military strike against Syria

Threats: Assad said that if America makes an attack, they should 'expect everything'

But the Obama Administration has been making a case counter to that claim.

Today,
 White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said there was 'no question 
in my mind' that President al-Assad carried out the August 21 attack 
that seemed to use the toxic Sarin gas.

The
 administration has been circulating video of civilians taken after the 
attack, showing them convulsing and struggling to breathe  - common 
reactions of Sarin exposure.

Secretary
 of State Kerry said that the images and footage of the aftermath are 
enough to prove that a chemical attack happened. Though some are 
pointing out that it doesn't prove that the Assad regime carried them 
out.

The Syrian perspective: Charlie Rose interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this morning in Damascus and will air the interview tomorrow evening. The two have spoken twice before. Above, a picture from their exchange in 2010

'He does accept some of the responsibility': While Mr al-Assad said he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on August 21, he did express remorse over the 1,400 killed including hundreds of children

When asked by reporters in London what he thought about President Assad's claim that there wasn't enough evidence, Mr Kerry said 'the evidence speaks for itself'.

President al-Assad on the other hand 
wouldn't say whether he thinks Congress will vote to approve the 
military strikes, only that they are  'as prepared as they could be' for
 one.

He also suggested that there would be a retaliation strike, but would not talk about what kind of response.

In
 the interview he gave a message to the American people 'that it had not
 been a good experience for them to get involve din the Middle East'.

Crimes against humanity: Congress is currently debating whether or not to authorize military strikes on Syria following the alleged August 21 chemical weapons attack that killed 1,400 including hundreds of children

Making their case: President Obama's administration has been using images and footage after the attack to convince Congressmen to OK the strikes

This isn't the first time that Mr Rose has spoken with the Syrian president.

He's interviewed him on two prior occasions, once in 2006 and again in 2010.

Excerpts from the interview will be previewed Monday morning on CBS This Morning and the entire interview will be broadcast Monday night on PBS' The Charlie Rose Show.

President Obama will give six television interviews on Monday and address the American people from the Oval Office on Tuesday.
