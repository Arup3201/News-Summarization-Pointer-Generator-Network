A pretzel bag available only in the U.S. has become an unlikely clue in the hunt for a suspected child abuser.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has released five photos of a man carefully taken from four videos in which he can be seen sexually assaulting a young girl believed to be between seven and nine years old.

Because the videos were so graphic, the images had to be 'sanitized' so they could be fit for public release.

All four videos, which were filmed in April, appeared on the internet on May 2 and were discovered by Danish police who contacted U.S. authorities.

Authorities have released images of a man (right) they would like to speak to in
connection with a video which shows a child being sexually assaulted. A packet of Rold Gold pretzels can be seen in the video

The man has been identified by the ICE as 'John Doe' and a warrant for his arrest was signed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Authorities believe the acts were committed in the U.S. because a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels, made only in the U.S., can be seen in the videos.

Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the U.S. and Canada, as those in Canada have different packaging and French language descriptions. 

In each of the four videos - which are all one or two minutes in length - several items of musical equipment can be seen. - guitars, speakers, a keyboard, electronic equipment and a musician stand and stool.

ICE Special Agent Neil O' Callaghan told the MailOnline their biggest challenge was to ascertain if the video was filmed in Canada or the U.S. as there are so many similarities between the two countries in terms of electrical outlets, brands, furniture etc. But it was the pretzel's packaging that acted as the key component in this.

Authorities are now appealing for members of the public to help identify the man, who is described as being between 45 and 55 years old with a heavy-set build.

He is balding with a wreath of light brown hair and a brown mustache and appears to have what is commonly referred to as a 'beer gut'. 

Authorities believe the acts were committed in the U.S. because a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels, made only in the U.S., can be seen in the video (not seen in this video still)

Do you know this man? Police are appealing for members of the public to come forward with information

Brian Korzak, a special agent with the ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, said:
'It looks like our suspect is either a musician or collects musical 
instruments', referring to images of guitars and mixers in the room 
where the videos were made.

'We're not sure what the relationship
(between the man and girl) is because unfortunately there is no audio. 
So we couldn't tell any interaction between the two.

'But, having access to the child, so 
to speak, on April 14, and then having access again on April 27, 
obviously there's some sort of ongoing relationship or personal 
knowledge between the suspect and the victim.

'Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim'.

Special Agent Patrick Redling added: 'Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now.

'And so we're looking to your help to get the word out about this particular investigation so hopefully we can catch this child sexual predator, take him off the streets and save this child from more harm.'

Anyone with information should call the ICE on 1-866-347-2423 from the U.S. & Canada or 1-802-872- 6199 from anywhere else in the world. Alternatively visit www.ICE.gov/tips
