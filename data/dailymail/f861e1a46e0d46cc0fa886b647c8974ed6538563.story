I always thought international football was about the best players from one country pitting themselves against the best players from another country.

But this is a fantastical idealistic notion.

The cosmopolitan nature of the world in general, and the easy, frequent movement of large numbers of people from country to country in modern times has made the globe a smaller place.

At the weekend, Italy's equaliser against Bulgaria was scored by a Brazilian, Eder, who first arrived in Italy when he was 16. He has admitted he doesn't know the words to the Italian national anthem. An Argentina-born striker, Franco Vasquez, is also in Antonio Conte's squad.

Italy's Italian strikers are either too old (Luca Toni, Antonio di Natale) or out of form (Ciro Immobile, Mario Balotelli, Graziano Pelle), hence the foreign call-ups.

The controversy led to Roberto Mancini saying that 'the Italian national team should be Italian. An Italian player deserves to play for the national team, while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.'

It's nothing new for Italy: they won the World Cup in 2006 with Argentinian Mauro Camoranesi in the side. 

He moved to Italy at the ripe old age of 23, didn't sing the national anthem, spoke in Spanish after the game when he dedicated the victory in the final in Berlin to the people back in his neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires – roughly 7,000 miles from Rome. 

As if more confusion was needed, he now manages in Mexico and his middle name is German.

Italy's casual approach to 'Italianness' when it comes to football stretches back nearly 100 years: midfielder Luis Monti played in a World Cup final for Argentina in 1930, and then won the 1934 tournament with Italy.

Italy of course are not the only ones. Spain called up Brazilian Diego Costa, and England have done it too: Raheem Sterling was born in Jamaica, but there is a difference. Sterling moved to England aged five.

And this is an important point: Mancini is wrong to believe you have to be born in the country for which you play: there are circumstances which may lead to you being born in one country, but brought up in another. The truth is that Sterling is proud of his Jamaican roots, but feels English.

'Irish Blood, English Heart' sang Morrissey, summing up the complexity of identity in four words. 

Diego Costa is another high-profile player who was born somewhere other than the country he plays for

Raheem Sterling was born in Jamaica but has lived in England since the age of five

There are plenty of English-born players who feel Irish because of their family history – a father from Ireland perhaps. Would it be wrong to deny them the chance to play for Ireland? I think so.

Back to Camoranesi, who even after winning the World Cup for Italy, said he felt Argentine.

Italy and Spain are stretching credibility with their foreign internationals. And perhaps the worst of all is Gordon Strachan selecting Matt Ritchie. 

The Bournemouth star admitted he had not even been to Scotland before his call-up and debut last week. He belted out the national anthem like he was one of The Proclaimers. 

No rules were broken because his dad was born in Edinburgh, but how Scottish can Ritchie feel if at the age of 25 he had failed to make the effort to even visit the country of his father's birth?

Good luck to him, but the whole mess raises questions about the nature and future of international football.

When one country faces another country on a football pitch, shouldn't the main purpose of that match be to see how 11 players from one nation fares against 11 players from a different nation?

Isn't that a fundamental premise and prerequisite of international football? 

If it isn't, and the international game has become a free for all involving bending the rules so that it no longer matters where you were born and which nationality makes your heart beat stronger, then what is the point of it.

When I go to see England play against Italy I want to see the best English players play against the best Italian players. Not a few ringers who aren't good enough to play for other countries.

Of course, clinging on to a view that footballers should only play for the country in which they were born will these days lead to accusations of xenophobia or discrimination. But those accusations are lazy and unintelligent.

International football should always be about one country against another. There is nothing wrong or racist about that.

But a Brazilian playing for Spain, an Argentine for Italy and several Englishmen playing for Scotland dilutes the passion of the occasion.

It's become more about players enhancing their careers when it should be about the passion you feel for your country. And that just isn't right.
