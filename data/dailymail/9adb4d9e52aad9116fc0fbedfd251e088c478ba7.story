 Sunderland are making a move for Costa Rica World Cup defender Oscar Duarte.

The 25-year-old plays for Club Brugge in Belgium and grabbed headlines in Brazil after becoming the first Costa Rican to be sent off in a World Cup following two yellow cards against Greece.

Duarte scored against Uruguay in their shock Group D victory and has already scored for Brugge in the league this season.

Manager Gus Poyet wants the Nicaragua-born defender to add extra mobility but his goal contribution will also be welcomed. 

Sunderland remain in talks with Liverpool over a deal for striker Fabio Borini but the transfer may yet be another loan despite the clubs agreeing a £14m fee. 

While Borini is happy to play for Sunderland this season the Italian forward is reluctant to make the move permanent.
