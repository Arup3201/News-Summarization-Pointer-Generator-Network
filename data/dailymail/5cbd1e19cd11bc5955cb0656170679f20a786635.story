TV and radio presenter Zoe Ball says becoming a mother has been the making of her

Her party lifestyle in the Nineties earned her a reputation as a ladette.

But Zoe Ball says becoming a mother has been the making of her.

The 44-year-old BBC TV and radio presenter also revealed that she uses her children as an excuse to have a quiet night at home.

She said: ‘My kids are the best things that have ever happened to me. They are amazing.’

The former raver married Norman Cook, 51 – better known as DJ Fatboy Slim – in 1999 and they have a son Woody, 14, and daughter Nelly, five. 

At the height of her partying days while fronting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Miss Ball admitted she was once so ‘high’ while presenting live from hedonistic party island Ibiza she could barely speak.

Miss Ball, who was once happy to swig from a bottle of Jack Daniels, has been teetotal for the last six years but recently admitted she is now enjoying the occasional drink. 

Speaking at an awards ceremony on Sunday which saw Esther Rantzen crowned Tesco celebrity mother of the year, she said the children were her top priority.

Miss Ball, who recently presented Strictly Come Dancing, said: ‘The great thing about being a mum is that it gives you something else to think about other than yourself. 'I just think it’s the best job in the world.

‘In the beginning it’s like, “What do you mean I’m never going to go out any more?” but now it’s such a joy. It’s such a great excuse to be like, “No, I’m with the kids,” so you don’t have to go out any more.’  

But motherhood did not come easily. She said: ‘It was tricky at first. You’re like “What? You scream all night? I don’t know what to do".

'But you learn about yourself, you grow and you also start to understand your own parents.

'You go “I’m so sorry mum for giving you such a hard time because you were making it up as you were going along too".'

She also revealed Cook has turned out to be ‘the best dad’.

‘I have to say he is amazing,’ she said. ‘Who would have thought that this crazy rave DJ would make such an amazing father but he has. We all grow up and we can’t play forever. We have to get sensible.’
