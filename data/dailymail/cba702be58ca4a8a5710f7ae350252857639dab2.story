Labour's failed system of financial regulation that is blamed for Britain’s economic crisis is swept away today.

Chancellor George Osborne and the outgoing head of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, will hail the abolition of the Financial Services Authority, the watchdog set up by Gordon Brown in 1997.

The Bank is once again taking sole charge of regulating lenders and protecting and enhancing financial stability.

The FSA was set up as part of Mr Brown’s so-called ‘tripartite structure’, which meant banks, insurers, building societies and other such firms were regulated by the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of England.

But the watchdog failed to prevent a lending boom or risky trading by banks, which ended in a spectacular crash that saw Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB collapse and need massive taxpayer bailouts.

The FSA is being replaced with two successor organisations: the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will ensure the stability of financial services firms and be part of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority, which will act as the City’s behavioural watchdog.

The Bank’s financial policy committee, meanwhile, is responsible for protecting and enhancing financial stability.

In a speech today, Mr Osborne is due 
to say: ‘The changes coming into effect today are the start of resetting
the system of financial regulation in our country.

'They represent a fundamental change in how financial services will be regulated in the future.

'They do away with the discredited 
system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went 
wrong, and put in its place a new system that puts the Bank of England 
back in charge and that will help ensure a strong, safe and successful 
financial system in Britain.’

Mr Osborne announced the proposed changes soon after the coalition was formed in 2010, insisting clarity was needed over who was responsible for supervising the financial services sector and avoid a recurrence of failing banks and vast taxpayer bailouts.

The moves are part of a big increase in the powers of the Bank of England and its new governor, Mark Carney, who takes charge in July.

Together they represent the biggest changes to the central bank since it was given its independence in 1997.

The PRA is to be led by the Bank’s deputy governor Andrew Bailey, and will regulate around 1,700 financial firms.

The FCA is headed by Martin Wheatley, who worked at the FSA and conducted a review into the Libor rate-rigging  scandal at banks.
