A council has spent £10,000 on a new bus shelter - only to see the bus service scrapped weeks later.

The brand new stop replaced an old one in Cambridge on the route of the hourly number 14 service.

But three weeks after appearing bus company Whippet slashed their service and now the stop is only used twice a day.

The shelter has been branded 'a ridiculous waste of money' because it has no regular bus service

Residents are furious after the Whippet bus company withdrew the number 14 from the stop after just a few weeks

Local resident Sadie Corn, 78, said: 'I think it's ridiculous. I'm a pensioner and I pay my council tax and then they waste money like this.

'A lick of paint would have done for the old bus stop but instead they put a brand new one.

'We were able to use it for all of three weeks before the number 14 was taken off.'

Local councillor Kevin Price said: 'It's not a great use of public money to spend it on a brand new bus shelter that isn't going to be used as a bus shelter - it seems fairly pointless to me.'

Andrew Preston, Cambridge City Council's 
project delivery manager, blamed Whippet and said the shelter could be 
moved - at a further cost of £1,000.

He said: 'We carried out considerable liaison with the county council's passenger transport services and service providers as part of this project.

'If decisions are subsequently made to cut services then this is outside of our control.

'This bus stop was also in the worst condition of all city council-owned shelters across the city.

'Of course the shelter could be relocated in the future at minimal cost, which I would estimate at less than £1,000, should the need arise.'
