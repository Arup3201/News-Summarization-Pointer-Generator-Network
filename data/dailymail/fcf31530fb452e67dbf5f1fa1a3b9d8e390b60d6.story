A vinyl cat has become an internet sensation after she was caught on video manipulating a record playing like a DJ.

Two-year-old Furby was enticed to a record player by the sounds of Bob Marley's Is This Love, which her owner James Corballis, 27, had put on at home in Galway, Ireland.

And once she had come face-to-face with the spinning record, she decided to take matters into her own paws by moving the record back and forth.

Music whizz: Furby, a two-year-old cat, was filmed by her owner 'mixing' a Bob Marley record on his vinyl player

She speeds the track up, slows it down as well as seeming to 'scratch' the record in the manner of professional DJs.

However, her curiosity quickly gets the better of Furby, and she climbs onto the player, knocking the needle off and leaving her spinning round on the player.

Mr Corballis managed to capture the moment on his phone's camera. After uploading being uploaded to YouTube the video amassed more than a million hits over three days.

Choosing her moment: Furby had never seen the record player before when she was tempted over by the sounds of Is This Love

On top of the situation: Furby later abandoned her musical aspirations and took a ride on the record player

Spin me right round: Furby unfortunately knocked the needle away when she climbed on board, but has maintained a keen interest in music

Mr Corballis said: 'I was just sitting around at home one day and put on a Bob Marley record. Furby had never seen the record player in action before and took an immediate interest in it.

'The video was a complete one off and there will be no attempt to do a follow up. I believe the best viral videos happen by chance.'

'After the video went viral, I played the music in the house regularly. She would run over to the computer every time she heard Is This Love so it's safe to say she's a big Bob Marley fan.'
