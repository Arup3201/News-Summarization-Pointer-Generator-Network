A security company is offering free GPS devices to churches to help prevent their baby Jesus figurines being stolen from Nativity scenes.

Brickhouse Security is giving the GPS trackers to qualifying churches to hide on or in their Jesus figurines.

If baby Jesus is snatched by a sticky-fingered heathen, the matchbox-sized device will alert the owner to the theft.

Crossing the line: Every year, baby Jesus figurines are stolen from church Nativity scenes

'We monitor it from our cloud-based mapping system, and set up alerts so that they'll get a text message or an e-mail if Baby Jesus is in motion,' said Todd Morris, CEO of Brickhouse Securities.

Brickhouse Security can then pinpoint Jesus' location whereupon law enforcement can undertake a rescue operation.

Savior: The Brickhouse tracker means baby Jesus can be tracked on the company's cloud-based mapping system

Marc Horowitz, the editorial director for BrickHouse Security, told The Christian Post why his company is providing the device for free.

'Frankly, we designed this program to do something helpful... and the theft and vandalism of holiday stuff happens more than you might realize. It happens in community after community all over the country,' he said.

This is the eighth year the company has offered the free program, called 'Save Jesus.'

The program has been taken up by more and more churches every year.

For St Mark's Episcopal Church in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, the offer of a free tracking device couldn't have come at a better time.

'Two of the Wise Men disappeared and ended up at Four Lakes Ski Resort,' explained Reverend George Smith to NBC.

The church this year will use GPS tracking devices on all of its Nativity figurines to prevent another such theft.

Heaven sent: The 'Save Jesus' program has been running for eight years to protect Church property during the festive season

'Of course God knows where they are, but now maybe we have a better chance to know as well,' said Reverend Smith.

'It gives me great pleasure to report that in the history of the Saving Jesus program, no holiday display equipped with a BrickHouse Security GPS tracking system has ever been victimized by thieves,' said Morris.

'Maybe one day this program won't be necessary. But until that day comes, BrickHouse will keep doing its part to make the holiday season safer and more festive for everybody.'
