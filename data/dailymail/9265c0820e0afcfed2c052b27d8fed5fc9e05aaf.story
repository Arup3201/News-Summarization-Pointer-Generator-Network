A U.S. brewery has been forced to apologize for naming an ale after the teetotal Indian leader, Mohandas Gandhi.

The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed  for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India.

What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi as a robot with one hand raised in blessing.

Following a legal complaint about the beer in Hyderabad, India, the New England Brewing Co issued an apology to Facebook.

It said in a statement that its intent wasn't to 'offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly.'

Despite the backlash, the company says it has no plans to withdraw the beer, which is not sold internationally.

It claims that Gandhi's granddaughter and grandson have seen the label and have 'expressed their admiration' for it. 

However, the company's stance could change when the case hits the courts Monday.

A petitioner in India contends that Gandhi’s image on the alcohol cans and description of the father of the nation by the brewery is highly condemnable and punishable under Indian laws.

However, there are also those who fully-support the drink.

One fan wrote on Facebook: 'Gandhi-Bot is best. Keep the craft up. 

'I'm an Indian and proud to drive five hours often to [the The New England Brewing Co] just for Bot.'

Another added: 'My only problem with your beer is that it is always sold out. Keep up the great work.'

On the website Gandhi-Bot is pegged as an intensely hopped double India pale ale with a blend of three varieties of American Hops.

It is also described as 'fully vegetarian' and an 'ideal aid . . . for the seeking of truth and love.'
