Moscow Zoo has unveiled its newest, and surely a contender for cutest, new resident - a rare red panda named Zane.

The one-year-old female made the journey to Russia from Ireland's Dublin Zoo in mid-October but she was under quarantine until this week.

Zane appears comfortable in her new surroundings, albeit a bit lonely given she will live alone in the enclosure at least until next year when the zoo aims to introduce a second red panda.

Zoo director Anna Kachurovskaya said the visitors to zoo would 'help it to cope with the loneliness'. 

Red pandas, sometimes nicknamed firefoxes, lesser pandas or red cat-bears, are slightly larger than a domestic cat and live to around eight years. 

They hail from the temperate forest regions across Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal, but their numbers are significantly under threat. 

The World Wildlife Fund estimates less than 10,000 adult red pandas are left in the wild with the species listed as 'vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, one level short of being officially endangered.

Hunting, accidental capture (getting caught in traps meant for other animals) and a loss of habitat is compounding the red panda's already delicate existence - the animals, like their bamboo eating namesakes, are fond of food sources that are notably void of nutrition. 

Zoo director Anna Kachurovskaya said: 'The red panda is a foodie, so he will choose very young twigs, very young leave, very young plumules (roots). The trouble is that this part of the plant is not very nutritious. That's why she has to spend up to 13 hours in search of food and eat up to 30 per cent of their body weight.'
