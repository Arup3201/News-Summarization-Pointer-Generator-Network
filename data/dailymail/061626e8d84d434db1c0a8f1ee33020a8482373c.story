Between 1955 and 1965, Hollywood's favorite male stars all had a penchant for a distinctly preppy style that came to be known as the Ivy look.

A new Evergreen Edition of best-seller Hollywood and the Ivy Look, by Graham Marsh and Tony Nourmand, published by Reel Art Press, features photos from that era, showing just how much the A-list set were influenced by the attitude and style of America's East Coast elite.

'From the button-down hip of Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Anthony Perkins to the preppy sensibilities of Woody Allen and Dustin Hoffman, the understated but carefully selected components of the Ivy look didn't shout "look at me" but instead gave off an image of approachable correctness and laid back confidence,' write the authors. 

The origin of preppy: A new edition of  Hollywood and the Ivy Look features photos from the Fifties and Sixties, showing just how much the A-list set were influenced by the style of America's Ivy League elite. Pictured: Steve McQueen looking typically suave in a navy button-down shirt and sharp plaid jacket, his hair in a neat cut

Modern casual: A photo taken circa 1960 shows Clint Eastwood giving his signature squinting smolder as he poses under a tree in a Lacoste collared shirt, a pinstriped sweater casually slung over his shoulder

In a never before published photo in the book, Steve McQueen looks typically suave in a navy button-down shirt and sharp plaid jacket, his hair in a neat cut.

'An interesting thing to note is that there was a spell in the early 1960s when button-holes were removed from the lapels of Ivy jackets,' reads a description from the book. 'This reflected the sleek, sharp and minimal look that surfaced in this period.'

Another sartorial element of the era is the white T-shirt just barely visible under his collar.

Clint Eastwood gives his signature squinting smoulder in a photo taken around 1960 as he poses under a tree in a Lacoste collared shirt, a pinstriped sweater casually slung over his shoulder.

Spot on: In a 1967 photo of Robert Redford taken during his Barefoot in the Park, he perfectly nails the look of the era in his diagonal striped tie, blue button-down shirt, grey tweed blazer and neatly styled hair

Debonair: Though he championed the style a few years before it became mainstream, Cary Grant is also included in the pictorial celebration. (Pictured: The legendary performer in 1955's To Catch a Thief)

With his sleek style and immaculately coiffed hair, he, too, embodied the look that came to be associated with masculine confidence.

Another star featured in the book is Robert Redford. A photo of the star taken around the same time as 1967's Barefoot in the Park depicts him perfectly nailing the look of the era in his diagonal striped tie, blue button-down shirt, grey tweed blazer and neatly styled hair.

Put-together: James Caan, famous for playing Sonny in The Godfather, is pictured off-screen with a close cut haircut and oversized check button-down that are 'pure Ivy League'

Tennis whites: Robert Culp gets to grips with a game of tennis in a 1966 episode of I Spy 

Memorable moment: This still of Steve McQueen 1968 film Bullitt is 'probably the most influential set of Ivy threads in movie history,' according to the book's authors

Though he championed the Ivy Look a few years before it became mainstream, Cary Grant is also included in the pictorial celebration.

A photo of the legendary performer sees him strolling the streets in a scene from 1955's To Catch a Thief with just the middle of his three jacket buttons fastened.

Tab Hunter, who launched into fame in 1955's Battle Cry, embodies the Ivy Look in a shot from the mid-Fifties in which he poses on the beach, with his khaki slacks and the sleeves of his white button-down shirt rolled up, a cigarette in hand.

On set: Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in scene from 1968 film The Odd Couple, which was 'full of sharp one-liners and, as you can see, even sharper clothes'

Iconic: 'The understated but carefully selected components of the Ivy look didn't shout "look at me" but instead gave off an image of approachable correctness and laid back confidence,' write the authors 

A still of Steve McQueen 1968 film Bullitt is 'probably the most influential set of Ivy threads in movie history,' according to the book's authors.

And James Caan, famous for playing the headstrong Sonny in The Godfather, is pictured off-screen with a close cut haircut and oversized check button-down that are 'pure Ivy League'.

Also featured in the tome are Jack Lemon, Sidney Poitier, Woody Allen and Paul Newman, all of whom had their own take on what came to be the quintessentially American dress code, which continues to have influences to this day.
