David Cameron was eying up what could be the world’s fast car today, in stark contrast to the mini scooter he has been using to get around London.

The Prime Minister welcomed the 1,000mph Bloodhound Supersonic Car to Downing Street to promote British engineering.

The jet and rocket powered vehicle, which designers hope will secure the world land speed record, was an altogether more impressive sight than Mr Cameron scooting through Regent’s Park.

It emerged yesterday that Mr Cameron had been spotted using a £120 Mini Scooter to keep up with his children.

He was pictured riding on the 40cm long deck in Regent’s Park on his way to lunch with Nancy and Arthur.

The PM later scooted back to Number 10, according to The Sun.

But he ditched his leg-powered mode of transport for what could be the fastest machine on the planet, when the £15million Bloodhound Supersonic Car pulled up outside Number 10.

Measuring more than 13metres, it has been designed to reach 1,050mph in just 42 seconds, which would smash the current land speed record of 763mph.

It means it can cover the length of four and a half football pitches in just a second.

Mr Cameron said the project was proof of what world class British engineers could achieve, and revealed his hope that it would inspire 100,000 extra 100,000 engineering technicians by 2018.

The Prime Minister said: ‘British engineering and innovation are a part of our history that we are rightly very proud of and our engineering excellence continues to change the world that we live in for the better.

‘Bloodhound is a fantastic example of what our engineers can achieve.

‘Apprenticeships are at the heart of our mission to rebuild the economy, giving young people the chance to learn a trade and to build their careers, creating a truly world-class, high-skilled workforce that can compete and thrive in the global race.’

It is hoped the Bloodhound will beat the current land speed record next year and become the first land vehicle to smash 1,000mph by 2015.

The Bloodhound SSC project – sponsored by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers - was launched in 2008 to help inspire the next generation of British engineers and scientists.

Mr Cameron today met Wing Commander Andy Green, the current world land speed and supersonic speed record holder who will drive the car during the record attempts.

Stephen Tetlow, chief executive of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: ‘To help UK companies succeed in this ever-growing competitive global marketplace, we need people with the highest professional skills and abilities.

‘This initiative will ensure that the UK has a growing stream of Engineering Technicians being developed to a level that is recognised and respected around the world.’
