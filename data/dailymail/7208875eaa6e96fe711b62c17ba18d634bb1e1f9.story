Par of the day

Phil Mickelson smashed his drive into the boondocks on the par-five 10th. Hit his second ball down the middle, two iron from over 200 yards, one putt.

Don't gloat Martin

German Martin Kaymer (below) rubs English fans' noses in it after a miserable summer of sport. He has four stars on his shirt - one for each of their World Cup wins.

That's gorgeous, George

'If it wasn't for Ernie Els I'd be playing tennis, and badly at that.' George Coetzee praised his South African hero after roaring into contention with a 69.

Cheers, Ernie

Ernie Els (below) was cheered every step of the way despite again looking haunted out on the course. A fitting reception for a fine champ.

On the tee from Scotland

Ivor Robson is golf's most famous announcer. The game's stars have been recorded doing hilarious impressions of the high-pitched Scot.

Picture of the day

Hoylake crowds were guaranteed at least two birdies as this pair of Robins swooped in, putting Batman in the shade.

Slam dunk Sergio

Biggest roar of the week after Sergio Garcia holed out for eagle from the rough off the second fairway. His celebration was just as exuberant.

Poor Rory

I love Rory but it looks like someone's attacked him with a highlighter pen today.' Judy Murray pokes fun at McIlroy's luminous hat, belt and shoes combo (below).

Achilles heel

Tiger Woods won at Hoylake in 2006 by using his driver once. He hit it at the first two holes on Friday - double bogey, bogey.
