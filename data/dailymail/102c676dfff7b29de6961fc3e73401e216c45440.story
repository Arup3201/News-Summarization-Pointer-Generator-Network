Clark Gable III, grandson of Clarke Gable, now presents the reality TV show about infidelity - Cheaters

Let's say you suspect your spouse of having an affair. Would you enlist the help of a TV show to find out what they were getting up to and with whom, then let it catch them in the act on live television - and drag you along too in the hope of an angry confrontation with the cheating couple?

Probably not, but that's the premise of US show Cheaters, and although reality television doesn't come much more intrusive it's become a compulsive and unlikely hit.

And its presenter is rather unlikely too, a descendant of one of the biggest stars in Hollywood history - and one of its most notorious womanisers to boot. Clark Gable III is the 25-year-old grandson of the Gone With The Wind star who Joan Crawford said produced in her 'a sexual urge beyond belief'.

What would Grandpa think of the heir to the family name hunting cheating husbands with a camera crew? 'I think he'd have a good laugh. It's about the sort of things - women, sex, infidelity - he used to surround himself with,' says Clark.

That would be putting it mildly. Gable went to epic lengths to hide his own myriad affairs. Five times married, he sired only two children - Clark's father John, and Judy Lewis.

The latter was the product of an affair with actress Loretta Young that began on the set of Call Of The Wild in 1935, and the pair were so keen to avoid any scandal that she fled to Europe to hide her pregnancy, later secretly giving birth and only 'adopting' the baby 19 months afterwards.

Gable came to see Judy just once, when she was 15, but she didn't know he was her father until she was 31 and he'd been dead five years.

'It was great back then; the studios would hide anything you wanted,' says his grandson. Is it more honest now? 'That's a strange word to use for the entertainment industry,' he laughs.

Meeting Clark Gable III begs the 
question - whatever happened to the Second? His father John, he reveals,
 has spent his whole life trying to distance himself from his own famous
 father's shadow.

The 
Hollywood star had always wanted a son but tragically died in 1960, just
 three months before John was born. John was brought up by his mother, 
the star's fifth wife Kay Williams, out of the limelight on Gable's huge
 California ranch.

'At school graduation when they called my name out, every parent stood up to see who I was'

There were several threats to kidnap him and a troublesome childhood ended up with him being sent to school in Switzerland. 'He told me he used to throw lemons at all the tourists who came to look at the family home,' says Clark.

Although John - who's now 53 and also has a daughter, Kayley - did a little acting, he soon moved into stunt work before following his passion for motor racing. The more dangerous the better, says his son.

In 2012 John, who is divorced from Clark's mother Tracy, made headlines when his girlfriend at the time, celebrity make-up artist Christiane Lange, was found dead at their Malibu home after a suspected drug overdose.

Clark is intent on restoring some of the family's acting glory and following his famous grandfather into film. He's been modelling since he was three but Cheaters is his first turn in front of the camera, although he had a role in a low-budget Italian thriller that's yet to be released.

He's now presented two seasons of Cheaters and says he can no longer be shocked by what people get up to in their private lives. Nothing is scripted or faked, though they edit out the frequent occasions when he introduces himself to stunned cheaters and they do a double take at his name Clark Gable.

Like the offspring of other stars, he believes that having a famous name opens doors to begin with but can be a hindrance when you're expected to live up to your illustrious forebear.

Clarke Gable III never met his grandfather who tragically died before the birth of his son

Clark feels John avoided acting because he was intimidated by the thought of trying to emulate his father's success and, as a result, he also showed a complete lack of curiosity about the colourful life of a man who, of course, he never knew. Clark finds this completely maddening.

'All my father knows about him is what he's seen on film. I feel he dropped the ball for a generation and I really want to pick it up again.'

So what was it like growing up Clark Gable? 'It was both cool and a nightmare. At school graduation when they called my name out, every parent stood up to see who I was,' he says.

And people still think he's having them on when he mentions his name. 'I always carry three different pieces of ID just to prove it,' he says.

Clark has done some digging into his grandfather's story. He enjoys telling how he was Hitler's favourite film star, with the FÃ¼hrer even putting a bounty on his capture.

'He wanted my grandfather to make a propaganda film to crush the American fighting spirit,' says Clark. The star didn't return his admiration, flying as a gunner on US bombing missions against the Nazis.

So what does he know about his grandfather? He loved riding and hunting, he says. More surprisingly, he even dabbled in cock-fighting, handing down to John an ornate pair of 1940s cock-fighting blades (the spurs that are attached to fighting cocks' feet) in a box with Gable's name engraved on it.

Not something today's stars would ever dream of indulging in. 'It's pretty crazy to think about it,' agrees his grandson.

Another fine souvenir his father inherited was a framed letter Walt Disney wrote to Gable apologising for making his ears too big when he included an animated version of the star in a couple of 1940s cartoons. 'I heard my grandfather was very upset about that,' says Clark.

Neither Clark nor John inherited Gable's famously oversized ears but there's one thing all three generations of Gables share: an obsession with women. Clark, who's single, says it's 'almost an addiction' for him.

And his twice-married father is no different. 'It's hard when we go out together,' says Clark. 'He tries to pick up women my age. He gets jealous, I suppose.' Grandpa would be nodding with approval.

Cheaters, weeknights at 11pm from 14 April, CBS Reality.
