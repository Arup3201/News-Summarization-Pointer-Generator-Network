The family of a pregnant 
Fort Worth woman being kept alive by a ventilator are suing the hospital that is refusing to turn off her life support, against their wishes.

Mother of one, Marlise Munoz is 20 weeks pregnant and has been in hospital since November, when she suffered a pulmonary embolism. Her relatives say doctors have told them that she is brain dead.

But John Peter Smith Hospital is refusing to allow them to take her off life support, saying that Texas law prohibits it from following a family directive when a pregnancy is involved.

Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness

Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period

The woman's husband Erick Munoz, who has   and 
mother Lynne Machado are now taking legal action against the hospital, 
also in Forth Worth. 

Attorneys for the family told the Star Telegram:
 'We do plan on filing some litigation, and it will be filed soon.' The 
lawyers wouldn't give further details but said they are 'making 
progress' on the case.

A spokesman for the hospital welcomed the move.

'JPS
 is encouraged by this development because the courts are the 
appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this 
matter,' J.R. Labbe said.

'JPS
 remains focused on providing compassionate care to all patients while 
also following the law as it applies to healthcare in the state of Texas,' he continued.

Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term

Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures

The hospital is pointing 
to a provision of the Texas Advance Directives Act that reads: 'A person
 may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this 
subchapter from a pregnant patient.'

But
 experts interviewed by The Associated Press, including two who helped 
draft the law, said a brain-dead patient's case wouldn't be covered by 
the law.

'This patient is 
neither terminally nor irreversibly ill,' said Dr. Robert Fine, clinical
 director of the office of clinical ethics and palliative care for 
Baylor Health Care System. 'Under Texas law, this patient is legally 
dead.'

Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor, said he did not believe the law applied in this case.

He
 said the hospital would not have absolute immunity from a civil or 
criminal case if it went outside the subchapter referenced by the law, 
but noted that 'most medical decisions' are made without immunity.

Munoz's mother Machado says she was shocked to learn her state left the family 
powerless to carry out their daughter's wish to never be 
dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant.

In December Machado lashed out against the law, saying that it had put her family through ‘pure hell.’

‘The doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a DNR or a living will, the law supersedes that,’ Machado told NBC News.

Machado’s 
son-in-law Erick Munoz found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor two days before Thanksgiving.

Erick is a paramedic - as was 
Marlise - and immediately performed CPR, but it was no use. At 14 weeks 
pregnant with their second child, Marlise had been without oxygen for an
 hour.

‘They did a CAT scan and an EEG and there was no brain activity,’ Machado said. ‘She was clinically declared brain dead. 

'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders

'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines

Marlise had suffered what was likely an embolism. She has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator.

The family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen. All they know is that they are powerless over their daughter’s fate or that of the unborn fetus.

'Knowing our daughter is not there, but her body is being kept alive, is hard to see,' Machado told CNN.

Marlise must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks.

‘At that point they would decide 
whether to start labor, do a C-section, or see if she could go to 34 or 
36 weeks when the fetus would be full term,’ Machado said.

But
 she and her family are horrified things even got this far. ‘No family 
should have to go through this,’ she said. ‘It’s been pure hell.’

‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick Munoz told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo.

Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation. And this isn’t it.

'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said

‘We
 knew what her wishes were,’ Erick told WFAA.

The
 couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive 
by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order.  But that wouldn’t have made a difference.

Texas
 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a 
DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under 
Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as 
pregnant.’

Doctors said the baby has a 
normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when 
Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen.

‘They
 don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick 
told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’

'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle
