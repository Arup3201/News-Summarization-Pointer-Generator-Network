A Colombian baby came back from the dead more than 10 hours after being sent to the morgue.

The tiny tot - now named Milagros (Miracles) - was born prematurely in Quibdo in the Pacific state of Choco in the early hours of Wednesday, November 13, last week.

Her mother Jenny Hurtado was just 27 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to the San Francisco de Asis hospital at 2:45am.

Baby Milagros was pronounced dead after being born prematurely by caesarian section at a hospital in Quibdo, Colombia, before being transferred to the hospital morgue (file picture)

Medics performed a C-section but, unable to find signs of life, declared the newborn deceased just 35 minutes later - at 3:20am.

Taken to the morgue, the baby was placed inside a box. Staff then waited for her fisherman father to collect her.

But, on the father's arrival and as the attendant handed the baby over, they recognised signs of life and heard a soft cry.

Realizing the infant was still alive, workers rushed her on board a plane to the Santa Teresita del Ni√±o Jesus clinic in the capital Bogota.

She remains there, accompanied by her aunt Reyes Hinestroza, receiving treatment for her underdeveloped lungs in intensive care.

It was only when the baby's father came to collect his body from the morgue that they noticed signs of life and he was taken to intensive care (file picture)

Her mother remains in Quibdo, where she is recovering from the ordeal.

Specialist doctor Javier Zagarra told Semana that the mistaken death declaration could be down to a soft heart beat at the time of the birth.

'In some cases the heart movements are not perceptible even though the newborn is alive, they can declare it dead,' he said.

'When they wrap the baby in a sheet, upon receiving warmth, the baby can then revitalize,' he added.
