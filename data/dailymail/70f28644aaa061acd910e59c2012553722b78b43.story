The woman who quit her job in a Super Bowl commercial has revealed that her boss was shocked.

Gwen Dean, who appeared in an advert for GoDaddy during a break in Sunday's game, said she received a text from her boss, Ted, soon after it aired.

'It was epic,' she told the Today show on Monday morning. 'It was, "You've got to be kidding. Wow, great commercial". He was stunned and he was laughing.'

New job: Gwen Dean, who quit her job in a Super Bowl advert, appeared on the Today show on Monday and said her boss was shocked and texted her saying, 'You've got to be kidding!'

Dean, 36, from Yonkers, New York, had worked as an operator for large refrigeration machinery for 18 years, and said she had loved her job and her 'super cool' boss, Ted.

But she decided to resign publicly after setting up her own puppet-making and performance company, Puppets by Gwen, which she said was her passion.

'It's puppets and their interaction with children that have been my real love since childhood,' she wrote on her website.

So when she saw GoDaddy's blind advert calling for people willing to publicly end their careers in order to pursue their website-based dreams, she jumped at the chance.

She was narrowed from a list of 100 people and became a spokesperson for the domain registrar and web hosting company.

She appeared in the 30-second advert beside actor John Turturro, who explained that she had long been working as an engineer but now had other ideas.

'I quit, Ted,' Dean said, addressing her boss.

Using one of her puppets, Mr Frank, she added: 'Ciao baby!'

GoDaddy said in a statement that Dean would also send a formal email of resignation to her boss.

'I'm thrilled to be moving to a new and exciting phase where I am listening to my inner-cheerleader - I am absolutely ready to do my own thing and be my own boss,' Dean said in a statement.

Super Bowl ads cost about $4 million for 30 seconds.

The breaks were as action-packed as the game, with brands like Coca-Cola and Sodastream courting controversy with their spots.
