A 16-year-old Detroit boy charged with assault and a hate crime over the brutal mob beating of a motorist last week, is being held on a $400,000 bond.

The teenager, who has not been identified, is the only one of five males charged in the April 2 attack on Steve Utash to face an ethnic intimidation count.

Utash, 54, is white, and the teenager and four adults charged in his beating are black.

Circuit Court Referee Raeigen Woods said at the teen's hearing today that a high bond was necessary given the serious nature of the mob attack which left Utash in a medically-induced coma.

Utash emerged from the coma yesterday, but remains in a critical condition.

Fox News reported that defense attorney Sterling Coleman asked the court for a substantially lower bond.

'He is not charged with a capital case and should not be given the same as those charged in a capital manner,' he said at Wayne County juvenile detention center today.

'He is not a flight risk. Both parents are in his life. They presented him to the police.'

Prosecutors however argued the teen should be held on a $500,000 bond given to the other four males, particularly as he admitted he was the first to throw punches.

Utash was punched and kicked by five people as he stopped to check on 10-year-old David Harris, who was struck when he stepped in front of Utash's pickup truck.

Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the 
neighborhood, rushed to help the boy and stopped the mob from continuing
 to beat Utash, police said.

Utash, a tree trimmer, suffered severe
 head injuries, while David Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any 
chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online.

Family members announced yesterday that Utash finally came out of an induced coma.

His daughter Mandi Emerick, who started a GoFundMe page to cover her dad's medical bills, said Utash is now off the ventilator, but experiences horrible flashbacks.

'Sometimes he can look at me and remember who I am and other times he can't. Today when I asked him how old he is he said "I'm two years old" but he did know his name,' she wrote.

'He does keep saying "I don't want to die I'm sorry" and "please don't let me forget you". He also keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for "HELP" and "PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME". He didn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital.'

More than 100 people, including hero Deborah Hughes, gathered at a prayer service for Utash at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday night.

'No matter how long I'm here I will not have a more special day than the day I go with you and your family to talk with your father, Mayor Mike Duggan said, according to MLive.

In relation to the April 2 assault, the 16-year-old was the only one of the alleged attackers charged with a hate crime.Â 

'In the case of the 16-year-old charged 
as a juvenile we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of 
assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation,' Kym Worthy, Wayne County's prosecutor, said.

'In the case of the four 
adult defendants that have been charged, the facts and the evidence does 
not support a charge of ethnic intimidation.'

Latrez Cummings, 19, was charged Thursday with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm.

Bruce
 Wimbush Jr., 17; Wonzey Saffold, 30; and James Davis, 24, were 
arraigned this week on the same charges and are being held in the county
 jail on $500,000 bonds pending preliminary examinations on April 21.

The Go Fund Me page set up for Utash, who has no health insurance, has already raised more than $168,000.

His family, who are keeping a bedside vigil, said on the site: 'It is so hard to see him (Utash) like this...Thank you all so much, your words mean more than you know.'

State representative Brian 
Banks said Utash did not deserve to be attacked.

'Mr

 Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need and, 
appallingly, was punished for doing so,' he said. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.'
