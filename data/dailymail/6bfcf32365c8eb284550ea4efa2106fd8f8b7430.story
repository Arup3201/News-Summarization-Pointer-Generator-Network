A Louisiana teen is dead after falling 16 stories to his death while on vacation with friends after recently graduating high school.

Challenge Talbot, 18, of Thibodeaux, LA., fell 16 stories from a balcony to his death in a pool at the Turquoise Place Condominiums in Orange Beach, AL. A couple walking near the pool early Friday morning saw his body face down and called 911, but responders were unable to revive the teen.

Police are still investigating if Talbot fell from the balcony or jumped.

‘There are no witnesses. We haven't been able to find the video yet and there's no indication of foul play,’ Orange Beach Police Chief Billy Wilkins told WPMI. ‘We're not through with the investigation. We're still trying to find out as much as we can.’

Friends staying at the condo with Talbot told investigators they ‘don't have any idea of what happened,’ Wilkins told the Houma Courier, adding that no one saw him fall or jump.

With the investigation still in preliminary stages, officials still aren’t sure if drugs or alcohol played a role in Talbot’s fall.

Talbot recently graduated from a local Catholic high school, where he was a member of the swim team that placed second in the Louisiana state championship, according to the Courier.

In a November interview, Talbot told the Courier that it meant a lot to him for his team to be on the gym wall with other athletic achievements, adding ‘When I look up at that board, I can say that I was on that team, and it means a lot.’

The recent grad also expressed a desire to return to help coach the team in the coming years.

‘They might win it next year, and I am thinking about coming back as an assistant coach,’ he said. ‘I think I can get a ring with these guys in the next few years.’

The school held a candlelight vigil Friday night in Talbot’s honor, according to WPMI.
