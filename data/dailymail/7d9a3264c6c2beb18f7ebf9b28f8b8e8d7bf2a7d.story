Little Polina wore pink bows in her braided hair to meet her American parents, Jason and Kendra Skaggs. After months of waiting and stomach-churning anxiety, the five-year-old could finally go home to Arkansas with the couple.

But the Skaggs were one of only a handful of U.S. families who were allowed to legally adopt a Russian child, following the January 1 ban of American adoptions of Russian youth, which has left hundreds of hopeful parents in limbo.

For Larry and Kelly Czocher, their story ended quite differently, as they were told not to travel to the Eastern European country, as they were told their 13-month-old son, Andre, was no longer coming to America.

The Skaggs were kept in limbo on their adoption status, but flew to Moscow from their home in Bella Vista, Alabama in mid-January thinking they would be able to bring Polina home, ABC News reported.

Mrs Skaggs told a local news station that the past few weeks have felt like a lifetime, not knowing if they would be able to bring the sweet girl home.

The nervous couple drove to the orphanage to see Polina for the first time in a month hoping for the best.

They were able to adopt her as their papers received court approval on December 24, just shy of the January 1 ban.

Polina, who suffers from spinal bifida and has other special needs, sat in a brightly-colored wheelchair and asked in Russian, ‘Momma, do I get to come home with you?’ the moment she saw Mrs Skaggs.

‘Yes, da,’ the mother replied, causing the young girl to beam with happiness.

Mrs Skaggs told ABC News that she and her husband were fearful of the psychological damage that could have been done to Polina had they not been able to complete the adoption, saying that it might have been ‘torture’ for the young girl to think that her parents had abandoned her and left her to live at an orphanage.

'We lost everything. It's a horrible, horrible situation.'

Mr Skaggs said after returning from Moscow that being Polina’s parent ‘is really feeling very natural.’‘She’s very cuddly in the morning. It’s wonderful as a mom to be woken up in the morning,’ Mrs Skaggs told local news station NEWhomepage, and said that Polina will receive frequent physical therapy to help her spinal bifida. 

‘I don’t like being woken up in the morning,’ her brother Carter said, but later announced that he wants his parents to adopt a brother or sister from Japan next. 

But for the Czocher family, the odds were not in their favor. The Sun-Sentinel reports that Larry and Kelly Czocher were not able to bring home Andre, the 13-month-old boy they were slated to adopt from Russia.

Ban: Russia's President Vladimir Putin, pictured on February 5 from Sochi, Russia, imposed a ban on all U.S. adoptions from Russia, effective January 1

Though they had painted a nursery for him and had a closet full of clothes for the young boy, the Czochers were among the hundreds of hopeful parents tied up in Russia’s political battle.

Russia's adoption ban enforced into law on January 1 was retaliation by leader Vladimir Putin for a new U.S. law targeting Russians accused of human rights abuses.

It also addresses long-brewing resentment in Russia over the 60,000 Russian children who have been adopted by Americans in the past two decades, 19 of whom have died.

Cases of Russian children dying or suffering abuse at the hands of their American adoptive parents have been widely publicized in Russia, and the law banning adoptions was called the Dima Yakovlev Bill after a toddler who died in 2008 when he was left in a car for hours in broiling heat.

They thought, since their paperwork went through ahead of the ban, that they would still somehow get little Andre.

But according to the Sun-Sentinel, the adoption agency called them, saying that everything was over. ‘We lost everything,’ Mrs Czocher, 38, said.

The couple had focused their efforts on adopting internationally because of the favorable odds. 

They had tried to conceive through in-vitro fertilization, but it did not take. ‘It’s a horrible, horrible situation,’ the devastated wife said.

The U.S. is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two decades.

The Department of State said it regreted the Russian Parliament's decision to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families.

Amnesty International Europe and Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act.

'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Kremlin children's tsar Pavel Astakhov said that Russian families would now adopt the children.

However, they earlier declined to do so - which is why the youngsters are available for foreign adoption. Commentator Yuliya Latynina dubbed the move 'worse than a crime.'
