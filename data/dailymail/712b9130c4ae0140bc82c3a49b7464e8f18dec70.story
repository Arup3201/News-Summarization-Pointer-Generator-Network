Graham Snowden was stabbed to death at a party on Saturday night

A teenager was charged last night with murdering a blind man who was found stabbed to death at a house party.

Jordan Flattery, 19, was accused of killing Graham Snowden, by detectives from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.

The 36-year-old victim died in hospital from a stab wound to the chest after an incident at a property in Milestone Road, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in the early hours of Sunday.

A 15-year-old boy arrested in connection with the inquiry on Sunday was freed on police bail to return to Stevenage police station on a date in February.

Flattery, of West Close, Hitchin, will appear before magistrates in Hatfield today.

Neighbours reported hearing 'banging 
and screaming' shortly before the incident. Paramedics rushed Mr Snowden
to hospital, but doctors could not save his life.

Officers arrested a teenager and cordoned off a house in Milestone Road after the incident at about 2am last night.

Today Detective Inspector Tim Redfearn
from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'We are
still very much in the early stages of this investigation and would 
appeal to anyone who may have information in connection with this 
incident to come forward.'

A post-mortem examination was carried out today, which established the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.

Mr Snowden had two young daughters. He
was left partially blind and has to walk with a stick following a road 
accident a few years ago.

A family liaison officer was said to 
be comforting his family at their home. Police said the arrested boy and
Mr Snowden were not related, but wouldn't be drawn on if they knew each
other.

The youth will return to answer bail at Stevenage police station on February 17

Police were called to the house in the early hours of Sunday morning following reports of a man being stabbed.

'There was some sort of ruckus going 
on and a punch up,' a neighbours said. 'Then it all went quiet and a 
short while later the police turned up.'

By the time officers arrived an 
ambulance crew was already at the scene. Mr Snowden was taken to the 
Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where he later died.

Police cordoned off the house in 
Milestone Road, which belongs to an unnamed single mother, as a forensic
investigation got underway. Another house in nearby Westmill Road was 
also sealed off.

Herts & Beds Major Crime Unit have launched a murder investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Collin said: 'Firstly, my thoughts are with the man's family at this distressing time.

'Whilst an arrest has been made, I would l still like to appeal for witnesses in connection with this incident. If you were in the area at the time and have information about what happened, I would urge you to make contact with police as soon as possible.'

A post-mortem examination has established that the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.

Neighbours said the dead man lived in the nearby village of Stondon.

One said: 'He was known as Snowy and he had two young daughters, although the relationship with the children's mother was over.'

She added: 'Some years ago he was involved in a nasty car accident on the A505 in North Herts and, as a result, he was left partially sighted and he walked with the aid of a stick.'

Another neighbour, Steve Dilley, told local reporters: 'I got a knock at about four in the morning, from police. I was in bed when it happened, and the bedrooms are at the back, so I didn’t hear much.

'Obviously, we are all shocked. You don’t expect it to happen on your doorstep, in your own street. It’s a fairly quiet street normally.'

Steve Williamson, another resident, added: 'I was very shocked. It brings it all home. There’s never normally any trouble on this street, it makes you think whether you are safe walking about at night.'

One neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, was awake when the incident happened: 'I heard some noise, then it all went quiet.

'Then the police turned up. There were seven police cars, an ambulance and a dog unit, nine in total.'
