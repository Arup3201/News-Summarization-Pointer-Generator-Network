A High School science teacher is facing the sack after he used the word 'vagina' during a biology lesson for pupils aged 15 and 16.

Tim McDaniel, is being investigated by Idahoâ€™s professional standards commission for using term while teaching a 10th grade biology lesson on reproduction and anatomy.

Four parents in conservative community of Dietrich wrote to complain, and now education chiefs in the conservative state are considering his future.

Mr McDaniel, who said he had never received a complaint in the 18 years he had taught at Dietrich School, is also accused of explaining the biology of an orgasm.

He told the Twin Falls Times-News: 'I teach straight out of the textbook, I don't include anything that the textbook doesn't mention.

But I give every student the option not to attend this class when I teach on the reproductive system if they don't feel comfortable with the material.

'This sort of thing makes you worry about what you teach. That's not right.'

A disciplinary letter from the Idaho State Department of Education also accused McDaniels of showing a video clip in class depicting an infection of genital herpes and teaching about different forms of birth control.

The letter also alleges that McDaniels told inappropriate jokes in class.

McDaniel also found himself in hot water for asking his students to write a critical response paper on climate change after showing them 'An Inconvenient Truth.'

According to a 2002 survey, 66 per cent of church goers in Lincoln County, where Dietrich is located, are affiliated with the Mormon Church,

But it seems the majority of his students back him.

One said: 'Here are a couple people in the community that are trying to get Mr McDaniel fired for teaching the reproductive system, climate change, and several other science subjects.

All these subjects were taught from the book and in good taste. He cares for each of his students and goes the extra mile to help them all. Now is the time for us to help by supporting him!'

Dietrich Superintendent Neil Hollingshead said: 'It is highly unlikely it would end with his dismissal.

'Maybe a letter of reprimand from the school board.'
