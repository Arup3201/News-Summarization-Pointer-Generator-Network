A mother-of-three has drowned in a freak accident after she dipped her toe in a swimming hole, lost her balance, fell down a waterfall and was sucked into a whirlpool.

Clare Lannen, 44, was enjoying a picnic with her parents at Ladies Well in Chichester State Forest, two hours north of Newcastle, on Monday when the tragedy occurred.

The Bolwarra Heights hairdresser fell into the water and slipped on rocks into a river with a strong current, which pulled her down a three-metre waterfall, the Newcastle Herald reported.

Her father Bob Richardson said he saw his daughter trying desperately to breathe but she kept being dragged into a whirlpool.

Mr Richardson jumped in and tried to save Mrs Lannen but he also started getting sucked down into the whirlpool and he couldn't drag her out, so he was forced to let her go.

Another man jumped in and dragged Mrs Lannen out of the water, where witnesses carried out CPR for 40 minutes until emergency services arrived.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her mother Margaret Richardson, who was also at the picnic, said Mrs Lannen had suffered from pneumonia in the past and did not have a strong chest or lungs.

'One minute you have her and she's so happy then the next minute she's gone,' Mrs Richardson told the Herald.

'Everybody loved Clare, she was straight-talking and straight to the point. She was also very giving - she'd give you the shirt off her back.'

Mr Richardson said she was an amazing mother to her children Hugh, 13, Bella, 19 and Jacob, who turned 21 on the day of the accident. Her husband of more than two decades, Peter, was in China for work with the tragedy occurred.

'She had a beautiful family and lovely kids,' he said.

'I think she was a born mother, she would always look after her sister's three children and loved them as much as she loved her own.'
