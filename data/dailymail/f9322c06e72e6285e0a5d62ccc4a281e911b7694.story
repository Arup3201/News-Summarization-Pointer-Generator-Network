A set of parents allowed their children to become so dirty they looked like 'urchins from Oliver Twist' with lice and rotting teeth. 

Jake Alderto, 22,  and Emma Louise Jones, 23, neglected their two-year-old son and three-year-old daughter so much the toddlers had lice growing in their hair and rotting teeth. 

The couple from Ulverston, Cumbria, kept no food in the family home where the children were within 'easy reach' of drugs, Furness Magistrates Court heard. 

Jake Alderto and Emma Louise Jones (above) were convicted of neglect after a court heard how the couple's two young children were so filthy they did not know what a bath was and had lice growing in their hair

When social services intervened they found the children 'starving' and their hair crawling with lice. 

Alderto and Jones were both found guilty of neglect and will be sentenced at Preston Crown Court later this month. 

Council workers described the case as one of the worst they had ever seen. 

'When foster carers were handed these two children they described them as looking like street urchins from Oliver Twist,' said Lisa Hine, prosecuting counsel. 

'They were filthy and there was no food in the house. They were both starving. It was a seriously dangerous house for children to be living in.

'There were drugs within easy reach of them both.' 

The couple's home in Ulverston, Cumbria, was described as 'dangerous'. The children were within easy reach of drugs 

The little girl had to have 16 rotten teeth with the pair's mother telling officials she did not think providing dental care was her responsibility. 

'In relation to dental care, the older child had not been cared for at all and had to have 16 teeth extracted because they were rotten. 

'Her mother said she didn't think dental care was down to her,' added Mrs Hine. 

'The children were filthy, they had lice in their hair and didn't know what a bath was or how to eat properly.'

The pair admitted one count of the ill treatment and neglect of children in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury to health.  

Alderton also admitted possession of cannabis on the same date. 

Their lawyer made no representation other than to ask for preparation of reports before sentencing given their guilty plea.  

The couple admitted neglect at Furness Magistrates Court (above). Their case has been committed to Preston Crown Court where they will be sentenced next month
