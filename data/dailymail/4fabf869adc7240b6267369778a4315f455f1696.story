Victor Valdes is back at Manchester United despite reports that the Spanish goalkeeper has stopped training with the Premier League club.

Valdes spent the weekend in Barcelona, sparking speculation that he had left United, who invited him to train with them at Carrington in late October.

However, Sportsmail can reveal that the 32-year-old was at the club’s training ground on Friday and returned on Monday afternoon when the rest of the squad reported back after Saturday’s win over Hull.

It is still unclear whether United will offer the three-time Champions League winner a contract as back-up to David de Gea as Valdes continues his rehabilitation from the serious knee ligament injury he suffered on his final appearance for Barcelona against Celta Vigo in March.

Louis van Gaal is understood to be keeping an open mind, with current No 2 Anders Lindegaard set to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season.

Meanwhile, United are awaiting the results of scans on Angel di Maria’s hamstring after the Argentina star went off less than a quarter of an hour into the 3-0 win over Hull that kept Van Gaal’s side in fourth place in the Premier League table.

The early indications are that Di Maria will miss Tuesday’s game against Stoke at Old Trafford, but it remains to be seen if he will return for the rest of the busy December programme.
