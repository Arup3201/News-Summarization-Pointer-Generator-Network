These peculiar portraits were created by a dedicated artist who spent every day for an entire year drawing a self-portrait using both hands.

Ambidextrous artist Tom Mosser, 53, came up with the idea of his Bed Head Self-Portrait Series as a way of being creative at least once a day.

Some days he would work for just one minute while others he would draw for hours - but the pictures always had to be finished that day.

A year in the life: Tom Mosser stands before dozens of the portraits he created for his project

The project lasted nearly 13 months with Tom, from Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, completing 395 self-portraits.

His unique talent meant that Tom could clench a pen or a paintbrush in both hands when creating his works.

The technique, which he calls 'Ambidextrous Impressionism', requires using movements with his left hand and firm movements with his right.

Tom said his works were created through whatever means took his fancy that day.

Tom describes his technique as Ambidextrous Impressionism - movements with left hand and firmer movements with his right hand

Nods to Picasso and Warhol? Tom uses pens, pencils and paintbrushes

He uses pens, pencils and paintbrushes, planned some works but spontaneously sketched others and used surfaces ranging from paper to cardboard, wood, shopping bags and canvases.

He even let his hair grow for an entire year to help depict change.

Tom said: 'There were days that I relished creating them and there were days that I grew bored of drawing myself again but no matter how tired I was I would do it.

More experimental: there were days when Tom relished creating and days when he grew bored

Scary: several times Tom was travelling with friends and would pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand to work

Tom was determined to finish at least one portrait per day

Discipline: Artist Tom wrote comments about his portraits on Facebook so he had to get on with it

'Several times I was travelling and visiting friends and I'd pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand, taping the paper to the mirror for a quick sketch.

'But despite the trauma of having to look at my goofy face every day for hours at a time, no matter what happened on a particular day I knew I had accomplished this one artistic task.

'There was no stopping because I had made a public commitment on Facebook - I had to do the portraits. Being watched was good motivation.

'When drawing with two hands it's like two people drawing side by side. It's almost like a third artist has created them - I can't produce the same look using just one arm.'

Tom adds: When drawing with two hands it's like two people drawing side by side

Tom said looking at his own 'goofy' face every day was traumatic....
