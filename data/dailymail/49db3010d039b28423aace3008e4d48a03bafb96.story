A Brazilian student who sold her virginity for £485,000 is yet again offering it up in another online auction, claiming she the original deal was never consummated.

Catarina Migliorini, 21, is selling her 'virginity' to bidders for the minimum of £62,000, but says she hopes for at least £930,000 ($1.5million).

Miss Migliorini's original 'virginity auction' was filmed for an Australian documentary, but she claims she was duped by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and that she was never given the money a Japanese man paid for her purity last October.

Virgin or victim? Brazilian student Catarina Migliorini sold her virginity for $780,000 after she put it up for auction online; but she is now claiming she is a victim who was exploited into selling her body

The original auction made Miss Migliorini a minor celebrity in Brazil and she posed for Playboy in her native country and Argentina.

'After being featured by so many media outlets in so many countries, I decided to actually auction off my virginity,' she explains to The Huffington Post regarding her decision to yet again sell her virginity.

Miss Migliorini previously said she wanted to give 90 per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of Santa Catarina.

However, as she claims never to have been given the money - nor lost her virginity - the organisation has yet to receive her help.

In October last year, Natsu, 53, a Japanese millioniaire fended
 off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack 
Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with the physical education student - who 
said she would use the cash to build homes for poverty-stricken families. 

Tricked? The physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for Australian documentary, Virgins Wanted

The auction was supposedly part of an
 Australian documentary entitled Virgins Wanted, in which Mr Sisley 
would explore the lives of Miss Migliorini and Alex Stepanov, a male who
 auctioned his virginity for $3,000.

But
 when Miss Migliorini went to meet her winning bidder, Natsu, in a 
Sydney restaurant, she claims that he didn't match the description Mr 
Sisely had given her, and insists the pair did not have sex. 

She also claims Mr Sisely did not cover her traveling expenses, or give her the £485,000paid by Natsu; and she now believes that 'Natsu' doesn't exist, and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary.

'I
 agreed to go along with [the auction], because Justin said it would be 
the best way to draw attention from the media about the project,' she said.

Mr Sisely, who first announced the 
documentary in May 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the 
virgins having sex, denies her claims.

'We have the footage to prove otherwise,' he explained.

In a bid to avoid prostitution laws, Miss Migliorini was to be 
'delivered' to her buyer on board a plane between Australia and the U.S.
 - being interviewed before and after the sexual act.

The intercourse itself would not be filmed, said Mr Sisely,
 and Natsu would retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture 
appearing in the media.

Both
 Migliorini's original claims of virginity and this time around have 
been treated with suspicion by medical professionals as it there is no 
foolproof way of telling if a woman is a virgin.

Miss
 Migliorini signed up to the project three years ago when she saw an 
advert by Thomas Williams Productions looking for a virgin to film.
