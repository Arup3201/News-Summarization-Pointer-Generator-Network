'He left to play in America and in more recent times returned to Oxfordshire and played with Kidlington and last year at AFC Hinksey.

'It's reported that Jordan passed away yesterday while on holiday in Turkey. He was just 23 years old.

'He was extremely popular both on and off the pitch and this awful news has shocked and saddened everyone involved with the football club.

'Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends at this time.' 

The Titanic Hotel is shaped like the doomed liner and has a maritime theme. It’s set on Lara Beach - a strip littered with luxury themed hotels including one shaped like Concorde and another like the Kremlin.

Mr Tabor’s former Chelsea boss, Roman Abramovich, is rumoured to have invested in Lara Beach development after visiting on his yacht several years ago.
