The three Afghanistan National Army officers who attempted to escape to Canada spent more than $1,600 on taxis to travel to the border after researching an escape route on YouTube.

Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar vanished from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, last month and were picked up at a border checkpoint in Niagara Falls.

The men had been participating  in a joint military exercise at Camp Edwards when they seized the opportunity to make their getaway during a group outing to Walmart.

Now they are fighting deportation from a US immigration jail in upstate New York, as they say to send them back to the Afghan army would be to give them a death sentence.

Speaking for the first time to the Boston Globe, in three separate interviews the soldiers said the Taliban are targeting them for fighting alongside the Americans, and they are constantly dodging sniper fire for $400 to $500 a month in pay and little protection.

'They catch us, they kill us,' Major  Arash, 48, said of the Taliban. 'They tip those who kill us.'

The trio say they sought asylum in Canada because they thought it more likely to grant them protection than the United States.

On September 20, the foreign soldiers training at Camp Edwards were given  three hours off duty and two of the Afghan men - Captain Askarzada and Captain Aminyar - split from the group and visited the Walmart.

Captain Askarzada had previously showed the other a YouTube video of people crossing the border into Canada at the Rainbow Bridge - a route popular with tourists.

The soldiers had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries.

The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises.

'If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,' Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told Cape Cod Online.

Major Arash, said he followed the two men and said he was going with them, despite their initial efforts to lose him. 

'I told them I don't have money,' Major Arash said in his interview with the Globe. 'They told me, 'We have a little. Come on'.'

The three men jumped in a taxi and between them shelled out more than $1,600 to travel to Boston and then on to Niagara Falls.

At Cape Cod, US soldiers frantically searched for the men at the Walmart. They even approached a strip club, where the owner said he believes the men visited - something all three vehemently deny.

Captain Aminyar said they made it to Niagara Falls early on September 22 and they spent some time in the park, before attempting to make the crossing.

But when the three soldiers reached the Canadian side at about 10am they were turned back by the authorities, because of an agreement with the United States regarding asylum seekers.

The three soldiers are set to appear in immigration court in Batavia later today.

They say that if they are deported they fear reprisals from the Afghan government, which inaugurated new leadership this week. 

Family members of two soldiers have reported recent death threats in Afghanistan.

Captain Aminyar, a 30-year-old former platoon leader, said just days after he arrived on Cape Cod on September 10, the Taliban went to his family's compound in Nangarhar province searching for him.

'Their leaders, they give the orders to kill me. My father told me the story,' he told the Globe. ''They will find you and they will kill you'. '

He said  he fears for his life, and the lives of his family, including five children.

The soldiers are due to appear before immigration Judge Steven Connelly today, who has approved just 10 per cent of his asylum cases in the past five years, according to TRAC, a research organization at Syracuse University.

'I hope they will not make the wrong decision about us and they will help us,' Captain Aminyar added. 'We work with the United States. We fight with them, we fight together, shoulder by shoulder. Now is the time they should help me.'
