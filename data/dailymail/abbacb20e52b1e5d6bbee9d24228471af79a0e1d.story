Air fares could rise by up to £28 after Heathrow and Gatwick were given leave to push up the charges levied on airlines.

The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday revealed its final proposals on how much the main London airports can increase fees on carriers using their space until 2019.

The regulator said that Heathrow charges should not rise by more than the RPI rate of inflation each year, currently 3.3 per cent. The Gatwick formula for the same period should be RPI plus 0.5 per cent.

Rise: Passengers in Gatwick and Heathrow face higher fares after the airports were allowed to raise fees

Anger: easyJet claims that all passengers could have to pay an extra £28 for their flights

It calculated that the extra charge per passenger would be around £14 at Heathrow by 2019 and £3 at Gatwick.

But easyJet warned that the extra cost for passengers would be far higher if an extra runway was built at Gatwick as it would need to be paid for.

Chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ‘Using Gatwick’s own figures, passengers could be paying £28 more per flight for years in advance of the opening of a new £9 billion runway.’

She claimed ‘the lack of regulatory control of a proposed second runway’ has ‘handed Gatwick a licence to print money’.

The move has also ‘significantly 
enhanced the value’ of Gatwick to its owners, private infrastructure 
fund GIP, in the event of a likely future sale, she added.

However,
the row also came as booming budget airline easyJet announced it now 
expects annual profits of between £470million and £480million, against 
£317million a year earlier, and said revenues per seat were also 
expected to grow by around six per cent on the back of strong passenger 
demand.

Above inflation: The CAA has allowed Gatwick to raise its fees by RPI plus 0.5 per cent every year to 2019

Virgin Atlantic said: ‘It is deeply disappointing the CAA has bowed to pressure from Heathrow.’

The airline added that the rises would be ‘a hammer blow for UK consumers and overseas visitors’ as well as deterring foreign investment.

Fees at Heathrow are triple the level of ten years ago, leaving travellers with ‘some of the highest charges in the world’, it said.

It's the bane of travellers crossing continents, but scientists may be a step closer to a cure for jet lag.

They
have identified a  hormone thought to master the body’s rhythm and so 
stop the brain from rapidly adjusting to new time zones.

Mice
which had been genetically modified so the compound vasopressin failed 
to work were able to deal much better with time shifts.

They almost instantly adjusted to an eight-hour jump whereas normal mice took eight to ten days.

The breakthrough at Kobe University, Japan, raises the prospect of a pill to suppress vasopressin after a flight.

But
the benefits could be much wider, reported the journal Science.

It 
could help shift workers cut health risks by adjusting more quickly to 
their schedules as well as improving the sleep of the elderly and those 
with dementia.

British Airways boss Willie Walsh said: ‘It is a bad day for our customers who have been let down by the CAA.’

He claimed the deal allows ‘complacent’ bosses at Heathrow ‘to ignore its inefficiencies and over-reward investors’.

Dale Keller, chief executive of BAR UK, which represents more than 75 scheduled airlines, joined the criticism.

‘Airline chief executives will be 
reaching for their oxygen masks in the knowledge they will be forced to 
pass on excessive charges to customers,’ he said.

Carriers want lower charges because of other pressures on fares, such as fuel costs.

But the airports said the CAA deal does not go far enough and could jeopardise investment.

Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews wanted a 4.6 per cent rise each year above inflation.

He warned the settlement ‘could have serious and far-reaching consequences’.

Mr Matthews added: ‘The CAA’s proposals risk not only Heathrow’s competitive position but the attractiveness of the UK  for international investment.’

The plans were given ‘a cautious welcome’ by Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate.

Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are the only airports to have charges regulated. A CAA proposal for Stansted is expected next week. A final ruling on all three airports is due in January.

Gatwick chief executive Stewart 
Wingate said: ‘The CAA’s proposal to take forward our commitments 
framework would deliver an improved future outcome for passengers in 
terms of service quality, facilities and price.’
