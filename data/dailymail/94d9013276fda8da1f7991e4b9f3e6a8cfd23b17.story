A depressed woman who strangled her disabled husband with a cravat because he was 'too nice' only failed to murder him because a Sainsbury's driver arrived to deliver their weekly shop, a court heard.

Christine Houston, 66, has admitted the attempted murder of partner Stewart, who said today she is still 'as gentle as a lamb' and he remains 'devoted' to her.

Mrs Houston, who has a history of mental health problems, will be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital for her crime, but Mr Houston believes she should never have been prosecuted.

After her sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court the couple shared a hug outside before she was taken away to hospital.

One of the reasons Mrs Houston, a retired pharmacist, gave for attempting to kill her husband was that he was 'too nice'.

Mr Houston, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and is wheelchair bound, was left with blood spotting behind his eyes and marks to his neck as a result of the attack.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that the attack only stopped when a Sainsbury's shopping delivery arrived and interrupted them.

Mr Houston dialled 999 and said that his wife had tried to strangle him, not long after Mrs Houston herself called the police in a distressed state.

Prosecuting Barrister Jamie Hill QC said: 'She was describing herself as being very cruel from an early age and that she has been neglecting her husband.

'She asserted that she had fooled people for years, that she was a Christian when in fact she was an evil person.

'When the police arrived Mrs Houston said "I tried to kill him, I wanted him dead".'

But outside court today Mr and Mrs Houston shared a loving embrace and Mr Houston said: 'Christine has shown a great deal of sacrifice and love in the 28-years that we have been married.'

The killing bid has been linked to 'carer's fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of looking after a loved one.

Tony Davis, defending said that Mrs Houston had been an 'extremely caring person and a cheerful wife' and that 'thankfully this was a very brief moment in time.'

Mrs Houston, who is of previous good character but suffering from severe mental health problems including bipolar disorder resulting in severe depressive episodes, psychotic episodes and obsessive thoughts which had began in her 20's.

The 66-year-old pleaded guilty to attempted murder at their home in Waldridge, Chester le Street and was held in a secure mental hospital following the attack where she will now remain as Judge Paul Sloane sentenced her to an indefinite hospital order.

Mrs Houston also admitted trying to strangle her husband the day before with his oxygen tube but stopped when the victim asked her to.

Judge Paul Sloan said: 'On May 26 your husband called the police and reported that you had tried to strangle him on that occasion with a cravat.

'You said that you had wanted to kill your husband but as you didn't have a gun and you didn't like knives strangling was all you could think of.

'Your husband still loves you and wants you to receive help.'
