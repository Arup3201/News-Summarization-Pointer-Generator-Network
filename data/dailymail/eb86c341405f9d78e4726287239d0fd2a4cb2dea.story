British ISIS hostage John Cantlie has appeared in another video released by the extremist group in their latest piece of propaganda against the West.

The photojournalist, who went missing last year while working in Syria, sits at a table dressed in an orange jumpsuit in the video titled: 'Lend Me Your Ears, Messages from the British detainee John Cantlie, episode five'.

Staring solemnly at the camera, Mr Cantlie describes himself as 'the British citizen abandoned by my government and a prisoner of the Islamic State for nearly two years'.

John Cantlie has appeared in a fifth video message from ISIS jihadis in which he describes how captives were treated when taken hostage by terrorists last year

Reciting 'emails' he claims were written by the families of American hostages Mr Cantlie says nothing was done to secure their release by US governments 

Describing the 'second phase' of the terrorists' agenda to kidnap western journalists, he says he and his fellow prisoners 'were treated well' by ISIS jihadis before some were murdered and others released.

'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. 

'Some of us who tried to escape were water-boarded by our captain as Muslim prisoners are water-boarded by their American captors.

'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life.'

Unlike other videos, a small stack of papers and a pen lie in front of him on the table. They are, he claims, emails between the families of American hostages and the US government. 

Reciting the alleged words of relatives of journalists taken hostage by IS, Mr Cantlie says that no help was given to families communicating with ISIS by US representatives. 

Emotionless, he describes how other European hostages were released after negotiations were successfully carried out by French, German and Danish governments. 

Reading from pieces of paper Mr Cantlie alleges that US governments did nothing to secure the safe return of hostages 

The video is the fifth in a series, described by the hostage as 'programmes' in which he describes life under ISIS rule 

'But it was clear something was different with the British and Americans,' he says. 

'While there was dialogue for everyone else, the British and the Americans were stone- walled - it was completely silent. Nothing.'

As the footage continues, Mr Cantlie talks of how the hostages did not give up hope of being saved by Western intervention. 

And in a potential nod to his unimaginable bravery, or, a cruel taunt by jihadis written into his script, he says: 'The human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self-defence in difficult situations.'  

The fifth video comes after his sister said earlier this week she thinks he believes 'two-thirds' of what he says on camera.

In September, U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff (right) was killed by ISIS in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading. His murder came just weeks after another American reporter, James Foley (left), was killed

Jessica Cantlie made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home. 

Just two days ago, Mr Cantlie's father died following a public appeal from his hospital bed. 

Paul Cantlie, 80, spoke directly to ISIS extremists in a heartfelt video, pleading for his son's return. 

His grieving family revealed they did not know whether Mr Cantlie's captors had received the messages, or whether he had even been informed of his father's death. 

In September, U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff was killed by ISIS in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading. His murder came just weeks after another American reporter, James Foley, was killed. 

British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning have also been beheaded by the terror group.

'Hello, I'm John Cantlie, the British citizen abandoned by my own government and a prisoner of the Islamic State for nearly two years.

'In this programme I'm going to reveal to you some uncomfortable truths that have so far resulted in the executions of my former cellmates. 

'Only the British and American prisoners were left behind after months of negotiations saw 16 other citizens from six European countries go home. 

'How was this allowed to happen?

'We have to go back to 2013 when the Islamic State launched a long term operation to capture westerners entering Syria and they began the next phase of the operation - negotiating for our release with our governments through family and friends.

'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. Some of us who tried to escape were water-boarded by our captors as Muslim prisoners are water-boarded by their American captors.

'Our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times.

'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life.

'The first to leave was my friend, Spanish journalist Marcos Margineres (sic) in Feb 2014. The Mujahadeen then made their first strong move by shooting one of our number -  a Russian with no clear origin or story behind him. 

'The message was clear: don't mess around when it comes to negotiations.

'The Europeans fell into line, two more Spanish journalists left, then four French, their representatives having fulfilled the conditions for their release

'But it was clear something was different for the British and Americans. While there was dialogue for everyone else the British and Americans were stone walled - it was completely silent. Nothing.'

'Now we knew our countries claimed to be non-negotiating when it came to situations like this but also knew examples when they had negotiated either under the table or through a third party.

'Due to the size and complexity of the situation, and the number of other countries involved

'We believed our governments would get us out in the end. So we waited patiently while everyone else went home to their loved ones.

'Finally we had movement in May. We made a video, wrote letters and made a voice recording. For us the Islamic State were asking for the release of Muslim prisoners and their transfer to the Caliphate. 

'It sounded very complicated but we were the biggest group from the biggest countries (so) there had to be a negotiation going on. 

'But by the time the other two Europeans left, my friend Dan from Denmark, another non-negotiating country, and Tony from Germany, it was clear to us we were in very big trouble.

'Now I have here a selection of emails between the Islamic State and families back home.

'I don't have much on the British so I assume there was even less discussion going on for them. So this is really all about the Americans and you'll see that really the government was doing nothing, absolutely noting, to help the families involved.

'I have a message here from one of the American prisoners on 11 June: "I would secure your sister's release, if I could. It sounds like you care about her freedom.

"You have surely seen the news, our government is a mess, they will not help."

Another here, from the family of one of the American prisoners on July 17 2014: 'Our government is not being helpful. 

We have begged them so many times already. Everyone has buried their heads in the sand, we feel we are caught in the middle between you and the US government and we are being punished. 

'We have reached out to our government but they have been non-responsive for some time now. 

'We don't expect to get any help from our government at all and we feel foolish for believing them."  

Another on the 24 July says: "We are contacting people every day, you have given us a huge mountain to climb and we feel like a pawn in this political battle that we have been forced into.

"I am taking everything you have said seriously, and am working as fast as I can. I need more time."

'Now, the recurring element in these emails is the government, the US government was simply doing absolutely nothing, to help the families involved in this negotiation.

'The Mujaheddin told us our government didn't care about us and we didn't believe them. They told us we were worthless and we didn't believe them.

'We were told we'd start to die and we didn't believe that either. The human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self-defence in difficult situations.

'But It was all true. Our governments had chosen not to negotiate with the Islamic State through our families and friends. And while everyone else had fulfilled conditions for release, for us there was no deal.

'Join me in the next programme as we learn about a failed rescue to try to get us out, and you'll hear about how one soldier was worth five prisoners and we were worth none.'

Mr Cantlie was among a collection of western journalists taken hostage in Syria by ISIS jihadis last year
