David Villa scored on his Melbourne City debut to claim a point as his new club drew 1-1 with Sydney FC at the Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

The 32-year-old frontman came off the bench to strike in the 63rd minute, cancelling out Corey Gameiro's stunning opener ten minutes earlier.

Villa, assisted by former Chelsea, Newcastle and Fulham wideman Damien Duff from the right, controlled the ball on the edge of the area and beat his man before placing the ball in the bottom corner.

The 32-year-old had not played any competitive football since the World Cup in Brazil during the summer

The Spaniard, on loan at the A-League club having signed for New York City in the summer, was clearly delighted as he jumped to punch the air with a beaming smile on his face.

The former Spain international had not played any competitive football since his country's exit at the World Cup in the summer, but the 32-year-old has been training with a group of players at his parent club ahead of this week's A-League kick-off.

The ex-Barcelona attacker is playing for the Australian side to maintain match fitness ahead of the new MLS season which starts in March.

The World Cup winner will link up with fellow New York City new boy Frank Lampard - the Chelsea legend is currently on loan at Manchester City in a similar switch to Villa's - upon his return to America in the new year.
