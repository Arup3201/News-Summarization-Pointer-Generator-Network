A flash of iridescent colour when a  dragonfly darts over a pond is an evocative image of summer. And it is one that is being witnessed more and more often, new data reveals.

Dragonflies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to conservation work and warmer weather.

A project that tracked different species over five years has led to a comprehensive Atlas of the Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland, published today.

Voracious spread: From its landing spot in Essex, the small red-eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country, spreading to the Isle of Wight in the south, Devon in the west and Yorkshire in the north

It found seven new species have been sighted in England in the past 20 years after migrating from the Continent.

Six had not been seen here before and one re-established itself after a six-decade absence.

Some, including the small red-eyed damselfly which was first sighted in England in 1999, have since spread voraciously across Britain.

From its landing spot in Essex, the small red-eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country, spreading to the Isle of Wight in the south, Devon in the west and Yorkshire in the north.

The dainty damselfly, absent in Britain for 57 years, made a surprising reappearance in Kent in 2010 and has now established a colony on the Isle of Sheppey.

The atlas combines pre-existing conservation data with new information collected by 6,600 British Dragonfly Society volunteers between 2008 and 2012.

The results established that 14 of the 42 established British breeding species have expanded their ranges.

Conservationists think that dragonflies, which are extremely sensitive to temperature change, have benefited from a warming climate and a general increase in the number and quality of wetlands.

Atlas editor Steve Cham, of the British Dragonfly Society, said: ‘Dragonflies are a very good indicator of the quality of environment.

‘They need good, clean water to survive, so typically the more dragonflies, the better the quality of the water.

‘But more significant is the impact of changing climate. We think new species are coming here because it is gradually getting warmer, and dragonflies are very sensitive to that.’

Dr Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, which helped contributed to the atlas, added: ‘This represents inspiring contributions from many, many volunteers across Britain and Ireland.

‘Dragonflies are charismatic and popular insects but they also provide an important insight into the ways in which our environment is changing.

‘Not only is the atlas another wonderful example of citizen science but it is also providing valuable scientific evidence.’

Dragonflies, which have existed on Earth for 325million years, have been threatened by widespread insecticide use, water pollution and the draining of wetlands for housing.

The research found that eight species, including the scarce blue-tailed damselfly and white-faced damselfly, have declined in recent years.

But overall the trend seems to have been reversed, with warm summers, conservation efforts and cleaner water providing better conditions for the ancient insects.
