Ill patients who dial 999 for an ambulance are increasingly being sent police cars or taxis instead.

One ambulance service has seen a staggering 350 per cent increase in the use of taxis to pick up patients in three years.

It comes as ministers announced how £250million would be used in the most stretched A&Es to prevent a crisis in the NHS this winter.

Ambulance trusts are using taxis, police cars and firefighters to take patients to hospital, the Commons heard

Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws by Labour reveal that in 2012-13 158 taxis attended 999 calls in the South Western Ambulance Service area. In 2009-10 the number was just 35.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham also warned police cars were being used on a daily basis to ferry patients to hospital.

In another area an ambulance service is using retained firefighters to attend calls.

The warning about the crisis in the NHS comes as new figures showed freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 extra deaths, in England and Wales. It marked a 29 per cent increase on the previous year.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today announced details of how an extra £250 million for struggling A&E units will be spent this winter.

It includes almost 2,500 extra beds the equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff.

Freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 deaths, new figures show.

The number of 'excess winter deaths' in England and Wales rose by dramatically by 29 per cent compared with the previous year.

Campaigners condemned the figures as a 'national scandal'.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the majority of the excess deaths were among pensioners - with over-75s accounting for 25,600 winter-related deaths in 2012-13.

Temperatures plunged across Britain at the start of this year, with March the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just 2.6C (36.7F).The ONS said: 'The number of deaths peaked in the first week of January, which coincided with a peak in rates of influenza-like illness over the Christmas weeks.

'The mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.'

More women died as a result of the cold (18,000) compared to 13,100 men.

But in the Commons he was challenged over
 the increasing reliance of over-stretched ambulance services on other 
vehicles to take patients to hospital.

Mr Burnham claimed that as A&Es fill up, ambulances become ‘trapped’ and unable to handover patients.

He urged Mr Hunt to take action now to avoid the ambulance hold-ups ‘engulfing’ other emergency services.

Mr Burnham told the Commons: ‘Today I want to put to you new evidence that the A&E crisis is deepening and having a serious knock-on effect on ambulance services.

‘Information from police forces reveals that police cars having to ferry patients to A&E is far more widespread than people realise and in some areas happening on a daily basis.

‘One ambulance service is now using retained firefighters to attend calls but this is how bad things have got - another ambulance service has seen a 350 per cent increase in the number of 999 calls attended by taxis.

‘Do you think it's ever acceptable that when a patient dials 999 a taxi turns up instead?’

But Mr Hunt accused his shadow of 
talking up a crisis that is not happening and said the coalition was 
hitting its targets, unlike the last Labour administration when Mr 
Burnham was health secretary.

Mr
 Hunt replied: ‘I'm afraid this is utterly irresponsible. We are hitting
 our A&E target, we are hitting our ambulance standard. When you 
were health secretary you missed the ambulance standard for October, 
November, December and January.

‘What
 you are doing is trying to talk up a crisis that isn't happening and 
you should think about people on the front line and just for once put 
patients before politics.’

Mr Burnham suggested that the country would have heard Mr Hunt's ‘complacency’ and warned large parts of the country did not have adequate ambulance cover.

He told the Health Secretary: ‘You didn't condemn the use of taxis. I'll tell you now, it's unacceptable but it's happening on your watch and why?

‘Because ambulances are trapped at A&Es, unable to hand over patients. This means 999 response times are getting worse and large swathes of the country right now are without adequate ambulance cover.

‘Isn't it time you were honest with the public, admitted the scale of the crisis facing the NHS this winter and took action now to prevent it engulfing other emergency services?’
