Detectives are warning the public not to approach Peter Holboll, 44, pictured, who is being sought following the death of his mother Tamara, 68, in Camden, north London

A man with suspected mental health problems who is being sought by police after his mother was found stabbed to death could be armed with a murder weapon, officers fear.

Detectives are warning the public not to approach Peter Holboll, 44, who is being sought following the death of his mother Tamara, 68, in Camden, north London, earlier today.

Ms Holboll’s body was found in a burnt-out flat by firefighters who were called to a blaze in Lawford Road, Kentish Town, at around 5.15am.

Detectives are now hunting her son Peter, who is believed to suffer a psychological illness, following her death.

Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, of the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said he ‘could not exclude’ the possibility that Holboll was armed with a murder weapon.

DCI Taylor said: ‘I need to locate him. I don't want people to approach him and put themselves at risk.

‘Mental health is one of the things we are looking into, we are engaging with our partners and agencies to build up as full a picture as we can for Peter.

‘We are very concerned for him and for the public.’

Firefighters were called to the blaze which broke out in a ground floor flat in the residential area, where houses sell for £1.5million, in the early hours of the morning.

London Fire Brigade said three women, a man and a baby from separate flats on the first and second floors of the building were all rescued by crews after they managed to escape to the roof.

DCI Taylor said firefighters then found the body of Ms Holboll, who had been stabbed, and alerted Metropolitan Police which sent officers and a force helicopter to the scene.

He said: ‘It would appear that the victim had a number of knife wounds although we are awaiting the results of tests.’

He confirmed Peter Holboll had been staying at the address before the attack but did not give any indication if he had left sheltered accommodation.

Tamara Holboll's body was found in a burnt-out flat by firefighters who were called to a blaze in Lawford Road, Kentish Town, at around 5.15am

He said: ‘The early indications are he is a local man and he frequents the local area, I have had nothing to suggest otherwise.

‘There were other people within the address who were brought out by the fire brigade.

‘It was fortunate that the fire was noticed at the point it did before it became truly established and they were able to get out.’

DCI Taylor said officers were looking at the history of the mother and son and what contact they had had with police in the run up to the murder.

According to locals, an ambulance was seen at the house yesterday.

A London Ambulance spokesperson said they had been called to ‘reports of a person unwell’ at 2.45pm and treated a man at the scene before taking him to hospital.

However, the ambulance service could not confirm if the patient was Holboll.

Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder, as well as the cause of the fire, and have set up an incident room under DCI Taylor. The property has remained cordoned off for most of today

Holboll is described as a white unshaven male, between 5ft 10ins to 5ft 11ins tall, with lank black hair and wearing a green T-shirt and brown trousers.

Police said that, if seen, he should not be approached and members of the public should dial 999 immediately.

The incident has shocked neighbours in the street, who were awoken this morning by firefighters arriving at the scene and a police helicopter circling overhead.

One neighbour said: ‘We’ve heard a woman who lived five doors away had been killed and then someone tried to set fire to the flat.

‘But she lived on the ground floor, there are two flats above her with a woman and a small baby trapped on the top floor.’

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, described Holboll as ‘troubled’.

They said: ‘We are worried he’s still in the area, the police helicopter came back around lunchtime and hovered around for a while.

'He might be lurking nearby and we now have a description of what he was wearing to look out for him.

‘He was a troubled guy, she had a lot of trouble with him. He had serious mental issues and they were due to visit the Crisis Centre nearby on Leighton Road.

‘He was living in some kind of sheltered accommodation near Tottenham Court Road but he’d always sit on the doorstep chain smoking one cigarette after another.

‘He would never say hello, and always looked unkempt with scruffy hair.

‘The police are here so hopefully we will be safe.’

Dr Zara Jay, a clinical psychologist who used to live above Ms Hoboll, said: ‘I heard from a neighbour that there had been an episode before I moved in in 2004.

‘An ambulance and police had been called to the flat, something had happened in there that had a mental health flavour to it, but I didn’t know if it was for him or for her.

‘He kept himself to himself, you would occasionally get a grunt from him in the corridor when you came and went and happened to bump into him.

‘He’d usually be smoking a cigarette on the doorstep. I never diagnosed him formally, but I have been told there were some issues there.’

Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder, as well as the cause of the fire, and have set up an incident room under DCI Taylor.

London Fire Brigade, which sent four fire engines, 21 firefighters and several officers to the scene, said it was working with the force to help investigate the blaze.

A spokesman said: ‘The fire damaged the ground floor flat where sadly a woman inside was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘A man, three women and a baby from flats on the first and second floors were trapped on a flat roof at the back of the house because of the fire below.

‘The Brigade’s 999 control officers gave them fire survival guidance until crews arrived to bring them down to safety using a ladder.

‘One of the women was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.

‘The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Brigade’s fire investigation unit and the Metropolitan Police.’

Police said no arrests had been made in connection with the murder and said formal identification of the body had not yet been carried out. 

A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place tomorrow.

Anyone with information about the incident should call the incident Room on 0208 721 4868 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
