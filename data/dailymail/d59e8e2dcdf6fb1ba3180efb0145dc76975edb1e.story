Threats: Five-year-old Mia Talerico has been targetetd by an internet troll, threatening to kill the Good Luck Charlie star

Los Angeles Police are today hunting an internet troll who has made death threats to the five-year-old star of the Disney series Good Luck Charlie.

In a series of messages posted on Mia Talerico's Instagram account, the suspect has threatened to kill the child star, adding she 'deserves to die'.

Mia, who plays Charlie Duncan in the show, began receiving the threatening messages last month, reportedÂ TMZ.com.

The account is managed by the five-year-old's mother Claire Talerico.

According to police documents obtained by the site, the suspect posted the first message: 'Die Mia, F***ing Die in hell! Kill yourself, you deserve to die.'

The suspect then posted another message, which included a picture of Mia's head with a bloody fist covering it, with the message: 'Yes, kill you stupid b**ch.'

The LAPD are said to be taking the matter seriously, after Mrs Talerico contacted Disney security.

The force is understood to have assigned their Threat Management Unit to the case, launching a full investigation to track the suspect.

Mia who plays the lead role of Charlotte (Charlie) Duncan in the Disney show, first started filming for her role when she was eleven months old.

Good Luck Charlie will come to an end after four series, later this month.

Investigation: Mia first received the death threats on her Instagram account last month. Her mother Claire Talerico, who manages the account, reported the threats to Disney's security.
