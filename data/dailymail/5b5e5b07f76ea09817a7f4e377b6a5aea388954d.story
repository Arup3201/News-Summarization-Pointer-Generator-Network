A second girlfriend of Justin Lee Collins has spoken of her 'year of hell' with the shamed presenter, claiming he abused her emotionally and demanded a list of her previous sexual partners.

Pretty Jo Vandervlist said the comic 'sucked the life' out of her, 'got under her skin' and before she knew it was 'controlling her', according to a report yesterday.

Collins, 38, who was last week found guilty of a single charge of harassment against Anna Larke, had been married at the time of his affair with Ms Vandervlist, 37.

Ex-partner: Jo Vandervlist, 37, has spoken of her 'year of hell' with shamed presenter Justin Lee Collins

She had befriended him on the social 
networking site MySpace in September 2006. The mother-of-two says the 
relationship had started well; Collins had been intense and 'attentive'.

But before long he 
accused her of being attracted to other men and ordered her to reply to 
his text messages within three minutes, she told The Sunday Mirror.

Ms
Vandervlist also claims Collins made her list her previous sexual 
partners in a chilling echo of the abuse he subject Ms Larke to.

But, despite her ordeal Ms Larke, 38, today admitted she may still have feelings for the long-haired presenter.

When
asked whether she still loved Collins by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones 
on ITV's Daybreak, Ms Larke said: 'I think so, yes. I think so, I don’t 
know. I'm so confused, my head is still kind of confused about it.'

Ms Vandervlist also admits Collins was hard to walk away from. 'He had become a big part of my life 
and he could quickly become the "nice Justin’ again", she said. 'But the nasty side
was getting worse.'

Soon after they met on Myspace, the couple began exchanging flirty emails, despite Collins being married.

Ms Vandervlist, an aspiring actress, said she had been drawn to the presenter who had seemed genuine, sincere and charming.

They then met in person after Collins invited her to a recording of his show The Friday Night Project, which he hosted with Alan Carr.

Ms Vandervlist said: 'He 
felt like my best friend. He was fixated on me, as though it was just me
and him there. On leaving the bar he grabbed my hand. It was an intense
meeting.'

Difficult: Ms Larke said she 'cried for months' after breaking up with Collins. She said she had been the kind of person who would not have tolerated domestic abuse. 'The minute someone swore at me I'd be gone,' she said

They met again two weeks later in London and went with Mighty Boosh star Noel Fielding and Duncan James from boy band Blue, to a party.

Later on he accused her of flirting with the pair.

Ms Vandervlist said: 'He said to me, "I bet you enjoyed that kiss from Noel and I 
bet you fancied Duncan, I bet he is your type".'

'He said one kiss at the end of a 
message was for a friend, two for more and three for someone special. He
insisted on three. He was trying to control me.'Jo Vandervlist, 37

She added that Collins then became 'obsessed' with comments from other men on her MySpace page and even analysed how long it took her to reply to a text message.

She said: 'Once he said, "normally that would 
take you three minutes to respond but it has taken you 11 minutes. You 
must be a busy girl this evening". He said one kiss at the end of a 
message was for a friend, two for more and three for someone special. He
insisted on three. He was trying to control me.'

Ms Vandervlist became more and more 
withdrawn, eventually visiting her GP and being described with anti 
depressants. Then a friend suggested Collins may be subjecting a string 
of women to similar abuse and a light bulb switched on.

Her
fears were confirmed after visiting the set of another TV recording in 
2007 to get closure from the star. There she met Ms Larke who was also a
guest of the presenter along with a third woman.

'My
friend had been right about him,' Ms Vandervlist, now married, said. 
'His wife was four months’ pregnant and he had invited three women to 
his show. I am just relieved I got out of the situation when I did, 
otherwise what happened to Anna could have ­happened to me.'

Ms Larke revealed today that she cried for months after her relationship with Collins ended.

She said: 'I didn’t actually go to the police. When I left him on July 4, I just went home to my parents and slept in the spare room and for about two and half months I was just crying and looking at websites about domestic abuse because I was always one of these people who just thought, "I'd never put up with that. The minute someone swore at me I'd be gone."

'But it was my dad who went to the police. I was reluctant to, but I spoke to them and they were amazing and I just thought there is no way I can let him get away with this because who’s he going to hurt next?'

She added: 'I wanted to stop the cycle before it happens to anyone else, and also I want to with this to send out the message that emotional abuse can be more damaging than physical abuse because my bruises – external bruises fade but the bruises inside me they are still there, it’s really hard.'

Collins was given a 140-hour community sentence and ordered him to pay £3,500 costs after the trial last week.

On his sentence, Ms Larke said: 'I was pleased that he got convicted, but I was appalled at the sentence - community service for what he did.'

Asked why she put up with the abuse, the PR said: 'I absolutely adored him, he was the love of my life, I absolutely loved him. Like in the beginning he was so lovely, but gently, ever so – I don’t know how they do it, but the abuse is just sort of drip fed, and by the time that you’re in love and completely smitten and I’ve moved in with him and everything, then you think, "Oh my God, he’s a control freak" because I’ve got no friends now.'

A spokesman for Justin Lee Collins had 'no comment'.
