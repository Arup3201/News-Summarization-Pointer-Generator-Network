An advert for a SodaStream machine due to air in a prime slot on ITV was pulled at the last minute - because it encouraged viewers to shun bottled soft drinks to help save the environment.

The commercial for the soda maker was to be screened during a break in last night's episode of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here, but a watchdog decided it could not be aired because it was unfairly critical of the soft drinks industry.

SodaStream UK branded the decision to pull its ad - which shows familiar looking plastic bottles of fizzy drinks exploding as people hit the button on the machine - 'absurd'.

Pulled: The advert shows a woman hitting the button on her SodaStream machine

As she hits the button, the scene cuts to some familiar looking plastic bottles disappearing

The advert sees various people using a SodaStream machine to create their own carbonated drinks.

Each time somebody presses the button on the soda maker, rows of plastic bottles are seen disappearing, sending the fizzy contents pouring on to the ground.

The firm said it had hoped to deliver a 'powerful message' about waste and sustainability with its new campaign, which ends with the line: 'With SodaStream, you can save 2,000 bottles per year'.

But just before the campaign was due to hit screens, Clearcast, the organisation that pre-approves UK TV advertising, decided the commercial was unsuitable.

Sustainable: SodaStream UK insisted it had not named or disparaged any competitors in its advert

SodaStream said it was told by Clearcast that the advert could be seen to encourage consumers not to go to supermarkets and buy soft drinks, but instead to help save the environment by buying a soda making machine.

Fiona Hope, managing director of SodaStream UK, said: 'This decision is absurd. We have neither named nor disparaged any of our competitors in the industry and cannot see how this makes any sense.

She said the decision appeared to give priority to 'soft drink giants' over concern for the environment.

'Through the ad, we are simply displaying an alternative way to living more sustainably and illustrating one of our product's benefits - the reduction of plastic bottle wastage,' she said.

'The consumer should be allowed to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and the products to choose.'

The company intends to push for the decision to be reversed.

Although SodaStream said it was informed the environmental message in its advert was partly to blame for it being pulled, Clearcast said last night that environmental issues were 'not relevant' to its decision.

Clearcast said in a statement: 'SodaStream submitted a finished filmed ad to us for approval on Tuesday 20th November without a pre-production script.

'On Thursday 22nd November we had been able to review it against the BCAP code and concluded we were unable to approve it.

'In our view, its visual treatment denigrated other soft drinks which put it in breach of the BCAP code.'

The organisation said that should SodaStream put forward an amended version it would work with the firm to agree an 'acceptable treatment'.
