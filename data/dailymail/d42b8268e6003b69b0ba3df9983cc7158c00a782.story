Richard Shepherd (pictured) from Doncaster, has been jailed for two years after he admitted stealing thousands from a children's hospice

An accountant who stole more than £13,000 from a hospice for terminally ill children has been jailed for two years.

Richard Shepherd, from Doncaster, admitted the 'deplorable' theft after suspicious staff at the South Yorkshire-based Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice installed covert cameras.

He was then captured 'red-handed' stealing two large bundles of cash and stashing them down his trousers.

All the money pocketed by the 26-year-old financial assistant had been given by the public, including generous donations from children who had handed over their birthday gifts and mourners who donated at funerals.

Jailing him, Judge Julian Goose said the terminally ill children at the hospice were 'exceptionally vulnerable' and Shepherd had even met those donating to the charity.

'You personally saw them as they gave you money and you took it from them,' he told him.

'It could have supported children and their families through some of the toughest times they could experience,' he told him.  

Sheffield Crown Court heard a new chief executive at the hospice became suspicious when she saw him hide something in his pockets and later count cash before work which was not normal procedure.

Covert cameras were installed inside the  office and footage showed Shepherd stealing the cash and hiding it down his trousers.

He was challenged but initially would only admit to stealing £850. He was sacked and the police were called, said David Wain, prosecuting. He was arrested on July 2, 2013. 

'He was caught red-handed in essence,' said Mr Wain who added that the theft had a detrimental effect on Bluebell Wood.

Shepherd, who worked for the charity for four years, admitted fraud over a seven-month period between December 1, 2012 and July 1,2013.

The prosecution claimed he stole £20,748 but the defence would only accept a figure of £13,500 and Shepherd was sentenced on the latter figure. 

The court heard he used a 'sleight of hand' to pocket the charity cash.

He kept some cheques back given by well-wishers instead of banking them and recording the amount on the donations account system.

When cash was donated he would record the donation but instead of banking it he would submit a cheque for the same amount - leaving him able to deposit the money in his own account.

'This was not an arms-length fraud, he was in contact with the ultimate victims of these offences,' said Mr Wain.

The hospice, based in Rotherham, costs more than £3 million a year to run and has to raise over 95 per cent of that funding itself.

Shepherd worked alongside another accountant in the finance office and was the junior but often accepted the public donations.

Richard Sheldon, defending, said: 'They were offences that were bound to be discovered at some stage, it was only a matter of time. He is totally ashamed of what he has done.' 

Shepherd had held two jobs in the Doncaster area, working a night shift and delivering fish and chips before he started nights to support his new partner who was pregnant.

He has since been thrown out of the matrimonial home and voluntarily sought counselling.

Judge Goose said he stole at least £13,500 and other proceeds of crime proceedings would ascertain just how much he gained.

Bluebell Wood provided a vital support service for 'desperately ill' children which relied on charitable donations. 'They have to work hard for every penny,' he said.

Shepherd's role was to protect the charity's financial interests and his 'high impact' crime had a serious detrimental effect on Bluebell Wood, he added.

The judge told him: 'The loss of this money means less care can be provided and what you did may well affect significantly the willingness of people to give to this charity.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Clare Rintoul chief executive of Bluebell Wood said: 'We're absolutely sickened that a member of our staff who was in a position of trust has stolen funds from Bluebell Wood.

'Our supporters range from small children giving up their birthday presents to retired grandmothers skydiving for us; all so that we can provide vital support and services to children who won’t live to adulthood and their families.'

'This is a shocking act of calculated betrayal and we hope justice means he will never get the opportunity to do this again.'

PC Angela Hardwick who led the investigation said: 'Shepherd's actions are deplorable. To steal money from a charitable organisation especially one that provides essential care and support for terminally ill children and their families is despicable.

'The money he stole allowed Shepherd to fund a lifestyle far above that afforded by his legitimate income.'
