An opulent mansion financed by one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution has been put on the market for a cut price £4million.

Dunstall Hall in Burton on Trent, Staffordshire, boasts 12 bedrooms, its own lake, orangery, ball room, a labyrinth of cellars and even has its own cricket pitch.

The Grade Two Listed property was paid for by the profits of Sir Richard Arkwright, one of the leading entrepreneurs of the 18th century and credited with transforming Britain's fortunes.

Up for sale: The grand Dunstall Hall in Staffordshire is on the market for a cut price £4million and was financed by one of the founding fathers of the Industrial Revolution in Britain

Added extras: Set in 85 acres with magnificent gardens, the mansion also has a beautiful cricket pitch in its Staffordshire grounds

Icing on the cake: The magnificent orangery at the hall, which has had its priced slashed by £1million because of a lack of interest

Stunning: Set in the rolling hills of Staffordshire the impressive property has it all either for a rich landowner or for a developer looking to open a new hotel or wedding venue

He invented the spinning frame, which made it easy to spin thread from wool or yarn, and later opened the world's first water-powered cotton mill in 1771, an act that made him a pioneer of British engineering.

A self-made man who was taught to read and write by his cousin, Mr Arkwright accumulated huge wealth and his son, Richard Jr, used it to finance this vast property.

The grand mansion was put on the market for £5million last May but estate agents Strutt and Parker have been forced to slash £1million after failing to get enough interest.

Agent Luke Morgan said: 'The thing about the house is there are two types of end users - someone who has made a few quid and wants a good-sized house, or the commercial buyer, who thinks they can create a swanky hotel or a wedding venue.

'It's appealing to quite a lot of people.

'It is worth more than that, but what we get for it depends on who is out there.'

Through the gates: The house is one of Britain's most splendid yet estate agents have admitted that they have struggled to find a buyer willing to pay £5million for it

Dynasty: Richard Arkwright accumulated huge wealth and his son, Richard Jr, used it to finance this vast property which he then passed on to his child in the 19th century

History: The Grade II listed property is built on land occupied since 1145 where it is believed the Earl of Derby built a grand hunting lodge in a royal forest

Special entrance: Even the main door of Dunstall Hall is grand, and is hand-carved with images of its vast grounds showing its animals and animals hunting on horseback

Tapestry of colour: The mansion has a mosaic in its main hallway and also has a number of grand painted ceilings covered in precious gold leaf

Grandeur: The building contains lavis decorations like stained-glass windows and this hand carved sweeping staircase at its heart

The estate, which sits in 85.7 acres of rolling countryside, dates back to 1145 when the manor was owned by the Earl of Derby.

The main building, which still exists today, was built by Sir Richard Jr in 1814 who passed it onto his son Charles who lived there until he died in 1850.

It was sold to the High Sheriff of Staffordshire John Hardy who carried out extensive alterations and improvements to the property including the new entrance with portico.

In 1953 civil engineer Sir Richard Douglas purchased the property until he died in 1997 when it passed to race course owner Sir Stanley Clarke.

Sir Stanley converted the property into a hotel and wedding venue until he put it on the market last May.

The cricket pitch, which is included in the particulars, is known as Deer Park and is the home of Dunstall Cricket Club who play in the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League.

Special: Cromford Mills in the Derwent Valley, Derbyshire, was built by Sir Richard Arkwright at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and changed his and Britain's fortunes

Sir Richard Arkright, right, was one of the founding fathers of the Industrial Revolution in Britain.

Born in 1732 and the youngest of 13, his tailor father could not afford to send him to school so he was educated by his cousin.

But from those humble beginnings sprung a genius who created a number of life-changing inventions culminating in the truly revolutionary water-propelled spinning frame, which led
 to the mass production of cotton thread.

Sir Richard started work as a trainee barber and wig maker in Bolton, where he later invented and patented waterproof dye.

This cash was used to finance prototypes that would later spin thread so successfully.

In doing so this former Lancashire barber unleashed the Industrial Revolution on the world.

Arkwright's engineering invention is credited along with James Hargreaves's Spinning Jenny with transforming the British economy.

Having created the world's first water-powered cotton mill he  died in 1792,  and his son, Richard Jr, would then carry on his dynasty and make even more money.

As well as maintaining the family's network of factories he also invested cash in property and government bonds, saving himself from financial ruin in the recession following the Napeolonic Wars.

He also helped finance canals and railways and at his death he was worth an astonishing £3milllion in 1829.

This comfortably made him the richest non-Royal in Britain and he used his money to build Dunstall Hall for his son Charles.
