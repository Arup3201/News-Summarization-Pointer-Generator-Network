Jenson Button says that love is more important than money in his rocky relationship with Formula One.

The British driver exhibited all his skills in coming fourth at Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix — five places ahead of his McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen.

Yet, bar a late change of mind from the team hierarchy, it is Button who will make way when Fernando Alonso joins for next season, despite having outscored Magnussen 106 points to 55 this season.

Button is sore. ‘You want to feel like you are wanted in a team and part of the family,’ he said. ‘It’s like if your parents were to turn round and say, “We’re not sure we want you at Christmas this year. But your brother can come, he’s great”.

‘Feeling part of a family is more important than money.

‘Whatever happens next year, the money is not the issue in any way, shape or form, for me anyway. Whether I’m racing here in F1 or racing somewhere else, I do it because I love it.

‘I still want to earn money from it because I feel I have achieved and should get paid for what I do in a racing car and for what I bring to a team. But I’m not a driver who takes the p*** and I will race somewhere even if I’m not getting the big bucks, unlike a few drivers who are out there.

‘You should get what you deserve and I feel I bring a lot not just in terms of results but in terms of marketing within a team and working with sponsors, and how I can help develop a car.’

The decision whether to keep Button rests with Ron Dennis, the group chairman, and Eric Boullier, the racing director. Part of the reason they prefer Magnussen is money-related. The Dane earns £500,000 a year whereas Button is on about £10million.

Alonso’s wages, which will be in excess of £15m, must be accommodated. The burden will be shared half and half with McLaren’s incoming partners Honda.

Button added: ‘I haven’t spoken to Ron since Austin (the previous race). It’s not for me to talk to him. I’m just doing my job, enjoying racing and getting the most from the car, and that doesn’t include discussing the future with Ron because that’s not where my head wants to be.

Button admits feeling emotional after reading heartfelt messages of support from fans on Twitter

‘When I’m on Twitter looking at fans’ messages, I haven’t seen a negative comment for some time. It makes you very emotional seeing how much support you get from the fans. There’s even more support than when I won the world championship. That really does mean a lot.

‘I did some TV and they said “do you want to stay if you can win races?” and I said “Yeah, I’ve done my schooling in F1, I’ve come of age at 34, I’m ready for it!”

‘In Brazil we were almost fighting for the podium, though a couple of steps are still needed to fight for wins. I really enjoyed it and if every race was like that, you’d want to race for several more years.’
