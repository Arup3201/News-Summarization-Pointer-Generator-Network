One woman has found that it is possible to survive for a week eating only the 59 foods represented by emoji - though it is not necessarily healthy.

New York-based writer Kelsey Rexroat chronicled her experiment for The Atlantic, noting that the diet is 'essentially the opposite of Atkins' due to its emphasis on desserts, rice-heavy items and alcoholic drinks.

Not only did Ms Rexroat limit her consumption to items with emoji counterparts, but she challenged herself to eat every emoji food during the seven days.

While items such as milk and bananas were already in her fridge, unfamiliar images forced her to consult the Emojipedia, a site that identifies each symbol by its official name designated by the Unicode Consortium.

Fortunately she was able to find oden - a broth filled with eggs and fish cakes - at a neighborhood restaurant, and dango - a sweet dumpling dish - at a local Japanese food market.

While Ms Rexroat was happy to eat more seafood and fresh fruit, she also cites sugar and white rice as common themes.

'Of the 59 food emoji, eight incorporate rice, and 11 are desserts,' she found.

There are also plenty of boozy beverages: After imbibing red wine, sake, a tropical cocktail and beer during her first four nights, she notes 'clearly the emoji diet is not for teetotalers.'

She also realized that items such as chips, popcorn and garlic are sorely missing from the emoji world.

'I have a moment of dismay when I realize there is no cheese emoji, and I must pass up the aged Gruyere I had bought a few days earlier,' she says during a dinner of spaghetti.

Currently, a Change.org petition for a hot dog emoji has more than 407 supporters.

Ultimately, Ms Rexroat writes: 'The emoji diet hasn’t left me hungry or dissatisfied - if anything, my dessert binge has added some pounds - but it has slimmed down my wallet, since I’ve been making more food purchases as I avoid the majority of my pantry.'

In another recent experiment, a New York couple used nothing but emojis in texts to each other for a month and found that it actually improved their relationship.

Alex Goldmark and Liza Stark sent each other only symbols and pictures to see if it 'altered their emotional vocabulary' in an experiment for New Tech City.

They discovered that emojis are better for conveying affection and positive feelings, but are (unsurprisingly) lacking when it comes to making plans and discussing logistics.
