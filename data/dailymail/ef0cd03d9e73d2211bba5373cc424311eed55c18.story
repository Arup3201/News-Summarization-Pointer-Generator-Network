The body of missing oil executive Carole Waugh was so badly decomposed she could only be identified by her dental records, an inquest heard today.

Relatives of the 50-year-old missing millionairess face a long wait until they can hold a funeral for her as pathologists carry out more tests to ascertain exactly how she died.

Police found her body hidden in a car after in a lock up in New Malden, south west London last Thursday night.

A man arrested in connection with her murder and kidnap has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, Scotland Yard said last week.

Found: Police have discovered the body of missing millionairess Carole Waugh, 50, in London

Police erected a tent outside a garage lock-up in the neighbourhood homeowners have described as 'peaceful and quiet'

The body was believed to have been found in this blue VW Golf which was inside the lock-up garage, after police received new information

Nicholas David Kutner, 47, of no fixed abode, is accused of pretending to be Chris Waugh, Ms Waugh's brother, in a bid to sell her London home.

She is thought to have died from a single stab wound but no further information has yet been revealed.

As an inquest into her death was opened at West London Coroners Court today Detective Inspector Andrew Rees said police were unsure how long Ms Waugh’s body had lain there.

Family members reported her missing on May 7 but she is not thought to have been seen alive since April 16.

DI Rees, of the Met’s Homicide Command, said officers initially thought she was alive and well and not in contact with her family, who she last saw in Easter, of her own volition.

Police are patrolling the area as they await the outcome of the postmortem which confirmed the identity of the body to be Carole Waugh

The quiet road has become the scene of a major crime investigation, as police now pursue the possibility that Ms Waugh may have been murdered

Those who worked with Miss Waugh during the eight years she spent in the Libya speak of 'a complex character' who told extraordinary stories about her life in England

But they became suspicious when hundreds of thousands of pounds were plundered from her bank account and items including Cartier jewellery went missing from her £650,000 Marylebone flat.

He said: 'Carole Waugh was reported missing to police on the 7th of May by some relatives who had not heard from her for some time.

'Initial enquiries made by police led them to believe she was alive and well and not in contact with her family by her own volition.

'However, subsequent activities in relation to her bank accounts gave rise for concern and the week following the 13th of July my unit undertook investigations into the circumstances.

'As a result of the investigation, numerous people were arrested in connection with fraud related offences in connection with Carole Waugh’s bank accounts and her property.

Mystery: Since disappearing, thousands of pounds worth of illegal transactions have been made in her name 

Despite never being married, she wore a huge diamond solitaire engagement ring and gold wedding band

Police have arrested ten people during the investigation, including arresting one man on suspicion of murder

'We were obviously very concerned for her safety. As a result of investigations undertaken on August 2nd we went to some garages in New Malden situated in Lime Grove.

'Having forced opened the garage door we discovered a Volkswagen Golf motor vehicle, and sadly Carole Waugh was discovered within the vehicle deceased.'

A post-mortem was undertaken the next day on August 3 but an exact cause of death is yet to be established.

The detective said: 'I can tell you that a post mortem was undertaken but Carole was badly decomposed so the investigation into her death is still ongoing. The pathologist has identified a single stab wound but cannot give an exact cause of death at this stage.

'Carole came to be identified by her dental records. There is no doubt about that.'
