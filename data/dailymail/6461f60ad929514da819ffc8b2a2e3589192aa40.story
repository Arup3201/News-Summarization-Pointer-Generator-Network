David Ginola's farcical attempt to depose FIFA president Sepp Blatter has hit a new low with the revelation he faces charges for breaching the governing body’s ethics codes for his links to gambling.

That would happen if he becomes an official candidate as of Thursday’s deadline. He would also be left without funding at that stage because his publicity-hungry bookmaker backers Paddy Power, who announced when they ‘launched’ Ginola that he needed £2.3m to run, now say they ‘will not be contributing financially beyond January 27’.

Any potential challenger to Blatter to become the most powerful person in the global game after May’s election has until Thursday officially to declare their candidacy, backed by support from five national associations.

David Ginola's links to gambling could derail his bid to depose FIFA president Sepp Blatter

FIFA's rules state that all presidential candidates are forbidden from being associated with gambling

But FIFA’s rules governing the presidential race explicitly state that all candidates are bound by the organisation’s code of ethics, which forbids ‘being associated with betting, gambling, lotteries and similar events’.

Given that Ginola’s campaign is being run by Paddy Power, who are paying him £250,000 over five months to run, he would be in clear breach of Article 25 of FIFA’s ethics code as a candidate.

To make matters worse, the Irish firm are collecting donations from football fans that the campaign website says are non-refundable, for a campaign built around Ginola and run via a new company called Rebooting Football Limited, a subsidiary vehicle of PP set up for the purpose.

FIFA’s ethics code also forbids active or passive stakes ‘in companies, concerns, organisations ... that promote [betting]’.

It remains unlikely Ginola will get the backing of five FAs and even be able to continue his stunt beyond Thursday. He also faces problems in showing he has held an ‘active’ role in football for two years in the past five years as laid out in condition 13A of the presidential race rules.

This specifies candidates should have worked as ‘a board member, committee member, referee, assistant referee, coach, trainer [or] any other person responsible for technical, medical or administrative matters in FIFA, a Confederation, Association, League or Club’.

Ginola has claimed that work for England’s ill-fated 2018 World Cup bid and consultancy work for obscure third-tier French club Etoile Frejus Saint-Raphael help him meet the criteria.

But his ‘active’ work for the FA covered a few weeks of trips and PR days. And the president of the French club, Alexandre Barbero, has admitted Ginola has held no formal role, has not been paid for work there and has acted as an advisor ‘mainly over the phone’.

Ginola has launched a campaign to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president 

Ginola's campaign was announced at a press conference in London on January 16th

Barbero told the Associated Press that Ginola never goes to the club as he does not want to interfere with the coaches’ work there.

A spokesman for Paddy Power said: ‘We are happy to engage with FIFA as part of the electoral process and furnish them with any documentation they request in this regard.’

If Ginola did somehow garner the support of five FAs by Thursday, a FIFA election committee would then scrutinise whether he is even eligible to stand — and whether he should face a FIFA ethics charged for his association to gambling.

Hundreds of members of the public have donated to his campaign, albeit only a few thousand pounds collectively, and in a contradiction to the the policy on the campaign website, Paddy Power now say: ‘In case David doesn’t make it through, we will look to fully reimburse fans who have donated to the campaign.’

Blatter will be heavy odds-on favourite to keep the presidency and may face just one rival candidate, with Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan his likeliest contender. 

Two former long-term FIFA insiders, Jerome Champagne of France and Harold Mayne-Nichols of Chile, will announce in the coming days whether they have the five FAs they need to support their own bids.

Mayne-Nichols was the head of the inspection team that assessed bid nations’ suitability for the past few World Cup hosting races. In an exclusive interview last week in Brussels as he attended a ‘New FIFA Now’ summit to discuss reform, he told The Mail on Sunday that football was betrayed by the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.

His own evaluation report warned of the dangers of the heat in the June-July 2022 period nations were bidding for.

‘The weather in Qatar makes it impossible to play in June-July, as it was in the [bidding] contract. It’s impossible,’ he said, adding Qatar should not even have been on the ballot paper for the 22 executive committee members to chose from.

‘I made it very clear that [there was a potential problem with] the health of the players if we play in Qatar,’ he said. ‘High risk. They [ExCo] either took the decision before they read the inspection report, or they read it but didn’t understand.’

After Mayne-Nichols first floated the idea he might challenge Blatter, he himself was hit with an ethics investigation that most observers believe is a trumped-up way to discredit him.

Asked if he thought it was a conspiracy to derail him standing against Blatter, he said: ‘I don’t have the energy to think about that. Otherwise I will lose control of my mind.’

He added that for the public’s confidence in FIFA to be renewed, it is imperative Blatter must go. 

‘That’s very clear,’ he says. ‘His period is over. I think he must realise you need new people to get back the confidence of the public. You cannot say I’ve been doing things one way for 41 years [inside FIFA] and now for the next four I’m going to do it this way. Nobody will believe you.’
