British banking giant Standard Chartered is accused of exposing the US to terrorists and weapon dealers by hiding $250 billion (£160 billion) worth of transactions with the Iranian government.

Standard Chartered, one of the top five largest banks in the UK by market value, kept around 60,000 transactions secret from US regulators over nearly 10 years, the New York State Department of Financial Services claimed today.

The bank, which employs nearly 90,000 people worldwide, has been called to appear before regulators on August 15 to explain the apparent violations and defend its licence to trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

Its share price fell 18 percent as world markets reacted to the news, wiping £6 billion from the bank's value. Prices had already dropped six per cent after the accusations were made just before the close of the London market yesterday.

The investigation’s findings come after fellow British bank HSBC was accused of allowing drug cartels and rogue states to launder billions of pounds through its US arm.

Accused: Standard Chartered Bank 'operated as a rogue institution' by 'hiding Iranian transactions'

In its findings report, the regulator said: 'For almost 10 years, SCB [Standard Chartered Bank] schemed with the 
government of Iran and hid from regulators roughly 60,000 secret 
transactions, involving at least $250bn, and reaping SCB hundreds of 
millions of dollars in fees.

'SCB's actions left the US financial system 
vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt 
regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial 
information used to track all manner of criminal activity.

'In short, SCB (Standard Chartered Bank) operated as a rogue institution.'

The 27-page report claims the bank was 'apparently aided' by its consultant Deloitte & Touche in concealing the information from regulators, the Guardian reported.

The findings include a memo sent in October 2006 from the bank’s US chief executive to the group executive director in London raising concerns about the activities with Iran.

He said: 'Firstly, we believe (the Iranian business) needs urgent reviewing at the group level to evaluate if its returns and strategic benefits are... still commensurate with the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group.'

He added: 'Secondly, there is equally importantly potential of risk of subjecting management in US and London (for example you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.'

SCB will have to defend its license so it can continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, pictured.

To which the group executive director 
allegedly replied: 'You f****** Americans. Who are you to tell us, the 
rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal with Iranians.'

In another example the report shows one how in 
2001 the bank was approached by Iran's central bank  CBI/Markazi to
act as recipient for daily oil sales from the National Iranian Oil 
Company.

Iranians warn the bank that revealing 
their identities to US banks would prompt 'unacceptable delays in 
clearing funds,' according to the report, the Guardian said.

Seeking legal advice, SCB was told it 'should ascertain that the payments are authorized'.

But it ignored the warning, instead 
'conspired with Iranian clients to transmit misinformation to the New 
York branch by removing and otherwise misrepresenting wire transfer data
that could identify Iranian parties,' the report claims.

The
regulator claims that between January 2001 through to 2010, Standard 
Chartered conspired with Iranian clients to route payments through New 
York after first stripping information from wire transfer messages used 
to identify sanctioned countries.

The bank moved the transactions through its New York branch on behalf of Iranian financial institutions that were subject to US economic sanctions, and then covered up the dealings, the banking regulator claimed.

The institutions included the Central Bank of Iran, as well as Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, both of which are also Iranian state-owned institutions.

Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York State Department for Financial Services, claimed a Standard Chartered subsidiary in New York had also tried to do business with Libya, Burma and Sudan, the Guardian reported.

Another dirty revelation: HSBC's David Bagley, left, and 
Paul Thurston, also of HSBC, faced a US Senate hearing, which ended in Mr Bagley quitting. Now SBC face a hearing to explain their actions

Financial transactions with Iran have been carefully subjected to strict terms since the 1970s.

Restricted, highly scrutinised transactions known as 'U-turns' were allowed as long as the money ended up in non-Iranian banks.

But the US treasury revoked U-Turn transactions in 2008 because it suspected Iran was using its banks to fund its highly controversial nuclear weapons and missile programmes and to channel money to terrorist groups.

According to Lawsky, Standard Chartered set up an operation known as 'Project Gazelle' aimed at helping Iranian banks put money through the US financial system.

Shares in the London-listed bank immediately plummeted in the last few seconds of trading when the damning report was 
published just as London's stock market was closing for the day.

The attack on Standard Chartered is a heavy blow 
to its reputation, which until last night had been regarded 
as the most solid of any of the London-listed banks after the 2008 
taxpayer bailouts, the more recent Libor rigging scandal at Barclays, 
and the money laundering offences at HSBC.

The shocking report follows the scandal of HSBC, which was discovered through a Senate investigation to have allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its US arm.

The findings, which accused HSBC of ignoring warnings and breaching safeguards that should have stopped the laundering of money from Mexico, Iran and Syria, led to the resignation of head of compliance David Bagley.

Britain's biggest bank allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its branches.

HSBC stands accused of fostering such a ‘polluted’ culture it became a conduit for criminal enterprises.

Top executive David Bagley, head of HSBC’s compliance division, sensationally quit in front of a US Senate hearing that exposed the scale of the scandal.

He had worked for HSBC for 20 years.

HSBC was warned that the total amount of fines and penalties levelled against it could be 'significantly higher' than the £445million set aside so far.
