A man in Canada rescued a newborn moose and brought the calf to a Tim Hortons doughnut shop.

Stephan Michel Desgroseillers found the newborn while out quad-biking in Dowling, Ontario Sunday afternoon.

'He was still wet from being born and still had his umbilical cord,' Mr Desgroseillers told the Toronto Sun.

Doughnut stop: Stephan Michel Desgroseillers found this newborn moose in Canada on Sunday and brought it to a Tim Hortons coffee shop before taking it a shelter on Monday

Mr Desgroseillers came across the moose out quad-biking Sunday afternoon, and had the moose stay at his house before taking it to a shelter the next day. Above, a grab from a video a Tim Hortons customer took of the calf

He says he and his friends attempted to release the baby moose back into the wild several times, but the newborn just kept reappearing and getting dangerously close to the road.

Mr Desgroseillers then tried to contact an animal shelter, but it seemed the place was closed. He later learned that he accidentally called the animal hospital next door instead.

Not knowing what to do, Mr Desgroseillers decided to take home the moose until the shelter opened the next day.

That night the moose slept in Mr Desgroseillers bed and would get up often to cry.

'She slept about half an hour at a time and then she was up for two hours whining so I had a really rough, rough night,' Mr Desgroseillers told CTV News.

The next morning, Mr Desgroseillers loaded the little moose into his truck and headed for the shelter - but decided to stop at a Tim Hortons doughnut shop first for some breakfast.

The moose caused quite a stir with the early-morning coffee crowd, who came out to gawk and pet the little calf.

One woman, Shirley Erkila, took video of her petting the moose outside the coffee shop and called it a once-in-a- lifetime experience.

'I basically felt blessed to be in a position to have crossed a path with that little animal. I felt I need to share that with other people,' Mr Desgroseillers said.

The calf is now in the care of the Wild at Heart Animal Refuge Center.

Dr Rod Jouppi, who founded the center, strongly advises anyone in the same position to leave the newborn in the wild - its mother is most likely nearby.

'People sometimes out of the goodness of their hears think they're healing - they're not,' he said.

The calf as determined to be a male, and is just five days old today. He weighs 25 pounds and is being cared for round-the-clock by a team of three nurses. They have named him Oliver.

'Only three people can be with him right now because he needs to bond,' said Adeline Charpin, an intern at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Lively. 'We're doing all we can.'

'We need to stay with him and feed him every two hours. If nobody's with him, he just cries.'
