Mike Ashley does not want to sack Alan Pardew.

He does not want to suffer the financial trauma of changing managers.

Mike Ashley, however, does not want to be relegated.

Likewise, he does not want to suffer the financial trauma of that sorry scenario (again). 

Alan Pardew has come under fan pressure following a poor start to the season but has the players' support

Mike Ashley does not want to sack Pardew and would be content to finish fourth from bottom in the league

To that end, if a mystic Magpie were to fly by the owner’s helicopter and reveal that, under Pardew, Newcastle would finish fourth from bottom, he would remain in charge.

It’s a numbers game with Ashley - check his bank balance and you’ll see why. He is divorced from sentiment, stung - emotionally and financially -  by agreeing to the return of Geordie Messiah Kevin Keegan in 2009.

So if Pardew, then, can guarantee Newcastle’s Premier League status and the cash bonanza to which survival equates, he will be OK by his paymaster.

But would Pardew be happy with such an eventuality? A fortnight ago, on the eve of the home game with Hull, he held court with journalists at the club’s training ground, convincing us – and perhaps himself – that his was a cause worth fighting for. 

There was off the record, on the record, gusto and guts.

In the subsequent match, his team were equally spirited, rallying to recover a two-goal deficit and claim a point. Four days later there was the League Cup win at Crystal Palace.

Relief? Or merely a temporary reprieve? His demeanour in the wake of Monday’s 1-0 defeat at Stoke suggests the latter.

For the first time, he looked like a man in need of a break.

He has not lost the dressing room. On the contrary, senior players remain in support of their boss, both privately and publicly.

Pardew still has the support of his players and the owner, but the fans are clear that they want him to go

If anything, though, that is something of a concern. For had there been discord behind the scenes, a change of coach could well trigger an improvement.

But this lot – and you suspect Pardew knows this – simply aren’t good enough. This is a team without invention, identity, energy or endeavour, and for that he is in part culpable. 

But the manager does not have autonomy on transfers – far from it – and has been denied a goalscorer, the one commodity which masks the failings of others.

He cannot speak out against the club’s transfer policy and the modus operandi of their soccermarket sweep of the continental aisle. Now that WOULD be a sackable offence.

Peter Crouch's headed goal, which earned Stoke a 1-0 win on Monday, put yet more pressure on Newcastle

Instead, he has offered a whole host of reasons as to the team’s shortcomings in recent seasons – hence the now familiar chant, ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’.

But perhaps now he’s had enough of it all – hands tied in transfer dealings, supporter unrest and venom hissed in his direction, no ambition from above and a squad which, no matter the man in charge, will lurk in dangerous waters until January at least.

Does he attempt to paddle through until then? Or is he resigned to being taken by the current which runs against him?

Either way, he will not abandon the liferaft to which he currently clings. But were Ashley to blow him out of the water, you get the impression it would save the manager from drowning. Perhaps now it is for the best.
