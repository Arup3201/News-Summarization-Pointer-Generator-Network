Abandoned and overweight cat King Leo must have thought his days were numbered when he was cruelly dumped by a Nashville road last month.

The 30lb cat, whose once long silky fur had become matted and filthy, had a change of fortune after a passing motorist heard his meows for help.

Now Leo is slimming down and has a new home to rule over after one of the rescue workers caring for him fell in love with the cute cat and decided to adopt him.

Leo's rescue and transformation was all thanks to Animalia animal hospital and treatment center, in Franklin, and Nashville rescue center, Cat Shoppe and Dog Store.

The 10-year-old cat was found by a driver who had pulled over with a flat tire. He heard Leo crying and discovered him locked inside an animal carrier by the roadside last month.

A note inside the carrier revealed that Leo had been abandoned at least once before, when his first owners handed him over to a new family.

Despite all the changes in his life, and the scary experience of being dumped by a road, Leo was soon making new friends.

The portly pet has been put on a diet and gentle exercise regime and, because his fur was so matted, he was given a fancy new trim.

His thick and tangled fur was severely restricting the cat's ability to move, with mats on the belly preventing Leo from being able to extend his back legs.

Not only did shedding his matted locks help Leo lose an extra 10.5oz, it has also made it easier for staff to keep an eye on his weight loss.

King Leo has been taking the changes in his stride, and has been enjoying trips to the Cat Shoppe, where he holds court with customers.

The store has been raising funds to help pay for his treatment - and that of other rescue cats - and had planned to help find him a new home, but one of the people caring for Leo has already stepped in to adopt him.

One of the vet technicians - Tish - who helped cut away the thick mats in his fur, fell for Leo's charms and has come forward to offer a permanent home.

Updates on the Cat Shoppe Facebook page show the remarkable progression from the disheveled, abandoned Leo, to a slightly slimmer and shaved cat, who loves to roll his back and have his belly rubbed.

In just a few weeks, the results of his diet are already visible, and Leo is said to have lost 5lb already.
