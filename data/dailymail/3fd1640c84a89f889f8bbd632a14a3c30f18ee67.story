These 1930s travel posters are advertisements with a difference - they are designed to encourage tourism to the USSR.

The vintage posters were designed to advertise flights and train routes to the Soviet Union through the travel company Intourist - founded by Joseph Stalin in 1929.

The posters - commissioned in the 1930s - were designed to encourage visitors to the Communist country, before the Second World War and ensuing Cold War closed off the Soviet Union to westerners. 

Soviet era tourism posters from Stalin's Intourist agency are up for auction at Christie's South Kensington location. Pictured: Odessa lithograph, expected to get between £800 and £1,200

Designed by Maria Nesterova-Berzina, Summersport In Der Udssr is estimated to raise between £2,500 and £3,500

Now the historic posters are up for auction with Christie's.

In total 179 original posters will be offered, with estimates ranging from £800 to £50,000.

The Russian posters are expected to fetch anything up to £5,000 each, with the TranSiberian Express advert expected to be a favourite with bidders. 

It promotes the route as 'the shortest way between Europe and the Far East' and the journey itself took 12 days in total.

This lithograph encourages visitors to book a trip to the Russian capital - and could sell for up to £8,000

The New Travel Land poster, which advertises the London bureau of Intourist, was created by Max Litvak and Robert Fedor

The Intourist agency - the official travel agency of the Soviet Union - targeted only an external audience, mainly in Britain and Germany, meaning the posters were intended to encourage inbound tourism from Europe.

As such, there is a distinctly capitalist look to each image - the type of message that was generally deemed to be appropriate among those within the USSR's secretive internal workings.

The examples in the sale were produced specifically for the English and German tourist markets and promote the USSR as 'The New Travel Land.' 

Designed by various artists working for the agency in the first half of the 20th Century, these tourism posters demonstrate the scope and breadth of the advertising campaign, as well as the emphasis on art deco colours and design in hopes of attracting the Western European traveller.  

This Transsiberian Express poster is of particular interest for collectors and could fetch up to £3,000

Konstantin Bor Ramensky's By Air to USSR from 1934 could go for as high as £5,000

Soviet Armenia, by Sergey Igumnov, is believed to have been commissioned in 1936

European collectors will also be able to bid for vintage posters that cover London Transport, American Modernist design, and the Russian Avant-Garde.

There will be 179 original posters up for auction, with some expected to draw up to £50,000. 

These lithographs, however, do not date quite as far back as the Intourist fare, with most estimated to be commissioned circa 1950s. 

Relax... by René Gruau dates back to the early 1950s and even has a linen backing
