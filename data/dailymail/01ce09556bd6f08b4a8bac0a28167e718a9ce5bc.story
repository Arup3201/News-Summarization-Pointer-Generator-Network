A self-confessed takeaway queen has managed to shed 8st in 18 months.

Lindsey Collier used to eat takeaways almost every night of the week and ballooned to a huge 21st 8lb, and had a morbidly obese BMI of 50.

But the 30-year-old was shocked into action after a visit to the doctors, and joined her local Slimming World group.

Lindsay, pictured before losing weight, had a BMI of 50 and was also told she had high cholesterol and was at risk of diabetes

In just 18 months Lindsey dropped from 21st 8lb (left) to 13st 6lbs (right) 

Now at 13st 6lb, Lindsey has dropped 
six dress sizes - from a size 28 to a size 16 - has turned her life 
around. She is even started her own Slimming World Group.

'I
 have six or seven takeaways at the end of my road, and I would be there
 pretty much every night' admits Lindsey from Stechford, Birmingham.

'I would have an extra-large pizza to myself and drink a lot of energy drinks.

'I couldn’t even walk to the bus stop without losing my breath. I had severe back pain and was on loads of medication.'

But when Lindsey went to the doctors in November 2012, she got the wake-up call she needed.

'The doctor told me I had high cholestorol. I didn’t want to be in my 30s with diabetes,' said Lindsey.

'I was upset, but it was the first time that I had taken a really good look at myself.

'I was literally killing myself with food.'

Lindsey
 was referred to her local Slimming World group in Lea Hall, which saw 
her ditch the pizza and chips, and finally cook her own healthy meals.

Lindsey used to eat from her local takeaway restaurants most days, washing down her unhealthy meals with high-sugar energy drinks

'Walking into that group was the most nerve-racking thing I’ve ever done. I was scared of being the biggest, of failing, and people taking the mick.

'But everyone was so friendly, and they made me a tailor-made plan to help fit around my vegetarian diet.'

Now Lindsey hopes to lose even more weight in preparation for her wedding to fiancé Jason.

'I’m looking forward to getting a size 12 wedding dress' said Lindsey.

'I’ve still got a way to go, but I fell like a completely different person.

'I love going on 10-mile walks now with my partner, and home cooking. If you had told me a year ago that I would be running my own group I would never have believed you.'
