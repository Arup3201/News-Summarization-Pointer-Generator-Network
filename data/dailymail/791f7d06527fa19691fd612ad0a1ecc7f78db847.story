Passengers aboard Aeromexico jetliner came in for a fright Saturday morning after two tires on the Boeing 737 blew out as it was prepared for takeoff from Los Angeles International Airport. 

The plane was taxiing with 129 passengers aboard about 6.30am when tire under the left wing blew out, stranding the plane on the runway. 

No one was injured and all were safely taken off Aeromexico Flight 18 and boarded onto buses to the terminal, where they took other flights bound for Mexico City.

A pair of blown tires on the left side of the Boeing 737 caused the breakdown, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

NTSB officials do not plan any further investigation, spokesman Peter Knudson said.

Aeromexico officials did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.

A preliminary report from the Federal Aviation Administration said the left landing gear had collapsed. 

The NTSB's Knudson said the blown tires were discovered later.

The incident happened at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday and the runway was briefly shutdown until the aircraft was removed.

According to The Los Angeles Times, the aircraft remained on the runway until 10.30am.

No other flights were affected. 

Airport officials initially reported mechanical failures at about 6:30 a.m. for the Boeing 737 plane bound for Mexico. All 129 passengers and six crew members were safely evacuated

Evacuated: Passengers were expected to be booked on the airline's four flights later in the day, LAX officials said
