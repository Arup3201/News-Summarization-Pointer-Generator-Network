Kell Brook insists he will win his first world title on Saturday night but is unsure whether he will KO American tough guy Shawn Porter ‘in the first round’ or battle his way to a decision ‘at the end of a dog-fight.’

The moment of truth is likely to arrive somewhere between those two extremes and the manner of it will probably depend upon how long Brook’s self-confidence holds up under the pressure of what he must expect to be the most exacting fight of his career.

The incentive for both these young men ‘to go through hell’ is most eloquently expressed by Brook: ‘The winner will hold the keys to Fort Knox.’

Focused: Kell Brook is finally ready to challenge for a world title after 32 fights as a professional

All smiles: Brook travelled to America early to ensure he is fully prepared for Shawn Porter

Eyes on the prize: Brook is the underdog against Porter but fancies his chances of causing an upset

In the case of Sheffield’s successor to Prince Naseem Hamed, the biggest treasure chest awaits if he can lure Amir Khan into a battle of Britain by dangling a world championship belt in front of him.

For Porter the mother-lode would be a mega-bucks fight with Mr Money himself, Floyd Mayweather Jnr, to which he would edge closer with an impressive victory over Brook.

An alternative bonanza for either could come in Mexico, with Juan Manuel Marquez ready to keep a watching brief at ringside this weekend while saying: ‘If I do decide to box again I want it to be against the winner of this fight.’

All very tempting but neither Brook nor Porter would be wise to get ahead of themselves.

Their duel for Porter’s IBF welterweight title comes at a watershed moment in their careers.

Both are coming into their prime, Brook at 28 and Porter at 26.

For the victor the only way is up. For the vanquished it will be back to the small halls.

The jury is out on each of them. So much so as far as the public are concerned that in order to come to close to filling the StubHub Centre in California promoters Golden Boy are having to stack the under-card with the high-profile likes of heavyweight knock-out sensation Deontay Wilder.

The balance of risk is more or less even.

Champion: Porter will need to be at his best against Brook to retain his title in California 

Confident: Porter knows he must see off Brook if he is to earn the right to face Floyd Mayweather 

Home comforts: Porter will defend his title on American soil on Saturday night

Porter has nothing to gain from putting his growing reputation on the line against a Brit who offers a genuine threat but is barely known in the in US. He says: ‘I have always been the one under pressure on my way to the top and I know I’m again the one with most to lose.’

Brook has to surrender home advantage to get the world title shot he regards as long overdue and America is never an easy place to secure an away win. He says: ‘I have to raise my game the way Lloyd Honeyghan did to win his world title over here when everyone expected him to lose to Donald Curry,.’

And raise his game he must if he is to emulate the Ragamuffin Man’s feat of 28 years ago.

Many saw it as a sign of weakness when Brook was reported to have asked his handlers if he was ready to challenge Porter, even though title bids scheduled previously had been scuppered by injuries to himself and Devon Alexander.

But if he did put that question, it was valid. Brook has been fed a diet of mostly moderate opponents so while he is talented and does pack a meaty uppercut he remains untested at the highest level in his 32 wins to date.

Porter, by contrast, warmed up against increasingly hotter rivals. Now his 25-fight unbeaten career has been brought nicely to the boil by a final eliminator against Julio Diaz, his successful world title challenge to Alexander and a first defence against Paulie Malignaggi – all three of whom are former two-time champions.

It is that elite experience which is missing from Brook’s resume and it is less than encouraging to recall that he only just held on for a squeaky victory over American journeyman Carson Jones as he faded towards the end of their first fight. 

Untested? Brook's biggest win came against former world champion Viacheslav Senchenko

Down and out: Porter was in a destructive mood when he stopped Paulie Malignaggi

Brook is a couple of inches the taller but Porter, a trimmed down light-middleweight, is a compact, powerful, heavy-punching athlete with, curiously, an equally long reach.

The Ohioan is also as effective at close quarters as they both can be at long range.

Brook says: ‘Porter is good but was not keen to take me on and has had to do it or be stripped of the title.’

Porter says: ‘I’ve wanted this particular fight for a long time. It is the ideal fight for me to prove myself as a top boxer and fighter.’

So who wins?

I would be more of a British optimist if Brook had been tempered against better opponents.

He has a chance but if he is going to pull this off away from home and with nagging doubts about his stamina then perhaps he had better do so sooner, like the first round, than later, via the scorecards.

Once again, good luck to Frank Maloney in a new life as Ms Kellie Maloney and freely admitting: ‘There is still a lot to overcome.’

And well done to Lennox Lewis for sending his best wishes to the manager who guided him to the world heavyweight title.
