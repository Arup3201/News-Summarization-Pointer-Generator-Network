Manchester United will be forced to step up their pursuit of Angel Di Maria after Carlo Ancelotti revealed the Argentina international was free to leave the Bernabeu.

United are under pressure from Paris Saint-Germain, who have moved into pole position to land the Argentine with a loan deal this season before a permanent £52million move next year, according to L'Equipe.

The European champions splashed out £60m on Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez and Ancelotti has now confirmed Di Maria is free to leave the Bernabeu.

The Italian said: 'I don’t know what Di Maria has decided. Until August 31 he will be here in principle. If from there he stays, or is no longer with us, we will think about it later.'

Speaking at a press conference unveiling the £50m signing of David Luiz on August 7, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: 'We spoke with Real Madrid about the possibility of signing Angel Di Maria, but it was too expensive.'

But the French side, who had their summer spending curtailed after breaching UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, are now looking at a loan deal for Di Maria with a permanent transfer next summer.

Van Gaal is keen to add more new faces to his United squad, who were beaten 2-1 by Swansea at Old Trafford in their opening Barclays Premier League game on Saturday.

Apart from 17-year-old Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic, United's only summer signings so far have been Luke Shaw from Southampton and Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao.

Manchester United are also closing in on Sporting Lisbon defender Marcus Rojo in a £16m deal.
