Roy Hodgson has poured scorn on the notion that swearing during a Press briefing after the 1-0 friendly win against Norway last week was a sign of the pressure getting to him.

The England manager has been in the spotlight ever since England’s awful World Cup display, in which they picked up just one point and scored twice, their worst performance at a World Cup finals since 1950.

It led him to use the words ‘f****** b*******’ after the Norway game when he was asked if he was worried that statistics from the game showed England had two shots on target. Hodgson regularly berates the use of stats, considering them an unsophisticated reading of the subtleties of the game. And he laughed off the fact that he had sworn, admitting that he even does so in front of his wife.

Furious: Roy Hodgson swore during a press conference after England's win over Norway

‘That’s ridiculous,’ he said, when asked about his language. ‘Goodness me. What sort of world are we living in? You are scraping the bottom of a barrel to say something negative there.

‘Listen, I’m a football coach. I worked most of my life, up to the age of 25, in England. I played in non-League with dockers whose every other word was a swear word. They didn’t even know they were swearing because they didn’t know any other words.

‘If you say: “We are very, very annoyed and morally offended by Hodgson, the England manager, using a swear word. And we insist that in the future he never swears,” then, OK, I will never swear in your company again.

‘I just thought I was with people mature enough to understand that a swear word, which I thought was probably used at the right time, should not provoke a fit of moral indignation... I wasn’t arguing with anybody, I was making my points.

‘It was the same discussion about England’s future, it was put in the same [calm] tone of voice. It was put strongly — yes, I’ll accept that. I will put the message forward quite strongly, even a little bit aggressively, sometimes.

‘But there was no need for me to be upset by anybody and there was no ill feeling. I swear all the time. I swear in front of my wife. I never used to when I was a kid but I do now, so there you go.’

Hodgson says that his broader point in the exchange was that the young players he has at his disposal can cope with the pressure being placed on them to lift the gloom that has enveloped the national team ever since the World Cup failure.

‘I do believe they can, without a shadow of a doubt,’ said Hodgson. ‘They’re getting a baptism of fire, many of them are coming in very young and into an air of negativity. It’s a bit of a baptism of fire.’

He added: ‘It would be nice if the Switzerland game wasn’t being built up into a World Cup final. Once they’ve played with each other for a couple of years, had European experience with their clubs and played another 10 to 15 international matches, they will go into the Euros and that’s when we’d be hoping they could lift our heads a little bit out of this gloom.’

This way! England must improve if they are to come away from Switzerland with three points on Monday
