For millions of online shoppers, customer product reviews have become one of the most popular and useful aspects of buying from online retail giant Amazon.

But as well as finding helpful advice on pretty much every conceivable object which could be sold online, shoppers can also often stumble across creative appraisals of some of the more bizarre or obscure products.

To celebrate its 15th anniversary in the UK, Amazon has rounded-up what it believes to be some of the funniest product reviews in its relatively short history.

Some of the products, and their reviews, have already become the stuff of legend, inspiring their own internet memes, such as the three wolf moon T-shirt, which sparked hilarious comments on the site.

One such comment, as picked out by Amazon, was: 'Don't get me wrong, this T-shirt is ace. I just can't help thinking an additional Wolf wouldn't go a miss.

'(P.S I've rated this 4 stars. 1 for each Wolf and 1 for the moon. If the seller wants another star, then I want another Wolf....or another moon)'

Other well-known reviews include this effort for a box canvas print of Paul Ross: 'If you only buy one 20 inch canvas print of Paul Ross this year, this is the one to get.'

A canvas clock of Eastenders actress Pam St Clement also received some memorable reviews, including: 'After purchasing this, time has taken on a whole new meaning in our house. As I type this, it is currently 5 past Pat's chin. Lovely.'

The Kitchen Craft Banana Slicer is another product which has gained notoriety through its advert on Amazon.

This t-shirt of three wolves howling at the moon has become so famous it has sparked its own internet meme

It's design and function inspired one customer to write this glowing review: 'Thanks to this revolutionary idea I can now purchase bananas free of fear.

'I used to stare longingly at bananas in my local supermarket, but I was afraid to add them to my shopping basket knowing I wouldn't know what to do with them when I got them home.

'Clearly too big to put into one’s mouth in one go, I couldn't for the life of me work out how to eat it. Now it is as clear as day, and I have joined the happy banana eating ranks. Thank you so much!

'I would have given this great product 5 stars if there had been banana peeling instructions included.'

The children's book Mr Tickle inspired this rather long-winded literary analysis

To many customers, Amazon's product reviews have become one of the site's most useful tools. Pictured is Amazon's one million sq ft fulfilment centre in Fife

Elsewhere, Mr Men book reviews have attracted some of the most in-depth reviews of all the products to be found on the site.

One review for Mr Tickle begins: 'Hargreaves' first work, and regarded by many as his masterpiece, Mr Tickle is something of a rarity amongst the Mr Men books. Elsewhere, we see much exposition on the pitfalls of excess - such as in Mr Greedy and Mr Messy, for instance - but a distinct lack of discourse on personalities that are over- rather than under-regulated...

'So what a glorious anomaly we find in Mr Tickle - a breath of fresh air from the unrestrained id.'

One of the most famous reviews in the history of the site however, has to be incredibly detailed analysis of a Bic Crystal Ballpoint Pen, Medium Point, Black.

The review begins: 'Since taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used. On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen (thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon!) I just couldn't contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on, like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen, the Post-it notes next to the phone, and on my favourite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk.'

This review of the catering aluminium foil is probably not 100 per cent true
