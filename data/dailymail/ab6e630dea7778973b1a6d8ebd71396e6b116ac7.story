The city of New York has been paying $200,000 to store a homeless woman's possessions, even though it would have been cheaper to have rented her an apartment.

Andrea Logan's things have been locked up since she lost her Upper East Side apartment in 2006 after a debilitating stroke.

Ever since, the city has been picked up the tab at the cost of New York taxpayers.

New York state law requires it to cover storage expenses for homeless people.

The city of New York has been paying $200,000 to store Andrea Logan's belongings. The 54-year-old former model has been homeless for eight years and suffered a stroke just before things took a turn for the worse

Logan, 54, had 11 storage units stuffed full of belongings ranging from 'hundreds of cartons of books,' as well as furniture, appliances and women's clothing, in the years after her stroke.

According to the New York Post, officials didn't notice the huge tab until it reached $3,585 a month last year.

For the same kind of money, a one-bedroom duplex in Greenwich Village could easily be rented or a large two-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side.

Cumulatively, Logan's storage units total more than 1,000 sq feet - which is more than a number of Manhattan apartments. 

After the extortionate spending came to light, the city refused to fund the rent any longer, prompting her to sue in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Now Logan has agreed to have a clear-out and cut down belongings so that they fit into just three storage units at a facility in The Bronx for $1,297 a month.

State law mandates that the city pay for storing furniture and personal belongings for homeless people 'so long as eligibility for public assistance continues and so long as the circumstances necessitating the storage continue to exist.' 

Logan ran an antiques business before the stroke left her legally blind, however she does not know the value of all of the items she has stashed away.

'There's so much stuff that I wouldn't even know where to begin,' she told The Post.

'The most critical and valuable things are the irreplaceable items — documents from medical-malpractice and personal-injury cases, personal family documents, photographs and mementos.' 

Whilst the city is continuing to pay her way when it comes to storage, the former model says she hasn't lived in a city shelter for four years and is now staying with friends or even squatting in abandoned buildings.
