Forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi are believed to have more than 200 Scud missiles held in reserve to defend Tripoli as rebel fighters draw closer to the Libyan capital.

With rebels threatening to take control of two strategic towns guarding supply lines to the city, Gaddafi's forces fired the first Scud of the six-month long conflict on Sunday.

It came as there was mounting speculation that Gaddafi would once again being offered a 'way out' to prevent massive bloodshed in any final battle for Tripoli by being guaranteed a safe passage to Venezuela.

Innocent victims: Libyan civilians carry an injured man into the Bir Moamer clinic in Zawiyah. Hospital staff have reported that at least 20 people, including civilians, were killed in fierce fighting to take control of the town

Significantly, UN envoy Abdel-Elah 
al-Khatib, Jordan's former foreign minister, has arrived in the Tunisian
capital Tunis for the meetings with representatives of both Gaddafi and
the rebels.

He said there were no direct 
negotiations as he met the two sides separately in the neighbouring 
country but a Tunisian security official said Mr al-Khatib might also 
meet with a representative of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

But Libya's rebel National 
Transitional Council (NTC) last night denied it was involved in any 
negotiations with Gaddafi's government or with the UN special envoy for 
Libya.         

'The NTC would like to assure that 
there are no negotiations either direct or indirect with the Gaddafi 
regime or with the special envoy of the United Nations,' NTC leader 
Mustafa Abdel Jalil said at a briefing.

Any talks could signal the endgame of a
civil war that has drawn in Britain and the Nato alliance, emerging as 
one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the 
Arab world.

Heavily armed and motivated: Rebels made significant advances over the weekend and are attempting to encircle Tripoli, which they hope will lead to a political collapse or civilian uprising

A Russian official yesterday said it 
was 'deeply disturbed' about Nato's aerial campaign because it has 
overstepped the intent of the UN resolution that authorized the strikes.

Attacks on non-military targets such 
as the main TV station and Tripoli airport call into question Nato's 
ability to implement the resolution that authorised the use of force to 
protect civilians, the diplomat said on a condition of anonymity.

The Scud missile, which is notoriously
inaccurate, was fired from a location 50 miles east of Sirte, Gaddafi's
home town, and landed in the desert east of the coastal oil town of 
Brega where rebels are fighting for control.

Intelligence officials said the fact 
that Gaddafi's forces had begun using the Scuds – fired from the back of
flatbed trucks or fixed positions – was a sign of the mounting pressure
on the beleaguered Libyan leader.

Their assessment was echoed by 
Shashank Joshi, Associate Fellow at Britain's Royal United Services 
Institute, who said : 'It's an obvious sign that the regime's back is to
the wall.'

In the protracted months of fighting 
up to now, Gaddafi's forces have been using short-range Grad rockets but
have not before deployed Scud missiles, which have an estimated range 
of about 185 miles.

Notoriously unreliable: A Soviet-made Scud missile, similar to the one fired at Brega. It is said the Gaddafi regime has about 200 of the missiles, but their inaccuracy means they pose little military threat

In the rebel headquarters in the 
eastern city of Benghazi, officials said the Scud firing was a sign 
Gaddafi would do anything to protect his power.  

British and French planes have 
continued their 'walls of Jericho' strategy to destroy Gaddafi's homes 
and compounds – sending a clear message that there is 'no hiding place.'

Rebels may still lack the manpower for
an all-out assault on Tripoli, but are hoping their encirclement of the
capital will bring down Gaddafi's government or inspire an uprising.

In the past, however, they have frequently failed to hold gains, and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back.

Referring to the sudden use of Scuds, 
Mohammad Zawawi, media director for rebel forces, said : 'Gaddafi troops
are using his last gun. He's crazy … we're scared he'll use chemicals. 
That's why we're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the 
least number of casualties.'

'We can't prevent the Scuds but we hope Nato can. Nato has the technology to detect them.'

Analysts say the rebels' strategy now 
is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse, but 
they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last-ditch 
fight for the capital. 

In a barely audible telephone call to 
state television in the early hours of Monday morning, Gaddafi called on
his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their Nato supporters.

'Get ready for the fight ... The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield,' he said.

He was speaking as rebels made their 
most dramatic advances in months of fighting, shifting the momentum in a
conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of 
Nato powers anxious for a swift outcome.

Rebel forces in the Western Mountains 
south of Tripoli surged forward at the weekend to enter Zawiyah. The 
town is about 30 miles west of Tripoli and, crucially, straddles the 
main highway linking the capital to Tunisia.

A day later, rebels said they had 
captured the town of Garyan, which controls the highway leading south 
from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha, a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the 
desert.

'Gaddafi has been isolated. He has 
been cut off from the outside world,' reported a rebel spokesman from 
the Western Mountains, called Abdulrahman.

Last night rebels on the outskirts of 
Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of 
the town, from where they have been attacking with mortars, Grad rockets
and sniper fire.

Medical workers at one of the town's 
hospitals said 20 people, a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians, 
were killed on Monday, and the death toll for Tuesday had reached one.
