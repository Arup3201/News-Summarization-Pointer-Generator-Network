Benefit cheat: Mother of nine Mary Otim claimed £40,000 in benefits to get a second house

A nurse swindled £40,000 from the taxpayer by claiming to be a homeless mother-of-nine to get a second council house.

Mary Otim already had a family sized home in Wolverhampton when she applied for and was given a £300,000 property in Harrow, north London.

She then moved into the home in Harrow and rented her second Wolverhampton address to her adult children for four years before being caught out.

The deception only came to light after 
data from the two councils' was cross referenced by the National Fraud 
Initiative.

Today the 53-year-old was given a
nine month 
suspended sentence for obtaining services by deception after Harrow 
Crown Court heard her youngest daughter was just 16 years old.

Judge Vivian Rose said:
'Although I am sure your offence is 
sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence, I am prepared to 
suspend the sentence in this case because of your personal 
circumstances.

The court heard Otim, who only
has three of her nine children living with her, dodged £40,000 in rent 
when she was handed a £300,000 three-bedroom property in Chandos 
Crescent, Harrow, a year after she secretly signed the lease on a 
family-sized home in Wolverhampton.

Otim, who pleaded guilty at an earlier
hearing, gave the Wolverhampton home to her adult children, who were 
all working, at a vastly subsidized rate.

She then continued to visit Wolverhampton to fool housing officers that she was living there.

Judge Rose said: 'I have no doubt that you knew that what you were doing was wrong and dishonest.

Suspended sentence: Nurse Mary Otim escaped jail for falsely claiming £40,000 at Harrow Crown Court

'You allowed Harrow Council to keep treating you as homeless and considering you a priority for a large house in Harrow.

'This carried on for a period of almost four years and there were several occasions when you could have put the matters right but you failed on each occasion to do so.

'Benefit fraud is never a victimless crime and by your actions you have prevented another family who were genuinely entitled to a property from being housed.' 

The court heard Otim was first assessed to be homeless by Harrow Council in 1997 when she was placed on the housing waiting list and housed in temporary accommodation at a cost of £80,000 per year.

She then went behind Harrow Council's back to register as homeless in Wolverhampton in 2005, claiming she was a single mother with nine dependents.

She was offered a property in Guy Avenue, Wolverhampton, in September 2005 - meaning she should have been removed from her temporary accommodation in Harrow and taken off the housing list.

Instead she was offered a three-bedroom property in Chandos Crescent in 2006, where she still lives with three of her children, the youngest of which is 16.

Prosecutor Dickon Edwards said: 'Housing is extremely scarce and is at a premium. Especially scarce are those large houses such as that given to Mrs Otim. They are intended for those at their lowest ebb and particularly vulnerable.

'Added to the cost of the benefit there is also the cost of housing Mrs Otim in temporary accommodation while she had a secure property - estimated at £80,000 a year.'

Defence barrister Claire Robinson said Otim was extremely devastated to have been suspended from her job and risk losing her home.

She added that she had been put under pressure to apply for the second home by her older children, who wanted the benefit of cheaper rent.

Otim, who has been suspended from her job at West London Mental Health hospital in Ealing, where she is being sponsored to study for a degree, is waiting to hear whether she will be allowed to keep her home in Harrow.

Speaking outside court, the 53-year-old said: 'I have to accept what the judge has said. It has been a very stressful time and I have been worried about the outcome.
