Torn: Dean Carter (pictured after his arrest in 1984) raped and almost strangled to death Rose Steward in 1984 before murdering five women, but Steward wants to spare her tormentor the death penalty

J. Rose Steward has spent the last three decades struggling to move past being raped and nearly strangled to death at the hands of a man who will go on to murder five other women.

But when Steward, 50, of Colorado, heads to the polling place next week, she will cast a vote in favor of a law that will spare the life of her tormentor, Dean Carter.

Steward was 22 years old and living in Ventura, California, in 1984 when she woke up on the night of March 29 to discover Dean standing in her room gripping a knife with a red bandana concealing his face.

For the next five hours, then-28-year-old Dean raped and throttled her until she passed out.

Steward was certain of her impending death, but she managed to outwit her assailant by pretending to like him, The Los Angeles Times reported.

When he finally left in the morning, the young woman even kissed him goodbye and made him promise that he will call her. 

After leaving Steward, Carter went on a murderous rampage, raping and strangling five women in a matter of 18 days. Their bodies were later discovered in closets after he was arrested. 

Steward's unflinching testimony helped the prosecution win two death sentences against Carter.

But 28 years later, the 57-year-old convicted killer remains on death row at San Quentin prison where he writes a blog called Deadman Talking about his daily life. 

Families of the five slain women have expressed outrage that Carter continues to live and called on the state to help them get the closure they deserve by watching him die.

Steward, however, has not joined the chorus of angry voices demanding Carter's execution. Although her position has left her feeling like a traitor to the five women who died at Carter's hands  - and whom she refers to as 'sisters'  - the 50-year-old woman has endorsed Proposition 34 to replace death penalty with life sentence without parole in California.Steward said it has been difficult to move past her traumatic experience while she waits for the phone call telling her that Carter's time is up.

Carter's sole survivor has long opposed capital punishment, and  seeing the appeals process drag on for decades with no end in sight has only reinforced her belief that it's hard to live a full life while you await someone else to die.     

Yet, the 50-year-old woman had been unwilling in the past to go public with her opposition to the death penalty out of respect for the families of Carter's victims: Jillette Leonora Mills, 25, Susan Lynn Knoll, 25, Bonnie Ann Guthrie, 34, Janette Anne Cullins, 24, and Tok Chum Kim, 42.

Steward told the LA Times that her reluctance stemmed in part from feelings of guilt that of all the victims, she was the only who survived - a fact that left her wondering if she could have prevented the murders, or worse still, that perhaps she was the one who had somehow triggered Carter’s murderous rampage.  

When Carter was arrested a month after Steward's rape, prosecutors decided to try him first for that crime and then call her to the stand to testify against him in the murder trials.

When the serial killer was convicted and sentenced to death, the murdered women's families rejoiced while Steward stayed silent, feeling that it was not her place to oppose the court's decision.

But when she read over the summer that Proposition 34 was put on the ballot in California, she wrote a note in support of the campaign to abolish the death penalty - a move that has left some of the victims' loved ones feeling betrayed.

In Steward's opinion, however, commuting Carter's sentence to life without parole would take away his celebrity status which he has enjoyed while on death row and help bring closure. 

Those who oppose the death penalty have said that aside for the obvious argument that institutionalized killing is no better than murder, doing away with death row is also a cost-cutting measure.

California has spent about $4billion since capital punishment resumed in 1977, yet just 13 inmates have been put to death.

An independent analysis says the state would save between $100 million and $130 million a year by converting death sentences to life-without-parole, money supporters say could be put toward public schools and local law enforcement investigations. 

Proponents of the death penalty, however, argue that the purported financial benefits of replacing capital punishment with life without parole are nothing more than smoke and mirrors. 

For Steward, it all comes down to one simple fact. 'I don't want blood on my hands like he has,' she said.
