Broken trust: Teresa Lee Cope, 34, former program director at the Birdseye Residential Treatment Center in Utah, was arrested for allegedly abusing a 15-year-old boy suffering from sexual behavior problems and addiction to pornography

A former official at a Utah treatment center for teenagers suffering from sexual behavior problems and pornography addiction is accused of abusing a 15-year-old resident.

Teresa Lee Cope, 34, a married mother of two from Springville, was arrested last week on multiple charges, including sexual activity with a minor, unlawful custodial relations and sex abuse.

The woman was released last Friday after her husband of six years posted $10,000 cash bail.

According to her arrest affidavit cited by Deseret News, Mrs Cope worked as program director at the Birdseye Residential Treatment Center when she started an illicit affair with a 15-year-old boy on April 15, 2013, which lasted for more than month.

The charging documents state that on at least three separate occasions, the couple kissed and touched one another at the boys' ranch.

In one instance, the teenage patient was sexually assaulted by Cope at a car wash in Springville, according to investigators.

The tryst culminated May 15, 2013, when the program director and her young charge had intercourse, police said.

Utah County Sheriff's Sgt Spencer Cannon told the Salt Lake Tribune the married woman required her underage lover to perform sexual acts on her, and vice versa.

According to Cannon, Mrs Cope would 'manipulate' the situation to make her encounters with the 15-year-old possible.

For example, during field trips, Cope and the boy would often drive together or find themselves alone, officials revealed.

Odell Erickson, quality assurance director with Heritage Youth Services, which runs Birdseye Center, said that Cope was hired in June 2012 and quit last December. 

The official said Cope passed two separate background checks, which raised no red flags.

The boy's family, from Cedar City, have known about the allegations for some time, according to Salt Lake attorney Greg Skordas, who was hired to represent them.

But it was not until two weeks ago that the 15-year-old approached his parents and told them about the alleged sexual abuse at the hands of the director. 

Sheriff’s deputies then executed a search warrant at Cope's Springville home, seizing electronic devices and other physical evidence, including clothing, which allegedly helped corroborate the victim’s story.

The 34-year-old woman married Jake Cope in 2008, according to the man’s Facebook account. The couple have two young daughters.
