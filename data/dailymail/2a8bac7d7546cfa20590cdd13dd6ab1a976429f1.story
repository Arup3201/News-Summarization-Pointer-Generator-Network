He also showed his gratitude that Southampton did not stand in the way of his dream move to Liverpool, who he supported and played for as a boy.

Lambert signed off by assuring fans that there was a new plan in place at Southampton and that he wished them 'every success in the word'.

What can I say…?

Southampton has been my life for the past five years, in which we have achieved all of our dreams and more.

First I have to thank Markus Liebherr for saving Southampton then Alan Pardew for bringing me to the club.

Thank
 you to all the staff involved in making me the player I am today. 
Without your knowledge and commitment I would not be here right now at a
 World Cup with England.    

Thank
 you to all the players, past and present, who I have had nothing but 
good times and success with driven by our club captain, Kelvin Davis. I 
love every last one of you.

Thank
 you to the managers I have worked with – Alan, Nigel and Mauricio – and
 their teams for helping me and Southampton step up and adapt to every 
challenge that has come our way the past five years.

When
 I grew up there was only one club I loved. I can honestly say now I 
have two clubs which will always be in my heart and that is thanks to 
the Saints fans.

The people
 who support this club have been nothing short of amazing towards me 
and, when I look back in years to come, it will be the relationship I 
had with the fans here which will stand out the most.

Southampton
 have allowed me to realise a lifelong ambition by joining Liverpool FC 
and taking my family home. The five-year plan when I arrived was to get 
this club from League One to the top half of the Premier League. Against
 all the odds we have achieved that.

Now,
 under Katharina Liebherr’s leadership, the club has the chance for new 
plan, a new chapter, and I wish them all the success in the world.

Rickie Lambert
