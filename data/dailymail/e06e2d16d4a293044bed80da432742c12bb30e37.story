The typical British family spends more than a quarter of its disposable income on childcare - almost three times as much as parents in other European countries.

Childcare costs swallow up 27 per cent of UK parents' net income on average, according to a Tory MP's report which calls for a major overhaul of the system.

In contrast, the average family in the Netherlands pays only 10 per cent of its net income to childminders.

South West Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss says that, despite the high costs, recent studies have shown widespread problems with quality, price and availability in the UK.

In a report for the CentreForum think tank, she claims that while the number of nursery places has increased since 1996, the number of childminder places has dropped drastically in the same period to 245,000 in 2010.

The report argues that this has led to price inflation, while at the same time, becoming a childminder is now fraught with red tape.

It calls for childminders to be allowed to take on more children at one time.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Miss Truss said a rule that British childminders can only look after three children at a time, including their own, was partly responsible for high costs.

The ratio is one to four in France and one to five in Germany and the Netherlands, she added.

Miss Truss said increasing the ratio in Britain would not compromise child safety.

It would attract higher paid staff to the profession, improve the quality and availability of childcare, or make it more affordable, she added.

Miss Truss said: ‘At the moment we have childminders getting an average income of £11,000 a year, so people aren’t going into childminding to a great extent.

‘We have half as many childminders as we had 10 years ago. It takes four to six months to register with (childcare regulator) Ofsted.

‘We need to make it simpler. We need to make it attractive.’

The report also calls for a single funding system and for childminders to be able to register with a local agency, nursery or network which would take responsibility for inspection and training and be regulated by Ofsted.

Miss Truss said costs were high because of ‘duplication’ in the way childminders are regulated, with both Ofsted and local authorities carrying out inspections.

‘I think a lot of money gets leaked away in the system,’ she added.

In the report the MP wrote: 'The coalition Government has a great opportunity to simplify the provision of childcare and get better value for money for parents.

'Reform could lead to an increase in availability of flexible childcare and an end to spiralling costs.'

But Anand Shukla, chief executive of the Daycare Trust, cast doubt over whether Miss Truss's recommendations would make childcare cheaper for parents.

He said: ‘Looking at the question of ratios, I think it will do very little in terms of reducing the cost of childcare.’

Mr Shukla called for more research focused on the ‘trade-off’ between having high quality care and allowing childminders to look after more children.

‘There is definitely a case for simplifying the funding stream,’ he said. ‘It is very complicated for childcare.’

Mr Shukla questioned whether reducing regulation would bring down costs.

He said: ‘In the Netherlands, they went down this route a few years ago and they have had to row back on it because they have been so worried by quality.

‘The cost to the exchequer went up by 50 per cent.’

The proposals come three months after Downing Street confirmed it was considering a scheme to allow parents to borrow up to £10,000 to cope with childcare costs.

Independent think-tank, the Social Market Foundation (SMF), put forward the plan, which would take the form of a loan similar to those offered to students.

A poll by SMF showed that 55 per cent of parents find childcare 'too expensive'.

The think-tank has suggested a national childcare contribution scheme where parents who earn more than £12,000 annually could receive a lump sum.

The loan would be repaid monthly over an extended period and at a low interest rate through the tax system.
