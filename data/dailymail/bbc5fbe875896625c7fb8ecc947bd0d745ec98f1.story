An Idaho lawmaker provoked ridicule after asking if a swallowed camera could be used to conduct a remote gynaecological exam on a pregnant woman.

Republican State Representative Vito Barbieri made the bizarre remark as the House State Affairs Committee heard nearly three hours of testimony on a bill that would ban doctors from prescribing abortion-inducing medication via video conference or phone call.

Dr Julie Madsen was testifying in opposition to the bill when Mr Barbieri asked if a swallowed camera could be used for a remote exam.

And when Dr Madsen replied that it would be impossible because swallowed pills do not end up in the vagina, Mr Barbieri added: 'Fascinating. That makes sense', amid the crowd's laughter.

The committee ended up approving the bill 13-4 on a party-line vote and now it will go to the House floor for a full vote.

Mr Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy centre in northern Idaho, voted in favour of the legislation.

Under the bill, abortion-inducing medication would not be able to be administered through telemedicine - which does not currently happen in Idaho, and requires doctors to make 'all reasonable effort' to schedule a follow-up visit.

The bill is also backed by the anti-abortion group Idaho Choose Life.

Anti-abortion advocates argue that the bill will protect women who may have an adverse reaction to abortion medication.

Those opposed say that the bill is an attempt to restrict abortions, pointing to women living in rural areas where access to clinics is already limited.

The measure is one of several abortion-related bills Idaho lawmakers are considering this legislative session.

Meanwhile in the Idaho Senate, lawmakers are considering a bill that would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.

Republican Representative Linda Bateman said: 'Children have no way to really challenge the forces that harm them and unborn children are especially susceptible to harm.

Mr Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy centre in northern Idaho, voted in favour of the legislation to ban doctors from prescribing abortion-inducing drugs via video conference or phone call 

'In my view, this may reduce the number of abortions.'

However, this isn't the first time Idaho lawmakers have received attention while debating abortion legislation.

In 2013, Republican Representative Ron Mendive drew audible gasps in a committee when he asked if the American Civil Liberties Union-Idaho's pro-abortion stance also meant they supported prostitution.

A year prior, Republican Senator Chuck Winder drew national criticism after he suggested on the Senate floor that a doctor should ask a woman who says she was raped if it could have been caused by 'normal relations in a marriage.' 

The House State Affairs Committee is considered one of the most conservative committees in Idaho's Republican-controlled Statehouse.

Already this year, the committee has rejected a proposal that would provide legal protections to gay and lesbian people and halted legislation proposed by a 14-year-old girl to designate the Idaho Giant Salamander as the official state amphibian.

It has endorsed, however, a bill that would expand parental rights in Idaho law.
