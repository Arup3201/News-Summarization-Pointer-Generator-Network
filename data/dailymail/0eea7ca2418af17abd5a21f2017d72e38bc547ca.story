Also on trial: Kelly Rayner (pictured) is accused of allowing her partner Ross Conlin to murder their baby daughter Kiera by failing to care for her

A drug user father shook to death his own baby daughter after flying into a rage because he 'failed to bond with her', a court has heard.

Ross Conlin, 29, who regularly used cocaine and cannabis, reportedly attacked four-month-old Kiera 'in anger' while left alone with her in Farnborough, Hampshire.

He allegedly 'vigorously shook' the baby - causing her to stop breathing, suffer a bleed to the brain and finally have a heart attack.

Kiera, who also suffered bleeding to the
 eyes, was taken to hospital with 'terrible injuries' and placed on a life 
support machine, but died the next day.

Now, Conlin has denied murder and three charges of causing grievous bodily harm to his daughter on three previous occasions at Winchester Crown Court.

He had allegedly caused Kiera to suffer from three skull fractures, rib fractures and bleeding in her eye sockets in the months leading up to her death last May.

Meanwhile, his partner, Kelly Rayner, has denied a charge of allowing Kiera's death by failing to care for and protect her daughter.

Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, 
told the court the pair had been staying with 
Rayner’s parents at the time of the alleged murder on May 6.

He said Conlin, who worked as a debt collector, had been left alone with Kiera while Rayner went to have her nails painted and her parents were out.

However, shortly after 10am, Conlin had suddenly attacked his daughter, 'probably in anger'.

'Such was the nature of that violent shaking, she suffered three recognised injuries, and others, that form what the doctors call a triad of injuries in such cases: bleeding to the surface of the brain; brain injury caused by the loss of oxygen and blood to the brain, and retinal haemorrhaging - bleeding to the eyes,' he said.

'Her injuries were so severe, having become unconscious and stopped breathing - she was in her father’s hands at the time - she suffered a heart attack.

'She never recovered and was allowed to die the following day, the doctors unable to save her.

'The prosecution say that her father... murdered her at a 
time when he was alone with his daughter. He
 did so probably in anger.

'The trial will also consider the role her mother, Rayner, played in her death. We
 do not say that Rayner caused her death, but allege that she failed to 
protect her daughter from her father, Ross Conlin, knowing that her 
daughter had suffered repeated injuries at the hands of Ross Conlin.'

Mr Lickley said there had been 'stress and strain' in the household in the weeks leading up to Kiera's death - with Rayner fearing that Conlin might leave her.

He
 explained that a major cause had been the lack of a 'bond' between Conlin 
and his daughter, saying: 'Ross Conlin had had a good relationship 
with her but that relationship changed and he became unhappy and 
stressed by the lack of bond between he, father, and Kiera, daughter.'

Conlin had also suffered from money worries, used dating websites and faced disciplinary procedures at work after his performance had 'dipped', he said.

Meanwhile, the defendant's drug use had impacted on the household, the court heard.

'He is a drug user, he smoked cannabis, he smoked cannabis on 
May 5th, the day before events on May 6th, and historically at least had
 taken cocaine,' said Mr Lickley.

'Such habits indicate a lack of responsibility on behalf of both parents when looking after children.'

Mr
 Lickley said that Conlin had dialled 999 at 10.47am after attacking Kiera, telling operators that she had choked on her bottle 
before she suddenly stopped breathing and went limp.

But he added: 'She
 hadn’t suffered those injuries as a result of choking or vomiting on 
her bottle, as her father said, but as a result of violent shaking by 
the adult holding her, her own father.'

Paramedics
 arrived at the scene and managed to restart Kiera’s heart, before 
taking her to Frimley Park Hospital and later, a specialist unit at 
Southampton General Hospital.

'But
 despite that, her injuries were so severe a decision was taken to 
withdraw support, her life support, because she was brain dead,' said Mr
 Lickley.

'Life support was withdrawn at 6.20pm [on May 7] and Kiera died in her mother’s arms at 7pm.'

He added that post-mortem examinations 
had shown that Kiera had suffered a rib fracture between four and eight 
weeks prior to her death, with the same rib and another being fractured 
again about 14 days prior to her death, along with three skull 
fractures.

The baby had then suffered further rib 
fractures between three and five days prior to her death and showed 
signs of previously having suffered bleeding to the eyes.

These injuries accounted for the three charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, he said.

Later in the trial, Mr Lickley read the jury a series of text messages between Conlin and Rayner.

He said the messages showed the strain that their relationship was under - and also read another message from Conlin to a friend which showed the difficulties he was having with Kiera.

The message read: 'LOL alright fella. Little missy is a pain in the arse, she’s always crying so it’s a bit difficult.'

Mr Lickley said that Rayner had also told a doctor during an eight-week check-up for Keira that Conlin 'was not forming much of an attachment' to his daughter.

He said that the doctor advised her to give it time and encourage her partner and daughter to spend as much time together as possible.

But by March 25, six weeks before Kiera died, Rayner had a meeting with a member of nursery staff whom she told that Kiera kept hurting herself.

Mr Lickley said that she told the staff member that: 'She was quite worried as Kiera kept on hurting herself and had scratches and bruises that were mostly on her arms, legs and face.

'She went on to say that she couldn’t get Kiera weighed because she was quite embarrassed about what people might think about the injuries.'

He added that the nursery staff worker had 'never heard anything like that before and advised her to see her GP.'

The trial has been adjourned until Monday.
