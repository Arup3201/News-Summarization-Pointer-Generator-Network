The sister of the young cancer victim from Massachusetts who inspired hit film The Fault in Our Stars has said watching the movie is like seeing her sibling have an extended life. 

Evangeline Earl described how watching the movie, based on the John Green book brought back memories - good and bad - of her sister Esther's fight against thyroid cancer.

And, although Esther never had a boyfriend like the film's main character, Hazel, watching the onscreen romance blossom gave Evangeline a fleeting glimpse of what could have been.

Muse: Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace in the film version of The Fault in Our Stars. Ansel Elgort portrays Gus. The adaptation was inspired by Esther

Writing in the Washington Post, Esther's sister Evangeline, who volunteers at her family's This Star Won't Go Out cancer charity, described last week how the film brought back a flood of memories.

'Watching the movie, I couldn’t help feeling I was seeing my little sister on the screen,' she said.

The Fault 
In Our Stars opened at the movies last Saturday and instantly became a 
smash hit.

The
 emotionally charged tear-jerker is the tale of the tumultuous 
relationship between two teenage lovers starring Shailene Woodley and 
Ansel Elgort who are both battling terminal cancer.

The
 film is based on Green’s best-selling novel of the same name, 
which sold about three million copies worldwide and developed a huge 
cult following.

While the book is a work of fiction, 
Green revealed the inspiration behind his main character Hazel Grace
 – played by Woodley - came from his close relationship with 
teenage, thyroid cancer sufferer, Esther.

Inspiration: John Green became friends with Esther at a Harry Potter convention. He was heartbroken when she passed away

Evangeline added that although her sister had never had a boyfriend, and died shortly after her 16th birthday in 2010, the film inspired her to imagine what else Esther could have accomplished.

'Witnessing a life and a romance she could have had made me feel 
unbearably sad and yet, oddly, uplifted. It’s as if, through Hazel, my 
sister is able to continue having new experiences. As if she got a 
sequel,' Evangeline said.

The girls' mother, Lori, added that Esther had written in one of the many journals she kept about how she would have liked a boyfriend.

‘In
 Esther’s journal she says, "Oh, I may never get to kiss a boy". She was
 ready for romance. She wasn’t looking for a knight in shining armor; 
she was more looking for someone with purpose, who was striving for 
something. Gus [in the film] was ambitious and Esther would have liked that.'

Evangeline added that the sassy attitude of the film's main character reminded her of how Esther had handled her own illness.

Recalling a scene in the film in which Hazel reacts strongly to being prescribed more drugs, saying: 'Why stop there? I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids,' Evangeline said: 'My sister could be similarly flippant.'

Despite often being bed-bound by her illness, Esther was vibrant and would write journals and make amusing and often poignant video blogs, where she discussed her cancer.

Upbeat: Esther was a vibrant teenager despite the cancer diagnosis, and made amusing video blogs

Fan: Esther was obsessed with John Green's earlier books and started a group dedicated to his work

Evangeline said 
that other parts of the movie, including a scene in which Hazel's father
 carries her to his car as she gasps for air, reminded her of darker 
moments in her sister's fight against cancer. '

'It brought me back to one night in 2008, when watched my father carry my sister 
Esther from her bedroom to an ambulance stretcher.

'I was
 almost 17 and couldn’t imagine life without the person who understood 
me when no one else could, who looked up to me even as I sat in awe of 
her,' Evangeline wrote in the Washington Post.

'We didn’t think she’d make it through 
the night. Yet, like Hazel, she regained her strength. She lived for two
 more maddening, beautiful year.'

Evangeline
 said she was pleased that like her sister, the film's main character 
was also a 'fangirl'. It was through a Harry Potter convention that 
Esther got to meet Green, who wrote popular young adult books.

Esther
 was obsessed with Green’s earlier
 books – starting fan a group dedicated to his work. After they met at 
the convention in Boston in 2009 they became great friends and close 
confidantes, after Green fell in love with Esther’s incredible courage 
and spirit.

Thumbs up: Esther wasn't worried about herself. But she was concerned about her parents and her family

Reality bites: In the film, Hazel can't believe a guy like Gus would ever be interested in her, but he proves his affection and gives her a reason to live. Their relationship is completely fictional, as Esther did not have a boyfriend. Her mother Lori explains Esther would have loved to have met someone like Gus

Green dedicated his book to Esther, and said he could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without having known her. 'Every word on that book
 depends on her,' Green said, adding that her 'empathy, charm and snark helped inspire' him.

While
 he also drew on experiences he had working as a chaplain on a 
children's ward, Esther's life also had an impact on his writing.

Her
 concern for making sure her family and friends would be OK after her 
death, has also been reflected in story's character, Hazel.

Evangeline
 said: 'Like Hazel - who tells her mother that her "greatest fear is 
that when I’m gone, you’re not going to have a life anymore" - Esther 
was focused on what would happen to the people she loved.

'She
 wanted to know that we would be all right, that we would miss her and 
think about her, yes, but that we would move on with our lives and be 
happy again.'
