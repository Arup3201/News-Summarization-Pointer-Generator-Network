An outraged son has told how his 95-year-old mother begged to die as she spent her last day alive waiting for an ambulance in agony - for almost four hours.

Devastated Eric Dennington, 73, said he felt totally helpless as he could do nothing for his dying mother Nora except try to reassure her that paramedics were on their way.

But as the hours ticked by with still no sign of help, her crippling abdominal pains grew worse until all she could do was cry out:  'I just want to die.'

Ambulance chiefs have now apologised to him after carrying out an investigation into the heartbreaking incident.

Mr Dennington said: 'She had agonising stomach pain and we were told the ambulance would be a blue light job and would be with her very quickly.

'But by the time she got to hospital it was nearly four hours.

'No-one should have to wait for an ambulance that length of time in any circumstances.

'I was disgusted.'

The furious pensioner added: 'I couldn't do anything for her and it was difficult for her to move because she was in such pain.

'I couldn't give her anything. I'm not a medical man and as far as I knew the ambulance would be there any minute.

'When the reception rang to see where the ambulance was they were told it was on its way.'

Mr Dennington, of Trimley St Mary, near Ipswich, Suffolk, said that when the 999 vehicle finally arrived it was a St John Ambulance.

And in a new cruel blow the crew were not able to administer the crucial morphine his mother so desperately needed.

The distressed family was then forced to wait further as a paramedic was called.

'We keep reading of similar cases and 
the situation doesn't seem to get any better,' said Mr Dennington, who 
worked at East Anglian Building Supplies, Felixstowe, for 20 years.

'I feel very let down.'

As
 well as making a formal complaint to East of England Ambulance Service 
NHS Trust, he has also written to his MP Therese Coffey to voice his 
concern and demand action.

An ambulance was called at 3.31pm but not sent until 6.36pm.

It eventually arrived at Mrs Dennington's Deben View care home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, just after 7pm.

There
 was then a further nine-minute delay until a paramedic could arrive and
 after that Mrs Dennington was taken to Ipswich Hospital.

Ambulance chiefs say crew rotas are to
 be revised to increase cover in the county following concerns about 
demand outweighing resources.

An
 East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust spokeswoman said in Mrs 
Dennington's case the doctor's receptionist said 'the doctor had asked 
for an ambulance within an hour but did not request an emergency 
vehicle, simply transport'.

The hour-deadline was not met because the service was so busy, she said.

But
 officials did call to check on Mrs Dennington's condition twice during 
the delay and were told she had not worsened and had no critical 
symptoms.

'We have written 
to the complainant with a full apology and the results of an 
investigation conducted into this incident,' said the spokeswoman.

'This was a request for non-emergency transport to hospital based on a GP's assessment that the patient had stomach pain and no critical symptoms.

'Occasionally demand outweighs resource and regrettably this was one of those times'

- Spokeswoman, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust

'Due to workload with patients in greater immediate need we did not pick up the patient within the hour requested but made regular calls to check her symptoms hadn't worsened.

'Unfortunately demand was extremely high with many 999 calls as well as urgent GP admissions like this.

'There were also ambulances unable to handover patients at hospital due to a high number of admissions which meant delays in them becoming available.

'Occasionally demand outweighs resource and regrettably this was one of those times.

'But in order to address this issue rotas are being revised in Suffolk so that not only will the county have more resources, particularly in Felixstowe which will see coverage increased by more than 115 vehicle hours a week, but they will be better placed to get to patients when and where they are needed.'
