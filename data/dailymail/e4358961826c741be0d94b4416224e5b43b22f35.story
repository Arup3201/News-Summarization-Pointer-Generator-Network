England batsman Ian bell led the tributes after Warwickshire club captain Jim Troughton announced his retirement from professional cricket with immediate effect after failing to overcome a long-standing back injury.

Troughton has only been able to represent Warwickshire sporadically in the last couple of seasons and made what would turn out to be his final appearance for the county in the LV= County Championship Division One defeat by Yorkshire in June.

And his county colleague Bell tweeted: 'Devastated my mate and bro in law Troughts has had to retire. Huge loss to all concerned on and off the field!'

Chris Woakes added: Sad to see Jim Troughton retire today. A true Bear who will be missed on & off the pitch. Great player, great career but even better bloke!'

He scored 8,491 runs in 167 first-class matches and was named captain ahead of the 2011 season, with arguably his finest moment in the game coming the following year when he led Warwickshire to the Division One title. 

'After what has been a difficult 14 months dealing with back problems, I am devastated to have to concede that my playing days are over,' Troughton - the grandson of former Doctor Who star Patrick Troughton - said.

'I simply am no longer able to do myself justice and after much deliberation and consultation with the club's medical team, my surgeon, family and close friends, I have to accept that I can no longer train and perform to the level required to fulfil my duties as a first-class cricketer and club captain.

'Warwickshire has been my life and I feel privileged to have been associated with such a fantastic club. I have been lucky to have played alongside so many amazing players and coaches, who I will regard as friends for life. Captaining Warwickshire has been the proudest achievement of my career.' 

The 35-year-old made six one-day international appearances for England in 2003 although a top-score of 20 in five innings meant he was not considered again. 

Dougie Brown, director of cricket at Warwickshire, said: 'Jim has been a model professional, having won multiple trophies, leading the club to a County Championship title and setting outstanding standards, on and off the field, for young cricketers to follow.

'Whilst we're very sad that he has to retire in this way, all members of the playing and coaching team are very proud at what he has achieved in the professional game.

'It has been a pleasure to work and play alongside him and as a Championship-winning skipper he will always have a special place in the history of the club.'
