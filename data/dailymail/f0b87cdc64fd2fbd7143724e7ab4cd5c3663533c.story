Beth Cowan pushed herself to the brink, living on just an apple a day.

But now the 19-year-old, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has fought back to fitness and is in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015.

The brave teenager even took to the stage at a recent beauty contest to tell crowds how she had battled eating disorders and hoped her participation would inspire others fighting the illness.

Beth Cowan, 19, of Chester le Street, County Durham, struggled with anorexia and bulimia, at one point tipping the scales at just 6st 3lbs. Now, she is a healthier 8st 2lb (pictured)

During a Q&A round, she told the host how she'd love to win to send a message of hope to others in the same boat.

Beth has now shared a shocking snap of the way she used to look in a bid to convince other young people not to take the path she chose.

Beth, who suffered bulimia and anorexia, would spend hours running on a treadmill in her bid to shrink her body to a tiny size. 

Weighing just 6st 3lb and standing at 5ft 8in, she had a BMI of 13.2 and was classed as dangerously underweight.

Beth said: 'I was 16 and still at school. I do not know how it started - there was no specific cause.

'I just started restricting what I ate. I would go on a treadmill for an hour and eat an apple a day.

'Then, I was in Newcastle's Marks and Spencer when I walked past a mirror and I could not believe how skinny I was.

'People used to say I looked like I was dying. I went to the doctors - I knew I needed to do something or I would not be able to have kids.

'The disease took everything away from me. It was my way of gaining some control, everything else was out of my control.'

Her condition became so dangerous she could no longer attend school and had to be home tutored.

Miraculously, Beth still managed to earn As and Bs in her GCSEs and now hopes to be a teacher.

Threatened with the prospect of hospital, Beth started to see an eating disorder specialist who helped her get her life back on track.

'They said to me if I did not do something right now I would be an inpatient tubed up because my weight was too low,' she said.

'I used to cry at the thought of going into hospital - I was absolutely terrified.'

After being scouted at the Miss Bijoux beauty competition for Miss Newcastle, Beth will now take part in Miss British Empire. 

It's a long way from the days when she would live off one piece of fruit a day - and she is urging other girls in her situation to seek help.

She said: 'My mum used to cry, they were pleading with me, telling me I really needed to do something. 

'I used to promise I would start tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes. I would lie to them and would lie to myself. 

'It was a habit I could not break. It took me until I was 19 to get better.

'I am 8 stone two pounds now but I'm still not where I want to be, I want to put more weight on.

'I was anorexic and bulimic. I just want other girls out there to know it's not impossible to beat. There is a way out. It does not happen overnight but you can control it.

'I would not be here now if I did not choose to beat it. Never give up.'  

After being scouted at the Miss Bijoux beauty competition for Miss Newcastle, Beth will now take part in Miss British Empire, where she'll encourage other girls to seek help for eating disorders
