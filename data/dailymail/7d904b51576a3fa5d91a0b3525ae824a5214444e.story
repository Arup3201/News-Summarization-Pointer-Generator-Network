Out of England's World Cup squad, out of contract at Chelsea in the summer; but Ashley Cole will not be out of options.

Cole has been the best left-back in the country for over a decade and, at times, arguably the best in world football.

But what is the next move for the 33-year-old?

Where next? Ashley Cole is resigned to leaving Chelsea this summer as his contract ends

Three World Cups, two European Championships, 107 England caps, three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups, a Champions League and Europa League trophy, one League Cup and three Community Shields.

Wherever he goes, he'll need a separate removal van just for the silverware. Options in England appear more limited, but are not out of the question.

With Luke Shaw set for a move to Manchester United, the only other viable clubs that could offer Cole the standard of football he would require to remain in this country are Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.

City aren't short of left-backs, Brendan Rodgers has shown faith in young English full-back Jon Flanagan, but Arsene Wenger could do with a replacement for the injury-prone Kieran Gibbs and the inconsistent Nacho Monreal.

Would Cole really return to a club where fans dubbed him 'Cashley' when he moved to Chelsea for far bigger wages?

Stranger transfers have happened in football.

Happy days: Cole could be set for a return to Arsenal, who he left to join Chelsea

Cole has had a renaissance at the end of this season, starting in big games against Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea Manager Jose Mourinho did not rule out keeping Cole, along with veteran team-mates Frank Lampard and John Terry.

‘Was the Norwich game the last game for Cole, Lampard and Terry? I don’t think so,’ Mourinho said.

Cole's reaction after that final game of the season at Stamford Bridge when he burst into tears suggested otherwise.

And, after his eight-year association with the club, he might fancy pastures new.

When his representatives negotiated 
his latest deal last year, worth just under £200,000-per-week but 
greatly dependant on bonuses which he is not getting sitting on the 
bench, they held tentative talks with Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain 
and Manchester United.

On the continent: Real manager Carlo Ancelotti may move for the left-back having always been an admirer

Cole has considered the idea of moving abroad in the past.

In his 2006 autobiography 'My Defence' he wrote: 'I’d entertained European thoughts. Ask any player with ambition; they’ll all do it from time to time.

'Nothing concrete, just tossing clubs around like a kid dreaming impossible dreams: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Inter Milan.'

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelloti is fond of Cole and knows him well from his spell in charge of Chelsea from 2009-2011 when they won the league and FA Cup double in 2010.

Ancelloti has spoken in the past about his admiration for the left-back's work ethic.

Uncertain future: John Terry earned a new contract, but Cole and Frank Lampard are yet to receive an offer

Inter Milan are in the process of overhauling their squad after a terrible Serie A campaign, although Cole said in the same autobiography that he was not keen on a move to Italy.

The MLS is becoming an increasingly attractive prospect to former stars heading into the twilight of their careers since the likes of David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Jermain Defoe, Rafael Marquez and Robbie Keane crossed the Atlantic.

The New York Red Bulls and LA Galaxy are both understood to be interested and Mourinho hinted earlier in the season that Henry, a former team-mate of Cole at Arsenal, was trying to persuade him to make the move to New York.

'Maybe Thierry is doing with the Red Bulls the same as David [Beckham] did with Miami,' Mourinho said. '[Cole] has [a future at Chelsea], but maybe Thierry has a better proposal.'
