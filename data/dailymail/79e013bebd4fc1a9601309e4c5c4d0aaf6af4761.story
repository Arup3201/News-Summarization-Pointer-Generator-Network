Dramatic video has emerged of the moment the owner of a dog shot dead by a policeman searching for a missing boy confronted cops over the killing.

Sean Kendall, 27, berated the officers only minutes after his dog was shot in the head last week by a Salt Lake City police officer. The one responsible for the shooting wasn't there, but that did not lessen Kendall's anger.

'You guys killed my dog. I’ve had this dog for three years – he was my best friend, and he was shot because an officer couldn’t back the f**k up out of my house,' Kendall shouted at the cops.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Confrontation: Sean Kendall angrily shouted at the police officers standing in his front yard after his dog Geist was killed

The video starts with Kendall driving home after finding out his dog had been shot dead. It was created less than 20 minutes after the dog died. His hands tremble with emotion as he confronts the cops and goes on a profanity-laced tirade.

'Which officer shot my dog? Please,' Kendall asks the officers standing in his front yard in the footage first made public on his Facebook page.

'We were looking for a lost child,' said one of the cops.

'And that gives you probable cause to enter a private residence without permission from the owner?' Kendall fired back.

The distraught man then asked for their names and badge numbers, as well as that of the one who killed his dog.

The officers on the scene identified an Officer Olson as the man responsible for killing the Wimaraner.

The gate: This is where Kandall believes the police walked uninvited into his backyard

'He was threatened by the dog, so backing up slowly and leaving the residence is not an option?' Kendall asked, later adding 'is that against policy? Is that against training?

'Did the officer at least have the decency to kill him in the first shot so he didn’t suffer? Or do I have multiple gun wounds in what I consider my child?' Kendall continued.

The officer apologized and explained that the dog threatened the officer - while on its own property.

'So I gotta bury my dog because an officer couldn’t back up and close the f*****g gate… what happened was wrong.'

Kendall reportedly met with Salt Lake City police officials earlier this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist.

Police were searching for a three-year-old boy named Kelby who had been reported missing - he was eventually found asleep in his own basement.

Furious: Kendall only becomes more angry as he talks about the officers killing his dog while walking into his backyard

The yard: Kendall insists the officers had plenty of time to slowly back out of the yard instead of shooting the dog dead

Police said
 the officer who was searching in Kendall's yard felt the dog was 
aggressive and going to attack him, and that's why he shot the animal.

Now
 Kendall is calling for the officer to be fired from the force, saying 
he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the apparent reluctance of the
 police to take action against the officer who shot his dog.

'The only thing that I would be satisfied with is having this officer terminated,' Kendall told The Salt Lake Tribune.

'I feel that his judgment was completely inappropriate.'

Kendall told KSL that Geist had never been aggressive or lunged at anybody.

'The idea that he attacked an officer — it just doesn't make sense,' he added.

Another case: A Baltimore police officer was suspended in a case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. Owner Sarah Gossard said her dog Nala, pictured, went missing and she had been trying to track the Shar-Pei down

'I 
believe my dog came out of the dog kennel to see what was going on, who 
was here, stopped right here, and those were his last moments.'

Kendall said Geist had a single gunshot wound to the head.

'Just the sheer sight of seeing my dog there — it was traumatizing,' said Kendall.

'Now he's dead. I have him wrapped up in a blanket in the back of my truck, and now I have to go bury him.'

Kendall’s attorney, Brett Boulton, said he believes his client should be compensated.

But Sgt. Greg Wilking said the officer did not break the law when he entered Kendall’s backyard.

'There are extenuating circumstances,' said Wilking reported The Salt Lake Tribune.

'A child is missing, and if you’re a parent, you would want us to look everywhere for your child. We wouldn’t want to leave any stone unturned.'

Earlier this week a second Baltimore police officer was suspended in a shocking case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat.

The Baltimore Sun reported that officer Thomas Schmidt has been placed on a paid administrative leave along with fellow officer Jeffrey Bolger who has been charged with animal cruelty.

The pair allegedly held down and cut the throat of a Shar-Pei, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained.

Schmidt is a 24-year veteran of the Special Operations Section, serving alongside Bolger who was hired in 1992.

The union did not provide information regarding the terms of Schmidt's suspension.

The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten.

Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat.

Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger.

Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'.

Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f*****g gut this thing.'

He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun.
