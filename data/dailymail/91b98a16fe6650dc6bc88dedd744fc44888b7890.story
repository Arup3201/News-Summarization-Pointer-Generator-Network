The typical British worker has a body effectively four years older than their actual age because of poor diet and lack of exercise, a study has found.

Bad habits - such as drinking, smoking, and binge eating - combine with stress to accelerate the body's natural ageing process.

Scientists found 86 per cent of us have bodies that appear physically older than a perfectly healthy individual of the same age.

Smoking: Study found that bad habits combine with stress to speed up the body's natural ageing process

Adults are, on average, four years and 37 days older, the research by private medical insurer PruHealth with Vitality found.

The researchers also managed to see clear health divides across the coutnry.

They found that those living in the capital are the fittest, with 45 per cent doing the recommended two hours 30 minutes exercise each week.

Residents
 of the North East have the best diet, with 74 per cent eating an ideal 
mix of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meat.

They also smoke the least, with just one in four puffing on a cigarette, pipe, or cigar.

However, Wales performed badly on nearly all indicators.

Over
 half of Welsh workers smoke (55 per cent), less than three-quarters (74
 per cent) exercise enough, and six in ten (60 per cent) are overweight.

They
 are also more likely to suffer from stress, high blood pressure, or 
increased cholesterol, all of which can cause health problems.

Those
 in the West Midlands have the worst diet, with 43 per cent eating too 
few healthy foods, or over-indulging on fat, sugar, and salt.

The study found a direct correlation between income and health, with lifestyle risk factors more common among lower-earners.

In fact, those with the highest salaries have a health age almost two years younger than those on the lowest.

People in Wales are in the poorest condition, having a health age of five years six months older than their actual age.

Those in London are healthiest, prematurely ageing by just three years two months.

The study analysed lifestyle, behavioural, and clinical risk factors, using data from 10,000 workers.

They looked at patients' weight, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, stress, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, and blood pressure.

And they used that to draw up a 'health map' of Britain, which shows Londoners are the slimmest, with 65
 per cent in the healthy weight range.

Those living in the capital are also the fittest, with 45 per cent doing the recommended two hours 30 minutes exercise each week.

mix of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meat.

The calculation is an alternative way of looking at how many years an unhealthly lifestyle may knock off your life expectancy.

Dr Katie Tryon, from PruHealth with Vitality, said: 'This map paints a fascinating picture of the health of the nation.

'It shows how people's lifestyles are impacting their overall health and ultimately reducing their life expectancy.

'There is a clear picture of how each region is performing and where the hotspots are.

'Most of us start the New Year with good intentions.

'By making lifestyle adjustments now we can all improve our quality of life and not only live longer, but live healthier lives.

'Things like getting off the bus a couple of stops early or taking the stairs instead of the lift are free and can make all the difference.'
