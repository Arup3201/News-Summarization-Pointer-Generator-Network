A prisoner of war camp were held is to undergo £500,000 worth of repairs after an emergency donation from English Heritage.

Harperley in Durham, which was built to house captured Italian and German prisoners during World War II, needs urgent work after it was hit by last year's sharp winter.

The sheds, many of them with corrugated rooftops and asbestos panelling, were supposed to be temporary buildings when they were put up in 1943.

Owners: James and Lisa McLeod tried to sell the camp on eBay two years ago and have now received £500,000 from English heritage to carry out emergency repairs

However, it has scheduled monument status which means it is nationally important. It is the only camp in the country to have the classification.

The 17-acre site, which has been run as a tourist attraction since 2004 by its private owners, is being given the funding by English Heritage with no requirement for it to be matched, the Guardian reported.

The repair work is being carried out to a theatre and a canteen on the site which are in the poorest state of repair. The huts will be clad in timber to stop their condition deteriorating further.

Temporary huts: When the site was built in 1943 the buildings, many of them made from pre-fabricated concrete, were only supposed to last a few years

Disrepair: This is the Oprisoner theatre, pictured in 2002, which will undergo emergency repairs. Its state of repair declined dramatically in last winter's big freeze

Although the buildings appear ramshackle, they give a remarkable insight into the lives of thousands of World War Two PoWs.

The theatre and the canteen which are undergoing repairs were central to the social life at Harperley.

Although the German and Italian prisoners were forced to work the land locally, many of them did not mind being there. Indeed, around 10 per cent of the population settled in the area after the war.

The inmates were humanely treated, encouraged to make themselves at home and even produced their own newspaper.

As well as the theatre there was football, education classes, gardening opportunities and a local community who were happy to accept them as their own.

The camp is historically significant because it gives a unique insight into the very ordinary war lives of thousands.

The theatre has a stage, orchestra pit and tiered flooring. The canteen, where the inmates would socialise, had a series of paintings of German scenes on the wall which have survived.

In total, there are 49 buildings.

Owners James and Lisa Mcleod put the camp up for sale on eBay two years ago - but no one was prepared to match their £900,000 asking price.

They ran out of money while trying to turn the piece of wartime history into a visitor and education centre.

Rob Young, historic environment adviser at English heritage, told the Guardian: 'Many people ask why not just record it and let it fall down, but it is the only place where you can see this aspect of our history, and it has a very powerful atmosphere.

'Although the materials were very crude, whatever they could get hold of, the workmanship is excellent, and the theatre was planned by somebody who really knew his job - it has a miniature proscenium arch, an orchestra pit, raked seating, even a prompt box, all fitted into the framework of the hit.'

The
camp was built to house 'low risk' prisoners of war who were housed in 
tents before Italian POWs erected prefabricated buildings. By September 
1944 most of prisoners had been dispersed to hostels and farms to make 
way for around 900 German prisoners

Originally the camp housed Italian prisoners who slept in tents.

But in the early 1940s huts were
erected by Italian PoWs who stayed there until September 1944 when
around 900 German prisoners were transported to the camp.

Prisoners underwent de-Nazification classes and although being interned was traumatic for soldiers many were relieved to be out of the war. Just one person ever tried to escape.

They were often allowed into town and formed such strong bonds with the local community
that around 10 per cent of prisoners stayed in Britain rather than return
home.

The prison was a work camp and detainees were taken out daily to work on farms.

Among the detainees was German PoW Bert Trautmann, who became a professional footballer for Manchester City after the war.

The
goalkeeper is famous for playing the full 90 minutes in the 1956 FA Cup
final, despite breaking his neck 17 minutes from time.

The sports field at Harperley is also believed to have been the venue for the first England v Germany
post-war football match when the PoW camp team took on Crook Town.

After the war it was used for storage by the farmer who owned it before the Mcleods purchased it and formed a trust.

Emergency repairs: Work will be carried out to the theatre and canteen. The owners ran out of money as they tried to turn it into a tourist attraction

Productions: Theatre was a centrepoint of life at the camp to keep up morale. Here is a theatrical production at another PoW camp
