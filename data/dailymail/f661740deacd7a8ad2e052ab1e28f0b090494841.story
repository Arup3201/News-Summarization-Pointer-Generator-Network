The parents of missing April Jones have spoken of their anguish of spending Christmas without their little girl.

Paul and Coral Jones, whose five-year-old daughter went missing on October 1 after playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, Wales, said: 'We are coming to terms with the fact that our baby girl has been taken from us.'

'It's been ten weeks since April, our beautiful girl, was taken from us.

'The pain from our loss doesn't get any easier to bear.'

April's family hope these new pictures may prompt someone to come forward with information about the whereabouts of the five-year-old

Devastated Mrs Jones called this image 'April the water baby'. She has thanked police for their support as they search for her little girl

Their comments came as police hunting
for the schoolgirl, who disappeared ten weeks ago, have 
announced they will scale down the operation over the Christmas period.

Supt
Ian John, who is leading the investigation for Dyfed-Powys Police, gave
the update on the operation and read a statement from April's 
devastated parents.

The search will start again in the 
new year as police tirelessly search for her body, after went 
missing on October 1, the officer leading the investigation announced in
a press conference today.

He
read out a statement from her heartbroken parents Coral and Paul, who 
thanked the community, police and everyone who sent them messages of 
support.

'Christmas will be a particularly difficult time without April being amongst us.

Police will continue to search for April

'But as parents of Harley and Jazmin we will obviously acknowledge the festive season as best we can.

'We sincerely hope that families around the world will enjoy a peaceful and loving Christmas.'

Coral, 40, and Paul, 43, said they were taking each day at a time with the help of police keeping them up to date with the search.

The parents said that the overwhelming amount of supportive and empathetic messages they had received from all over the UK an dtheir local community has 'shown us that people really do come together at difficult times.'

The family also said that those 
involved in the search, who have been working from Monday to Friday in 
16 search teams, deserved a rest with their families.

Supt John said it was one of the largest search operations in the UK in police history.

He said officers were all united by the hope that they could help the Jones' family.

He said: 'We are all motivated by the same thing, finding a little girl and bringing peace to a family.'

April was last seen near her home on 1 October and since then officers from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have tried to locate the body of the little girl.

An extensive search has continued, but she has not yet been found.

Supt John said the search would continue until police had investigated all lines of inquiry.

He said: 'The search continues, this is by no means over.

'While it will be scaled down over Christmas, the hard work continues and do all we can to find April.'

But he said it was necessary to reduce the scale of the search over the festive season.

April was last seen getting into a vehicle after playing near her home on the Bryn y Gog estate.

She had been allowed to play outside later than usual as a treat for her glowing school report.

At the end of November April Jones' parents released unseen pictures of the missing five-year-old to mark two months since she disappeared.

Her devastated parents have refused to give up hope she will be found, and an illuminated pink star lit in April's memory is part of the Christmas decorations in her hometown.

Mark Bridger, 46, has been remanded in custody, charged with murder, child abduction and perverting the course of justice.

He is due to appear in court on January 11.
