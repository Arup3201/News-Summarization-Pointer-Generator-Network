A graduate student from St. Louis, Missouri, who was severely injured in a chimp attack at a refuge in South Africa is now awake and communicating, his doctor announced on Thursday.

Saint Louis University chief of plastic surgery Dr Bruce Kraemer said Andrew Oberle Jr had undergone three surgeries since arriving at the hospital less than two weeks ago.

Speaking at a news conference, Kraemer said Oberle, 26, had injuries all over his body, but reports that he had an arm severed in the attack were inaccurate, though he did lose fingers.

Victim: Andrew Oberle (pictured) suffered severe injuries all over his body at the hands of two chimpanzees

Oberle was mauled by chimpanzees on June 28 while giving a tour at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimpanzee Eden SA.

The 26-year-old anthropology and primatology student from the University of Texas–San Antonio was working at the sanctuary as part of his graduate program.

Two chimps named Amadeus and Nikki lunged at Oberle, pulling him under an electric fence and dragging him about a half-mile.

The refuge said it was the first attack since the center opened six years ago with the goal of saving abused animals

Oberle suffered large cuts to his head and face that left his skull and facial bones exposed. He was kept in a medically induced coma until his return to St. Louis.

Kraemer said the majority of Oberle’s wounds are now closed and covered, and he is poised to begin the rehabilitation process. 

The surgeon added that the 26-year-old ‘has a very strong spirit. His attitude is phenomenal.

‘He’s dealt with horrific pain but is just a sweet, loving guy who just wants to have his privacy respected now so he can figure things out on his own,’ Kraemer said.

Serious injuries: Oberle suffered cuts to his face and skull, and lost several fingers in the brutal attack

Moving forward: The animals involved in the attack (not pictured) were reintroduced at the center in July under supervision 

Oberle faces a long recovery and may 
be treated with new technologies in regenerative medicine and 
prosthetics that would possibly allow the graduate student to ‘grow 
back’ what he lost, according to his doctor.

‘Everything
he wanted to do (before the attack) perhaps he’ll have some 
limitations,’ Kraemer said, according to KMOX. ‘I guess in the bigger context he’s been 
saved.’

At the press 
conference, Oberle's mother, Mary Flint, gave a brief statement in which
she thanked doctors and staff at the hospital, along with relatives, 
friends ‘and all the wonderful people from all over the world who have 
kept Andy and all of us in their prayers and for helping us with 
donations for his care.’

Officials at the chimpanzee refuge reintroduced the animals at the center in late July, under careful supervision.

Prognosis: Oberle's surgeon said thanks to new technologies, the young man, pictured, may be able to 'grow back' the parts he lost in the attack, but he is likely to face limitations

Amadeus,
the alpha male, had been held in solitary confinement since the June 
attack. Nikki was shot in the abdomen and leg, and was transferred from 
the Johannesburg Zoo back to the refuge.

Speaking
to ABC’s 20/20 last week, institute director Eugene Cussons said the 
chimps both had difficult upbringings before coming to the refuge, and 
should be considered victims along with Oberle.

Cussons also said that Oberle had a lapse in judgement by approaching too close to the fence while conducting the tour, and he should have been more careful in the presence of wild animals.

Strong: 200-lb chimpanzee Travis attacked in 2009. Experts warned chimps can be up to six times as strong as a human

In 2009 Charla Nash, 58, almost died in a
horrific mauling that saw her lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands 
after being savaged by Travis, a dangerous 200-pound chimpanzee.

She received a revolutionary 
full-face transplant in June 2011 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, nearly two years after the attack.

The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. 

Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’

In an interview Ms Nash told the Hartford Courant that she feels no different than she did before the attack.

‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good. Every day, my muscles get better.'

In past interviews,
Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human 
pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again.

She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose.

But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth.

‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said.

But she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house.

She
said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask 
in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna.

‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’

Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features

She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack.

Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications.

In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity.

‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’

She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame.

Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 
attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand 
transplant after the first one failed.

Ara
Chekmayan, a spokesman for the Nash family, told the Mail Online: 'The 
horrific chimpanzee attack that occurred today involving the American 
student further highlights the danger that these animals pose and their 
violent nature.

'Charla
Nash knows as well as anyone the tremendous harm that a chimpanzee can 
inflict. Her thoughts and prayers go out to the young man and his 
family.'
