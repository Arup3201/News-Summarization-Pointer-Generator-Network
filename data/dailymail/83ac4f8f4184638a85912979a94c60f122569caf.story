Venting hatred: Murderer Ian Brady has penned a series of letters with weird diatribes aimed at Noel Edmonds, Chris Evans and The Beatles

Killer Ian Brady believes celebrities like Noel Edmonds and Chris Evans should be 'culled' and calls for the working class to riot against the middle class in a series of demented rants.

In letters sent from his room in a high-security psychiatric hospital, the Moors Murderer also calls The Beatles 'puerile' and hints darkly about his horrendous crimes.

Brady, 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his girlfriend Myra Hindley for abducting, abusing, torturing and killing five youngsters in Manchester before burying them on nearby Saddleworth Moor.

He has been held at Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Liverpool since 1985. Hindley died in 2002.

The letters, seen by the Sunday Mirror, were in the possession of Micky Lloyd, 35, a campaigner working to find the body of Keith Bennett, the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found.

Bizarrely, Brady says the public should be able to vote for the celebrities they want to see killed.

The letter reads: 'The likes of Noel Edmonds and Chris Evans come crawling back from nowhere, not content to enjoy the pile they've made but craving more fame.'

Another passage singles out The Beatles, who were at the height of their fame when he was committing his crimes, stating: '(The Beatles) with their little uniforms and haircuts... were puerile.'

Brady also rails against the 'bone-idle' middle-class and calls for the working-class to attack them.

'Whining middle-class drinkers resent the fact that the working-class can now afford to drink as much as the middle-class has done,' he said.

He also says he would like to look for 'the remains of the old' if he ever returned to Saddleworth Moor, a possible sick taunt at the campaigners.

A few days ago it was reported that Brady could be in the early grip of dementia.

Jackie Powell, the Moors Murderer's self-styled mental health advocate, said his behaviour had become increasingly bizarre and medical experts believed he was now seriously ill.

The revelation has prompted fears that he may become unable to remember where he buried Keith Bennett.

She also said she believed it highly unlikely he would ever reveal where Keith Bennett is buried, saying that he refuses to even discuss it.
