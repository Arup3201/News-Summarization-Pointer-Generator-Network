With more than 150 million users  worldwide and around 55 million photos posted everyday, Instagram is a perfect way to look back at the year that has almost gone.

On Friday, the photo-sharing social network revealed its most popular picture, as well as the most Instagrammed locations, cities and hashtags of 2013.

And with over 12 million followers, it's no surprise that pint-sized pop sensation Justin Bieber gained the crown of the most 'liked' photo of the year. 

But the top location of the year was the Siam Paragon shopping mall and leisure complex in Bangkok, Thailand.

Runner-up: The Crossroads of the World (or Times Square) in New York City was the second most popular location

Canadian singer Bieber grinning and posing with Men In Black actor Will Smith received over 1.5 million likes.

Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom told NBC he believed the shot was so popular as simply it looked like the stars were having fun.

Instagram also announced the most popular places for photos in a blog post. 'Like last year, a popular location in Thailand tops the list,' the message read. 

'The Siam Paragon - a massive shopping complex, movie theater and aquarium in Bangkok - was our top spot, edging out 2012’s most Instagrammed place, Bangkok’s International Airport.'

Declarations: #Love was the most common hashtag of 2013 and mentioned in 371 million posts

Third: Disneyland, California, was the number three on the top Instagram locations list

Strike a pose! The Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas were the fourth most popular Instagram spot in 2013

Filter: DisneyWorld in Florida came in a at number five in the Instagram charts

Meanwhile, an icon of France and Paris, the Eiffel Tower, dropped out of top-ten altogether, meaning that none of the top places to share a snap was in Europe.

Two much-loved and leafy locations in New York City - Central Park and the High Line - were new to the list.

Times Square, another NYC icon that is often known as 'The Crossroads of the World' or 'The Center of the Universe', was the second most Instagrammed place of the year. 

Last year's most popular location was Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, which dropped to number nine in 2013.

The Big Apple was also the most Instagrammed city of the year, with five other U.S. cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas and San Francisco joining New York in the honors.

But 60 percent of Instagram users are outside the U.S., so Bangkok and London were the second and third most photographed in 2013.

Touchingly, Systrom also revealed that the top hashtag of the last 12 months was #Love, which was mentioned in around 371 million posts.

Yet the CEO added that #ThrowbackThursday, where users post up a nostalgic image, and the always popular #Food came in 'a close second and third.'
