Ladies' man? Godfrey Bloom with his wife Katie - who, as a woman, he concedes is 'better at finding the mustard in the pantry' than a man

Employment law should be torn up to allow small firms to sack women workers who get pregnant, UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has suggested.

The Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire MEP said that owners of smaller businesses were too scared to hire women of childbearing age because of maternity and anti-discrimination laws.

Mr Bloom called for the tearing up of 'draconian' employment legislation which burdened small employers by giving women the right to take maternity leave and expect their jobs back.

He said there should be 'liberty of contract' which would see a woman replaced for a job if she had children.

'Young women would much rather have a job under liberty of contract than not be given a job because of the fears some employers might have', he told London's LBC radio.

He had argued that feminism had 'done no favours' for the 'sisterhood' and that maternity rights in employment law had been bad for women.

In an interview with London's LBC radio station, he insisted that: 'Trying to paint me as a misogynist dinosaur does not bear out the facts'.

Mr Bloom said he employed mostly 'young women', 'many of them glamorous too' and was a big supporter of women's equestrian sport and Cambridge women's rugby.

He had been invited on the show to discuss an article he had written arguing against boardroom quotas. Mr Bloom claimed that women were better at digging out the mustard from the pantry than reversing their car into a parking space.

The 63 year-old set out the differences between men and women in an attempt to argue against quotas in the boardroom.

'You cannot legislate for human nature and nor should you,' he said.

'Men and women are different yet there is no golden rule,' he said in an article for the website politics.co.uk.

'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man and most men can reverse a car better than a woman.'

He predicted that feminism was a passing fashion, created by 'shrill, bored, middle class women of a certain physical genre'.

The only male supporters of feminism were men 'who seem to have no link with the usual social and sporting male preserves, the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach'.

The feminists of the 1970s were actually 'hostile to other women' and had done 'the sisterhood no favours'.

Bongo bongo: Mr Bloom, whocreated a stir when he walked out on an interview with Krishnan Guru-Murthy on C4 News earlier this month, said he would 'happily punch the first man who tries to steal my beer'

The former businessman said he was puzzled that women had produced so few great works in the arts despite having much more time on their hands in the 18th and 19th centuries

'Women, in spite of years of training in art and music - and significant leisure time in the 18th and 19th Centuries - have produced few great works,' he said.Mr Bloom's comments came just weeks after he sparked outrage by claiming that foreign aid was going to 'bongo-bong land'.

Women were more interested in tidying the house than getting ahead in business. 'Men and women care about different things on a micro-scale,' he said.

'Leaving the lavatory seat up, wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad. A man simply cannot understand what the problem is.

'Most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility. Men cannot see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight.'

He also said he would be 'happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer'.

UKIP was also at the centre of another controversy this week when its chief executive Will Gilpin quit after just eight months.

'Mutual agreement': Will Gilpin is to leave his role as chief executive of UKIP

Mr Gilpin said that the party was resisting any attempts to try and become more professional - and this would cost it potential seats at the 2015 general election.

The former RAF pilot, warned that the party would never progress beyond a 'bunch of enthusiastic amateurs' while leader Nigel Farage held so much power.

'The thing I am most shocked by is that Nigel does his own thing without the party knowing where he is or what he is doing,' he told the Telegraph.

'Nigel would see the party as being about him. The party is structured like a flying wedge, pushing Nigel forward.'

There is speculation that former Tory MP Neil Hamilton could replace him.

Barmy army? UKIP leader Nigel Farage has brushed aside recent comments about controversial members of his party, saying it is still a strong Right-wing alternative
