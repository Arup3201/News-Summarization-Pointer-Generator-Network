Most generous soldier: Marine David Hart, 23, left £100,000 to a group of 32 friends so they could enjoy the holiday of a lifetime in Las Vegas

A marine who died in Afghanistan left £100,000 to his friends to spend on a dream holiday in Las Vegas, his family revealed at his inquest today.

David Hart - who died the day before his 24th birthday - left a chunk of the money from his life insurance policy to fund the trip of a lifetime.

The serviceman, from 40 Commando, was blown up an IED in Sanguin, southern Afghanistan, while on foot patrol in July 2010.

The coroner's court heard today that the young soldier was 'the life 
and soul of any situation he was in'.

The marine had stipulated that in the event he was killed in action £100,000 of his £250,000 life insurance policy should be used by his 32 friends to go to the U.S., his family confirmed in private.

He also left £50,000 to a charity to help injured marines.

Marine Hart's friends were inundated by dozens of Sin City hotels and casinos, who insisted on giving them VIP treatment for free, after hearing about the heroic soldier's last wish.

His best friend Andy Hare said at the time of the trip: 'David had always said "if anything happens to me I’m going to leave this money and you can go on holiday".

'Out of ten, I would give the holiday 11. It was incredible from start to finish. Some of the lads who hadn’t been to Vegas before couldn’t believe what it was like.

'We were treated like royalty and didn’t want for anything while we were there. Thanks to Dave’s generosity we’ve all had a holiday none of us will ever forget.'

Marine Hart’s friends went on that 
holiday last summer, and today at his inquest one of his colleagues who saw the 
explosion paid tribute to him at the inquest.

Sergeant Damien O’Sullivan, 40 Commando, told York Coroner's Court: 'He was one of the most professional people I ever met. He had a bright future ahead of him.

'He was the life and soul of any situation he as in and he was loved and respected by everyone in the police mentoring group.'

The court heard that Marine Hart, from Poppleton, York, who was part of a team training Afghan police, was on a joint foot patrol with ten British soldiers and 13 Afghan soldiers.

They were going to talk to some locals when a bomb went off in a wadi, or valley, near their base.

They were travelling in an 'Afghan snake', a single file line with the Afghan soldiers up ahead, the court heard.

Three metal detectors were being used to clear a path away from any explosives but none were discovered - until the explosion killed Marine Hart.

Sgt O'Sullivan said: 'There was nothing on that day that led us to believe that there was any particular threat. That day was no different to any other day.

'As the Afghans were moving up the hill there was an explosion that I didn’t feel was particularly loud and a large plume of dust flew in the air.'

British soldiers cleared a path to Marine Hart, who had serious injuries from the waist down, and began to administer first aid.

He was taken to receive treatment at a nearby base by military vehicles but later died.

Pathologist Nicholas Hunt, in a written statement, said the cause of death was 'blast injuries caused by an explosion'.

Coroner Donald Coverdale said: 'Quite a number of Afghan and British soldiers walked across this spot.

'Unfortunately Marine David Hart walked across it and it was his footstep that triggered the IED (improvised explosive device).'

In a narrative verdict, he ruled: 'David Hart died from injuries inflicted by an exploding IED while on active service in Afghanistan.'

The coroner told Marine Hart’s family: 'You have suffered the loss of a well-loved son. He was a well-loved, well-liked and competent soldier.

'A lot has been suffered by his family but I think it is fair to say a lot has been suffered by his extended family, his colleagues in the British Army.'
