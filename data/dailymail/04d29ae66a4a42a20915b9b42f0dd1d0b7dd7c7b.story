Here's the bad news for Robert Rock: despite the camouflage we CAN see what you're wearing at the Trophee Hassan II on Thursday.

The 37-year-old Englishman turned heads at the European Tour event by wearing an ostentatious blue and pink camouflage jumper, and in the process added to golf's long list of crimes against fashion.

Rock has arguably the most famous hair in golf thanks to his insistence on being one of the few players not to wear a sponsored cap, leaving his carefully-coiffed mane on view at all times. Tiger Woods got a fine view of the do when Rock claimed a brilliant victory by beating the 14-time major champion at the 2012 Abu Dhabi Championship.

But, sadly, neither the hair nor the jumper could inspire a better score than 74 - two over par - in the first round at Golf du Palais Royal in Morocco on Thursday.

That left the Staffordshire man nine shots behind the leader, Adrien Saddier, with three rounds to go after the Frenchman's opening 75.

Rock is far from the first offender when it comes to golfers breaking the laws of fashion.

There are too many examples of awful golfing attire to list here, but among the chief culprits are loud-mouthed and loud-trousered American John Daly, numerous Ryder Cup teams down the years and, of course, the not-so-shrinking violet, Ian Poulter.

Here is a taster of some of golf's fashion hall of shame...

Woody Austin shows off during The Open at Royal Birkdale in 2008 (left - no prizes for guessing his nationality); and what do you ink about Billy Horschel's octopus-print pants at the 2013 US Open?

Oh, and if you want to wear the Rock look yourself, visit Wolsey.com and get ready to shell out £130. Good luck trying to get your local members' club to let you on the course, though...
