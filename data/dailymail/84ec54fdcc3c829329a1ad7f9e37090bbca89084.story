When introduced to pupils as ‘Professor’, she may not have expected them to appreciate her academic achievements – but she did expect them to address her accordingly.

Instead, Jennifer Coates says she was ‘demeaned’ by the youngsters simply calling her ‘Miss’.

Professor Coates described it as ‘a depressing example of how women are given low status and men, no matter how young or new in the job they are, are given high status’.

Infant and junior boys sitting at their desks in the 1930s, as pictured here, would not have dreamed of calling a female teacher 'Sir'. But academics believe this is a sexist hangover from the past

Australia: Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms and surname

China: Surname and Lao-shi (Teacher)

France: Monsieur or Madame

Germany: Herr or Frau

India: Teacher, Madam or Sir

Japan: Surname and Sensei (Teacher)

Korea: Full name and Seon-saeng-nim (Teacher)

Mexico: Miss and name if female, or Professor and name if male

Pakistan: Miss or Sir

Russia: First name and surname

Spain: Seno for women and Profe for men

Sweden: First names

US: Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms and surname

Now the emeritus professor of English
 language and linguistics at Roehampton University has called for the 
traditional titles ‘Sir’ and ‘Miss’ to be banished from schools to stop 
sexist views taking root among pupils.

Her call was backed by several other academics – including one who said teachers should instead be called by their first names.

Professor Coates told how she had 
been introduced to pupils at Harris Girls’ Academy East Dulwich, where 
she was volunteering, as ‘Professor Coates’, but they soon reverted to 
calling her just ‘Miss’.

‘The men on the staff are all in 
their twenties and they were all called Sir,’ she said. ‘Sire is what 
you called the king. And Sir is a knight. There weren’t women knights 
but Miss is ridiculous: it doesn’t match Sir at all.

‘It’s just one of the names you can call an unmarried woman.’

She said that for both men and women using their ‘title plus last name would be better’.

Professor Coates, who taught a course
 for undergraduates on sexist language, warned that terms such as ‘Sir’ 
and ‘Miss’ risked reinforcing the message that ‘women are lesser beings 
to men’.

Their use dates back to the 16th century, when schoolmasters were often of a lower social status than the children they taught.

They insisted on being called ‘Sir’ 
to reinforce their authority, education historian Jacob Middleton told 
the Times Educational Supplement.

Meanwhile women in the late Victorian
 era were discouraged from working once they married, leaving schools 
mainly staffed by men and single women referred to as ‘Miss’.

School girls are influenced by the 'discriminatory' way male teachers are called 'Sir' while their female counterparts are referred to as 'Miss', according to academics

Robin Lakoff, professor of 
linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, in the US, said 
that Sir for male teachers ‘always conveys respect’ while Miss does not.

‘It’s very hard to create linguistic equality between people who, in many people’s minds, aren’t equal,’ she said.

‘At school, we have children who are 
still really only learning language. They pick up on it very readily and
 then the next generation gets exposed to the prejudices of the previous
 generation.’

Professor Sara Mills, from Sheffield 
Hallam University, urged schools to abandon titles altogether and allow 
pupils to use first names.

But Debbie Coslett, chief executive 
of the Brook Learning Trust, which runs three schools in the South East,
 said: ‘If I’m in a school where students don’t know me and they call me
 “Miss”, I’m fine with that. They’re showing respect by giving me a 
title rather than “hey” or “oi, you” or whatever.’

'Miss' exposes pupils to 'prejudices of previous generation', say Professors

Instead all teachers should be called 'Sir' or their first names

Call likely to be ignored by traditionalist Education Secretary Michael Gove
