Wedding of the year: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West will say their vows tomorrow in Florence after flying their 3,000 wedding guests over from a party in Paris

Non-uniformed Italian militia have been drafted in to assist the pair's personal security team at the wedding on Saturday while construction workers continue to decorate the Parisian venue for tonight's event.

The couple, who have an 11-month-old daughter, North, got engaged in an American football stadium on Kim's 33rd birthday in October last year.

A 50-piece orchestra and firework display were unveiled after she said 'yes'.

And tomorrow's event will be no less extravagant.

The A-list guest list is said to include Rapper Jay Z as Kanye West's best men, his wife Beyoncé, and singer Lana del Rey.

The thousands of guests were seen arriving at the Palace of Versailles this evening for the pre-wedding party after a brunch at Valentino's Paris home

Men dressed as Muskateers were also seen making their way into the event, which rapper Jay Z, his wife Beyoncé and singer Lana del Rey are expected to attend

Today construction workers at the palace were pictured setting up the venue, which was closed to the public, before thousands of celebrities arrived

This was one of many trucks seen delivering fresh flowers, furniture and art works to the palace as ordered by Kanye West, who is said to have designed the event

Today, the party enjoyed a wedding brunch at a magnificent French home west of Paris once owned by King Louis XIV.

Kim and Kanye left their residence at the Four Seasons George V hotel in the first of three outfits selected for today.

Chateau de Wideville, now the home of celebrated fashion designer Valentino Garavani, was surrounded by security officials this morning as fans of the celebrity couple surrounded the walls.

Convoys of black Ferraris and people carriers were then seen transporting the group back to the capital for tonight's party at the palace.

Describing the weekend as a 'discreet' affair, Kim and Kanye will not sell their 
wedding pictures, despite receiving offers of up to $1million, 
preferring to keep the big day private.

While Kanye West takes charge of 
managing the events, Kim Kardashian has been in Paris with her four 
sisters, mother, and eleven-month-old baby North since Wednesday for 
pre-wedding brunches and final dress fittings.

On Thursday night, Kim celebrated her bachelorette do with her friends at the Eiffel tower in Paris and was said to have been sent 15 bottle of champagne for the occasion.

With the iconic landmark lit up behind her and her pals, Kim posted a photo in the photo-sharing site Instagram with the message: 'Night out in Paireeeeee.'

She has since been 'banned' from using her phone or the internet by groom-to-be Kanye, who plans to keep the details of their wedding a surprise, reports claim.
