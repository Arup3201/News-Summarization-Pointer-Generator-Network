An art installation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been temporarily shut down by authorities after three visitors have had seizure-like symptoms.

An 18-year-old woman was treated at the scene on Sunday after visiting the room-sized exhibition, Zee, by Austrian artist Kurt Hentschlager.

Patrons must sign a waiver before 
entering the exhibition that is described as ‘intense stroboscopic light
in combination with thick artificial fog, resulting in a loss of 
spatial orientation’.

According to the artist's website, the audience wanders freely in a space 
filled with extremely dense fog that fully obscures all of its 
boundaries.

Stroboscopic- and pulse lights illuminate the fog, in a 
'softened and evenly dispersed manner', creating kaleidoscopic 
three-dimensional structures in constant animation.

An ambient and 
minimal sound-scape connects to the imagery, without directly 
synchronising to it.

The core visual impression of Zee, according to the website, is of a 
psychedelic architecture of pure light, an abstract luminescent 
landscape enveloping the visitor. Time appears to stand still.

with photosensitive epilepsy, breathing or heart problems, migraines, 
claustrophobia or anxiety are warned not to go inside.

The current condition of the 18-year-old is not known, and it is not clear what kind of seizure-like symptoms she experienced.

However, the most common symptoms are seen in the grand-mal seizure, in which a person loses consciousness and usually collapses.

The loss of consciousness is followed by generalised body stiffening, then by violent jerking, after which the person goes into a deep sleep.

During grand-mal seizures, injuries and accidents may occur, such as tongue biting and urinary incontinence.

District EMS Chief, Paul Sabol, said the 18-year-old was the third person to report feeling ill since 
the exhibition opened on Friday, according to Fox News.

Sabol said the exhibit at the 943 Gallery in downtown Pittsburgh will be temporarily closed and changes would be made before it reopens.

The
installation has appeared in other venues in the city previously. It is
currently being shown as part of the  Pittsburgh International Festival
of Firsts and is meant to continue through October 27.

Zee had its New York premiere in October 2009 at the 3LD Art & Technology Center.

According to Pittsburgh Cultural Trust spokeswoman Shaunda Miles, some patrons reported seizures in those places as well.

Visitors to the exhibition have had mixed feelings, according to interviews on Henstchlager's website.

One
man said: 'That was the most insane thing I have ever been a part of', 
while another said at first it was 'extremely uncomfortable. I really 
wanted out'.

Words like 'anxiety' and 'almost scary' are used to describe the emotions the installation gives people.

Another visitor said: 'You don't even know where you are, you lose your sense of space, time and motion.'

'It
did feel a bit like death. if you don't have a body, is this what your 
existence is like?' said another person who went to the exhibition.

The Chicago-based Hentschläger, who could not be reached for a comment, is known for his audiovisual performances and installations.

He began to exhibit his work in 1983, and since has been working predominantly with time-based media, light and sound.

His work reflects on the metaphor of the sublime and the human condition in the 21st century, while his current work continues to investigate human perception and the impact of new technologies on both individual and collective consciousness.
