California saw one of the worst droughts in history but Yosemite National Park's waterfalls are back adding a droplet of hope in the dry state.

Following powerful storms in December the Yosemite Falls are back after having dried up in June and failing to flow again in November like they have in the past.

Two major storms that moved through California revived the Yosemite Falls along with the Bridevall Fall and the Cascarde Fall, reports The Huffington Post.

Park employee Ryan Sheridan told The Los Angeles Times that when he first saw water flowing off the rocks he was skeptical that the falls had actually returned.

'One day later, Yosemite Falls came back. I was riding my bike to work and I just stopped and kept looking,' Ryan Sheridan, an employee at one of the park’s restaurants, said

'It's hard to miss. It's the essence of pure power.'

Yosemite Falls is the parks most famous waterfall and is one of the tallest in North America.

There are three separate waterfalls that drop a total of 2,425 feet.

'Hopefully we get a lot of snow and the falls come back with a vengeance,' continued Sheridan.

'I don't think it means the drought is over or that the climate isn't changing, but it's comforting to see a natural process greater than anything we can control.'

Despite the waterfalls return, this month's rain isn't doing much to improve the drought afflicting the state.

State Officials said on December 12 that consistent rains will be necessary to water California which is in its fourth year of drought.

As a consequence of the drought, California saw some of its most violent wildfires including the Rim Fire of 21013, the worst fire in Sierra Nevada history.

There was also a huge fire in September that forced officials to airlift 100 hikers from Half Dome in the Yosemite National Park.

Park Employee Lucy Garces, 27, said that she found the sound of the falls comforting after an especially dry summer.

'I was a little terrified this summer. There were fires all around. Every time, they said it depended on which way the wind blew if there was going to be fire in the valley,' she said.

‘Now there are waterfalls surrounding us again.’
