A U.S teacher working at a private French school in China has been arrested on suspicion of abusing at least seven pupils.

Officials from the fee-paying school told AFP that a second teacher, who is also American, was extradited back to the U.S. after similar accusations were made.

Parents contacted Chinese police last month and the kindergarten teacher at the Lycee Francais de Shanghai was then arrested.

Some suspect their children have been abused for up to five years, according to reports.

The formal accusations against him include sexual abuse and rape of children of both sexes.

One mother, who did not want to be named to protect her daughter, feared her child had been abused for months.

She said: 'We are living a nightmare'.

Parents said they were 'devastated' at the allegations.

The school's management said the parents of the victims came forward to lodge complaints.

In a statement, the school told AFP: 'The investigation is being carried out by
the Chinese police and is ongoing. The teacher has been in 
administrative detention since his arrest.'

One mother said her daughter showed signs of stress, which she believes was caused by the abuse, since they arrived in China.

However, she initially put it down to the trauma of the move.

She said: 'My daughter was having nervous breakdowns, she was scratching herself on her face and thighs.'

A notice was released to parents referring to the allegations as 'sexual abuse' but it did not elaborate when contacted by AFP.

The second American teacher, who is a friend of the other suspect, was extradited to the U.S. in December 2012.

The school told parents in an email that the man, who worked at both the French school and a neighbouring German school, that he was removed from China after an investigation 'into sexual touching and violence against minors.'

The school has 1,600 students, aged three to 18, and is part of a private institution contracted with the Agency for French Teaching Abroad, a government body.
