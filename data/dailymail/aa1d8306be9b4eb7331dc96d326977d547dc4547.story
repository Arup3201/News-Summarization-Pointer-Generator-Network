One of Britain’s most famous rock stars is embroiled in a desperate battle to prevent his wife learning that he has secretly fathered a daughter during a one-night stand.

The musician – a member of a hugely successful band – cannot be named for legal reasons.

He has apparently been told by the girl’s mother that she wants a £2million payout and substantial child support until their baby daughter turns 18. He has been warned: ‘Pay up or I’ll tell your wife.’

The singer is desperate to keep news 
of the child hidden and, although he has rejected the mother’s financial
demands so far, he is understood to be spending thousands of pounds on 
lawyers as he negotiates with her to keep it quiet.

The musician has a family with his wife and has hitherto been known as a responsible father.

A source told the Sun: ‘You do not 
treat his wife like this and that is why he is doing everything in his 
power to  stop this coming out. The reality is, the truth will emerge. 
And my God will there be fireworks.’

The star is willing to negotiate with the mother to keep his wife in the dark

The woman with whom the star had a 
fling is reported to be a successful writer. She was tracked down in New
York where she said: ‘I shouldn’t even be speaking to you. I can’t say 
anything.’

She is believed to be considering 
tests to prove her claim and had a mobile DNA testing van parked outside
her Manhattan apartment a few days ago.

Her friend said: ‘She knows she will 
be entitled to a big sum. She was successful before they met but this 
payout would set her up for life. This man will do anything to keep 
under wraps. He wants nothing to do with the kid and is prepared to pay 
big bucks to keep this a secret.

He knows his wife will throw him out 
and he will lose so much money he simply can’t bear to contemplate 
honesty as an option. There has not been a DNA test but it is an option 
the mother is considering.

‘It was a one-night stand and 
according to him a huge mistake. But she won’t go away and the fact of 
the matter is she bore his little girl.’

According to the Sun, the brief 
liaison between the musician and the woman happened in New York more 
than a year ago. After discovering she was pregnant, the writer 
contacted the singer.

He denied the child could possibly be
his, broke off contact and instructed lawyers. The woman then hired her
own lawyers to negotiate a deal.
