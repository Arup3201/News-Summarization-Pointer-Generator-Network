A grieving dental nurse who piled on the pounds grieving the loss of her best friend has shed more than four stone to turn herself into a muscle-bound beauty queen.

Sarah Jayne Maher, 26, from Denton, Greater Manchester, ballooned to 13 stone 12lbs and suffered severe depression after the loss of her best friend Simone Hill in a car crash in January 2011.

But after seeing a picture of herself looking overweight on a night out with friends, the 5ft 3in blonde shed the pounds and bulked up into a body-building beauty queen.

And she is set to compete as Miss Manchester in the Miss Galaxy UK pageant on February 8.

Sarah was left severely depressed after the death of Simone, who was tragically killed in a car crash in Reddish, Greater Manchester, while travelling to meet up on her 18th birthday.

The horse-mad pair had always been active as they groomed and cared for Sarah's first horse, Rusty, after he was given to her as an eighth birthday present.

Sarah said: 'I was athletic as a kid and I was always with my horses and Simone, competing in horse shows three times a month. 

Sarah was inspired to go into body building after a chance meeting with female weight-lifter Kizzy Vaines

'But once she died, I just wanted to get rid of any reminder of her. The memories were just too painful.

'I realise now that it was a mistake. I even had to give my horse, George, to a friend to look after for me.

'I was so depressed. I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to do anything. All I did was stay in and eat.'

Sarah binged on takeaways every night and scoffed crisps and chocolate for 18 months.

But after seeing a picture of herself on a rare night out in York, she vowed to turn her life around and hit the weights.

Before the tragic death of her friend Sarah lead an active lifestyle but says that grieving kept her housebound

Sarah swapped her diet of greasy takeaways and took on a seven days-a-week training schedule 

Sarah attended the Body Power Expo at the NEC in Birmingham where a chance meeting with professional body builder Kizzy Vaines inspired her to sculpt her eight-stone frame.

Sarah said: 'I saw the picture and I couldn't believe that was me. I just couldn't recognise myself.

'I just could not believe what I had done to myself.

'Meeting Kizzy changed my life. Without her, I would have just been another overweight person aimlessly jogging on a treadmill.'

Sarah embarked on a seven-days-a-week training schedule, ditched fatty foods and takes on a rigorous 45-minute cardio regime to get into shape for competitions.

She debuted at the North Wales Open in 2013 and stunned judges, grabbing second prize.

Sarah said: 'I was really pleased with how I did at my first competition.

'When you have gone from being huge to finishing second in a pageants it's like "is this really happening?".'

Sarah, who works as a dental nurse, has dreams of turning professional after her Miss Galaxy appearance with several more pageants pencilled in for the rest of the year.

She said: 'I would love to turn pro. I don't do this for the medals, I do it because it makes me feel great and I am really interested in the athletic side of it.

'The last time I competed I was in the best shape of my life and I just want to carry it on.

'And my family and friends are all really proud of me. My mum was initially against it because she was worried that I would become one of the really muscly body builders with no neck!

'But when I first competed there wasn't a prouder person in the room.'
