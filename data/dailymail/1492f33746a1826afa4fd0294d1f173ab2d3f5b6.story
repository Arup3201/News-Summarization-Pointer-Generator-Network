John Terry admits there have been no talks yet about extending his Chelsea contract beyond the end of the season.

At 34, Terry is aware time is running out for him at the top level and wants to squeeze every drop from a campaign chasing three major trophies.

He hopes to sign for another year under Jose Mourinho and is unconcerned that negotiations have not opened because he accepts the priority for Chelsea was to secure the long-term future of Eden Hazard.

‘The club know my position,’ said Terry. ‘Hopefully, I know theirs and it will get done. No talks have happened yet between myself and the club but we both respect the position.

‘There’s more important players. Hazard’s one. For me, that was the most important for the club. Without anyone telling me that, I knew that was the first priority for them. Hopefully they’ll be knocking on the door soon.’

Hazard, 24, signed a five-and-a-half-year deal last week, making him the top earner at Stamford Bridge and keeping him from the clutches of Real Madrid, at least for now.

The policy at Chelsea for players over 30 is to limit extensions to one year. Terry could secure a longer deal elsewhere and his contractual situation means he is free to talk to foreign clubs about a move.

He could sign a pre-contract leading to a free transfer at the end of the season. But he is comfortable with Chelsea’s stance, having been through the same process last year, when he was linked with moves to Galatasaray and Monaco. And Mourinho has spoken in public to confirm he wants to keep his captain.

‘The first year, I was maybe a bit nervous and hoping and knocking on the door myself,’ said Terry. ‘But we had a good chat. I know their position and they know mine. I want to stay and hopefully my performances are showing that and they want to keep me.

‘I’ll be happy with one more year and then we’ll see how we go year by year. I’ve not got much choice.’

Terry  has spent his entire career at Chelsea and has been restored as the defensive bedrock of the team since Mourinho returned to west London.

There is pressure from emerging players such as Kurt Zouma, but the captain promises to be one of the last survivors from his generation at the top of the English game.

Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard plan to leave for the USA in May, Ashley Cole is in Italy and Rio Ferdinand has been unable to hold a regular place at QPR.

‘The way players like me, Stevie, Rio, Lamps, those kinds of player, have looked after ourselves in the last five or six years has helped us in our later careers, for sure,’ said Terry. ‘They’re a couple of years older than me.

‘It’s difficult when you see young boys come in like Kurt. He’s been a revelation since he came in. He’s young, fit, strong and hungry and it makes it even more difficult. We all want to play every game. Gaz (Gary Cahill) and Kurt have been fighting it out and it could be me (who’s dropped) any time.

‘It’s important to remain top of the league and everyone gets their game time. When Gaz plays he’s been great, when Kurt plays he’s been great, so it’s hard but we’re all rotating and there are enough games to share around.

‘I don’t want to rest. I’m coming to the end of my career, so it’s important I stay fit and play as much as I can.’

Terry also described young defender Kurt Zouma's impact on the team this season as a 'revelation'
