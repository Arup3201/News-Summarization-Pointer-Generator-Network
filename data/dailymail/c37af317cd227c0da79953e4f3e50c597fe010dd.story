Manchester United youngster Andreas Pereira offered a student £10,000 for a threesome with him and Old Trafford team-mate Paddy McNair, it was reported on Thursday.

The Belgian-born Brazilian, who made his Barclays Premier League debut on Sunday against Tottenham, allegedly offered 19-year-old Kelly McKinney cash to spend the night with him and McNair after she met the United squad at their Christmas party.

Pereira is also said to have invited Kelly to his home for sex days before his Premier League debut, mentioning that he was with two other members of the first-team squad.

McNair is not suggested to have been involved in or aware of the sending of Pereira's messages.

Kelly told The Sun: 'I nearly fell off my chair when he offered me £10,000 for a threesome. What kind of low-life does that? I'm not that kind of person at all and found it very, very insulting.

'He's clearly desperate and struggling to find anyone that he doesn't have to pay for a sex.' 

Kelly claims that Pereira tracked her down on Twitter after the team's Christmas party at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester where she was invited to the VIP area to drink with the other players.

In a series of WhatsApp messages, the midfielder allegedly asked if she wanted to meet with him and McNair  before she responded questioning what he meant.

The Belgian-born Brazilian messaged Kelly after meeting her at United's Christmas party in Manchester, saying 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each'

Pereira is said to have replied: 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each.'

It remains to be seen whether Louis van Gaal will punish Pereira for his behaviour, with the starlet having embarrassed his manager in a week when he has been full of praise for the 19-year-old's class on the field.

'When you are 19 and already in the squad of Manchester United, then you must have a big talent otherwise you would not be in there,' Van Gaal said. 'I am very happy that I could give him his Premier League debut.'

Pereira's agent Leo Scheinkman said: 'He is young and single and can have sex with whoever he wants. What does he have to apologise for?'

Pereira is yet to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, with his current deal expiring in the summer and top clubs from around Europe ready to swoop.

Juventus, who took former United youngster Paul Pogba on a free transfer from United in 2012, are said to be interested with French champions Paris Saint-Germain also keen.
