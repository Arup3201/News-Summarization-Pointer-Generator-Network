A spring spending spree helped British stores achieve their best month of sales growth for a  decade, figures revealed yesterday.

Retail sales rose 1.3 per cent last month as the Easter break and supermarket price war persuaded shoppers to splash out, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The increase left sales 6.9 per cent higher than April last year – the biggest annual jump since May 2004. Mortgage lending was also on the rise as the housing market continued its dramatic recovery.

April this year saw the biggest increase in sales for more than a decade, raising hopes that the economy had finally turned a corner for good but also increasing the concern that the recovery was based on household debt

The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned that the economic recovery is not sustainable at the moment because it is too reliant on consumer spending

Analysts said it put the UK economy on
 course for another strong quarter following growth of 0.8 per cent in 
the first three months of the year.

The
 Bank of England welcomed signs that ‘the recovery has become less 
fragile’ and said the economy may be even stronger than so far reported.

‘According
 to present estimates, output had grown at a little above its historical
 average for each of the past four quarters,’ a spokesman said.

‘But
 it was possible that, after the usual cycle of data revisions, output 
would ultimately prove to have been growing at an even faster rate.’

Experts
 believe the economy has finally returned to its pre-recession peak, 
having crashed by 7.2 per cent under the last Labour government during 
the ‘Great Recession’ of 2008-09.

Marks and Spencer chief Marc Bolland this week revealed the High Street giant had suffered its third year in a row of falling profits. But the rest of the retail sector appears to be booming

Household spending has driven the 
turnaround over the past  12 months, but manufacturing and business 
investment are also growing.

The
 surge in spending last month – in part driven by Easter – came as the 
squeeze on family finances eased thanks to low inflation and higher 
wages. Food sales were 6.3 per cent higher than a year earlier – the 
best performance since January 2002 – as supermarkets cut prices in a 
bid to lure shoppers away from their rivals.

Dr
 Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at research group IHS 
Global Insight, hailed the ‘mightily impressive’ figures, saying: ‘This 
bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter.’

The
 Council of Mortgage Lenders said £16.6billion of home loans were made 
last month, up 8 per cent on March and 36 per cent on a year ago. It was
 the best April since the financial crisis in 2008.

A
 separate report, by research group Markit, showed job security is now 
at its highest level since it started taking records in February 2009.

People
 are also more confident about their future finances than they have been
 at any time over the past five years, according to the study.

Tim
 Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: ‘The latest survey highlights 
that improving labour market conditions and relatively subdued increases
 in living costs are delivering an appreciable overall boost to 
household finances.

Households remain upbeat about their financial prospects for the next 12 months, supported by another drop in job insecurities.’

Business
 leaders welcomed the sales figures but warned the recovery was far from
 secure. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of 
Commerce, said: ‘Retail sales volumes are expanding at their strongest 
pace since 2004.

This is good news, and supports our belief that the UK economy saw continued growth in the second quarter of this year.

‘However,
 the UK recovery still needs to become more balanced. Although consumer 
spending should remain an important part of overall growth, exports and 
investment should make a greater contribution or there is a chance the 
recovery could stall.’
