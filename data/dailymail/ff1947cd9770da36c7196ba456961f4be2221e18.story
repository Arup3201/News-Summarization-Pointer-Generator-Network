Prison: Robert McLaughlin, 52, has been jailed for 16 weeks after being caught behind the wheel five times over the limit and dressed as a WPC

A drink driver found slumped behind  the wheel while dressed in a female police officer's uniform has been jailed.

Robert McLaughlin, 52, was five times the drink-drive limit when he was discovered at the wheel of a car wearing a  female police top, black trousers and boots, a court heard.

He also had a communication earpiece in, with the wire going into  his collar, and a police helmet that belonged to his stepson on the passenger  seat.

His solicitor told the court he had been in a relationship with the owner of  the uniform and they would 'occasionally dress up' in her gear.

Wakefield magistrates heard a cyclist was nearly knocked down by a car that was trying to  avoid the McLaughlin's Citroen, which was parked diagonally across the road.

The cyclist went to confront McLaughlin and found he was 'slumped and  appeared to be wearing a police uniform'.

Richard Ogden, prosecuting, said the cyclist described unemployed McLaughlin as 'seeming out of it' and 'totally  and utterly confused' when he spotted him on the road in Ackworth, West Yorkshire,  around 1.50pm on May 28.

Believing the drink-driver to be a police officer who 'may have had a stroke', the cyclist called  an ambulance.

A roadside breath test then revealed that McLaughlin was five times over the drink driver limit.

He was arrested, and then taken to hospital due to the high amounts of alcohol  in his system. A blood test showed he had 366mgs of alcohol in 100mls of blood. The  legal limit is 80mgs.

Mr Ogden revealed the articles of uniform belonged  to a female constable with a debilitating medical complaint, who McLaughlin  befriended and helped out around the house. Eventually she gave him a key.

'The officer whose items they were said she was extremely distressed to find  these items had gone missing,' said Mr Ogden.Â 

Ban: Wakefield magistrates jailed McLaughlin for 16 weeks and banned him from driving for four years

The fleece McLaughlin, of Wakefield, was caught wearing displayed the officer  in question's details. Since the incident she has changed her name, the court  heard.

His stepson is also a police officer and the court was told that the helmet  found in the seat was an old one he had damaged in training.

Mr Ogden said a further nine items of police issue equipment and clothing were  found when they searched McLaughlin's home.

Ruth Gill, mitigating, told the court that rather than just be befriending the  officer, McLaughlin had been in a relationship with her for 18 months.

Mrs Gill said: 'During that time they used to occasionally dress up in the  police stuff that was subsequently found.'

At an earlier hearing, McLaughlin admitted drinking and driving and being in  possession of a police uniform while not being a member of a police force or a  special constable.

Due to the high level of alcohol in his system McLaughlin was jailed for 16  weeks and banned from driving for four years.
