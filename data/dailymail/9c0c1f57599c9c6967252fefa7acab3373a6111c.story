Facing bankruptcy, the U.S. Postal Service is pushing ahead with unprecedented cuts to first-class mail next spring that will slow delivery and, for the first time in 40 years, eliminate the chance for stamped letters to arrive the next day.

The estimated $3billion in reductions, to be announced in broader detail on Monday, are part of a wide-ranging effort by the cash-strapped Postal Service to quickly trim costs, seeing no immediate help from Congress.

The changes would provide short-term relief, but ultimately could prove counterproductive, pushing more of America's business onto the Internet.

They could slow everything from check payments to Netflix's DVDs-by-mail, add costs to mail-order prescription drugs, and threaten the existence of newspapers and time-sensitive magazines delivered by postal carrier to far-flung suburban and rural communities.

That birthday card mailed first-class to Mom also could arrive a day or two late, if people don't plan ahead.

'It's a potentially major change, but I don't think consumers are focused on it and it won't register until the service goes away,' said Jim Corridore, analyst with S&P Capital IQ, who tracks the shipping industry. 'Over time, to the extent the customer service experience gets worse, it will only increase the shift away from mail to alternatives.'

The cuts, now being finalized, would close roughly 250 of the nearly 500 mail processing centres across the country as early as next March.

Because the consolidations typically would lengthen the distance mail travels from post office to processing centre, the agency also would lower delivery standards for first-class mail that have been in place since 1971.

Currently, first-class mail is supposed to be delivered to homes and businesses within the continental U.S. in one day to three days.

That will lengthen to two days to three days, meaning mailers no longer could expect next-day delivery in surrounding communities. Periodicals could take between two days and nine days.

About 42 per cent of first-class mail is now delivered the following day. An additional 27 per cent arrives in two days, about 31 per cent in three days and less than 1 per cent in four days to five days.

Following the change next spring, about 
51 per cent of all first-class mail is expected to arrive in two days, 
with most of the remainder delivered in three days.

'The things I have control over here at 
the Postal Service, we have to do. If we do nothing, we will have a death 
spiral.'

-Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe

The consolidation of mail processing centres is in addition to the planned closing of about 3,700 local post offices.

In all, roughly 100,000 postal employees could be cut as a result of the various closures, resulting in savings of up to $6.5billion a year.

Expressing urgency to reduce costs, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in an interview that the agency has to act while waiting for Congress to grant it authority to reduce delivery to five days a week, raise stamp prices and reduce health care and other labour costs.

The Postal Service, an independent agency of government, does not receive tax money, but is subject to congressional control on large aspects of its operations.

The changes in first-class mail delivery can go into place without permission from Congress.

After five years in the red, the post office faces imminent default this month on a $5.5billion annual payment to the Treasury for retiree health benefits.

It is projected to have a record loss of $14.1billion next year amid steady declines in first-class mail volume. Mr Donahoe has said the agency must make cuts of $20 billion by 2015 to be profitable.

It already has announced a 1-cent increase in first-class mail to 45 cents beginning January 22.

'We have a business model that is failing. You can't continue to run red ink and not make changes,' Mr Donahoe said.

'We know our business, and we listen to our customers. Customers are looking for affordable and consistent mail service, and they do not want us to take tax money.'

Separate bills that have passed House and Senate committees would give the Postal Service more authority and liquidity to stave off immediate bankruptcy.

But prospects are somewhat dim for final congressional action on those bills anytime soon, especially if the measures are seen in an election year as promoting layoffs and cuts to neighbourhood post offices.

Technically, the Postal Service must await an advisory opinion from the independent Postal Regulatory Commission before it can begin closing local post offices and processing centres. But such opinions are nonbinding, and Mr Donahoe is making clear the agency will proceed with reductions once the opinion is released next March.

'The things I have control over here at the Postal Service, we have to do,' he said, describing the cuts as a necessary business decision. 'If we do nothing, we will have a death spiral.'

The Postal Service initially announced in September it was studying the possibility of closing the processing centres and published a notice in the Federal Register seeking comments. Within 30 days, the plan elicited nearly 4,400 public comments, mostly in opposition.

Among them:

Maine Senator Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate committee that oversees the post office, believes the agency is taking the wrong approach. She says service cuts will only push more consumers to online bill payment or private carriers such as UPS or FedEx, leading to lower revenue in the future.

'Time and time again in the face of more red ink, the Postal Service puts forward ideas that could well accelerate its death spiral,' she said, urging passage of a bill that would refund nearly $7billion the Postal Service overpaid into a federal retirement fund, encourage a restructuring of health benefits and reduce the agency's annual payments into a retiree health account.

That measure would postpone a move to five-day-a-week mail delivery for at least two years and require additional layers of review before the agency closed postal branches and mail processing centres.

'The solution to the Postal Service's financial crisis is not easy but must involve tackling more significant expenses that do not drive customers,' Miss Collins said.

In the event of a shutdown due to bankruptcy, private companies such as FedEx and UPS could handle a small portion of the material the post office moves, but they do not go everywhere.

No business has shown interest in delivering letters everywhere in the country for a set rate of 44 cents or 45 cents for a first-class letter.

Small-town mayors and legislators in states including Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania cited the economic harm if postal offices were to close, eliminating jobs and reducing service. Small-business owners in many other states also were worried.

ESPN The Magazine and Crain Communications, which prints some 27 trade and consumer publications, said delays to first-class delivery could ruin the value of their news. Their magazines are typically printed at week's end with mail arrival timed for weekend sports events or the Monday start of the work week. Newspapers, already struggling in the Internet age, also could suffer.

AT&T, which mails approximately 55million customer billing statements each month, wants assurances that the Postal Service will widely publicize and educate the public about changes to avoid confusion over delivery that might lead to delinquent payments. The company is also concerned that after extensive cuts the Postal Service might realize it cannot meet a relaxed standard of two-to-three day delivery.

Netflix, which offers monthly pricing plans for unlimited DVDs by mail, sent one disc or two at a time. Longer delivery times would mean fewer opportunities to receive discs each month, effectively a price increase. Netflix in recent months has been vigorously promoting its video streaming service as an alternative.
