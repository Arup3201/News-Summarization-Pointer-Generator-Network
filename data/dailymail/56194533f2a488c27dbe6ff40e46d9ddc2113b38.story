Police in Mexico have found the bodies of six people - one of who had been decapitated - at a house in a poor neighborhood of the resort city of Cancun.

The director of the Quintana Roo state detective agency says the victims' hands, heads and feet had been tied up with packing tape, and they were apparently asphyxiated.

The bodies, five men and two women, had been left on a patio of a house located some distance from the city's tourist zone.

Arturo Olivares Mendiola says the bodies were found on Sunday.

Neighbors told police there had been strange coming and goings at the house, suggesting it may have been used to sell drugs.

Cancun has so far largely been spared the drug violence plaguing many other cities in Mexico.

Last month six people died and five were injured after two men opened fire in a bar on the outskirts of Cancun.

The same day police in Cancun found the body of another man who had been bound and gagged and wrapped in sheets, according to ABC News.

Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto has vowed to end the endemic violence which has become a feature of life in the country.

His predecessor as president, Felipe Calderon, had launched an attack on drug cartels which are thought to be behind many of the killings.

Tens of thousands of people have died in drugs-related violence in Mexico during the past six years.
