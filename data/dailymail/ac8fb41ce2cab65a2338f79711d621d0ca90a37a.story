Quit? Sally Bercow named a teenager who allegedly ran away with a teacher and her Twitter account has now gone

Sally Bercow today finally deleted her Twitter account - after revealing  she had her 'a**-whipped' by her lawyer and husband over her latest legal blunder.

The most recent high-profile error was naming a British runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order - with her her final tweet revealing the intervention from a lawyer and the Speaker of the Commons.

The breach prompted calls for her to 'turn off Twitter' to avoid any more legal problems.

It also appears her account may have been hijacked overnight, as at 2.21am a tweet in broken English appeared under her name calling her a 'stupid woman'.

Naming the teenager means Mrs Bercow could face a £5,000 fine for contempt of court after breaching the order which bans revealing the identity of the girl who allegedly ran away with her teacher to France this year.

Sussex Police would not confirm if they had received complaints about her tweet, but told MailOnline they 'will actively investigate potential criminal breaches of these restrictions'.

And her exit from Twitter comes just a fortnight after she used the site to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine following a BBC2 Newsnight report which alleged a senior Conservative figure from the Thatcher era was a child abuser.

He was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online. It later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity.

Lord McAlpine, who settled with the BBC for £185,000, is now suing Mrs Bercow, although she insists that what she said on Twitter was ‘mischievous’ rather than ‘libellous’.

Her latest blunder happened on Sunday, when she named the teenage girl on Twitter.

This tweet has since been deleted. She then wrote another message to her 59,000 followers, saying she had been discussing the matter with a friend.

She had been referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a 30-year-old teacher in Eastbourne, East Sussex, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September and returned to Britain.

Final tweet: In a message to her thousands of followers Mrs Bercow revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back

Hacked?: This curious tweet appeared under her name calling her a 'stupid woman' and saying she had a soft password

He was charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing last week.

The court made a Section 39 Order under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, banning the naming of the teenager.

The order states: ‘Any publication by whatever media in breach of this order is punishable by a fine in the sum of £5,000.’

Reference: The Labour activist was referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a teacher in Eastbourne, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September. He is pictured in October getting on a plane to return to Britain 

Legal action: Her gaffe comes just a fortnight after she used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine, following a Newsnight report which alleged a senior Tory figure was a child abuser

Legal experts say using a social networking site such as Twitter to comment does constitute publication, meaning Mrs Bercow, a Labour activist, could face a fine.

Sarah Webb, a media lawyer with the firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: ‘The contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster. I would advise her to be very cautious.

‘I  would certainly urge her to turn off her Twitter account at the moment.

Angry: Sally Bercow was sent a letter from solicitors acting for Lord McAlpine (pictured in April 1998)

‘She may not know the law, but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that, you can’t go around naming them. I think it is surprising that none of these things seem to cross her radar.

Mrs Bercow’s agent was  contacted last night but did  not reply.

Last Thursday, Mrs Bercow received a 
letter from solicitors acting for Lord McAlpine, who are examining 1,000
tweets  that they believe defame the 70-year-old peer.

It said legal action will be  taken 
against for her remarks on Twitter which allegedly linked him with child
abuse. She had tweeted: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent 
face*’.

Over the weekend, Mrs Bercow  used 
Twitter to argue that she was being unfairly targeted  by Lord McAlpine 
because she was high profile and a Labour supporter.

‘This is totally politically motivated, I tell you,’ she wrote.

‘And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’

In another tweet, she declared: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire. Lord McA falsely accused but not by me.’
