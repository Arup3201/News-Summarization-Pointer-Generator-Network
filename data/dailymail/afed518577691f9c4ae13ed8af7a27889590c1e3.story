Jackie Powell has denied the allegations surrounding her departure from a mental health charity earlier this year

The confidante of Moors murderer Ian Brady quit her job at a respected charity following allegations she posed as a nurse to obtain prescription drugs for her partner.

Jackie Powell, who has acted as a mental health advocate for Brady since 1999, is at the centre of controversy after being arrested over claims she had a letter written by Brady in her possession that could identify the location of his victim Keith Bennett, whose body has never been found.

Now it has emerged Ms Powell, 49, was suspended by mental health charity Eiriol, based in South Wales, last year and was subject to a disciplinary hearing into her ‘inappropriate conduct’. She left Eiriol in January.

Paul Betteridge, who until recently was chair of trustees at Eiriol, said Ms Powell was investigated by the charity over allegations she posed as a community psychiatric nurse at a GP practice in a bid to persuade doctors to give her drugs for her partner.

He said the charity was also informed of allegations that she pretended to be a nurse at a police station where her partner was in custody, to persuade officers to allow her to visit him.

Mr Betteridge said: ‘I heard that she [Powell] had acted inappropriately and that she was suspended with a view to the investigation.

'There had been a couple of complaints about her.’

Asked if Ms Powell had visited a GP to try to obtain drugs, Mr Betteridge said: ‘From two GPs, in fact. One in Swansea and one in Birmingham.’

Ms Powell, a human rights and criminology graduate, had worked at Eiriol as a mental health advocate since 2007.

The role involves helping people with mental-health issues to defend their rights and express their views.

Ms Powell was arrested two weeks ago on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath, which was screened last week.

On camera, Ms Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would ‘allow [Keith’s mother] Winnie Johnson to find peace’.

She speculated that the contents might reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

Channel 4 sources said producers urged Ms Powell to hand her letter to the police, but she went ‘off radar’ for a few days.

When she made contact again, she told them she had returned the letter to Brady, 74, at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside.

Documentary producer Paddy Wivell contacted the police, who raided Ms Powell’s home in Llangennech, near Llanelli.

Mrs Johnson died last weekend after dedicating her life to finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her son, who vanished in 1964.

Lynn Howells, manager at Eiriol, said: ‘All I’m allowed to tell you is as of January this year she [Powell] was no longer working for Eiriol.’

A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said the force was unable to comment. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police, which is investigating Ms Powell over the letter, said officers were not aware of the allegations.

Last night, Ms Powell denied there was any truth to the allegations but refused to comment further.
