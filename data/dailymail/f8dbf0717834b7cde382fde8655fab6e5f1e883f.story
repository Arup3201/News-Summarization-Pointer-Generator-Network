Four missing young boys who were the subject of an Amber Alert issued by California Highway Patrol Wednesday night were rescued following a tense standoff with the children's father.

The dramatic arrest capped three days of intense search efforts to locate Daniel and Erica Perez, of Montebello, California, and their four sons, ages 6 to 11.

On an elevated overpass near the San Diego suburb of Santee, officers used two armored trucks to surround the vehicle. 

Daniel Perez, 43, from Montebello, was taken into custody nearly two hours after his 2014 black Toyota Camry was spotted at around 8.30am in a San Diego suburb.

The hunt for Perez was prompted by the discovery of a dead woman in the trunk of a Honda Accord belonging to Perez and his wife, Erica, about a half-mile from their home Wednesday.

The family had not been heard from since Friday, and neither spouse had been answering their phone.

Relatives told police the couple's marriage was unstable and that there was a history of domestic violence.

As of Thursday afternoon, the body of the woman in the trunk has not been positively identified as Mrs Perez. An official with the Los Angeles County coroner's office said no details could be released because the case is on a security hold by Montebello police.

CHP officers had spent the night searching for Daniel Perez until a LoJack system installed in his Toyota led them to the wanted man in El Cajon at 8.30am, according to CBS Los Angeles. 

Officers made an attempt to pull him over, but Perez fled.

He finally came to a stop on eastbound State Route 52 in Santee at around 9am, but remained in the car for the next 50 minutes.

During the standoff, Perez released two of his sons, who were seen running from the vehicle towards awaiting police officers. 

Perez, dressed in a blue sweatshirt, came out of the car and moved towards the edge of the freeway ramp railing, dangerously close to the roughly 200-foot drop-off

SWAT offices rushed to Perez and tackled him when he made an apparent attempt to jump off the overpass

He continued to hold his other children hostage inside the vehicle until about 10am, when the father and sons finally emerged from the car in the middle of the freeway.

Perez came out of his car, clutching one child while another walked behind. He walked toward the edge of the freeway ramp railing, dangerously close to the roughly 200-foot drop-off, California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Pearlstein said.

'Immediately, when he stopped there, that's what we all said, "You just don't stop right here unless you're thinking of jumping,"' Pearlstein said.

Officers shot Perez with a nonlethal bean bag and then tackled him.

All four children, identified child as Jordan, 11, Jaiden, 9, Tristin, 8 and Alex, 6, were rescued and not physically harmed, officers said. 

In a tearful press conference Wednesday night, relatives begged for the children to be brought back.

'You're breaking our heart,' Pamela Valdez, the children's aunt, said. 'Please don't hurt the kids, please.'
