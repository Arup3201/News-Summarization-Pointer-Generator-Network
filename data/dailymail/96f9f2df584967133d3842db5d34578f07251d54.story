From peacock blue Manolo Blahnik spikes to towering Sergio Rossi, the stars of Sex and the City were as famous for their footwear and they were for their exploits in and out of bed.

Now, Kristin Davis, the actress who played conservative Charlotte, has spoken out against the cult of the high heel and has apologised to fans for encouraging them to squeeze their feet into uncomfortable shoes.

But her confession isn't entirely out of character: with flats now the stylish shoe of choice, Davis seems as fashion-savvy as ever.

'I do feel guilt about the heels,' said the 49-year-old star. 'It did seem we were trying to say to women, "You should be wearing heels like these".

Speaking in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Davis added: 'But we definitely weren’t. Were they beautiful shoes? Yes. Were they appropriate for the characters? Yes, that’s what women like that wear.

'But it became a bigger picture thing, where it seemed women should be wearing them every day.'

Although her stance might come as a shock to TV fans, flats have been steadily gaining ground on heels and are currently the stylish shoe of choice, as Davis, who says she only wears flats, is all too well aware.

So fashionable are flats, Karl Lagerfeld sent all of his models down the runway in trainers during January's round of couture shows in Paris, while off the catwalk, stylish flats have been embraced by everyone from Rihanna and Cara Delevigne to Home Secretary Theresa May.

What's more, orthopaedic style flats such as Birkenstock sandals have been deemed the hottest shoe for summer, along with the equally sturdy pool slider.

Other popular choices include the brogue, especially in sunny pastel shades, and the loafer. Even the humble ballet pump and the equally low key plimsoll are enjoying a new lease of life, with the Duchess of Cambridge choosing a pair of the latter to wear on the plane en route to a holiday in Mustique.

Since Sex and the City ended in 2004, Davis has had something of a chequered career, with roles in rom coms such as the badly-received Couples Retreat interspersed with stints voicing children's cartoons and a guest appearance on Project Runway.

Her latest project will see her star as Beth Gallagher in a stage adaption of Fatal Attraction, scheduled to begin at London's Haymarket Theatre this month.

Nevertheless, she remains best known for her Sex and the City character Charlotte and her impressive wardrobe of sky high heels.

'I
 wear heels so rarely now,' she added. 'It hurts when I do – you have to
 get in training for them, and it takes a lot of practice.'

And Davis isn't the only former Sex and the City to swear off heels. Last year, co-star Sarah Jessica Parker revealed that she had been forced to give up her spikes because of damage to her feet.

Speaking
 to Net-a-Porter's in-house magazine, Parker said: 'I went to a foot 
doctor and he said, "Your foot does things it shouldn’t be able to do. 
That bone there – you’ve created that bone. It doesn’t belong there"’.

'The moral of the story is, the chickens are coming home to roost.
