A mother-of-two, who wanted to prove that women in the army could be just as feminine as their fellow females, has been crowned a beauty queen.

Georgia Delaney, 23, from Calne, Wiltshire, joined the army four years ago on the advice of her mother after getting into the wrong crowd at college and 'messing up her education'.

During her time as a Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist, Georgia, who always wanted to be a model, started looking into beauty pageants - and she's already won one.

Beauty queen: Georgia Delaney, 23, started looking into beauty pageants during her time in the army and entered her first one in February last year - now she's taken part in three pageants and has won one

Stay-at-home mother Georgia, who has taken part in three pageants, said: 'I wanted to be a model but my mum suggested the army so I just went along with it.

'The training was extremely difficult and there were times when I just wanted to give it up, but I found something in myself and carried on.

'Women in the military aren’t seen as feminine so I decided to do pageants to prove people wrong.

'After leaving the army last year due to injury I am now looking to do more pageants to spread the word that you can be a mother and do beauty pageants.'

Winning: The mother-of-two, who was in the army for four years but had to leave due to injury, is now a beauty queen and encouraging other women to follow her lead

Dream come true: Speaking about her newfound hobby, Georgia said: 'I wanted to be a model but my mum suggested the army so I just went along with it. Women in the military aren't seen as feminine so I decided to do pageants to prove people wrong'

Georgia first joined the army in 2010 after she ‘messed up her education’ and despite wanting to be a model, she joined the military on the advice of her mother.

After battling through the training Georgia qualified as Pte Delaney, Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist.

She said: 'It was a lot easier once I got through the training. I was discharged in 2013 due to a non-freezing cold injury, which made my fingers go numb and meant I couldn’t even hold a rifle.

'Now I stay at home with my two boys, Oscar, eight months, and Henry, two, as well as doing some promo work.'

New life: After leaving the army, left, last year due to injury, Georgia is now looking to do more pageants to spread the word that you can be a mother and do beauty pageants

The official Miss England competition does not allow women to enter if they either have children or are married, so mother-of-two Georgia was relieved to find there were other pageant competitions out there.

She said: 'I started pageants while I was in the army. I wanted to prove that just because I was in the military it didn’t make me masculine, and that having children didn’t change who I was as a person.

'My best friend, Hannah Goulding, was promoting pageants which inspired me to get involved. The first pageant I entered I won, which spurred me on to keep going. The second one was national and I came 15th out of 60.'

In the army: Georgia joined the army after falling into the wrong crowd at college. During her time as a Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist, pictured, she started looking into beauty pageants and has taken part in three

She said: 'I have met so many people through the pageants. You are in competition with the other girls but it’s like competing against your friends.

'There’s a view that you have to be pretty but there is another side involved. It’s not just what you wear and how you look.

'My partner Michael doesn’t like the pageants - he doesn’t see the point. But for me it is a hobby. He has his cars and I have my pageants.'
