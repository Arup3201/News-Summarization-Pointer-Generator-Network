Maria Sharapova won her second French Open title on Saturday but it was Romanian Simona Halep who claimed the hearts of the Roland Garros crowd after pushing the 27 year-old Russian to the brink of defeat.

Sharapova had to use every grain of her experience and fighting capabilities – plus some highly dubious stalling tactics – to complete a 6-4, 6-7, 6-4 victory that stretched to just over three hours on a steaming afternoon.

While lacking much variety it was a fine contest of baseline slugging and retrieving, only marred by the weak officiating of French umpire Kader Nouni, who failed to crack down on the timewasting that continually forced the Romanian to adjust her pace of play.

Sharapova, who took an eight minute 
break to change her dress after losing the second set tiebreak, went two
 hours and 24 minutes before Nouni finally gave her a warning about 
taking too much time between points.

Nonetheless
 you can only admire her remarkable fighting instinct which saw her win 
her fourth three set match in succession and none more gruelling than 
this.

The 27 year-old 
Russian returns to Wimbledon in a fortnight ten years after winning the 
title there. You could hardly have expected then that she would win two 
Roland Garros trophies without adding to hear haul at SW19.

'I
 wouldn’t have believed seven or eight years ago that I would win here 
more than at any other Slam, it was like a dream for me to win here at 
all,' said the champion.

Doubling up: Sharapova was aiming for her second French Open title, after winning there in 2012

Breakthrough: Halep, meanwhile, was in her first ever Grand Slam final

Reacher: The rangy Russian was too much for her opponent in the first set, winning it 6-4

She
 becomes the twelfth female player to win five or more Grand Slams since
 the game became open to both amateurs and professionals in 1968, and is
 the first Russian of either gender to win the same Major twice.

Halep,
 just 22, received the bigger ovation as she went up to collect the 
runner-up’s shield from a crowd who had become agitated with the time 
her opponent was taking, especially between first and second serve.

She
 will have learned an enormous amount from this and, after a meteoric 
rise in the past twelve months, has emerged as the surprise standard 
bearer for a coming generation. “I had an incredible two weeks, I hope 
this is the start,” she said.

Fightback: Halep clawed her way back into the match, taking the second set on a tie break 7-6

Sharapova
 – whose boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov was in London preparing for the Aegon
 Championships - won despite serving twelve double faults against the 
player who moves as well as anyone on the women’s tour, and who only 
flagged right at the end of an attritional match.

The
 Russian broke to take the first set, and then twice needed to break 
back at the end of the second to take it into the tiebreak. In that she 
led 5-3 before Halep reeled off four points to take into a decider.

When
 Sharapova double faulted in the eighth game it seemed to be wobbling, 
but then she won the last eight points to romp home. She remains the 
supreme competitor in the game and the hardest player to close out, 
someone insistent on defying the up and comers.
