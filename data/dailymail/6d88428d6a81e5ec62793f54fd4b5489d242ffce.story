Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of highly-rated midfielder Marco Asensio, but the 18-year-old will stay at Mallorca until the end of the current season.

Asensio, a member of Spain’s Under 19 squad, has penned a six-year deal with the reigning European champions.

‘Real Madrid and Mallorca have reached an agreement for the transfer of Marco Asensio, who will join our club for six seasons,’ read a statement on the club’s official website. ‘The player will remain at Mallorca until the end of the current season.’

Despite interest from Barcelona, who came close to completing a deal for the teenager in the summer, Madrid have trumped their rivals to a player who had also been linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea.

Last week Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti described Asensio as ‘a great player’, when asked about him during a press conference and Asensio himself confirmed the move was imminent on Sunday.

‘I have decided to go to Madrid and I am happy with my decision,’ he said after Mallorca’s 1-0 defeat to Sporting Gijon.

Asensio, who made his debut for Mallorca in October 2013, has scored three times in Spain’s Segunda Division this season.
