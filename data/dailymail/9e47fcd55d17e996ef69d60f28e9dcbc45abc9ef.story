This is the moment a Turkish woman was left with metal railings through her shoulder after trying to hop over a spiked fence to grab some mulberries.

Ceyda Oruk, 35, had been walking with her five-year-old daughter down a street in Adana, a city in the south of Turkey when the little girl spotted the fruit.

Ms Oruk then decided to keep her daughter happy by grabbing a handful of the berries but as she climbed over the fence she slipped, impaling herself on the spikes.

Ceyda Oruk was left with part of a metal fence stuck in her shoulder after she tried to climb over it to grab some mulberries for her daughter

Emergency workers were unable to free her at the scene and she still had part of the fence in her shoulder when taken to hospital

The mother was left impaled on the fence in the grounds of a school in Adana, southern Turkey for 20 minutes before rescue workers arrived

The mother was left impaled for 20 minutes before rescue workers arrived and realised it would be difficult and dangerous to remove her there and then from the fence.

In the end they were then forced to cut the post free and send her in an ambulance with a section of the fence still attached to her arm.

Ms Oruk explained: ‘My daughter spotted the mulberries and she really likes them and asked me if I could get some.

Rescue workers help to free Ms Oruk, but they soon realised it would be difficult and dangerous to remove her there and then from the fence

Ms Oruk said the experience was agony adding that she couldn't scream as she didn't want to scare her daughter

The railings were eventually removed from the woman's shoulder in hospital, where she is recovering and is in good health

‘All the ones that you could reach from 
the road had been grabbed, but I realised if I hopped over the fence I 
could probably grab a handful to keep her happy.

‘But the bars were really close together and I slipped, and suddenly found myself impaled on the spikes.

‘It was agony, but I couldn't scream because it didn't want to scare my daughter any more than she already was. I tried to be brave and told her not to worry, and managed to get my mobile phone and call for help.’

The accident happened near the grounds of a school in the Ismail Safa Ozler Anadolu Lisesi neighbourhood and teaching staff were able to console the young girl during her mother’s ordeal.

The woman was taken to hospital where the railings were removed and according to doctors, she is in good health and is likely to be released within 24 hours.
