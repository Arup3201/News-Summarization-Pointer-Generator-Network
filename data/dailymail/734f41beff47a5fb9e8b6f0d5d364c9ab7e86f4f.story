Texas officials have withdrawn a plan to allow sales of alcohol at some gun shows, which would have come with strict conditions, such as a ban on sales of live ammunition.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission had received hundreds of negative responses to the idea and agreed Tuesday to back off the proposal.

The change was meant to aid the Dallas Safari Club's annual convention, a massive event that draws up to 50,000 people. Alcohol sales would have come with a series of conditions, including that a firearm be disabled and not immediately turned over to the buyer.

But traditional gun show operators opposed the idea, saying they worried about mixing guns and alcohol. Opponents said any policy change should be left to the Legislature. 

Under current rules, if a gun show is held at a venue licensed to sell alcohol, drinks sales and consumption are suspended during the time it takes to set up, conduct and dismantle the gun show.

'We got a request from a gun club in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to amend the rules,' said agency spokeswoman Carolyn Beck.

The Texas affiliate of the National Rifle Association said it had nothing to do with the request.

 The Texas State Rifle Association's Alice Tripp, said the idea was 'confusing' and questioned whether gun advocates would want to attend gun shows with such restrictions.

'Does that make any sense? Who would buy a gun at a gun show where you couldn't take possession of it?' she asked.

'Nobody is interested in selling alcohol at a gun show,' Tripp added.

Bill Clouse, one of several hundred people who attended the High Caliber Gun & Knife Show in Houston last month, described himself as a 'huge gun supporter' but said he doesn't believe guns and alcohol are a good combination.

'I don't think there will be a possibility for trouble. I just personally do not believe you should have alcohol and firearms in the same vicinity, whether you are hunting or at a gun show,' said Clouse, 34, a high school teacher.

Josh Jensen, another person at Saturday's gun show, was also against the proposal, saying the idea is 'just silly to me.'

'You will find people in here who are going to say, 'Oh yeah, that's a great idea. Why can't we have a beer at the gun show? Nobody's got a loaded gun.' But stupid things happen. It's just like drinking and driving. Are you going to drink and drive?' said Jensen, 30, who works for a beer distributor.

Crystal Hartt, 47, a ranch owner from the Port Lavaca area who was at the Houston gun show in August. supported the idea, adding she considered being able to buy alcohol at a gun show the same as buying a beer at a baseball game or a rock concert.

'It's another event. Why not sell a margarita to go with it?' she said.
