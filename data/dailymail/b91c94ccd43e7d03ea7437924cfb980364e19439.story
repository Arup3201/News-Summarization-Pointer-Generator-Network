Convicted boyfriend killer Jodi Arias is spending several hours a day video-chatting to fans from her prison cell.

The murderer, who narrowly escaped the death penalty for the brutal slaying of Travis Alexander in 2008, is said to be the most popular inmate getting video calls - many from girls as young as 15.

Photos have surfaced showing Arias pulling faces and showing off a Hershey's from the confines of the cell where she spends 23-hours-a-day.

Last Saturday alone, Arias took 27 video calls in jail with pictures from some of those calls having leaked.

With each call lasting up to 20 minutes, it means Arias spent up to nine hours that day Skyping with followers and fans from a laptop.

Poser: The 34-year-old killer was snapped by admirers who have been skyping with Arias in her prison cell following her conviction for murder

Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty.

Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. 

Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. 

He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. 

Sheriff Joe Arpaio revealed Arias used the jails video system to tell two 15-year-old admirers they should use fake ID's so they could keep talking with her on the jail video call system.

'The mother told the girls to stop, and evidently the girls got back on and Arias advised them to get some phony ID's so they could get back on there because you have to be 18-years-old,' he said.

Other admirers who have been taking photos of the conversation have also been banned with 10 now having been stopped form communicating with the prisoner.

All smiles: Convicted killer Arias is said to be the most popular inmate for video calls receiving dozens in just one day 

But, despite calls for her to have the privilege withdrawn, Arias is still able to make and receive video phone calls. 

Mr Arpaio says any discipline in the jail has to go through a committee, and that process takes a few days. Only after that is complete could Arias lose the right to make calls.

'It takes a few days to justify why we have taken action on any violation of our policy, I want to make sure we follow the proper procedures, she's not going to like this,' said Arpaio.

The 20 minute phone calls cost £3.30 or $5 each, and anybody can request a conversation but Arias has to accept the calls.

Earlier this month, Arias was sentenced to life behind bars after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'. 

The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty.

Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life.

Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' 

It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April.
