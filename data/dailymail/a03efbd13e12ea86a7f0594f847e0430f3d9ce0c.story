A besotted dog owner has spent an astounding £5,000 on a birthday party for her beloved pet.

Karen Chamberlain, 52, from Dover splashed out on a glamorous bash for her female bulldog, Lady Lola, to mark the fact she had survived to 10 years old despite being given just five years to live after a devastating house fire in 2005.

The professional dog breeder, who specialises in bulldogs, hired a lavish beach club where Lola sat upon a specially-made throne and dressed in a £150 dress and £100 tiara.

The pair were joined by dozens of doggy friends who tucked into a 10-tier cake and enjoyed live entertainment.

Karen, who has no children, said: 'People think I'm mad - I've been called "barking" more than once - but it's only common sense to me that Lola should have had a tutu and a throne for her "100th birthday", considering her rocky journey in life.

'She's really like one of my children.'

Karen narrowly saved Lola and Lola's puppy Tia from a cloud of toxic smoke which filled her house when a coffee pot melted in an unexplained fire.

She said: 'I raced through the house looking for them.

'Both the dogs were succumbing to the fumes and I had to practically throw Lola through an open door into the fresh air.

'By the time I found Tia she was nearly dead. I had to give her mouth to mouth.

'We had to take both dogs to intensive care at the Royal Veterinary College in London where they stayed for two weeks, at a cost of £18,000. We almost lost them several times.

'The vets told us we should prepare ourselves for the fact that they wouldn't live for another five years. I was devastated, but I took them home and nursed them as best I could. It took them a full year to properly recover.

'Lola survived the five years, and then another, and I began to think, 'wow, she's a real survivor'.'

Last year, as Lola approached her 10th birthday, Karen decided to throw an extra-special bash to celebrate her eldest dog's life so far.

Karen also keeps five other bulldogs, Baby Gracie, 6, triplets Angel Star, Lil' Belle and Scarley Sky, 4, and King, 9 months, who with her fiance Pete Dowling, 5.

She said: 'I invited all our dog-mad friends. I wanted it to be a very glamorous evening.

'The dress code was quite strict - I wanted all the ladies and gents to be dressed in their finest gear and their dogs were to wear fancy dress. We had one dog dressed up as Prince Charming, and others were dyed especially for the occasion.'

The venue, the Beach Club marquee at the Kings Oak Hotel in Loughton, Essex, cost £1,000 to hire for the night. Lola's dress cost £150, and her tiara cost another £100.

The decorations, food and entertainment, including a specially-constructed throne, a 10-tier cupcake tower, individual treat bowls, celebrity lookalikes and dancers, brought the total cost to £5,000.

Karen said: 'We considered it Lola's 100th birthday because bulldogs generally do not live as long as some breeds. Every year equals 10 dog years.

'Lola really enjoyed her big day. She loves a fuss being made of her, and it obviously did her some good.'

Sadly Tia, Lola's daughter, died in April this year, but Lola is still going strong.

Karen said: 'She still acts like a puppy. She enjoys playing with her toys a bit too much sometimes and still gets excited meeting other dogs.

'Every day we take her for two short walks and when we're going longer distances we take her out in her stroller. She loves walking on the sand.

'We were once told that Lola only had a few short years to live, but she's amazingly strong.'
