Gillian Taylforth, who is best known for her role as Kathy Beale on EastEnders, has taken matters into her own hands as she approaches her 60th birthday.

The 59-year-old, who also appeared on Footballer's Wives and The Bill, has turned back time with a non-surgical facelift called the Silhouette Soft.

The star was treated by Dr Aamer Khan at the Harley Street Skin Clinic - and she's now the face of the anti-ageing procedure, which uses dissolvable thread to remove wrinkles.

Before and after: Actress Gillian Taylforth, 59, has undergone a Silhouette Soft - a 'non-surgical face lift' that uses a dissolvable thread to remove wrinkles

During the procedure, which costs around £1,500 and takes about half an hour, a thread made of polylactic acid is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic.

The thread is used to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face.

This acid is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen. 

This action, which continues over time, apparently helps increase the volume of saggy areas and restore shapeliness to the face gradually and naturally.

The acid in the thread is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen, say cosmetic surgeons 

The thread dissolves completely after 18 months and promises to have an immediate lift and lasting regenerative effect.  

Speaking about the treatment, Dr Khan said: 'I recommend it to redefine the faces of patients looking for ways to combat sagging jowls and loss of volume in the cheek area - but who don’t want surgery. 

'It produces an extremely natural-looking result which leaves the face completely mobile - very important in Gillian’s case as she is an actress. She is also a very animated woman who laughs and smiles all the time, so it was imperative that she could continue to emote.'

Gillian has had a successful screen career, which has included stints on ITV's Loose Women, Strictly Come Dancing and Celebrity Big Brother. 

Her most recent role saw her playing Sandy Roscoe on Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks.
