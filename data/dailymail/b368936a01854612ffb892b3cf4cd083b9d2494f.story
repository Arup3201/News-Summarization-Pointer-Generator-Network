Doctor-assisted suicide is set to be legalized in Canada, putting the country in the company of a handful of U.S. and European territories.

The Supreme Court in Ottawa said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from a severe medical condition. The new legislation will take effect in 12 months.

Friday's ground-breaking decision related to the case of two Canadian women with debilitating illnesses who fought for the right to end their lives. They died without ever seeing the ruling come into play.

Lee Carter, left,  and her husband accompanied her 89-year-old mother Kay Carter, who suffered from spinal stenosis, to Switzerland in 2010 where assisted suicide is legal, to end her life - she was overjoyed at the Canadian Supreme Court's decision to lift the ban on doctor-assisted suicide on Friday

Gloria Taylor, an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
patient and activist, who joined the right to die lawsuit in
2011, passed away from her illness in 2012.

The family of a second woman suffering from a degenerative spinal cord condition, Kay Carter, 89, who was forced to travel to
Switzerland to end her life, were also plaintiffs.

'Justice, dignity and compassion were the defining qualities of my mother,' Lee Carter said after Friday's decision came down.

'We just felt that it was a fundamental right for Canadians that they should have this choice.'

She called it 'a huge victory for Canadians and a legacy for Kay.'

Assisted
suicide is legal in Switzerland, along with a number of other
European countries and a few U.S. states including Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. 

Canada's Supreme Court last considered assisted suicide in
1993 with the case of 42-year-old Sue Rodriguez, who also suffered from ALS.

However, a lift on the ban was dismissed with a ruling at the time citing prohibitions on assisted suicide as 'the norm among Western democracies.'

Since then, the act of counseling, aiding or abetting suicide in Canada has been deemed a criminal offense, carrying a maximum of 14 years in prison.

Commenting on Friday's turnaround, Grace Pastine, litigation
director of B.C. Civil Liberties Association, which initiated
the challenge, said: 'This is one incredible day. 

The Supreme Court in Ottawa (pictured above) said the practice would be allowed in the case of consenting adults who are suffering intolerably from a severe medical condition

'Physician-assisted dying is now recognized for what it is:a medical service that brings an end, for some individuals, tounbearable suffering.'

Parliament can overturn the decision before the year is up but that is an unlikely
outcome.

Since 1993 pressure for assisted suicide has persisted. 

Last
year the Quebec government introduced a bill to legalize it,
arguing this was a matter of healthcare under provincial
jurisdiction, not a criminal matter in the federal bailiwick.

Religious groups have opposed it as well as organizations
representing people with disabilities. 

They argue that making it
easier to end people's lives is a slippery slope that makes them
feel vulnerable. 

However, the Supreme Court of Canada argued this week the ban on doctor-assisted suicide infringes  the 'life, liberty and security' of a person.

'We do not agree that the existential formulation of the
right to life requires an absolute prohibition on assistance in
dying, or that individuals cannot 'waive' their right to life,' the court said.
