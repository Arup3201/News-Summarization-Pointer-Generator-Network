Juan Cuadrado, Aaron Lennon and Darren Fletcher are among the players who are in contention to make their debuts since completing January moves.

The aforementioned trio stole the headlines by joining Chelsea, Everton and West Brom respectively in what proved to be a relatively quiet transfer window.

Lennon's move to Goodison Park has been in the spotlight as the winger looked extremely grumpy after sealing a move to Everton.

However will the Toffees new boy be smiling at the final whistle on Saturday evening after his new side have taken on rivals Liverpool?

Here, Sportsmail focuses on the players who could make their debut this weekend.

Juan Cuadrado - Aston Villa vs CHELSEA 

Colombia international Juan Cuadrado completed a £26.8miillion move to Chelsea during the final day of the winter transfer window despite the deal being in the pipeline since the start of January.

Cuadrado will be hoping to make his Premier League bow this weekend against Premier League strugglers Aston Villa.

The 26-year-old is expected to compete with the likes of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard for a first team spot at Stamford Bridge.

Aaron Lennon - EVERTON vs Liverpool

There is no better way of making yourself an instant hero at your new side than scoring a winner against your arch-rivals.

Lennon could be handed the chance to do just that if he makes it on to the Goodison Park turf against Brendan Rodgers' side.

The 27-year-old will be hoping to make an immediate impression at his new side after struggling to impress Tottenham boss Pochettino.

Darren Fletcher - Burnley vs WEST BROM

West Brom new boy Darren Fletcher is expected to make his first Premier League appearance since making a substitute appearance in Manchester United's 3-1 Boxing Day win against Newcastle.

The former Manchester United midfielder was allowed to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer after failing to hold down a regular first team spot under Louis van Gaal.

Baggies boss Tony Pulis, who is likely to throw Fletcher straight into his starting XI, made a move for the 31-year-old after the Scotland international's transfer to West Ham collapsed.

Gabriel Paulista - Tottenham vs ARSENAL 

Gabriel Paulista could get his first taste of the north London derby on Saturday if Arsene Wenger chooses to call on his services. 

The former Villarreal defender may have to bide his time at the Emirates Stadium as Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are established first-team stars. 

Paulista, who is likely to start on the subs' bench at White Hart Lane, is 'ready to start', according to Wenger.

Pape Souare - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE

Crystal Palace have been crying out for a new left back since the start of the season as both Joel Ward and Martin Kelly have been forced into playing out of position.

Pape Soare is in line to make his Crystal Palace debut at Leicester following his transfer from Lille.

The 24-year-old, who signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Selhurst Park, could replace Kelly on the left side of Palace's defence.

Shola Ameobi - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE

Shola Ameobi was sent off in his final Premier League appearance for Newcastle back in May 2014.

The 33-year-old will have to beat off competition from Yaya Sanogo, Dwight Gayle and Glenn Murray if he is going to make his Palace debut this weekend.

Alan Pardew knows all about Ameobi having worked with the the striker at St James' Park.

Keshi Anderson - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE

Pardew has said Keshi Anderson will be included in Crystal Palace's squad to face the Foxes.

Former non-league striker Anderson made a shock deadline day move to SE25 from Barton Rovers.

Jack Cork - SWANSEA vs Sunderland

Swansea boss Garry Monk used a small chunk of the money received from the sale of Wilfried Bony to sign Jack Cork from Southampton.

Cork spent much of his time on the subs' bench at St Mary's due to the fine form of fellow central midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama.

The 25-year-old, who started his career at Chelsea, will be desperate to start against Sunderland on Saturday.
