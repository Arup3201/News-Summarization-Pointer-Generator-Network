The BBC is facing an angry backlash over its decision not to screen the unveiling of the RAF Bomber ­Command Memorial on its flagship channel next week.

While the Queen will be honouring the 55,000 Bomber Boys who gave their lives for the ­country, BBC1 will be showing repeats of Cash In The Attic and Bargain Hunt.

The family of the late Bee Gee Robin Gibb, who led the campaign to raise £6million for the largest memorial to be built in London for 200 years, said: 'This is a disgrace.'

The BBC’s decision comes just two weeks after it came under fire for its coverage of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Thames river pageant.

Under fire: The Bomber Command Association is surprised by the BBC's decision not to show the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial on BBC1

The corporation will show live coverage of the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial on digital channel BBC News, instead of on BBC1 or BBC2, which will be showing live tennis from Wimbledon during the 35-minute service.

Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, told the Sunday Express: 'I am lost for words.

'We are living in a fool’s paradise if we forget, or worse, ignore, the courage and sacrifice of 55,000 of the best and bravest of their generation.

'The BBC should question their real motives.'

Defence minister Gerald Howarth said: 'It would be extremely disappointing if there wasn’t full and comprehensive media coverage of this national event.'

The BBC claimed the Bomber Command Association was happy with its plans.

However, the association’s financial director Jim Dooley said: 'This is a real surprise.

'We were told it was going to be broadcast live and it is a huge disappointment to discover that this does not mean the BBC’s main channel but rather a news channel usually watched by far fewer people.

'This is an active choice by the BBC for reasons which I dare not speculate about.'

The family of Robin Gibb also also angry.

Mr Gibb, who died from cancer last month, said his involvement with the project was his 'proudest achievement'.

His son RJ Gibb told the Sunday Express: 'This is a disgrace.

'My whole family is astounded, my mother thinks it’s an outrage.

Anger: The family of the late Bee Gee, Robin Gibb, who led the campaign to raise £6 million for the memorial said he would be 'very sad' at the BBC's decision were he alive

'The corporation has really reached a new low.

'The 55,000 men who paid the ultimate sacrifice fighting Hitler’s war machine were all volunteers.

'The spirit should live not only in the hearts and minds of those who lost them personally but also in the hearts and minds of the rest of us, who are still benefiting from the freedom from tyranny they helped to ensure.

'My father would be very sad indeed today if he were alive to hear this news.

'We urge the BBC to amend its plans and give this important event the respect it deserves by airing it live on its main channel, BBC1.'

The unveiling will take place in Green Park, London, at midday on June 28.

Seven thousand veterans and their partners, many of whom are in their 90s and infirm will be travelling to the ceremony, some from as far afield as Australia.

The Queen and eight members of the Royal Family will also be present at the event, which will feature a fly-over by one of the world’s two remaining 
Lancaster bombers.

A BBC spokesman told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the significance of this story, both for the ­veterans and for our audiences.

'The midday service is being filmed for later inclusion in a special programme Bomber Command: A Tribute on BBC2 at 5pm.

'The BBC News Channel is also currently planning to carry the service live at midday.

'The Bomber Command Association are happy with our plans and have been working closely with us.'
