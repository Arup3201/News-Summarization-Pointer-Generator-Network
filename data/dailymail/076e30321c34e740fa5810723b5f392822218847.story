A mob of wild monkeys has gone on a rampage in a village in eastern Indonesia by entering houses and attacking residents.

A 16-year-old boy has been left in a critical condition after being badly bitten during the surprise attack in Toddang Pulu village.

About 10 monkeys were involved in the rampage, which also left six other people injured.

Ambo Ella, a spokesman for Sidendeng Rappang District in South Sulawesi province, says about 10 monkeys took part in the attack.

He confirmed today that the teenage boy was badly bitten and is being treated at hospital.

He believes the troop came from a nearby forest protected by a local tribe.

It's unclear why the monkeys, which are usually afraid of humans and flee when they hear human voices, emerged and attacked.

Local authorities are investigating to find out what prompted the attack, which caused panic among villagers.

There are about 260 known living species of monkey which have varied relationships with humans.

Many are kept as pets while some are used as model organisms for scientific research. In some parts of the world they are considered agricultural pests which can cause damage to crops.

In some tourist locations, they have been known to attack humans.
