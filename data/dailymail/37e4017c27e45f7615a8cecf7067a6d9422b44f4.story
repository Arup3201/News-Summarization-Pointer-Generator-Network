When Isobel Wyatt didn't get a coin in exchange for the tooth she left under her pillow, her parents told her it was because the tooth fairy was on strike.

The nine-year-old's parents, Wendy Wyatt and Kevin Golding, from Coventry, told her the Government had threatened to take away the fairy's pension, so in protest she refused to go to work.

But rather than accept that she would not be visiting, the schoolgirl became so incensed with the government that she decided to write a heartfelt letter to the Prime Minister.

Isobel Wyatt, aged nine, is pictured at her home in Coventry, with the letter she received back from David Cameron

Incensed: The youngster sent a hand-written note to 10 Downing Street pleading with Mr Cameron to rethink his stance on the pension issue so the Tooth Fairy could get back to work and take this tooth

In it she pleaded with him to rethink his stance so that the tooth fairy would be happier and could get back to her job.

Isobel and her parents didn't think they would hear back from David Cameron but to their amazement, she received a reply this month.

An aide thanked her for her query - but confessed the Government was in the dark when it came to plans for a tooth fairy strike.

They wrote: 'I was pleased to read your well-written letter and your concerns about the tooth fairy.

'Unfortunately, I am unable to answer your question about possible industrial action.'

Primary school pupil Isobel – who lives with her parents, two brothers and sister - said she had been showing off the prized letter to her friends.

She said: 'When I got the letter I was stunned. I wrote in because I thought David Cameron would take away the Tooth Fairy's pension.

In the post: Isobel did not think she would hear back from the PM after sending this letter

Surprised: Isobel with her mother Wendy Wyatt, aged 39, at her home in Coventry

Downing Street's reply: The letter which Isobel Taylor, nine, received from Prime Minister David Cameron's office

'I wasn't expecting anything back because he is very busy. I've taken the letter into school to show my friends – they think it's really good.'

Her mother, Miss Wyatt a University of Warwick nursery worker, said the 'little white lie' had spiralled.

She said: 'Her dad said "maybe they've gone on strike".'

'After that she came and spoke to me and I said I thought I'd heard something about David Cameron cutting their pensions. That was when she decided to write the letter.'

Isobel had been told that the Government had threatened to take away the fairy's pension, so in protest she refused to go to work

The mother-of-four said Isobel became determined to write after her father, assistant accommodations manager at Warwick University, told her of the tooth fairy strike in October.

'I left her to it and she asked me to get the address, which I did.

'I gave her a stamp and she posted the letter herself back in October and when we didn't hear anything for a while we assumed she'd hear nothing back.

'It wasn't until earlier this month we received a reply and Isobel got very excited when she saw the Downing Street postmark on the back of the envelope.

'She knew what it was straight away. She'd been very upset about the missed visit so she was really pleased to get a response.'

Isobel finally received her £2 from her mother after she decided to donate her baby teeth to an art project she saw at a local gallery.

Called Palaces, the installation aims to build a 'magical sculpture' out of donated baby teeth from children across the world.

Miss Wyatt added: 'Isobel decided she wanted to donate her teeth to the project instead - she's saved a few up.

'We have an arrangement where she donates them and we give her the money instead.

'So she doesn't have to worry about the tooth fairy going on strike anymore.'

In 2010, a six-year-old girl sent David Cameron £1 she had received from the tooth fairy because she wanted to 'make the country better and create jobs' after listening to a speech he had made.
