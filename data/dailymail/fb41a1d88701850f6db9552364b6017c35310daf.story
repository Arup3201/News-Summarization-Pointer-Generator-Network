Keeping in line with the current 'cool' thing to do on Instagram, Biden'S first photo is a selfie in the back of a limousine with President Barack Obama. The tagline reads 'Found a friend to join my first selfie on Instagram'

Vice President Joe Biden joined Instagram on Wednesday and his first post was a selfie with his boss, President Barack Obama

The other three photos are of Biden speaking behind a podium, him getting off Marine Two, the vice presidential helicopter, in Pittsburgh and a somewhat artsy photograph of a pair of Ray Ban aviator sunglasses on a table with the vice president blurred in the background.

Biden let his fans know about his new Instagram account on Wednesday afternoon by sending out a message to his 279,000 Twitter followers.

The vice president has laid low when it comes to social media until recently. Last week, he reactivated his Twitter account after it was left dormant since December 2012.
