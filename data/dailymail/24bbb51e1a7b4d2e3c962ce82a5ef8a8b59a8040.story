His body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king.

But now the traditional funeral crown that Richard III never had, has gone on display in York.

The golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the House of York by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III’s remains beneath a car park in Leicester.

Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty.

His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park.

Dr John Ashdown-Hill commissioned a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems.

The crown was made by medieval jewellery expert George Easton who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch.

‘The crown is plated with gold, with the circle set enamelled with white roses and pearls,’ The York Press reported.

‘On the roses are set rubies and sapphires, representing the livery colours of the house of York. The crosses of the crown have more enamelled white roses, set with emeralds and turquoises.’

The historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king’s remains away from the archaeological site, having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch.

The funeral crown is now on show at the Richard III Experience in York's Monk Bar – one of the medieval gateways to York.

It will go on tour around the UK before playing a part in the king’s reburial at Leicester Cathedral.

It was announced earlier this week that Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'.

Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park.

They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'.

The skeleton of Richard III  was discovered at the Greyfriars excavation site in Leicester, which was a church and is now the site of a car park. Now there is a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king

But the High Court told the claimants, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans.

Three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt.

'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated.

'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'. We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.'

Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire.

During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year.

Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.

Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester. There have been heated discussions as to where the king is to be buried and the high court has now confirmed that he will be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral
