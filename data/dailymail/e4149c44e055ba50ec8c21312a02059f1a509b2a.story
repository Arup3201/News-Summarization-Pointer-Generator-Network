A celebrated painter accused of being a paedophile today claimed that artists who use children in their work are subjected to a 'witch-hunt' and there is 'no shame' in pictures of nude children.

Graham Ovenden, who told police he had a 'major reputation' for having 'some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years', is accused of sexually abusing children over the past 40 years.

The 70-year-old painter and photographer, whose work has hung in a Tate gallery and some of the world's greatest museums, told Truro Crown Court there was 'no shame' in the 'state of grace', saying he had a 'moral obligation' to capture images of nudity.

Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard

Giving evidence from the witness stand today, Ovenden talked the jury through some of his paintings - including those featuring nudes and children in states of partial dress.

Referring to one of his subjects, an alleged victim in the case, he said: '[She] was a beautiful child - not only as she was, as you see her in front of a camera, but also as a person.

'I think it is important that someone pays homage to that and place her in a state of grace. I think holding those things, by photography or painting, is a moral obligation.'

Referencing poet William Blake, Ovenden described the 'state of grace' as 'a thing of wondrous beauty'.

In one of several references to Christianity in court today, Ovenden said: 'Imagine Adam and Eve before the serpent - there's no shame.

'We're not born with trousers, skirts, shirts and shoes. One of the great qualities of art is to go back to the great point, the Garden of Eden.'

Ovenden told the court how he had photographed children, in the presence of others, including the alleged victim's relatives.

He testified: 'I have to say the absolute witch-hunt which is going on at the moment - and the idea of a child naked is something to be frowned upon - is absolutely abhorrent.'

Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife had previously described how the four alleged victims posed for Ovenden. They made formal complaints to police in the late 2000s and he was arrested in 2008.

Witnesses giving evidence during the trial described how Ovenden would take his alleged victims into his studio and make them wear Victorian-style clothing which he would then remove.

He would also cover their eyes before abusing them, they told the court.

Asked by his counsel, Christopher Quinlan QC, whether he found children sexually interesting, Ovenden replied simply: 'No.'

He also denied abusing the alleged victims, and said a blindfold used in one of his works had a religious significance.

Ovenden told the court: 'I want to keep it simple - it is the fact that when in the Catholic Church we come to confirmation, your eyes are blindfolded.

'Then the blindfold is removed to show the revelation of Christ through light.'

He told the court he fixed the blindfold on his subject himself, sometimes adding a small amount of double-sided tape to keep it in position as required.

He said the Victorian clothing was part of a box of costumes which were 'very popular with the children'.

'I gave them freedom to just take them out of the box,' he said.

Mr Quinlan also asked Ovenden about a time when he was visited by two police officers after he submitted a series of negatives - including some of a child as the subject - to be developed by Kodak.

Ovenden told the court he subsequently received a letter of apology from the police for their involvement.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
