Supermodel Cindy Crawford was among the speakers at a rally held by parents to raise concerns after potentially dangerous levels of toxic chemicals were found at Malibu High School.

The 48-year-old Malibu resident appeared alongside actor Joshua Malina as the pair called for action after potentially harmful levels of a carcinogen were found at the school last year.

Ms Crawford, who said she was speaking at the rally as 'a concerned parent' called on the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to carry out tests on caulk in classrooms built before 1979, and even offered to pay for it.

She told the meeting: 'Without confirmation where the PCBs are we cannot ensure that our children are not being exposed.

'In any event if money is an issue, Rande, my husband, and I have decided we would happily pay for proper and thorough testing of all pre-1979 classrooms.'

Illegal levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which can cause cancer and effect the immune system, reproductive system and nervous system, were found in classrooms at the school last year after teachers raised health concerns.

The chemicals were used in caulk dating back from the 1950s, but were banned under the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1979, according to the Los Angeles Register.

Independent testing carried out by teachers and parents last month found samples of contaminated caulking containing as much as 7,400 times the legal limit.

Ms Crawford and Mr Malina were joined at the event by actor Ed Begley Jr and several school board members and lawyers. 

Actor Joshua Malina was also among the speakers at the rally at Malibu Library on Tuesday evening

Illegal levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which can cause cancer and effect the immune system, were found in classrooms at the school last year after teachers raised health concerns

Last year the school district agreed to investigate the concerns after 20 teachers signed a letter suggesting mould and other contaminants in some of the school's buildings made their colleagues ill - including three who were diagnosed with stage-one thyroid cancer in the previous six months.

Superintendent Sandra Lyon has said the school's classrooms have been cleaned and they now meet Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, KTLA 5 has reported.

According to the Los Angeles Register report, authorities have promised to clean up the school and weekly notices are sent out to keep parents up to date on the cleaning scheme.
