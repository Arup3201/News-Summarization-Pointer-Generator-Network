Laughing without an apparent care in the world, it appears Amanda Knox is slowly getting used to  the everyday things in life again.

The 24-year-old was spotted yesterday at a petrol station in Seattle, Washington, with her father and bodyguard.

Wearing a broad grin, Knox looked to be relishing her freedom after four long years locked up in an Italian prison.

At liberty: Knox has been keeping out of the public eye as she comes to terms with her freedom and celebrity since she was acquitted of murdering British student Meredith Kercher

It was the first time she has been seen since giving a brief press conference on her return to Seattle last week.

Knox
has been keeping out of the public eye as she comes to terms with her 
celebrity and the media circus surrounding her since she was acquitted 
of murdering British student Meredith Kercher.

She is believed to be considering 
offers from U.S. television networks to give an interview in a deal that
could run to millions of dollars.

Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were arrested a few 
days after Miss Kercher's body was discovered in a pool of blood in 
November 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia.

Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years 
respectively. A third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede, was also convicted 
and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court.

It was this week revealed that Knox will be reunited with Sollecito in time for Christmas.

Sollecito will fly across the Atlantic from his native Italy to 
spend time with Knox in Seattle before the end of the year, his attorney 
said.

The news came as a 
video diary made by Knox's best friend who moved to Perugia to be close 
to her was released for the first time.

Sollecito's attorney Luca Maori said 
that his client will take up Knox's offer to come and stay 'probably by the end of the year', but was 
currently 'shaken and afraid to go out'.

The attorney revealed that the pair 
had been able to speak to each other after the not guilty verdict as they 
waited to be taken back to prison to pick up their belongings.

The potentially romantic encounter 
could prove difficult for Knox though as she has also been seeing David Johnsrud, her boyfriend from before she went to Italy.

Mr Johnsrud was pictured last Wednesday leaving the Seattle home of Knox's mother. And with his pale skin, glasses and straight mousey hair, he bears an uncanny likeness to Sollecito.

Knox sought comfort by secretly meeting Johnsrud almost immediately after she returned to the U.S..

But Knox's father said they had not yet rekindled their romance.

Speaking outside the family home, Curt Knox said: 'She has been around DJ yeah.
I think it’s a little early to be dealing with that romance.'

Getting back together? Raffaele Sollecito plans to fly to Seattle to spend time with Knox before Christmas
