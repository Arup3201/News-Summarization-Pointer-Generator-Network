Soaring numbers of Britons are looking into having nose jobs and breast operations, figures from a private healthcare search engine reveal.

The biggest jump in cosmetic surgery inquiries was for nose jobs and mini-facelifts, up around 1,200 per cent each compared with last year, WhatClinic.com said.

Breast operations are still the most popular procedure, with searches up 80 per cent this year. 

Breast surgery remains the most popular procedure, with searches up 80 per cent this year, while the biggest jump in cosmetic surgery inquiries was for nose jobs and mini-facelifts

And inquiries for slimming operations, such as liposuction, the third most popular surgical treatment in the UK, were up around 250 per cent. 

Fat transfer was close behind in fourth and tummy tucks in seventh place, in terms of enquiries.

While queries about mini facelifts rose eleven-fold in the past 12 months, and eye-lift surgery enquiries increased almost sixfold. 

Those asking for muscle implants dropped by 69 per cent in the past 12 months as demand for the treatment waned. 

Cheekbone reduction, post-bariatric plastic surgery, bra-line back lift and closed rhinoplasty enquiries remained static in 2014.

Emily Ross, director of WhatClinic.com, said ‘The cosmetic surgery and injectables market in the UK is expected to be worth as much as £3.6 billion in 2015. Not only is the market huge - it’s growing at a phenomenal rate.

Inquiries for slimming operations, such as liposuction, the third most popular surgical treatment in the UK, were up around 250 per cent

‘These figures confirm that in the UK, breast augmentation and nose jobs are more popular than ever.

‘This year we welcomed the independent review of cosmetic patient safety by Sir Bruce Keogh of the NHS - which contained some excellent recommendations to improve standards, including the creation of a registry of qualified practitioners. 

'We believe access to independent, trusted information is imperative for all patients so the sooner this registry is made public, the better.

‘Until then we advise anyone considering going under the knife, to find a practitioner who is qualified, experienced and totally transparent about the risks involved. 

'Don’t let special offers cloud your judgement, and don’t be afraid to ask about qualifications and insurance cover.’
