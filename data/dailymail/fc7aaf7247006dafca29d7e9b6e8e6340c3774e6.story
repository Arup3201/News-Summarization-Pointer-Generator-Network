At one point Ms Cunningham could be seen leaning into the heavily tattooed man for a kiss.  

The mother-of-three shot to notoriety she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Josie would reveal the identity of her new baby's father to him on Christmas Day

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. 

She made headlines again when she said she now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. 

Earlier this month, it was reported that she would reveal the identity of her new baby's father to him on Christmas Day.

She was reported to have asked three men to take a paternity test to determine which one could be three-month-old Grace's father - and she plans to write the outcome in their Christmas card.

At the time, she expected to find out the truth in two weeks and claimed all three men would receive a card late on Christmas Eve, but only one would have a copy of the test results.  

Recently the single mother sparked fury among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'vile and borderline incest'.

She has embarked on another venture - a string of websites to encourage girls to 'get pregnant and live on benefits'.

The pair both were both wearing hats and holding coffee cups as they took a stroll around Leeds

The young mother, who has just moved from her council house in Leeds to a bigger one in a village 20 miles away - has launched WantKidsNow.com, which allows women to arrange unprotected sex sessions.

The Sun reported that she had also set up easysingles.co.uk, for people seeking casual sex, and pullthepig.com, aimed at average looking girls. 

Josie compared herself to '2014's answer to Cilla Black' and reckons the sites will turn over £800,000 a month.
