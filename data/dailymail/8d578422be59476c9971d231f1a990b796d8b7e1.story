The president of the University of Virginia has questioned whether the Virginia liquor agency should be able to arrest students, following the fallout from black  student Martese Johnson's brutal arrest. 

Teresa A. Sullivan said the agency's top priority should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law adding 'getting arrested shouldn't involved getting stitches.'

Video of the student's bloody arrest by officers was shared on social media and sparked protests on campus after he was seen lying on the ground, hands tied, saying 'I go to UVA, I go to UVA.'

Questions: UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan, pictured, said the Alcoholic Beverage Control should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law and not leaving people needing stitches

Hurt: Lawmakers are calling for change after the fallout from black student Martese Johnson's brutal arrest, seen here, as he lay bloody on the pavement after the scuffle with officers in the early hours of Wednesday

Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus but the venue has denied racially profiling patrons in a statement

The 20-year-old, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and pink top could also be heard saying: 'How did this happen, you fuc**** racists.' 

Johnson, a Chicago native who is majoring in Italian and Media Studies, was arrested by Virginia's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) at 12:45 a.m. Wednesday.

Cops swooped in and arrested the student - who could be seen on video bleeding profusely - after he was accused of trying to get into Trinity Irish Pub, near campus with a fake ID.

Following widespread condemnation of the footage, Sullivan, along with several high-profile lawmakers in Virginia are now calling for a reexamination of ABC's arrest powers. 

She told The Washington Post: 'As to the other issues, like having a fake ID and underage drinking and son on – both Charlottesville and university police do arrest people for that.' 

Sullivan is backed by Marcus L. Martin, UVA's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity. He said he spoke with Johnson, and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested.

On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town 

Support: Marcus L. Martin, left, UVA's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity, said he spoke with Martese Johnson, and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested by state liquor control. State House Minority Leader David Toscano, right, called the image of the arrest 'very disturbing'

But video of Johnson's bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head led House Minority Leader David Toscano to call the arrest 'very disturbing.'

Meanwhile, Senator Donald McEachin has added his voice to the chorus of disapproval over ABC's   arrest powers.

He now wants to consider sponsoring legislation that would give state police jurisdiction of the state's alcohol laws.

Johnson, an honor student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning.

Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest. On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate. 

It has also emerged that contrary to officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it, according to his friend.

His roommate Joshua Kinlaw said: 'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID.

'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.'

Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement'

Defense: Joshua Kinlaw, left, pictured speaking to ABC News, said  the ID that Johnson actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC was his real ID, but the zip code he gave was for his mother's, right, address rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers

On Thursday, his lawyer, Daniel Watkins, backed these claims and said that the student was simply standing on the sidewalk when officers approached him.

This led Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a state police investigation into the arrest.

Additionally, Attorney General Mark R. Herring said he is now considering a review of arrest data to determine if there was any racial bias involved from the law enforcement agencies.

But in a statement, Trinity Irish Pub, (the establishment that Johnson tried to get in) said managers refute claims made by a former employee that staff were instructed to  racially profile.

The statement, obtained by WVIR-TV said: 'There have been reports that Trinity engages or engaged, in this incident, in racial profiling in not permitting Mr. Johnson to enter. 

'The rationale for allowing patrons to enter — being familiar with the zip code on their own license — is color, gender, race, and ethnicity-blind.

'Comments made by a previous employee by the name of Dante DeVito that Trinity instructs its management to scrutinize persons of color for entry, are patently false.  

'Mr. DeVito was employed by Trinity for six months and was terminated by management for cause. His comments are those of a disgruntled former employee and are not accurate.' 

The pub also said that Johnson was turned away after he gave an incorrect zip code to go with his ID. 

Yet, the student later said that he gave the ZIP code of the address where his mother currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers.

The legal drinking age in Virginia is 21 years old and Johnson has maintained his innocence saying he was not intoxicated, according to CNN.  

Johnson said his 'head lay bloody, but unbowed.' And: 'One thought raced through my mind: How could this happen?'
