If you fancy going for a burger after the pub, you’ll need deep pockets to afford this one - the world’s most expensive.

Stuffed with some of the world’s richest food, the Glamburger will set you back £1,100 pounds.

The burger patty is made from 220 grams of Kobe Wagyu beef minced with 60 grams of New Zealand venison to balance the fat content, and has a rich centre of black truffle brie, creating a liquid pocket once the meat has cooked.

It is then seasoned with smoked Himalayan salt and served with a Canadian lobster poached in Iranian saffron.

And if that isn’t enough, topping it all is maple syrup coated streaky bacon, Beluga caviar and a hickory smoked duck egg intricately covered in edible gold leaf.

The bun is seasoned with a Japanese matcha and cream mayonnaise and coated in gold leaf. 

The finishing touches are a mango and champagne jus and grated white truffle.

On 2 October, the burger was certified by Record Setters as the most expensive in the world.
