The morgue at a hospital in Washington, DC, is infested with rodents that scratch and dine on cadavers stored there, a former contractor claims. 

'[Rats] were actually gnawing inside of the bags and leaving the remnants 
of where they were eating to get inside of the bags,' Doris Kennard, who ran the morgue at Providence Hospital for two years, told FOX 5.

'Parts of the bag on
 the tray, I saw scratches on the bodies.'

Former morgue contractor Doris Kennard sued Providence Hospital in Washington, DC, for emotional distress over claims that she was attacked several times by rats

Kennard told the station that the cooler at Providence Hospital's morgue would frequently break down and attract rats from a nearby trash compactor. 

'They were going into places like
 the anal area, the vaginal area, the pubic area of the males,' Kennard told FOX 5. 'That's where they would get in.'

Kennard claims to have been attacked herself many times, once even needing a battery of exams and treatment. She sued the hospital for emotional distress in 2012 and last week was awarded $237,000 by a jury, court records show.

Providence spokeswoman Karol Marciano did not immediately reply to a MailOnline call seeking comment.

The former contractor says the rats were so vicious, she ended up hospitalized and had to undergo a series of examinations

Kennard's attorney, Gregory Lattimer, claims rodents have run amok at Providence Hospital for decades, and the hospital has tried to 'cover this thing up from day one.'

'If you look down there now, I'm willing to bet you'll find the same problem and it may even be bigger,' he told FOX 5.

Kennard says she remains traumatized.

'It could have been anyone in my family, and every time I think about the way those people were treated and doing with a hospital like Providence Hospital, nothing like this should never happen in any hospital in the United States,' she told the station.
