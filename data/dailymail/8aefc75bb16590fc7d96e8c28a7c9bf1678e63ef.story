Like any bride-to-be, Pauline Bailey was thrilled when she finally found her dream wedding venue.

After touring the landscaped grounds of the stunning Stoke Park – a five-star country house hotel that has featured in two Bond movies – Miss Bailey decided it was the perfect setting.

She and her fiancé Paul Carty were happy to pay £10,000 for their big day, and wrote to ask about possible dates.

Snub: Bride-to-be Pauline Bailey believes the five star hotel didn't want to host her wedding because her fiance Paul Carty has a pierced eyebrow and two earrings

Seemingly amicable discussions ensued with the venue’s wedding planner, Michele Connelly. Then Miss Connelly dropped a clanger that revealed her true feelings about her would-be clients.

She sent an email to her manager Carlo Zoccali – but also forwarded it to Miss Bailey by mistake. It read: ‘Hi Carlo, I need your advice on this wedding, I know this probably doesn’t sound very nice, but I am trying to put this wedding off as I don’t think they are the type of people that we would want to have at Stoke Park.’

Miss Connelly added that she had ‘put the bride off for now’ then signed off with the word ‘Help!!!’.

Miss Bailey, a law graduate, said she burst into tears when she read the message. ‘I was horrified,’ she said. ‘Effectively she was asking her boss how she could get rid of us. We were hugely offended.

The suggestion was that we were undesirables, which we definitely are not.

‘We’re a respectable, middle-class, hard-working, well-educated couple. Paul and I can hold our own anywhere and in anyone’s company. We are thoroughly decent people and didn’t deserve this humiliation.’

The couple believe they were snubbed because Miss Connelly took objection to either her husband’s eyebrow piercing and two small earrings, or the age difference between them.

'Caring face': Stoke Park wedding planner Michele Connelly

They were quoted £240 per head for the venue in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, which boasts a golf course where Sean Connery famously took on his enemy Goldfinger in the 1964 movie.

The hotel ballroom was used for 1997’s Tomorrow Never Dies. Miss Bailey and Mr Carty had been planning to marry in its Fountain Room but Miss Connelly –  described on the hotel’s website as its ‘caring face’ – had other ideas.

After a viewing in April, she managed to stall the couple. Mr Carty said he felt something was amiss when they were told it would cost them £1,000 to light their own fireworks.

‘Whatever we wanted, it felt like they were throwing obstacles in our way,’ he added.

Then the email arrived. Miss Bailey was so offended that she hired a solicitor to explore the possibility of taking legal action against the hotel for defamation.

‘How could she or anyone else judge us after only a ten-minute meeting?’ she said.

In an emailed apology to Miss Bailey, Mr Zoccali invited her to meet him to discuss the wedding.

He wrote: ‘Firstly on behalf of Stoke Park, I would like to humbly apologise for the email which was sent to you by accident. I have spoken with Michele about this, who also sincerely apologises and I will deal internally with regards to her comments.’

The couple spoke out about the incident after settling on an alternative venue for next June’s wedding: Parklands, a 17th century mansion on the Essex/Hertfordshire border.

A spokesman for Stoke Park refused to comment last night.

The bride-to-be said: 'I was horrified. Effectively she was asking her boss how she could get rid of us.

'The suggestion was that we were undesirables, which we definitely are not.

'We’re a respectable, middle-class, hard working, well educated couple, who both speak well and were certainly not dragged-up so to speak.

'Its clear to me that this hotel operates a policy of discrimination which is terribly wrong, unfair and deeply, deeply hurtful.

'Paul and I can hold our own anywhere and in anyone’s company.

'We are thoroughly decent people and didn’t deserve this humiliation,' she said.

Mr Carty added: 'We’re both gutted because it was like "what’s wrong with us?"

'We are normal people, our money is good, no better or worse than anyone else’s.

'If we can afford it why can’t we have it? We were devastated.'

On the hotel’s website Michele is described as its 'caring face'.

Miss Bailey said: 'Michele’s change of heart must have revolved round Paul based on two factors - our age gap and the fact that he has a pierced eyebrow and wears two small gold earrings.

'If I’m right, they’ve got it so wrong about him because he is perfectly respectable as well as being charming and a true gentleman.

'Finding the hotel was a dream come true but it became a nightmare after the way it they treated us.

'I wonder who else it is turning away? And what reasons it is finding for doing so?'

Decadent: The couple were prepared to pay £10,000 to host a wedding reception for 30 guests at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire

The couple had visited 30 different venues before finally settling on the luxury hotel

The plush hotel is set in 14 acres of stunning gardens and boasts a championship golf course

In a grovelling e-mail sales manager Carlo Zoccali told bride to be Pauline he 'humbly' apologised.

Pauline finally spoke out after settling on an alternative venue for the couple's big day next June.

The pair will marry at Parklands, a 17th century mansion on the Essex/Hertfordshire border.

The couple met five years ago on a night out with friends, and romantic Paul popped the question to her last Valentine’s Day on holiday in Gran Canaria.

A spokesman for the Stoke Park Hotel refused to comment on the blunder today, and said the management did not want to prejudice anything that might happen in the future.

Since being turned into a luxury 
hotel Stoke Park has developed a close relationship with Pinewood 
Studios - which is just four miles away - and the British film industry.

Two James Bond movies, Goldfinger (1964) - where the golf course features as the fictional Royal St Mark's - and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) were filmed at Stoke Park.

The golf duel from the first of 
those, between Sean Connery's James Bond and Goldfinger, played by Gert 
Frobe, is still considered by many to be the most famous game of golf in
 cinematic history.

After catching Goldfinger cheating, Bond switches balls on his opponent during the match.

Realising that Bond is attempting to 
interfere in his affairs, Goldfinger motions to Oddjob, his deadly 
Korean manservant and caddie, to sever the head of a nearby statue with 
his steel-rimmed bowler.

Bond is suitably impressed, but 
wonders what the club secretary will have to say. Goldfinger explains 
smugly: 'Oh nothing Mister Bond - I own the club!'

In Tomorrow Never Dies, James Bond - played by Pierce Brosnan - enjoys a tryst with past love Paris (Teri Hatcher), the wife of the film's villain.

The famous ‘mini break’ and rowing 
scenes from Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) were filmed in the Great Hall, 
Lakes and The Pennsylvania Suite with Hugh Grant, Renée Zellweger and 
Colin Firth.

In 2004, three movies were released all featuring Stoke Park: Wimbledon, Bride & Prejudice and Matthew Vaughn’s Layer Cake.

In Wimbledon, Paul Bettany is featured on the grass tennis courts.

Layer Cake featured Stoke Park in many scenes including the dramatic ending with Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, filmed on The Mansion’s front steps.

Bride & Prejudice, a Bollywood reworking of Jane Austen's classic novel, featured shots throughout the grounds.

Now a five-star hotel, historic Stoke Park was a private residence up to 1908.

The mansion - set in 350 acres of 
parkland and historic gardens - at the heart of the luxury Stoke Park 
Country Club and Hotel was designed by James Wyatt, architect to King 
George III, who worked on the estate from 1790 to 1813.

The manicured grounds were the handiwork of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, lauded as England's greatest gardener.

In 1791 Humphry Repton was commissioned to upgrade the landscaping of the grounds.

The
 imposing building was purchased by Nick 'Pa' Lane Jackson who created 
Stoke Park, Britain's first Country Club, boasting a golf course 
designed by Harry Colt.

Now guests at the hotel can take advantage of a selection of 49 bedrooms and suites, an award-winning spa, 13 tennis courts, 14 acres of gardens and three restaurants.
