Twice as many teenagers are using e-cigarettes than conventional smoking with fears this could potentially lead to an addiction to nicotine.

The findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a 'gateway' to tobacco. 

The study, based on surveys of 50,000 students in 400 secondary schools in the US, is the first sign among this age group the use of e-cigarettes has surpassed the use of traditional tobacco products, researchers claim. 

The new findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a 'gateway' to tobacco 

Dr Wilson Compton, deputy director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: 'I was really surprised that among the eighth graders over a third of users of e-cigarettes hadn't previously tried tobacco cigarettes

'In a lot of kids, their first exposure to nicotine is now with these e-products.'

Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in San Jose, California, Dr Compton warned about the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. 

He said: 'There is potential that if you start with e-cigarettes, that gets you into a nicotine habit, and then you switch over to the real thing. That's speculation but what we don't want to do is look back and say I wish we'd done something.

'Just like tobacco becomes a habit that's life long and hard to break, e-cigarettes might start you on the same pathway.

'They could not be described as harmless. Nicotine itself is not a harmless substance. It produces changes in heart rate and blood pressure, can be dangerous in high doses, and certainly wouldn't be recommended for the adolescent brain.'

He said it was important parents did not fall into the trap of thinking that 'vaping' e-cigarettes were harmless.

'Parents are our most important tool for shaping teenager behaviour and they may not see this as risky,' he added.

The study found that among 14 to 16-year-olds, nine per cent reported using an e-cigarette in the past 30 days, while only four per cent had smoked a tobacco cigarette. 

Among 17 and 18-year-olds, 16 per cent reported using an e-cigarette compared to 14 per cent smoking a cigarette. 

Scientists also found that 36 per cent of 13 and 14-year-olds who had used e-cigarettes had never smoked a real cigarette.

E-cigarettes, widely used as an aid to quitting smoking, contain a heating element that produces a vapour containing nicotine but are free of many of the harmful substances associated with tobacco.

The vapour is often given sweet flavours - examples include bubble gum and milk chocolate cream - that might be attractive to younger teens, the researchers said.

'E-cigarettes have made rapid inroads into the lives of American adolescents,' said senior study investigator Dr Richard Meich from the University of Michigan. 

He added: 'Part of the reason for the popularity of e-cigarettes is the perception among teens that they do not harm health.'

The same investigation, now in its 40th year, revealed a long-term decline in the use of tobacco cigarettes by American teenagers.  

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said, 'Nicotine can be harmful to the growing brain so it's best if young people avoid it. But if they're going to experiment it's better to use e-cigarettes as vaping is far less dangerous than smoking and much less addictive.

'So far in the UK and the US, smoking rates are going down more than e-cigarette use is growing. This would not be the case if vaping really were a gateway into smoking.'
