Luis Suarez may still be a Liverpool player as far as the club are concerned but for everyone else his transfer to Barcelona is a foregone conclusion.

The people of Catalonia are in no doubt that the Uruguayan striker will be arriving this summer and one sports shop has already printed a Suarez 9 jersey.

Alexis Sanchez is set to depart for either Arsenal or Juventus this summer and it will free up the No 9 shirt for Suarez.

The store, Futbolmania, is already trying to capitalise on Suarez's impending arrival.

A member of staff told Sportsmail: 'It's an official Barcelona shirt but we did the printing ourselves. It's got quite a lot of attention on the internet already.'

Suarez is currently banned from all football-related activity for four months, after biting Giorgio Chiellini while playing for Uruguay against Italy in the World Cup.

That didn't stop Barcelona launching a charm offensive as they tried to lure the forward to the Nou Camp.

Club
 president Josep Bartomeu, sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and new 
signing Ivan Rakitic have all praised Suarez in recent days.

And like former Barcelona great Hristo Stoichkov, who stamped on a referee, the club believe he can be redeemed.

The
 owners of Footballmania certainly hope so, with plenty more plain 
strips ready to have Suarez's name emblazoned on the back.
