We all bemoan the seemingly inevitable encroach of Christmas earlier and earlier into Autumn, but it seems we all contribute to the early decoration by hitting the shops months in advance for presents.

The festive season will begin earlier than ever this year according to a new study - with 41 per cent of Britons starting Christmas shopping this Friday.

Many won't even wait until Halloween is out of the way to start finding perfect presents for loved ones the research revealed. 

Unbelievably, many of us will begin planning and buying for Christmas before the leaves have even fallen from the trees

October 24 is now our favourite day to start hitting the shops ahead of the festive season.

The study also found that on average we will spend more than a staggering £20,000 on Christmas gifts in a lifetime.

The busiest time to shop for presents will be 6.35pm, with research suggesting most people will head to the shops after work.

And it seems we aren't afraid to splash the cash for gifts.

The average Brit will buy 14 presents for loved ones, each around the cost of £24.

This adds up to a quarter of the typical monthly pay - 331 pounds - and a third of us will spend up to two hours planning which gifts to buy.

However, one in ten (9 per cent) will spend more time planning the perfect present than they'll spend at work (ten hours).

Despite our readiness to get ahead of the rush at Christmas, many of us still fail to be completely prepared.

One in six, 17 per cent, leave all their festive shopping to the last minute and buy their presents in December.

However some Brits are really keen to make sure they're all done in plenty of time - five per cent even started in January.

The survey, conducted by the Ideal Home Show at Christmas and sponsored by Go Compare, found men and women have very different shopping habits at Christmas.

While both sexes leave three hours to do the shopping and three hours to wrap the presents, women are the better shopper.

Women buy on average three more presents than men 

Despite men spending £24  more, 10 per cent of women will spend 11 to 14 days shopping online - only 3 per cent of men can say the same.

Thoughtfully, women buy three more presents than men and 7 per cent of women will buy over 50 gifts this year.

Lee Newton, CEO of Ideal Home Show owners Media 10,  said: 'This weekend will see most of us starting to plan the perfect Christmas.

'Rather than waste hours worrying about what to buy and pounding the busy shops like the majority of the population, why not come to the Ideal Home Show at Christmas.

'Everything you need is under the one roof!'

The results also found that those living in the North are more generous with gifts.

Each person in the North West will spend an average of £340 on gifts whereas Londoners will only spend £288.

Shoppers in Yorkshire will buy an average of 17 presents yet Londoners will only buy 11.

Men even confessed that they spoil their pets at Christmas.

Five per cent admitted they spend more on their pet than they will for anyone else.

When it comes to brothers and sisters, 21 per cent of women say they spend more on their parents - whilst on 11 per cent of men say the same.

However one in five men, 19 per cent, say most of their money goes to brothers and sisters - yet only 15 per cent of women can say the same.
