A racing driver tipped as the next Lewis Hamilton is suing his GP for more than £300,0000 for allegedly missing his cancer and delaying his bid to become a Formula 1 champion.

Three years ago, Dean Stoneman had won the Formula 2 world title and, at 20, was poised to enter Formula 1 racing having tested for Williams.

But instead he was given the devastating news he had advanced testicular cancer after visiting his GP’s surgery for almost 18 months with symptoms of the aggressive disease.

Lawsuit: Mr Stoneman is claiming compensation for pain, suffering and loss of earnings arising from an allegedly negligent consultation

Now Mr Stoneman, 23, is claiming compensation for pain, suffering and loss of earnings arising from an allegedly negligent consultation he had with Dr Paul Hemming in May 2010, when he was 19.

According to papers lodged at London’s High Court, Mr Stoneman went to see Dr Hemming, complaining of enlarged breasts and sore nipples and pain and discomfort in his testicles.

Mr Stoneman claims Dr Hemming said his symptoms were due to a ‘temporary hormone imbalance’, and failed to examine his testicles.

In January 2011, Mr Stoneman saw a different GP who immediately referred him to a surgeon who diagnosed stage IV testicular cancer which had spread to his lungs and abdomen, giving him a 50 per cent chance  of survival.

Mr Stoneman’s agent, Anthony Shaw, said: ‘Dean is in remission, but suffers from side effects of the intense chemo, including lack of feeling in his feet. But he is back driving for the GP3 series.’ Dr Hemming’s lawyers declined to comment last night.
