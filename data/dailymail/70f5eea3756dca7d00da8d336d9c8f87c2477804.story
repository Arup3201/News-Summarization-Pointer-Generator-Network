David Cameron took a dramatic gamble with the future of the union yesterday by offering to hand more powers to Scotland after a referendum on independence – and got nothing in return.

The Prime Minister said the Scots could have further devolution if they vote No to a breakaway.

His surprise concession angered Tory MPs who insisted that Nationalist leader Alex Salmond should get no further powers without a referendum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland too.

Mr Cameron met Mr Salmond in Edinburgh and emerged ‘frustrated’ after the First Minister refused to budge an inch on his plans for a referendum.

The SNP leader was last night still insisting that the Scottish people must be given the chance to vote not just on independence but also for beefed-up powers dubbed ‘devo max’. The Prime Minister sought to undercut that position by offering Scotland sweeping new powers during an impassioned speech in which he said he was ‘ready to fight for the life of this country’.

He said: ‘When the referendum on independence is over, I am open to looking at how the devolved settlement can be improved further.

‘And, yes, that does mean considering what further powers could be devolved. But that must be a question for after the referendum, when Scotland has made its choice about the fundamental question of independence or for the United Kingdom.’

Mr Cameron refused to spell out exactly what he had in mind but Whitehall sources said he is thinking about handing the Scottish government greater control of tax and spending in areas such as welfare policies, to add to its control of health, personal care and university tuition fees.

No 10 officials insisted they were not preparing to hand Mr Salmond full ‘devo max’, which would give the First Minister control of everything except defence and foreign affairs.

But if Mr Cameron had hoped the bold gambit would help win concessions from Mr Salmond, he was quickly rebuffed. After the talks Mr Cameron said: ‘I am afraid there wasn’t much progress.’ One aide said: ‘He found it frustrating.’

Last night Mr Salmond accused the Prime Minister of attempting to ‘hijack’ the public consultation on a referendum under way in Scotland by making vague offers.

What powers does Scotland have now?

Under devolution, the Scottish Government already has wide-ranging powers to set laws on domestic issues from education, to health and prisons.

For example, the Scottish people enjoy free tuition fees and free personal care for the elderly.

The Scotland Bill, currently going through Parliament, will give £12billion of extra powers allowing Scotland to control even more of its budget.

Decisions, mainly concerning matters which have an impact on the United Kingdom as a whole, or indeed on an international basis, such as taxation, foreign affairs and defence, are reserved and dealt with at Westminster.

What extra powers could David Cameron give Scotland?

SNP leader Alex Salmond is pushing for the Scottish people to be allowed a vote on a so-called ‘devo max’ option which would hand greater powers to Scotland.

Devo max has never been fully explained, but is described by the Scottish Government as ‘control of all laws, taxes and duties’ within the UK.

Holyrood would be able to raise and spend its own cash, while defence, foreign affairs and monetary policy would remain reserved to Westminster.

What would full independence mean?

Scotland would become an entirely independent country with control over its own fiscal, defence and foreign policy.

The First Minister said: ‘Give us the detail, where’s the beef, what is the proposal, what is on the table?

‘He
can’t seriously expect the people of Scotland to go into this huge 
debate, the biggest debate for 300 years about the future of our 
country, and have people say, “Look, we’re thinking about giving you 
something else; we’re not telling you what it is”. That’s not a tenable 
position.’

Privately some Tories warned that Mr Cameron was in danger of ‘giving away the farm’ to the SNP before the referendum campaign has even begun.

They believe Mr Salmond does not really want independence but is just keen to secure control of the levers of power – with Scotland’s economy propped up by the Bank of England and English taxpayers.

Mr Cameron’s critics will be emboldened by a House of Lords Constitution Committee report published today which makes clear that ‘devo max’ would have to be subjected to a UK-wide referendum.

Former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth said: ‘Devo max would mean creating an English Parliament and a federal government.

‘If
the Prime Minister is saying that Scotland could get more powers, 
that’s certainly not something the Government should do without 
consulting the people in England.’

Tory
MP Philip Davies voiced the fears of many Tories that handing further 
powers to Scotland would leave English voters with an even worse deal. 
He said: ‘The Scots would still get our money, they’d get all of the 
benefits of independence with none of the costs. To me, that’s totally 
unacceptable.’

Mr Cameron 
admitted that as a wealthy Englishman he might not be the best person to
defeat the call for independence, and urged Labour heavyweights Gordon 
Brown, Alistair Darling and John Reid to make the case for the union.

He
said: ‘As for the fact that I am English, that I had a privileged 
upbringing, that I might annoy people by making a speech in Scotland, 
all I can say is that this is what I believe. I care about our United 
Kingdom.

‘I am a unionist 
head, heart and soul. I believe that England, Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland are stronger together than they would ever be apart.’

In his speech, the PM said Scotland had been a 'pioneering country all its life' but the United Kingdom provided a 'stable home that billions envy'
