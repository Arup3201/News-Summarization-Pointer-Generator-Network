David Beckham was  at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea's Champions League last 16 second leg match against one of his old teams, Paris Saint-Germain.

The former England captain was in London with his three sons, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz. 

The anticipation of the PSG fans inside Stamford Bridge ahead was clear, with a number of fans stood topless in the away stand, despite it being another chilly March evening.

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who was suspended by the BBC on Tuesday, was present at the game

That manner of appearance was not one chosen by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who was spotted in the stands ready to watch his beloved Chelsea only a day after being suspended from the BBC.

Boris Becker was also seen in the stands, appearing blissfully unaware that the Chelsea scarf he was wearing had the emblem of the Chelsea hooligan firm, the Chelsea Headhunters, on.

The two teams are tied 1-1 from the first leg at the Parc des Princes. 

Defender Branislav Ivanovic headed Chelsea in front before Edinson Cavani equalised.
