Five bunker shots, four dropped shots, three missed putts from short range, two poor chips and one blow into the water. And that was just the front nine. It's fair to say Rory McIlroy's curious Florida funk continued in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday.

At least on the back nine there were enough good blows on show to hint it will not be too long before we can enjoy a more customary service. The world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73. While that might have been barely ok in the context of the field as a whole it was a radical improvement on what appeared a likely score at halfway.

McIlroy placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative. 'After nine holes I thought there was really not much more to lose, so go ahead and be more aggressive,' he said. 'It paid off a little and the eagle was really important. Hopefully I can get off to a better start in the second round and get back into it.'

He's certainly got some work to do. McIlroy will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former American Ryder Cup player JB Holmes. Given there was a decent breeze blowing for most of the day, his 62 was a remarkable effort. Fellow American Ryan Moore shot 66. World number three Henrik Stenson carded a 69 while Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies.

As for McIlroy, a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the Sunshine State this year, taking in last week's two rounds at the Honda Classic, in a startling 11 over par.

The world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage.

Opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start, since there are two par fives in the first three holes. But McIlroy drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains. Just to compound the frustration, his approach to the par four 11th was a metre short of being perfect, and plugged in a greenside bunker to bring about an unlucky bogey.

So it continued. Every good iron shot he played he couldn't take advantage, while every bad shot invariably led to more damage to his scorecard.

Two over par coming to the 18th, McIlroy became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach, and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green.

It wasn't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real Rory. A sumptuous long iron to the difficult par three fourth set up his first birdie of the day and lit the spark on a run that saw him birdie two of the next three holes before registering an eagle three at the 8th. Even during this spell, however, there were sloppy bogeys at the 5th and the 9th. No wonder he headed straight to the range afterwards.

Two players who will not be remembering their rounds with any affection were Phil Mickelson and Stephen Gallacher. Mickelson's 74 was notable only for the fact it was the first time in 190 consecutive rounds on the PGA Tour that he had failed to register a single birdie.

Poor Gallacher's nightmare was even more complete. The Scot put two balls into the water at the 18th to complete an awful 84. It was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro.

Lee Westwood, who became the first man to play in 50 WGC events, was one over par after nine
