The Premier League is often described as the most exciting division in world football, and it certainly matches Spain’s La Liga for goal action.

But as Sportsmail's wide-ranging study of the world’s football leagues reveals, both are outstripped by Germany’s Bundesliga among their 'Big Five’ rivals, and fans of nine other major divisions around the world see more goals per game.

Using numbers for the most recently complete seasons in 34 leagues around the world, the Austrian league has more goals per game than anywhere (3.31 per game) followed by the Dutch top division (3.20) and then Bundesliga (3.16). Those are the only three averaging more than three goals a game.

The Premier League saw 1,052 goals scored last season, including this by Sergio Aguero against Tottenham

Alexis Sanchez has already scored 12 goals for Arsenal since his summer move from Barcelona 

Luis Suarez was the Premier League's top scorer last season, his 31 included this beauty against Norwich

The Premier League is 10th on the list of 34 leagues around the world, with 2.77 goals per game to La Liga's 2.75 per game in 11th place.

Italy’s Serie A is 15th (2.72 goals a game) and France's Ligue 1 down in 28th, with 2.45 goals per game.

One quirky feature of the goal-scoring findings - for the seasons considered at least - is that the more northerly the league, the likelier a high-scoring tally of goals per game.

The six top divisions in goals per game were all in the northern-most group of countries in the study (Austria, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland) while the six lowest-scoring leagues were all in the southern-most group of nations (Nigeria, Algeria, Argentina, South Africa, Portugal and Colombia).

There were an average of 2.75 goals per game in La Liga last season, Lionel Messi scored quite a few of them

Serie A had the second lowest goal-to-game ratio of Europe's top five leagues, despite Carlos Tevez's efforts

Whether this is because climatic differences tend to mean northern football is faster and more error-prone in cold places but slower and lower-scoring when it’s hot is far from clear.

But France was the only 'northerly' country among the dozen lowest-scoring leagues, with 2.45 goals per game last season.

Scotland’s Premiership is a middle-ranking league in goals terms, with 2.75 scored per game last season putting it in 13th place, fractionally behind La Liga and Australia’s A-League.

The Austrian Bundesliga has more goals per game (3.31) than any other top league in the world

The German Bundesliga is third overall in the list thanks to goals from the likes of Arjen Robben (centre)
