The girlfriend of Aaron Hernandez's alleged victim said  the defendant was stressed and kept to himself in the days following the murder.

Shaneah Jenkins was on the stand for the third day on Wednesday in Fall River, Massachusetts where she was cross-examined by the defense.

Her sister Shayanna, the fiancée of Aaron Hernandez, also returned to court for the first time since last week. She sat with Hernandez's family in the front row behind the defendant and took notes. 

Shaneah Jenkins, a graduate law student, is a witness for the prosecution and has been sitting with the family of her late boyfriend, Odin Lloyd, in court.

Hernandez, 25, has been charged with the murder of Lloyd in 2013 after the 27-year-old's body was found with gunshot wounds in industrial scrub land.

Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, took the stand on Wednesday where she was shown a photo of her son from when she identified his dead body at the medical examiner's office

The former New England Patriots player has pleaded not guilty.

Lloyd's mother also took the stand on Wednesday where she kept check of her emotions as she identified her dead son in an image of his face from the medical examiner's office. 

Ursula Ward was advised by Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh not to cry while on the stand. Ms Ward answered questions from the prosecution about her son's upbringing and the last time she saw him.

Ward has left the courtroom in tears on two previous days when seeing photos in court of her son's body. 

Ms Ward testified that she had never met Aaron Hernandez and did not know him to be a friend of her son, saying the ex-Patriots player had never come to her home.

The defense declined to question Ms Ward who left the stand after about ten minutes.

On Wednesday morning, Shaneah Jenkins told the court that she went to her sister and Aaron Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts the morning after she found out Lloyd was dead.

She told defense attorney Charles Rankin that in the days that followed, Hernandez 'seemed stressed'.

The defense read Shaneah her previous grand jury testimony where she said that Hernandez 'appeared shaken up'. 

Shaneah said that she did not recall saying those precise words but confirmed she said that Hernandez did not eat a lot and was 'isolated' at the home.

The defense team used the cross-examination of Miss Jenkins to reinforce a picture of Aaron and Odin as good friends, who regularly hung out together and smoked marijuana. 

Shaneah  testified about occasions when Lloyd and Hernandez spent time together but reiterated that they weren't close and just had 'the beginnings of a friendship'.

Her sister Shayanna sat in the front row behind Hernandez, taking notes while she spoke. The two sisters didn't make eye contact. 

Hernandez also took notes in court on Wednesday as the jury was shown photographs of Odin Lloyd's shaving kit bag in which he carried marijuana.

As the trial resumed on Wednesday, Shaneah reiterated what she had said in court on Tuesday, that she saw her sister going to basement with a black trash bag the day after Odin's murder.

She confirmed for the prosecution that still images from surveillance cameras in the Hernandez home showed her in the living room while Shayanna goes to the basement with the garbage sack.

At trial on Tuesday, Shaneah had broken down in tears as she recalled the middle-of-the-night call which brought news that her boyfriend was dead.

Miss Jenkins also told the court in Fall River that she had a close relationship with her sister but that Shayanna 'was not being normal' the morning after Odin's murder. 

Shaneah said that Shayanna took a number of phone calls in another room at her home and then went to the basement several times, on the last occasion carrying a black garbage bag.

Shaneah said that Hernandez, 25, only briefly spoke to her once about her 27-year-old boyfriend's untimely death.  

'He [Hernandez] came into the dining room, rubbed my shoulder and asked me if I was okay,' Miss Jenkins said.

'He told me he had been through this death thing before and it will get better with time.'

Hernandez remained emotionless and stared at the ceiling as Miss Jenkins, who had been dating Lloyd for 18 months, became tearful as she recalled the last time she spoke to him.

Miss Jenkins said that she spoke to Odin several times on June 16, which was Father's Day, from her home in Connecticut.

Odin told her that he was going to work the following day and he had to return a rental car after he finished.

During her morning commute the following day, she called Odin at 7.30am but was unable to reach him. Miss Jenkins testified that she called him at lunchtime, got no response and again, at 8pm that night.

Shaneah was woken up late that night by Trooper Benson from North Attleboro who informed her that Odin was dead.

The law student, who has remained composed and given measured, articulate answers on the stand, broke down as she recalled finding out he had died.

Miss Jenkins dabbed at her nose and eyes with a tissue but was able to continue. 

She testified that in the early hours of June 18, she tried to call Shayanna but couldn't get through to her sister.

Shayanna then called back and 'sounded like she was in the car', Shaneah said.

The grieving young woman then drove from her home in Connecticut to visit Odin's family in Massachusetts and some hours later, then drove to her sister's home about an hour away. 

Shaneah testified that on June 18, Hernandez left the home and she stayed in the living room for some hours with her sister, niece and uncle.

Sometime around noon, Shayanna received a number of phone calls and text messages. 

'Her responses were short and she kept getting up and leaving the room,' Miss Jenkins said. 'She was not behaving normally. She was being secretive.' 

Shaneah said Shayanna went to basement two or three times. On the last time she went, she had a black garbage bag which she did not explain what was for. 

Shayanna then borrowed Shaneah's car - which she had never done before, saying that she had to go to the bank to collect money for the housekeepers. 

When her sister returned, Shaneah said she then left to visit Odin's family and on her return, found police searching the Hernandez home.  

The trial continues.
