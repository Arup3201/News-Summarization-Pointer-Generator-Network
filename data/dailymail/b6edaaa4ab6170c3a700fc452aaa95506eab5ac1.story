At least four people have been hurt at a church in Albuquerque, New Mexico when a man went on a rampage towards the end of Sunday's service.

Police say the 24-year-old man jumped out of the pews and stabbed several members of the Church's choir whilst they were singing.

The four victims do not appear to have life-threatening injuries and are being treated at local hospitals.

St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church in Albuquerque, NM: The man attacked four members of the choir including the lead singer before he was pinned to the floor

Two parishioners told the Los Angeles Times that a man in his teens or early 20s leaped from the pews and stabbed the choir's lead singer at after communion at St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church.

'While that was going on, people were just panicking. It was scary, you wouldn’t think something like that would happen in church,' said Reyes Stinson, 18.

Another member of the congregation, Vanessa Lucero, 14, said she was sitting right behind the man, who 'was kind of twitchy, sketchy looking. He had a tattoo of an upside-down star on his wrist.'

She said the man climbed over the pews, punched and then repeatedly stabbed the choir's lead singer.

An off-duty police officer along with other parishioners at the church managed to subdued the attacker and held him down until police arrived.

Unprovoked: The attack occured just as the Sunday service was coming to an end when the man lept from the pews

Ms Lucero who was witness to the entire incident said that as the man was being handcuffed old ladies who were present were telling him to forgive himself.

Nobody at the church recognised the man and the police have confirmed he was not a parishioner at the church.

Father John C. Daniel spoke to the Times: 'At this point, we’re just trying to deal with it, it sounds like everybody is going to be OK.'

The choirs lead singer had several stab wounds on his arm and his jacket was also ripped.

Archbishop of Santa Fe Michael Sheehan released a statement saying he was saddened by the attack. 'I pray for all who have been harmed, their families, the parishioners and that nothing like this will ever happen again,' Sheehan said.

In a statement, Albuquerque police have confirmed the man is now in custody but have not yet released him name.

They also have been unable to determine a motive for the attacks.
