The former lover of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been executed by machine gun amid claims that she had been appearing in pornographic videos.

And the brutal killing of singer Hyon Song-wol – and 11 other entertainers said to have performed on the videos – immediately led to speculation that Kim’s jealous wife was to blame.

Hyon was among a dozen singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups who were machine-gunned to death on August 20.

Hyon and Kim knew each other as teenagers then had an affair when he was leader

The singer was reported by South Korean newspapers to have been  brutally executed by machine gun on August 20 from order's directly from the South Korean leader (pictured above with his wife)

Because Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju,  was 
once a member of the same group as the executed singer, North Korea 
analysts suggested that she might have given her consent to the 
execution.

Fuelling the speculation, there have been rumours that her husband was still seeing Hyon.

A
 source in China, the only ally of the secretive Stalinist nation, told a
 South Korean newspaper that the entertainers were arrested on August 17
 for violating laws on pornography.

Kim Jong-Un¿s ex-girlfriend, Hyon Song-Wol, was recently seen delivering a speech at a national art workers rally on national television, despite rumours she had been executed

It was reported that they were accused of making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings.

Some
 of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are 
banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as 
political dissidents.

Without
 facing trial Hyon, said to be 28, and other members of North Korea’s 
most famous pop groups were marched in front of a firing squad and 
gunned down while their families and other members of the groups were 
ordered to watch.

The victims’ families and friends were then taken away to a labour camp, having been found ‘guilty  by association’.

Married: Kim with his wife Ri Sol-ju, who apparently played alongside Hyon in the Unhasu Orchestra

North
 Korea has very little contact with the outside world and it is unlikely
 that the reason for the execution will ever be confirmed.

But
 Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, a Japanese expert on Korean affairs, 
said it was ‘simply not believable’ the entertainers were executed for 
making pornography, as they could simply have been made to ‘disappear’ 
in the prison system. He said: ‘As Kim’s wife once belonged to the same 
group, it is possible that these executions are more about Kim’s wife.’

Kim,
 30, who succeeded his late father as supreme leader of North Korea in 
2011, met Hyon ten years ago when he returned from studying in 
Switzerland. However, his father, Kim Jong-il, disapproved of the 
relationship and ordered the friendship to end.

Hyon was rumoured to have been accused of featuring in a pornographic film alongside dozens of singers and dancers

Hyon went on to marry an officer in the North Korean military and is believed to have had a baby.

But
 rumours circulated that Kim was still secretly seeing her, which might 
account for reports that he was seen with a mystery woman in the months 
before his marriage to Ri, which was disclosed last  July. Ri and Kim 
are said to have a baby daughter.

Such
 is the secrecy surrounding Kim’s life it was initially reported that Ri
 was the singer who performed a series of bizarrely titled patriotic 
songs that had, apparently, stirred the nation.

However,
 it was really Hyon who had recorded Footsteps of Soldiers, I Love 
Pyongyang, She is a Discharged Soldier and We are Troops of the Party.

Ri
 was also given credit for Excellent Horse-Like Lady – also known as A 
Girl in the Saddle of a Steed – another of Hyon’s songs.

Kim
 has already displayed the ruthlessness that has made his family the 
world’s only communist dynasty, beginning with grandfather Kim Il-sung 
at the end of the Korean War in 1953.

He
 is said to have purged his stepmother from her position as a senior 
official in the ruling party to show his absolute power and had a 
minister executed by mortar round for showing disrespect by drinking 
during the official mourning period after Kim Jong-il’s death.
