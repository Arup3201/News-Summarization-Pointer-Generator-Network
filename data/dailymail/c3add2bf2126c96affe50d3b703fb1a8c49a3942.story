Four adults and three children have died in a massive pre-dawn fire that destroyed a three-story apartment building within minutes on Thursday.

The victims, who have not been identified, were found on the top floor of the building in Lowell, Massachusetts. Nine people were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries and more than 50 people have been left homeless by the blaze, which was the state's deadliest in two decades.

Witnesses described chaotic scenes of adults jumping from windows or dropping their babies into open arms beneath, while firefighters battled treacherous conditions to save residents.

The cause of the fire is being 
investigated but State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said authorities are 
looking into witness reports that the blaze followed an explosion
 that sounded like fireworks.

Deadly: Seven people, including three children, were killed in the massive blaze in Lowell, Massachusetts

Randy Perry, who lives in a building 
next door, said he looked out his window at 4am and saw people gathered 
outside the building as it was consumed by flames.

'I was shocked at how fast the fire moved from one end of the building to the other,' he said.

The 50 residents lived in apartments on upper floors above a liquor store on the ground floor - but the entire building was destroyed in the blaze.

The roof entirely burned away, with the outer walls charred and the siding melted. Firefighters had to evacuate at one point as the roof gave way.

Neighbor Sarin Chun said she awoke to screams and saw someone hand a child out a window to another person on the street.

Witnesses said tenants jumped out of windows. Several people had to be rescued from upper floors.

A police officer on routine patrol was the first to report the fire, while several tenants ran about 100 yards down the street to a fire station to sound the alarm, Fire Chief Edward Pitta said. But the building was fully involved by the time firefighters arrived.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said she is 'deeply concerned' by reports from witnesses that no fire alarms sounded.

The building did not have a sprinkler system but was not required to because of its, Pitta said. It did have an alarm system, and whether that was working will be part of the investigation.

'It's a tragic day for the city of Lowell,' Mayor Rodney Elliott said. 'The entire city mourns the loss.'

The property's owner, Sanjay M. Patel, who also operates the first-floor liquor store, told the Boston Globe that he heard about the fire after receiving multiple phone calls.

'I have no words,' Patel said. 'Iâ€™m in shock.'

He insisted that his property was up to code and had passed every yearly inspection since he bought the building six years ago. Other residents agreed the property was in good condition.

The Red Cross is assisting displaced tenants, and the city is accepting donations of clothing and other essentials. A relief fund has been set up at the Jeanne D'Arc Credit Union in the city.

A chaplain for the fire department, Rev. Paul Clifford, said chaplains were offering what comfort they could to people who escaped

The last time seven people died in a fire in the state was a Christmas Eve blaze in 1994 in North Attleborough.
