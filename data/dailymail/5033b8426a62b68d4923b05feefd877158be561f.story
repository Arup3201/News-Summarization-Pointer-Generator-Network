Two pregnant women who threw bleach out a car window and hit a four-year-old girl have had their jail terms quashed.

The pair have instead been placed on good behaviour bonds.

Sarah Louise Roan, 21, and Lauren Jackson, 22, appealed against the severity of their sentences after they were handed at least six months in prison for hurling Harpic White and Shine from a moving car in northwest Sydney.

The bleach hit a mother and her four-year-old girl, who dropped to the ground and screamed: 'It's stinging! It's stinging!'.

After the girl's eyes swelled up, her mother took her to hospital for treatment.

She suffered no permanent injuries.

On appeal, both women said they did not know they had hit the girl when Jackson threw the bleach out the window at Kellyville Ridge in May last year.

Parramatta District Court heard that Roan was driving when she began throwing a series of items, including a pair of socks and a ball out the window, hitting an oncoming vehicle.

Soon after, Jackson joined her in throwing things from the car, before yelling 'skanks' at two children, believed to be about eight years old.

Jackson then threw the bottle of bleach.

On appeal Jackson said she was 'upset' when she discovered the toilet cleaner gel had struck the four-year-old girl.

The next day Roan handed herself into police.

Jackson's lawyer Greg West argued that some of the facts of the case may have been 'misunderstood' by the magistrate on sentence and argued that neither woman deserved full-time custodial sentences.

He pointed out it could mean both being separated from their soon-to-be born children.

Judge Norman Delaney quashed their sentences on Monday and placed Roan on a six-month good behaviour bond.

Jackson was placed on a two-year bond for one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a six-month bond for one count of assault.
