Grave charges: Laurel Schlemmer, 40, has been charged with homicide after telling police that 'crazy voices' told her to drown her two sons in the bath

A six-year-old Pennsylvania boy whose mother allegedly held him underwater in a bathtub died on Saturday, four days after his younger brother drowned.

The boy, Daniel Schlemmer, had been declared brain dead after authorities say he and his three-year-old brother, Luke, were submerged underwater by their mother at their McCandless home on Tuesday in western Pennsylvania.

Laurel Michelle Schlemmer, 40m is being held in the Allegheny County Jail without bond on criminal homicide and other charges in the death of her younger child.

With Daniel's death, the charges against her are expected to be amended.

County detectives say the mother told them she tried to drown both boys by sitting on them in the tub after a third son left for school.

They say she told investigators she heard "crazy voices" telling her to push the boys underwater.

Daniel had been on life support at a Pittsburgh hospital, according to the prosecutor's office.

Schlemmer didn't speak during a short video conference earlier this week, and her attorney, Michael Machen, declined to comment afterward.

Machen got court permission to have Schlemmer evaluated by a psychiatrist hired by her family.

She appeared in a special vest that is designed to prevent inmates from tearing off their clothes and is on suicide watch at the jail.

County detectives said Schlemmer told them she tried to drown both boys after her 7-year-old son left for school that day.

Schlemmer told detectives she thought she could be a better mother to her oldest son 'if the other two boys weren't around, and they would be better off in heaven', a police complaint said. 

She also told police she got into the tub, fully clothed, and sat on the boys because 'crazy voices were telling her to push the boys down into the water'.

The boys' father, Mark Schlemmer, was at work at the time.

Tight-knit community: The deadly drowning took place in the Schlemmers' home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive in upscale bedroom community of McCandless, Pennsylvania

Child welfare officials are scrutinizing the drowning and the family's contact with Allegheny County's Office of Children, Youth and Families.

The deadly incident comes less than a year after Schlemmer was questioned for nearly running over the two boys. She was never charged.

North Park Church Pastor Dan Hendley said that the van incident happened in the driveway of the boys' grandparents in a town near McCandless, where Schlemmer had been living with her sons.

‘There was no concern that there was anything but a terrible accident that occurred in that situation,’ Hendley said.

Schlemmer also received a citation for leaving a toddler unattended in a parked car September 5, 2009, in nearby Ross Township.

Court records don't indicate which child was in the car, but police said the car's interior was 112 degrees when officers arrived.

Family torn apart: Mrs Schlemmer worked as a teacher until 2004, while her husband of nine years, Mark, is an actuary. Her two youngest sons Luke, 3 (center) and Daniel, 6, (left) were drowned to death on Tuesday

Tragedy struck Tuesday morning after Mrs Schlemmer's seven-year-old son left 
for school.

She put the 
older boy on the bus at around 8.40am, then told the younger boys to 
take off their pajamas and get into the bathtub.

'Schlemmer
 said after the boys got into the tub she got into the tub "fully 
clothed" and "crazy voices" were telling her to push the boys down into 
the water,' the complaint said.

'Schlemmer explained that at one point she [was] sitting on top of boys while they were under the water in the tub.'.

Red flags: Mrs Schlemmer was suspected of trying to back over her children with her car last year, and in 2009, she was cited for leaving one of her kids in a hot car unattended

Schlemmer
 pulled both unconscious boys out of the tub and laid them on the 
bathroom floor while she called 911. She told police she never attempted
 CPR because she did not know how to do it

Paramedics who responded to the colonial home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive rushed Luke and Daniel Schlemmer to UPMC Passavant Hospital, where the younger boy was pronounced dead at around 10.50am.

His brother 
was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's 
Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC, where police said he remained in 
critical condition.

On a 911 call placed just minutes after Schlemmer had
allegedly drowned her children, the mother sounded halting but calm and extremely
polite, reported the Pittsburgh Post--Gazette.

'Um, my two sons,’ Schlemmer said, ‘I think that they’ve, they’ve drowned in our bathtub.’

During the five-minute conversation with the dispatcher, Schlemmer explained that she let her sons to play in the bathtub while she went to the restroom, and by the time she returned to check on them, both children were unconscious.

Later, the operator asked if the boys had anything in their mouths.

'Just water,' the mother replied.

Word that the two little boys were found unresponsive stunned neighbors in the quiet, upscale bedroom community a few miles north of Pittsburgh. 

They described the family as religious and said Schlemmer was a stay-at-home mom.

According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the couple got married in 2005. Mr Schlemmer is employed as an actuary, while his wife worked as a teacher at Kerr Elementary School and Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel School District from 1999 until 2004.

The Schlemmers have been long-time members of the North Park Church congregation, where the wife had been attending Bible studies since her 20s.

‘They were a wonderful couple, strong Christians,’ Rev. Bob Shull, a former associate pastor at the church who officiated the Schlemmers’ wedding ceremony in 2005, told Pittsburgh Tribune Review.

Two bouquets of flowers were tucked Wednesday into a bush at the front of the family's home on a winding street of tidy split-level houses and manicured yards. Mourners also left a small stuffed leopard and a burning votive candle.

Schlemmer
 faces a preliminary hearing April 11. Other charges against her include
 reckless endangerment, aggravated assault and tampering with physical 
evidence, for allegedly hiding her wet clothes in a trash bag and then 
hiding that bag under three other bags.

Pastor
 Hendley and other friends at the evangelical Presbyterian congregation 
were working to help Mark Schlemmer, who is currently staying with a friend. The pastor said the husband was distraught but what happened, but not hostile toward his wife.

‘I'd question whether they're ever going to go back to that house given what's occurred,’ Hendley said.
