McDonald's has been accused of super-sized tax avoidance after apparently dodging more than £700million worth of taxes across Europe.

The American fast food chain funnelled billions of pounds through Luxembourg to reduce its tax bill significantly, according to a report.

Luxembourg has controversially been used as a tax haven by many multi-nationals because it allows companies to pay as little as 1 per cent tax on income. Now, McDonald’s has been branded ‘shameful’ after claims it used an ‘aggressive’ tax loophole to avoid paying around £730million over five years.

According to British charity War On Want – which tackles poverty around the world – McDonald’s opened a Luxembourg-based offshoot called McD Europe Franchising Sarl in 2009, to deal with royalty revenues paid by franchises using its brand. This happened ‘immediately after’ a policy change in the country which allowed these kinds of intellectual property firms to pay lower taxes on income.

The company then routed billions in royalties from its European operations to the Luxembourg outpost, minimising its tax liabilities, the report said.

That same year, McDonald’s also shifted its European headquarters from London to low-tax Geneva, which was viewed as another attempt to reduce its liabilities.

‘As a result, McDonald’s engaged in aggressive and potentially abusive optimisation of its structure which has led to the avoidance of significant amounts of tax,’ the review said. ‘This structure is likely to have cost European governments over 1billion euros [£727million] in lost tax revenues between 2009 and 2013.’

Britain is the third largest European market for McDonald’s after Germany and France, meaning the UK could have lost out on millions of pounds.

The report found that McDonald’s Luxembourg branch registered revenues of £2.7billion over five years, but paid less than £12million of tax. If it had kept these royalties in Europe as ‘profit’, rather than diverting them through Luxembourg, it would have had to pay more than 60 times this amount.

And if it had kept its headquarters in the UK and paid British corporation tax on all the royalties it earned from its European subsidiaries, HM Revenue and Customs could have netted up to £818million extra between 2009 and 2013.

Even if McDonald’s had only paid UK corporation tax on the money it made from British royalties, the taxman would have received £75million more.

While the schemes are not illegal, firms are coming under growing pressure to pay tax in the country they sell their goods – rather than where various headquarters are based.

Amazon, Ikea, Pepsi and Disney are among the other corporations accused of pushing profits through Luxembourg to reduce their tax bill. And McDonald’s has already faced scrutiny of its tax practices in France, with authorities visiting its Paris office last year.

European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the report ‘will be carefully processed’, the Financial Times reported. It was co-written by War On Want alongside three US and European trade unions – EPSU, EFFAT and SEIU.

Jan Willem Goudriaan, of EPSU, said: ‘It is shameful to see that a multibillion euro company, that pays low wages, still seeks to avoid its responsibility to pay its fair share of much-needed taxes to finance public services we all rely on.’

A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘McDonald’s complies with applicable laws, including payments of the taxes that are owed in each country in which we operate. A significant amount of tax is also paid by our franchisees, who make up 73 per cent of McDonald’s restaurant estate in Europe.’
