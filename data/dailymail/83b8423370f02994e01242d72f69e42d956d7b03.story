At least 11 people were killed and dozens more trapped in rubble after a block of flats collapsed in the Indian city of Chennai yesterday.

Five building firm bosses have been arrested over the disaster, which happened when the 11-storey building was still under contruction.

It was the second deadly building collapse in India within a single day as the heavy monsoon rains had a devastating effect on shoddily built structures.

Disaster: 11 people died when a block of flats which was under construction collapsed

Mission: Dozens of rescuers were deployed at the scene to save workers who were trapped inside

Victim: An injured woman is removed from the rubble of the building and taken to hospital

Rescuers at the scene of the disaster in the Chennai suburb of Porur were today using gas cutters and shovels to hunt for those believed still to be trapped inside.

The building came down yesterday at a time when 90 contract workers were in the basement collecting their wages.

Four people were found dead in the ruins and seven more were taken to hospital where they later died.

As many as 60 people could still be trapped in the rubble, according to police, with some heard crying out for help.

Operation: Diggers were used to clear large concrete blocks and allow rescuers to dig deeper

Army: The volunteers donned hard hats and high-visibility jackets to help look for survivors

Tragedy: Workers remove the body of one of those killed in the collapse of the 11-storey complex

Help: One survivor who was able to stand up received the attention of the volunteers

Officials used cranes to shift concrete blocks before dozens of rescuers deployed smallers tools to dig deeper inside.

One of the builders, Balaguru, suggested that the building might have collapsed after being struck by lightning.

'Usually, once the construction gets over we install the equipment to prevent the building from a thunder strike. It was nearing completion,' he said.

A police officer said that five officials from Prime Sristi, the construction firm building the complex, had been arrested as part of the investigation into the tragedy.

Building: The complex was located in the suburb of Porur on the outskirts of Chennai

Bystanders: Workers watch the ongoing efforts to rescue survivors

Earlier on Saturday, 11 people were killed when a smaller building collapsed in a slum area of the country's capital New Delhi.

The spate of building collapses has been blamed on runaway demand for housing and weak regulations, which encourage builders to cut corners and use substandard materials.

Last year, India saw its worst building disaster for decades when an eight-story complex in Mumbai collapsed, killing 74 people.
