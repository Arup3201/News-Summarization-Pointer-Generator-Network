A father who sought surrogacy overseas in India after trying for five years to adopt in Australia has called the case of rejected surrogate baby Gammy 'abhorrent'.

Sam Everingham, who runs a support group for Australian families going through surrogacy, said he is appalled by the couple who left six-month-old Gammy behind with his poor Thai surrogate mother because he has Down syndrome.

The couple from WA took Gammy's healthy sister home to Australia and left 21-year-old mother Pattaramon Chanbua to care for him despite his congenital heart condition.

'I was appalled by that. We want best practice around the world. For many of our parents the thought of leaving one behind is abhorrent, it’s really hard to understand,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Speaking on Monday, Everingham called for the Australian government to better support the hundreds of desperate families seeking surrogacy overseas.

He suffered a 'tough' and heartbreaking experience after he and his partner were forced to go to India to have children.

He lost two baby boys in a Delhi hospital in 2009 before a surrogate gave birth to his three-year-old twin girls in 2011.

Everingham said he and his partner Phillip Copeland travelled to India because 'same sex couples were placed at the bottom of the waiting list for adoption' in Australia.

He explained there was at least a seven-year waiting list for heterosexual couples which made the adoption process 'beyond consideration'.

‘We didn’t have any sisters, my partner or I, that were able to carry for us and we weren’t willing to ask a friend to carry. We thought that was too risky, emotionally, psychologically.’

The couple had been trying for about five years to adopt and he said overseas surrogacy is only usually an option after ‘most couples have thought long and hard for many years’.

Everingham believes Australia’s laws discriminate against all childless couples.

'There is no support. That needs to be changed. There should be Medicare rebates for at least the heterosexual market that can’t carry children instead of them paying $16,000 for each IVF cycle,' he said.

Describing his surrogacy experience in India, Everingham said 'it was a pretty touch journey'.

He and his partner first created embryos with his sperm and a donor's eggs in 2009.

Their Indian surrogate gave birth prematurely at 26 weeks to twins. One of the babies was stillborn and the other was seriously ill and died seven weeks later.

'That was one of the reasons we set up the not for profit organisation,' Everingham, who is the director of Families Through Surrogacy, said.

'There was no support for us at home or abroad and we continue to see situations with no support or counselling,' he explained.

Everingham and his partner’s second try for babies led to two different surrogates having one healthy girl each in 2011.

Talking about his children Ruby and Zoe, Everingham said: 'It's wonderful, it's changed our lives.

'I can see why some many people ego through so many hard years. It is so wonderful.'

He explained how he now understands why 'people will go to great financial and emotional risks, and people will travel and break laws' to have children.
