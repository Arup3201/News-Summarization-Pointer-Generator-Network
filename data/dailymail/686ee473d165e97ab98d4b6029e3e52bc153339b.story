Show of support: GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry spoke out in support of the Marines who urinated on dead Afghans

GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry is accusing the Obama administration of 'over-the-top rhetoric' and 'disdain for the military' in its condemnation of a video that purportedly shows Marines urinating on dead bodies in Afghanistan.

No one has been charged in the case, but officials in the U.S. and abroad have called for swift punishment of the four Marines.

A military criminal investigation and an internal Marine Corps review are under way.

The Geneva Convention forbids the desecration of the dead.

Perry told CNN that he thinks the Marines involved should be reprimanded, but not pursued with criminal charges.

Perry said: '18-19-year-old kids make stupid mistakes all too often and that's what's occurred here.'

Although
the vast majority of people are outraged over the deplorable behaviour 
of the four Marines shown 
in a video circulating the internet, controversial comedian Bill Maher 
and one CNN contributor have also said they support their actions.

'A dead body is just, you know a f***ing body that's dead and it just doesn't bother me,' Mr Maher said on his HBO show Real Time With Bill Maher.

'If they were real Taliban, if they were people who burned down girls' schools, and, you know, do honor rapes and throw acid in people's faces, I'm not that upset about p***ing on them,' he continued.

Mr Maher's statements came after those of a conservative CNN contributor who said she would happily join the Marines. Dana Loesch made the comments on her own Missouri radio show and not on CNN.

She said: 'C'mon people, this is a war. 'Do I have a problem with that as a 
citizen of the United States? No, I don't.'

She added that she wants 'a million cool points for these guys' and would be willing to join them.

'Can someone explain to me if there is
supposed to be a scandal that someone pees on the corpse of a Taliban 
fighter -- someone who as part of an organization murdered over 3,000 
Americans,' she said.

'I'd drop trou and do it too. That's me, though…Come on people this is a war.'

CNN said its independent contributors often expressed their views, independent of their roles with the network. A spokesman added: 'CNN contributors 
are commentators who express a wide range of viewpoints - on and off of 
CNN - that often provoke strong agreement or disagreement. Their 
viewpoints are their own.'

Horrifying: A video posted online claims to show four Marines urinating on dead bodies

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Captain Tim Kudo, a former Marine and representative of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that the men cannot consider themselves soldiers because of their offensive actions.

‘I don't see them as Marines,’ he said

‘I see them as people who have set 
back the war effort, put their fellow Marines in danger, and who stand 
in contradiction to pretty much everything the Marine Corps stands for 
and America stands for. So, it's very hard to look at them and see them 
as Marines in that way,’ Mr Kudo said on CBS.

‘Every Marine was absolutely shocked 
by what happened. Nobody would have expected something like this, not 
just from a unit, but any Marine in general.

‘These actions are completely outside the norm, and basically a few individuals who went rogue,’ he concluded.

Grinning: One of the men can be heard saying: 'Have a great day, buddy' as his colleagues laugh and another jokes: 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!'

The four Marines in the video have been 
identified and are members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp
Lejeune in North Carolina.

There has been nearly universal condemnation of the soldiers since the video began circulating earlier this week. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai and Senator John McCain are among the biggest names to express their anger.

Florida Representative Allen West, an ex-Army lieutenant colonel, insisted the Marines were wrong but fumed: ‘As for everyone else, unless you have been shot at by the Taliban, shut your mouth, war is hell.’

 ‘All these over-emotional pundits and armchair quarterbacks need to chill,’ Mr West told the Weekly Standard of their 'self-righteous indignation'. But he said the men must face a ‘maximum punishment’.

A spokeswoman for the Marines said: 'While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps'

In addition he suggested they all receive a reprimand letter, issue a public apology to God, the U.S. and their fellow servicemen - and then sing ‘the full US Marine Corps Hymn without a teleprompter’.

The Navy's law enforcement arm is heading the main inquiry, which is expected to weigh evidence of violations of the U.S. military legal code as well as the international laws of warfare.

Separately, the Marine Corps is doing its own internal investigation. Pentagon officials said the criminal investigation would likely look into whether the Marines violated laws of war.

These include prohibitions against photographing or mishandling bodies and detainees. It also appeared to violate the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs conduct.

Thus, some or all of the four Marines could face a military court-martial or other disciplinary action.

The psychologist's advice came as U.S. officials spoke out against the footage yesterday and scrambled to maintain damage limitation and avoid another Abu Ghraib scandal.

The four were members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, reported CNN. An unidentified official said that some of the four are no longer in that battalion.

The 40-second clip, which has been described a 'recruitment tool for the Taliban', shows four men in combat gear standing over the three corpses with their genitals exposed as they relieve themselves.

There were no further details on their identities. The men can be heard joking 'Have a great day, buddy', 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' as they groan with relief whilst urinating.

It is not clear if the corpses in the video belong to civilians or insurgents engaged in combat, although the film does appear to have been shot in Afghanistan.

The anonymous person who posted it included the caption: 'Scout sniper team 4 with 3rd battalion 2nd marines out of camp lejeune peeing on dead talibans.'

Camp Lejeune is in North Carolina and is the largest Marine Corps Base on the East Coast of the U.S., home to 40,000 marines.

The 3rd Batallion 2nd Marines consists of 800 Marines and sailors and is nicknamed the 'Betio Bastards', a reference to the island of Betio in the Tawara Atoll and the site of one of the most deadly battles with the Japanese in World War II.

More recently they have served in Iraq, the Haiti earthquake of 2010 and in Afghanistan. Their motto is: 'We quell the storm, and ride the thunder!' or 'Strength and Honour'.

NATOThe NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan described the acts as 'highly reprehensible and disgusting'. ISAF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jimmie Cummings said: 'The behaviour depicted in this video is reprehensible and is not in keeping with the values of U.S. Armed Forces.'

'This matter will be fully investigated and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.'PentagonThe government body's spokesman Navy Captain John Kirby said the video was deeply troubling: 'Whoever it is, and whatever the circumstances, which we know is under investigation, it is egregious behaviour.'

Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense'Those found to have engaged in such conduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent,' Mr Panetta said. He told the commander of western troops in Afghanistan to launch an investigation.Hamid Karzai, President of AfghanistanAfghan president Hamid Karzai said in a statement: 'The government of Afghanistan is deeply disturbed by a video that shows American soldiers desecrating the dead bodies of three Afghans. This act by American soldiers is simply inhumane and condemnable in the strongest possible terms.

 The Council on Islamic-American Relations, civil rights group
The prominent Muslim civil rights and advocacy group based in 
Washington, wrote a letter to Defence Secretary Leon Panetta condemning 
the video.
