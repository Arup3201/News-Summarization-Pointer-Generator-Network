A new attraction where children as young as 13 fire military-grade weapons in zombie, gangster and cowboy-themed simulators has been slammed by gun control campaigners.

Although management claim their Orlando, Florida, attraction provides a safe place for the use of firearms, critics claim it is unsuitable for an area known for its child-friendly attractions.

The website for the business - named Machine Gun America - states it is Orlando's 'first automatic adrenaline attraction'.

It explains: 'Whether you're looking to unleash your inner action star or become a zombie hunter, experience the exhilarating rush of shooting real machine guns and powerful firearms for a thrill like any other.'

But Lucia Kay McBath, a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, said: 'You've got Holy Land right there in Orlando. You've got Disney World, and Epcot. All places for family fun where they should feel protected,' WTSP reported.

Machine Gun America's management claim it is an attraction, not a firing range, and customers cannot bring their own weapons to shoot. Guests must be 13 years old and no alcohol will be sold.

Wes Doss,  Machine Gun America's safety and training officer, said it was unlike any other experience in the country.

'The live shooting experiences will include themed packages featuring some of the most famous firearms from around the world.'

General Manager Bruce Nierenberg also defended accusations the attraction was unsuitable for children.

'No one ever shoots by themselves, and no guest is ever in control of the weapon without a range safety officer next to them and participating with them,' he told WTSP.

The business is due to open on Saturday.

In late August, a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot dead firing range instructor Charles Vacca, 39, after an Uzi she was firing recoiled upwards out of her grip.

The shocking recording taken by the girl's parents and released by police shows Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode. 

Mr Vacca died after being fatally struck in the head.
