A careless council has been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after it painted new white lines on a potholed road before covering them over with tarmac.

Flood water had ravaged Whiteway Road, in Kent, leaving it pockmarked with dozens of dangerous craters.

Kent County Council workers arrived but ignored the potholes and instead painted new white lines through them - only to return days later to re-tarmac the whole road.

Before: Council staff went to Whiteway Road to re-paint the white lines but ignored the potholes

After: Despite painting new white lines, workers were called back to the street days later to re-tarmac the road

Taxi driver Neil McLennan, 42, of Queenborough, Kent, said: 'It’s shocking. Why can’t they set it up where somebody does the potholes first and then paint the lines?

'However much it costs to fill in the lines on the road they are going to have to do it again.

'Kent Highways is always saying, well we haven’t got the money to repair the roads. Well stop wasting it then. It’s really not rocket science.'

A spokesman from Kent County Council yesterday admitted it should have painted the road markings after the repair work was completed and pledged to spend another £3million tackling potholes in the county.

He said: 'We have just experienced the wettest winter on record. In many cases we’ve seen a week’s rain fall in just a few hours, leading to widespread flooding and high water levels. This has led to an increase in potholes.

'We are poised to begin a countywide drive to fix potholes now that the weather is becoming drier.

'In this instance the white-lining, which was also essential maintenance work, should have followed the pothole repairs that have now taken place in Whiteway Road, Queenborough.'
