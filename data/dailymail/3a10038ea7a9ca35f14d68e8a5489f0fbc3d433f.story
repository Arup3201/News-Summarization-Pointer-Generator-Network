The Seattle Seahawks self-proclaimed 'best cornerback in the NFL' roared into the Super Bowl on a wave of publicity generated by his trash talk but bowed out with a whimper.

Richard Sherman said after the game he suffered a high ankle sprain in the first quarter but stayed in until further aggravating it early in the fourth - he was taken off the field on a cart.

Sherman was seen later in the game with a boot on his right foot and walking around using crutches.

He finished the game with only one pass defended and three tackles, and his presence in the game wasn't enough to stop Denver quarterback Peyton Manning from throwing in his direction.

Sherman's job was to cover Demaryius Thomas, number one corner versus number one receiver.

Manning completed a Super Bowl-record 14 passes, including a late touchdown, to Thomas.

The Broncos QB famously responded during Super Bowl media day to Sherman saying he throws 'ducks' by saying 'they were touchdown ducks.'

Sherman attributed the lackluster performance in on the game's biggest stage to the ankle sprain in a post-game interview with Westwood One Radio, according to NBC Sports.

High ankle sprains usually heal with rest, but some require surgery.

Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Roddy White, a perennial all-pro, suffered through the 2013 season with a severe high ankle sprain that sidelined him for the eight games and left him a shell of his former self the rest of the way.

White is expected to be back up to speed by the time NFL training camps start in July, it is still too early to tell what Sherman's prognosis is.
