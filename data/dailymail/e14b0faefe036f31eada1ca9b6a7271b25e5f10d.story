Almost £400million was wiped off the value of Sainsbury’s shares at one 
point yesterday after chief executive Justin King announced he is 
stepping down.

Mr King, who has spent a decade at the supermarket’s 
helm, is credited with taking Sainsbury’s from strength to strength, 
despite the cost of living crisis that has hurt customers.

He is 
considered a retail success story and is now much sought-after, with 
speculation linking him with top jobs ranging from M&S to Formula 1.

During
 his tenure, the store’s profits have almost trebled to £756million, 
while sales have increased by 59 per cent. At the same time the number 
of customers visiting stores has risen by around ten million a week.

Recent
 success has been built around an expansion of the ‘Local’ convenience 
stores and promotions such as ‘Feed Your Family for a Fiver’.

Mr 
King, who was raised in Solihull, West Midlands, joined Sainsbury’s in 
March 2004 from Marks & Spencer, where he was head of the retail 
group’s food department.

The 52-year-old father of two enjoys the 
limelight and a flamboyant approach to public relations, which means 
always being ready to fight Sainsbury’s corner in TV and radio 
interviews.

During his tenure, he has masterminded a successful 
commercial partnership with Jamie Oliver and, more recently, David 
Beckham.

He also made great play of a decision to ditch his Maserati 
Quattroporte, an £80,000 sports car, in favour of a ‘green’ Lexus 
limousine, at £88,000, for his commute to London.

The Manchester 
United fan, who lives near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has listed his 
recreations as coaching a village football team and sailing.

News of 
the departure of Mr King, who will step down in July, saw the firm’s 
share price drop by 5.8 per cent at one stage, taking the firm’s market 
value down by some £395million to £6.38billion.

At the end of the 
day’s trading shares were down by 2.3 per cent, equating to a fall in 
value of £156million. This drop signalled some concerns about the 
future  of the UK’s joint second-largest supermarket.

Sainsbury’s grew sales by 3.1 per cent in
 the 12 weeks to January 5, Kantar said, ahead of the 2.9 per cent 
market growth maintaining its market share of 17.1 per cent.

Its market 
share is under threat from the budget chains Aldi and Lidl on one side 
and supermarket rivals Waitrose and Marks & Spencer on the other. At
 the same time, there is pressure from the likes of Tesco and Asda – and
 now Morrisons.

Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: 
‘Supermarket retailing is getting a bit tougher and it’s understandable 
[King] wants to go out on a high note.’

Mr King has not lined up another
 job but said he felt young enough to take another ‘big one’, although a
 non-compete deal rules him out of taking a role with a rival grocery 
chain for 12 months.

He said: ‘There’s plenty of energy left in the old 
dog yet. I’m sure the right opportunity will come along and I’ll know 
what it is when I see it.’

Mr King is being replaced by the firm’s 
commercial director, Mike Coupe, 53, a former director of Big Food Group
 and Iceland, who has been at Sainsbury’s for ten years. Analyst Clive 
Black said:

‘Coupe represents continuity for Sainsbury’s, something that
 may reassure investors who will naturally be a little disconcerted by 
change.’

In the grey world of Britain’s corporate elite, Justin King stands apart from the crowd.

He is the supermarket boss with the market stall-holder’s gift of the gab, and an orange perma-tan and head of lustrous chestnut locks that look more suited to a daytime television presenter.

Gregarious and with tremendous self-confidence, he is the opposite of his former great rival, the taciturn and now retired Tesco chief, Sir Terry Leahy.

Behind King’s love of showmanship and the limelight is an extremely sharp brain that is able to respond to any question about his business with rapid-fire facts and figures.

Over his ten years at the helm, he has turned around a failing family-controlled enterprise. His great achievement was to reposition Sainsbury’s as a favourite place to shop for aspirational families who might otherwise be seduced by rival Waitrose, with its more upmarket image.

The value placed on King was reflected in the sharp fall yesterday in the Sainsbury’s share price following news of his departure.

In 2004 he took over a dispirited company that had been pummelled by falling market share under the stewardship of David Sainsbury (the last family member at the helm) and wasteful investment decisions taken by Sainsbury’s successor Sir Peter Davis, who was ignominiously ejected from his job.

King moved rapidly to turn the business around. Part of his whirlwind approach involved cleverly anticipating people’s preference for smaller convenience stores that were within walking distance of their homes and widening choice to include clothing.

The result was spectacular, with profits tripling during his decade in charge – from £254million to £756million in the last full financial year – comfortably outdistancing King’s former employers, M&S.

The group moved from a standing start to become the seventh-largest clothing retailer in the UK and launched its own fashion brand ‘Tu’. 

King has an instinctive nose for the 
nation’s food habits. Apart from emphasising the supermarket’s ‘quality’
 image through its Taste the Difference range, he hired the nation’s 
favourite television chef Jamie Oliver to promote its image and 
products.

But perhaps his greatest achievement was to exploit technology in harness with attractive promotions in a way that entrenched customer loyalty.

For example, check-out tills were designed to automatically ‘price-match’ items with those of rival supermarket so that shoppers could see that the prices they were paying at Sainsbury’s were cheaper (or if not, they got a voucher to use the next time they shopped at the store).

This was a revolutionary piece of marketing. Ahead of his rivals, King seized the possibilities of online shopping and Sainsbury’s now does £1billion of its annual sales of £25.6billion on the net.

Politically, he is not shy of expressing his forthright views: putting up a good case for lower taxes during an appearance on BBC1’s Question Time.

However, he was also tackled by the audience over high levels of boardroom pay. King notoriously claimed that his own £900,000 salary (40 times the average Sainsbury’s employee) was modest.

In fact, his total annual remuneration (including pension contributions, share options and benefits) was £2.6million.

He also became embroiled in the horse meat scandal. At first, King claimed Sainsbury’s had not mislabelled any meat but then had to remove meat burgers from shelves after concern that they might have become contaminated.

Whoever takes over from grammar school-educated King will have a tough task. Sainsbury’s Christmas sales figures showed some of the momentum he had built up – to gain a 17 per cent share of the market – was fading.

The invasion of German-owned Aldi and Lidl will be a formidable challenge for those now charge if they are to replicate the savvy, showmanship and success of King Justin.
