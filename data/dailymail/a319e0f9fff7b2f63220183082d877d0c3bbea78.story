Bill Craven, 74, steered his coach to safety after suffering a heart attack

Family and friends have paid tribute to a bus driver who managed to steer his coach to safety as he was dying after suffering a heart attack.

Bill Craven, 74, drove his 60-seater holiday coach to the side of the road after falling ill and clipping a lamppost on the A1 motorway near Gateshead.

The grandfather-of-three from Newcastle, was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead but died shortly afterwards despite attempts to save him.

His actions meant that the 46 passengers on board suffered no injuries, with only one other passenger taken to hospital and another seen by paramedics at the scene.

The coach, which had adults and children on board, was travelling from Newcastle to Ambleside for a three-day holiday over the bank holiday weekend.

Today his family said they had lost a dad, grandad and friend, while his employers Bells Coaches have commended Bill, who worked for the company for 16 years, for his bravery.

Managing director Michael Bell said: 'Bill's actions whilst he was sufferinghis heart attack were heroic - he drove the bus away from the carriageway,brought it to a halt and stopped the engine - putting the safety of his passengers before his own.

'We will always be incredibly proud of Bill for what he did that day, and for the way he represented our business every day he worked for us.'

Floral tributes still mark the spot where the accident happened and Mr Cravenâ€™s workcolleagues described him as a kind and thoughtful man, who lived for his family.

Mr Craven's funeral was held on Thursday at West Road Crematorium Chapel.

Thanks to Mr Craven's bravery, forty six passengers on board suffered no injuries

Firefighters from the surrounding area and two helicopters were called to the scene

His son Brian, 44, said: 'He was my best friend and we'llmiss him. He was an experienced driver and he loved meeting new people and taking them to new places. He was caring, polite and had integrity.'

He added: 'What I thought was very touching,was a lady on the bus who helped him came to his funeral to express her condolence. She introduced herself to me. It was a lovely thing for a stranger to do.'

Mr Bell added: "We were privileged to have Bill work for us for over sixteen years. Throughout that time, he was a first-class colleague and employee.

Paramedics treated one passenger at the scene and took Mr Craven and another person to hospital

'The numerous messages of condolence that we have received since he died, are testament to the high esteem in which he was held by customers and other coach operators alike. They have highlighted Bill's professionalism, kindness and thoughtfulness to others.'

After the incident, firefighters from the surrounding area were called but passengers had got off the bus before they arrived.

Two helicopters were also dispatched to the scene but did not need to land.

Mr Craven leaves behind his partner, a son, two step-children and three grandchildren.
