Carlo Ancelotti has ruled out a homecoming for Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United, guaranteeing the Portugal star will remain at Real Madrid for the forseeable future.

Ronaldo has proved himself as one of football's greatest during five years in Spain since a £80million move, but has suggested in the past that he wouldn't say no to a return to United.

However, Ancelotti has rubbished any talk of a prospective move, claiming the Champions League holders need the 'best player in the world' on their side.

'Everyone can be changed and substituted but Ronaldo is now the best in the world and it means Madrid lose the best player which is a huge loss,' Ancelotti told The Sun.

'But this won't happen. Because Ronaldo will go to the end of his career at Real Madrid. I'm 100 per cent certain he will be here next season not at Manchester United — 100 per cent.' 

'He's happy here, he's loved here by everyone. It's a perfect relationship at this moment so I don't think it will change. Ronaldo will finish his career here.'

Ronaldo told Sportsmail in September that he would 'love to return to Manchester United one day', while the new manager at Old Trafford Louis van Gaal, also confessed he would like to see a deal happen.

But the comments from Ancelotti seem to dispel any hope the United fans might have held.

The Italian's new band of Galacticos are back on English soil this week as they face Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday night.

Raheem Sterling could be in action against a side who were reportedly interested in acquiring his services, but the former Chelsea manager has similarly dismissed those reports, too.

'To think of another striker for the Real Madrid attack is really extremely difficult. It's clear that Sterling is not in our plans,' he said.

Real Madrid are in ominous form ahead of the Champions League game, beating Levante 5-0 in la Liga on Saturday.
