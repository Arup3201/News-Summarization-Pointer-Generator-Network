First lady Michelle Obama has taken heat for her low-calorie and low-fat push in school lunchrooms and vending machines, but her punishing food austerity has spared the White House occupants whom her husband needs to please most: journalists.

The White House press corps doesn't get many perks – tiny bathrooms, tinier cubicles and awful coffee are the norm –and reporters pay for their own snacks.

But while soy chips and apple slices have replaced Kit Kat bars and Doritos in hundreds of thousands of vending machines nationwide, the one adjacent to the White House press briefing room has escaped untouched.

One reporter snapped a photo of the machine's artery-clogging jackpot, a 590-calorie 'jumbo honey bun.' There was only one left in the machine, suggesting that it's among the most popular offerings.

The pastry packs 17 grams of saturated fat, 360 milligrams of sodium and 30 grams of sugar.

Breakfast of champions? White House reporters, photographers and video camera operators have a smorgasbord of snacks to choose from that would make the first lady's blood boil

Power lunch: Mrs. Obama has championed the eviction of added fat, sugar and salt from school lunchrooms, but hasn't yet taken her food sledgehammer to the press corps that will help frame her husband's legacy 

World Health Organization nutritionists recommend a daily sugar intake of 25 grams, and scientists at University College London recommended this week that a better target would be just 14 grams – an even more unrealistic number for most.

But either way, a single honey bun would put a hungry deadline-driven journalist on Mrs. Obama's 'naughty' list.

The Broad Street Bakery brand pastry sells for $1.50 and is made by Flowers Foods, which also manufactures Nature's Own breads and Tastykake snacks.

Other Broad Street snacks available in the White House press snack machine this week included 'chocolate frosted creme cakes,' 'rich frosted mini donuts' and 'double chocolate cupcakes.'

One member of the White House daily print press pool told MailOnline with his best Mel Gibson 'Braveheart' accent that 'the Obamas can take our weekends, and they can take our holidays – but they can't take away our gargantuan glazed donuts!'

The journalist begged to not be identified, and MailOnline obliged.

The new normal: Vending machines in American schools are now mostly chock full of healthier but less popular options

The first lady made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat.

School nutritionists and foodservice workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs. Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales.

Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. 

Mrs. Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'

But for now, at least, she's leaving the journalists who will help frame the president's legacy alone.

And that, said MailOnline's cheeky William Wallace impersonator from the White House press corps, is in the Obama administration's best interest.

'If they started rationing sugar and fat around here,' he grimaced, 'you'd have a lot of sluggish people in the briefing room when the 1:00 briefing starts. You don't want cranky, hungry reporters peppering you with questions.

Of course, he added, 'we'd probably just double our coffee intake. Or open a bodega on the South Lawn.' 

Best option for White House correspondents if the snack machine should go the way of the ashtray? The black market, one reporter chuckles
