Locked up: Thomas Coutts has been jailed for ten years after he grabbed a 20-year-old woman from behind and dragged her into bushes where he gagged, handcuffed and raped her at knifepoint

A rapist who attacked a random woman because he was angry at being dumped by his girlfriend made a 'pinky promise' with his terrified victim not to kill her.

Thomas Coutts, 21, grabbed the 20-year-old woman from behind and dragged her into bushes where he gagged, handcuffed and raped her at knifepoint.

During the brutal attack, Coutts locked his little finger with hers and promised he would not kill the terrified woman after she begged for her life.

Afterwards, Coutts ran off leaving the traumatised victim to stagger into the road to raise the alarm.

He was arrested for the rape in Poole, Dorset, and jailed for 10 years by a judge who said he had 'eked out his revenge' on the unfortunate victim after being dumped.

Coutts, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, went out at 1am armed with a knife and handcuffs and 'selected' the woman as she walked home alone while listening to music on her headphones.

He placed his hand over her mouth and forced her into nearby bushes and began tearing her clothes with the knife.

Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, read out a statement on behalf of the woman to Bournemouth Crown Court at the sentencing hearing.

It said: 'I immediately started screaming and I was pulled to the ground and the man kept telling me to be quiet.

'I told him "I'm not going to make any noise, just please don't kill me, I'm not going to recognise you".'

Miss Branford-Wood said: 'She made a determined decision not to look at him in the face so that by not being able to recognise him she hoped that would safeguard her in some way.

'He kissed her and promised he was not going to hurt her, and held her little finger with his and said he was making a pinky promise, as he called it.'

The court heard that the woman was now too scared to go out alone and had lost her job since the attack.

Investigation: Police officers assess the scene in Poole, Dorset, where the attack took place in August last year

Coutts pleaded guilty to charges of rape and sexual assault that happened on August 20 last year.

In a pre-sentence report his ex-girlfriend, who has a young child by him, described how Coutts had a 'controlling sexual nature towards her'.

Judge John Harrow told him: 'It would seem that after your girlfriend told you she wanted to end your relationship you decided to eke your revenge out on an unfortunate young woman.

'You went out at night armed with a knife and handcuffs and selected your victim, a clearly vulnerable young woman who was oblivious to any danger.

'This must have been a terrifying and almost indescribable experience for her.

'I've read what your girlfriend said about you and you had a rough and controlling sexual nature towards her.'

The judge said he was handing Coutts an extended prison sentence because he is 'dangerous'.

Miss Branford-Wood, crown advocate for the CPS Wessex, said afterwards: 'This young woman has clearly been the victim of a terrifying ordeal.

'She is to be commended not only for having the courage to report this crime but also in supporting a prosecution.

'We hope that this conviction and sentence will bring some closure to the victim and will enable her to move on with her life.'

Coutts must serve two-thirds of his 10 year sentence before being considered for release and will then serve five years on licence.
