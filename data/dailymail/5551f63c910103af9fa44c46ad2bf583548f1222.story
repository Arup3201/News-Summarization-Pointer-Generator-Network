The St. Louis Cardinals were delayed for six hours in advance of Game 6 of the World Series after their team plane got grounded by mechanical problems.

The players and their families were stuck on the tarmac at St Lambert Airport in St. Louis.

'Everyone is just 
watching movies,' Michael Wacha said from the plane, a couple of hours into the
delay.

'They've got dinner on here for us and stuff. Everyone is just 
walking around. Nobody is in a bad mood or anything like that. The 
attitude is pretty good.'

Manager Mike Matheny even did his scheduled news conference with reporters at Fenway via phone while sitting aboard the plane.

'Yeah, we've been sitting on the runway for a while,' he said.

'But everybody seems to be doing all 
right. We're fortunate that our club allows our families to travel with 
us. We have some younger kids. But I'm impressed with how everybody has 
handled it. Fortunately we have plenty of food, snacks for the kids, 
lots of entertainment with on-board movies, and everybody travels with 
all their high-tech stuff. Most of these kids are pretty happy that 
they're not in school right now, and it's a great way to spend a day, 
and no complaints so far.'

The
team was not scheduled to undergo a workout at Fenway so Matheny did 
not anticipate the delay having much of an effect, reported ESPN.

Players and fans alike used the hashtag #CardsPlaneProblems to tweet entertaining scenarios and reasoning for the delay including playing on the Game 3 obstruction call by photo-shopping Red Sox' Will Middlebrooks in front of the delayed plane, reported KMOV.COM.

It took all day before the Cardinals 
finally arrived in Boston, trailing the Red Sox 3-2 going into Game 6 on
Wednesday night.

Their flight took off about 9:10 p.m. EDT after a 
delay that appeared to last around 6 hours and landed shortly after 11 
p.m.

Game 6 of the World Series is scheduled for Wednesday night in Boston.
