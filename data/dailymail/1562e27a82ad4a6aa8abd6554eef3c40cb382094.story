Considering the violent and bloody battlefield death of the monarch it is thought to belong to, this skull seems in remarkably good condition.

Particularly as it is part of a skeleton which has spent more than 500 years beneath what is now a social services office car park.

But this morning, archaeologists searching for Richard III’s remains will release the results of DNA tests which are expected to confirm this was indeed the head which once bore the English crown.

Royal remains? The skull of the skeleton found in a Leicester car par. It is thought it could be that of Richard III

The skull was part of a skeleton – complete with a metal arrowhead embedded in its spine and signs of ‘battle trauma’ – which was unearthed by University of Leicester archaeologists in September, two weeks after they began excavating the city centre site of the former Greyfriars church. The last medieval king of England died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, defeated by an army led by Henry Tudor.

According to historical records, his body was taken 15 miles to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of his death before being buried in the Franciscan friary.

When the body was unearthed in the council-owned Grey Friars car park, it was discovered the skeleton had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head consistent with recorded details of both the monarch’s appearance and 1485 death – prompting those involved in the dig to herald the find as ‘momentous’.

Tantalisingly, only the front of the skull was visible on the image released by the university yesterday. But at today’s ‘major announcement’, the skeleton is expected to be crowned that of Richard III.

Dr Jo Appleby, a lecturer in Human Bioarchaeology at the university’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History, who has carried out months of analysis of the remains, said: ‘The skull was in good condition, although fragile and was able to give us detailed information about this individual.

‘It has been CT scanned at high resolution in order to allow us to investigate interesting features in as much detail as possible.

‘In order to determine whether this is Richard III we have built up a biological profile of its characteristics.

‘We have also carefully examined the skeleton for traces of a violent death.’

It is also expected to be confirmed that the skeleton was buried in neither a shroud nor a coffin which, while unusual for a medieval king, ties in with historical accounts that Richard was ‘irreverently buried’ by his successor Henry VII.

As well as comparing DNA from the bones with that of a direct descendant of the king’s sister, Anne of York, they have been subject to carbon dating – which can date bones to between 70 and 100 years – and other studies including environmental analysis.

Richard Taylor, deputy registrar of the University of Leicester, said the findings could ‘prove to be one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of recent times’.

A documentary on the dig will be shown on Channel 4 at 9pm tonight.
