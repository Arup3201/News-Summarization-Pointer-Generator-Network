A jealous husband stabbed his beautician wife so forcefully the murder weapon broke into three pieces, a court was told today.

Witness Gennaro DeMarco told jurors in Manhatten, New York, that victim Denise Kenny screamed 'No! No! No!' as husband Michael knifed her to death with a six-inch kitchen knife.

The salon worker said: 'And then from there I heard just screams - muffled screams.'

Michael Kenny, 42, of Rockaway Park, Queens, is accused of killing his wife in her  salon in the city's Garment District.

After plunging the weapon into her chest, limbs and hand, he apparently cleaned out the cash register and fled to Maryland, where he was caught the next day.

Prosecutors displayed crime scene photos showing the West 35th Street salon's blood-splattered bathroom after the March, 2011, killing.

It happened in March, 2011, at the D'Galina's Center between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, the New York Post reported.

In his opening statement, defense lawyer Kevin Canfield argued that Kenny mentally 'snapped' over his wife's infidelities, and should be convicted only of manslaughter.

Mr Canfield said the husband lost his mind after his wife sent a topless photo of herself to his cell phone.

Kenny later admitted that the intended recipient had been her ex-husband in Trinidad, the lawyer told jurors.

Kevin Michael Canfield, asked jurors to convict him only on manslaughter because of Kenny's 'paranoid mind', adding: 'Out of his mind, he had no control at that point in time because of what happened. I’m not saying it’s an excuse. No one deserved to die.'

But prosecutor Linda Ford told jurors in her opening statement that the husband came to the salon prepared for revenge.

She said he brought a six-inch kitchen knife and rifled through the cash register before fleeing.

The court heard Kenny has a long history of robberies, violence, and drug issues, the New York Post reported.

The trial continues.
