Marouane Fellaini appeared oblivious to the fact his designated mascot before Belgium's game against South Korea on Thursday rivalled him in the hair department.

The 26-year-old lined up for the anthems alongside a youngster who seemed to have modelled himself on the gangly midfielder, with the player stoney-faced.

He has been busy showing Manchester United fans exactly why they chose to splurge so much money on him from Everton last summer with a string of good performances at this summer's World Cup.

Marc Wilmots' side comfortably qualified out of Group H before the clash against South Korea, with Fellaini enjoying a starring role.

The former Everton man notched a vital headed equaliser against Algeria during the first game of the group and has proved the driving force he once was in the Premier League.

There has been no word as to what Louis van Gaal will decide to do with the Belgian after a disappointing first season at Old Trafford.

But his performances for his country will be a source of some encouragement at Carrington, particularly after ex-boss David Moyes said he is a sensitive player who is a confidence footballer.
