Two Hawaii residents have been arrested for trespassing to see lava and taking selfies, police said on Friday amid growing interest from people eager to witness the slow-moving flow.

Hawaii County police said officers saw a man and a woman on county property Thursday taking photos within 5 feet of the lava in the small town of Pahoa.

Ruth Crawford, 65, and Stephen Koch, 59,  had two golf clubs that had been dipped in lava, which had hardened on the clubs, police said.

Put-put you in trouble: Stephen Koch, 59, had two golf clubs that had been dipped in lava and also was arrested for trespassing along with Ruth

They crossed private property to get to the spot where they watched the lava and later spoke with reporters at KITV.

 'It was very hot and I felt like my face was burning. It was really hot,' said Puna resident Ruth Crawford.

When reporters asked her why she ventured into the forbidden territory she told them, 'Just because it's lava and I've been here 23 years and I was kind of excited and scared and just wanted to do it.' 

After their arrest, Crawford and Koch posted $250 bail.

'I know we're not supposed to, but, OK, I won't again,' said Crawford. 

Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said the county is restricting the public's access to the lava flow to keep people safe.

'It's unfortunate. We would hope we wouldn't have to take steps to enforce the rules,' Oliveira told reporters.

He said the lava is currently in people's backyards. The county may be able to enable public viewing if and when it enters public land, he said.

Hot stuff: Lava flow is burning vegetation near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii and is making a small crawl towards a major road in the area

But authorities need to be able to manage the situation. In 1990, when lava poured into Kalapana on the Big Island's southern coast, parked cars lined the roads and people crowded in to watch.

Tourists and residents have been streaming into Pahoa for a glimpse of the lava since the flow edged closer to the town's main road. Tourists and residents from around the Big Island are giving restaurants extra business.

Glen Bousquet, a tree trimmer from the nearby community of Nanawale, said he hiked to the flow multiple times since the weekend and trtrespassed to do so. He followed the glow through 6-foot-tall grass, he said.

''It's so interesting to see nature unfolding. It's like a once in a lifetime chance to actually see it up close and personal without having to wait for it to be on TV,' he said. 'You kind of get the real deal.'

Though he trespassed, he said he did so with 'the utmost respect' and didn't break any fences or otherwise harm anyone's property.

But he said won't go back because he doesn't want to get arrested.

Some are jilted by the lava but others say that they're not afraid of the heat,

'I don't think people need to panic. Auntie Pele is going to do what she wants to do so allow things to move the best way possible to allow things to move and stay safe. Everything is going to be OK,' said coconut vendor Vince McMillon to KITV.  

The Star Advertiser reports that others have been arrested because they are taking advantage of an emergency situation and using it to loot homes.

Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi proclaimed a state of emergency in September for the lower Puna district under Act 111 of the 2014 state Legislature, which has classifications of certain crimes that are elevated while the emergency proclamation is in effect.
