The immediate assumption one has on hearing that an academic has won the Nobel Prize  is that he must always have been a brilliant and hard-working individual  who was marked out for golden success.

In the case of the Cambridge scientist Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this week, we were roundly disabused of this notion when he let it be known that his school science report began with the word ‘Disastrous’ — and went downhill from there. 

‘I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist,’ his biology teacher wrote. ‘On his present showing this is quite ridiculous; if he can’t learn simple biological facts he would have no chance of doing the work of a specialist, and it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part, and of those who have to teach him.’ 

Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October, says human cloning could happen within 50 years

Gurdon’s work was ‘far from satisfactory’. One effort ‘scored two marks out of a possible 50’. In a class of 18 at Eton College, this master placed Gurdon 18th.

And yet, 79-year-old Gurdon has for decades been pre-eminent in the field of cloning and cell research.

True, there are those who have questioned some of the ethical issues arising out of his work. It is as a direct consequence of his endeavours, for example, that other scientists decided to proceed with cloning Dolly the Sheep. He has also been at the vanguard of defending genetically modified crops.

But no one in recent years has questioned Sir John’s brilliance, nor his dedication to his work. Even when he was the Master  of Magdalene College at Cambridge University, with administrative responsibility to students and scholars, Sir John never let up in his scientific work, and was hard at it in the laboratory even on days when he had also to attend fundraising meetings and the like.

'I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist. On his present showing this is quite ridiculous... and it would be a sheer waste of time'

Some people will read this story and remark how foolish the science teacher was. Not since 1895, when a Munich science teacher said that little Albert Einstein ‘will never amount to anything’ could anyone have got a budding scientist so wrong.

But there is another way of looking at it. Is it not possible that this patently honest report is one of the reasons why Gurdon went on to such great heights?   

In most schools today, the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times, even when they have achieved nothing spectacular. 

If a small child at kindergarten rolls a piece of Plasticine into the shape of a garden worm, the class is expected to be as impressed as if he had moulded it into the shape of the Venus de Milo. 

At assemblies, the most feeble, inaudible lisped readings and songs are greeted with wild applause.

And later on, in the modern child’s school-days, it is thought desirable to continue praising and emphasising the positive.

Thus the recent, welcome, decision to raise the bar for English GCSEs passes and to admit finally that some children could not spell, or write grammatically, or remember the books they had been studying, was greeted with howls of outrage and seen as unfair, and even cruel.

The truth is that in state schools, proper school reports are a thing of the past. The old cliche — ‘could do better’ — is no longer allowed. 

It’s considered too harsh for the poor dears. But the fact is that unless someone tells a young pupil that they could do better, they never will do better. They are left with the lie that they could not improve — even if they tried. 

In any case, trying is not something which they are encouraged to do. Conned by artificially high grades at GCSEs, which are doled out by cynical examination boards touting for custom (the boards get paid by schools which choose them, so it is in their interest to make things easy), whole generations of school-children have never received criticism of the kind stingingly — and helpfully — delivered by John Gurdon’s Eton master.

Indeed, many students receiving such a rebuke today would probably need counselling, or their parents would write off to a solicitor seeking redress.

For his part, John Gurdon became a great scientist, not because he was a conceited, lazy boy, who thought he knew it all, when he did not. He became a great scientist when he stopped being that boy, and learned the tough lessons that his biology master wanted to teach him: get your facts right, apply yourself, learn to be humble in respect of facts, work hard.

Of course, Sir John has rightly been 
seen as one of a number of high achievers who were either slow starters,
 or whose genius was not spotted at school.

So wrong: A Munich science teacher said that little Albert Einstein 'will never amount to anything'

Winston Churchill is the classic case of the boy who was largely unloved by his parents, and unappreciated by the teachers.  

When he was an eight-year-old attending a private school called St George’s, Ascot, Churchill was said by his teacher to be ‘a very naughty boy’ and ‘a constant trouble to everybody and is always in some scrape or other. He  cannot be trusted to behave himself anywhere’. 

Actually, Churchill’s anarchic and ungovernable behaviour — which got him into many scrapes in his political career — were part of what made him so unpredictable and successful a warlord.

When he went on to Harrow School, his housemaster despairingly wrote: ‘He is so regular in his irregularity that I really don’t know what to do.’

(By contrast, in Linz, in Austria, a schoolmaster was writing that his pupil was ‘very satisfactory’ in his ‘moral conduct . . . religious instruction, adequate; freehand drawing good’. It was, of course, Adolf Hitler).

There are countless examples of school 
reports of successful people which are hardly complimentary — yet which 
show the teachers had seen something in their pupils that would go on 
being part of their later character.

Churchill could certainly make colossal 
mistakes and be ‘a constant trouble to everybody’ — that turned out to 
be part of his greatness. And the important thing is that his teachers 
were happy to express their firmly held opinions of him.

The rot set in from the Seventies 
when teachers’ training colleges all started going barmy, and it was 
considered wicked to correct children’s mistakes. 

This was also the period from which educational standards generally started to plummet.

Too harsh: In schools today the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times, even when achieving nothing spectacular but unless someone tells a pupil that they could improve, they will never do better

If you are a dedicated teacher with a passion for your subject and a real love for your pupils, you will go on and on correcting them until they achieve excellence. But this approach did not fit in with the prevailing ethos of the educational establishment, which meant core subjects suffered.

In maths, science, languages, and history, it is essential to get your facts and grammar right. 

Unsurprisingly, there has been a marked decline in these subjects in British education across the past 40 years, and a growth in so-called subjects where there is no right or wrong answer — such as design, creative writing, media studies, international relations, business studies, fashion, psychology — subjects where no one lets facts get in their way.

By contrast, life-changing medical research such as that conducted by Sir John Gurdon, depends upon actually knowing things. And knowing things is  only possible if some teacher has been brave enough to tell the pupils when they have got something wrong.

All through the party conference season we have been treated to the boring spectacle of politicians vying with one another to raise the number of British students in higher education. But what is the point of doing so if these students are not studying anything useful? 

And how can anyone be expected to study something useful  unless at an early stage a school teacher has been honest enough, caring enough, to say — as that biology teacher did all those years ago to a young John Gurdon: ‘If you go on making mistakes like that, you’ll never make anything of your life . . . it would be a sheer waste of time.’
