Their marriage lasted just 72 days, and now it has been claimed that Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' nuptials were a hoax 'right from the start'.

A source close to the pair alleged Kim was 'never really into' her husband, but went along with the wedding as a 'publicity stunt'.

The shocking claims have been made as a spokesperson for E!, who broadcasted the wedding special, said the showbiz channel were holding emergency meetings following Kim's announcement yesterday, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

'Publicity stunt': Sources close to Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries have claimed their marriage was all a hoax

A statement read: 'All of us at E! are surprised and saddened by this news. And we send our support to Kim and Kris at this difficult time.

'The Kardashians have always been uniquely open with all aspects of their lives from joyous events to intimate moments to heartbreaking transitions.

'E! will continue to share the fascinating real lives and larger-than-life existence of this close-knit family.'

All
a hoax? Kim and Kris walk down the aisle on their big day, but some 
sources are claiming the whole thing was merely a money-making exercise

However, sources close to Kim and Kris said their relationship was 'pretty much an arranged marriage right from the start'.

Upset: A ringless Kim at LAX yesterday

The source added to Radaronline.com: 'Kim was looking for a husband and Kris 
was selected for her, amongst others.

'She wasn't really into him but she
hoped she would be able to develop some feelings, but it never 
happened.

'Kris turned out to not be as malleable as everyone hoped he would be, he was pictured out partying with other girls, Kim really couldn't care less for him, she decided to end it.'

In a further twist, Kim filed for divorce a year to the day she very first set eyes on Kris.

The reality star met Kris on October 31, 2010, at a New Jersey Nets game.

Kim was sat courtside at the Izod Center in New Jersey when she took a liking to strapping 6ft9in-tall Kris.

The couple began dating just weeks later, leading to a whirlwind marriage - and yesterday's news of divorce.

Meanwhile, as Kim announced the end of the marriage, the inevitable questions began to arise about how much money the pair made from their union.

Kim's decision to file papers against 
Kris just hours before her mother's book, Kris Jenner and All Things 
Kardashian, goes on sale tomorrow, could certainly be viewed as a 
calculated move.

And yesterday, as soon as she woke up, 
Kim promoted the family's new clothes store on Twitter, only later being
drawn upon for a statement about the breakdown of her marriage.

Still wearing the bling: Kim, with sisters Khloe and Kourtney, had her engagement and wedding rings in place on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last night

In a tweet that many of her fans will find cold and inappropriate, she effused: 'Our store #KardashianKhaos is opening 
tomorrow at 9am at @TheMirageLV We are so excited!! Kardashian Khaos has
arrived!” Kardashian Khaos indeed…'

It's a miscalculation of tone that Kim might live to regret, as fans begin to question the reality behind her family's money-spinning soap opera.

Whatever the truth, there is no doubting the fact that 31-year-old Kim's marriage has been lucrative for the Kardashian family.

Was it ever love? This is the moment when fans wept to see Kim find happiness, but now they doubt it

And for that matter, the abandoned spouse, Kris Humphries, 26.

The wedding, which would've cost the couple $10 million if they'd had to pay for their freebies, netted a whopping $18 million.

A huge chunk of that - around $15 million - is thought to have been TV rights which formed part of the family's exclusive deal with E!

Whatever the exact breakdown, their marriage ending now means that the whole haul has earned the couple about $250,000 per day.

The happy couple also bagged $1 million from People magazine for exclusive shots of the apparently joyous occasion.

That's not to include the value of the numerous other magazine covers that have added grist to the mill of the Kardashian publicity machine.

Even before the big day, Kim was paid $500,000 to host her bachelorette party at Tao in Las Vegas.

But then, however heartbroken he is, Kris has benefitted hugely.

He was earning around $40,000 per game but since marrying Kim, has been hitting the quarter of a million mark each day.

This is sure to be a loss he feels keenly.

The gravy train: Khloe, Kourtney and Kim promote the Kardashian Kollection in Cerritos, California last month

Especially as Kim seems determined to sever ties sharply and swiftly.

E! report that alongside the prenuptial agreement she put in place, the brunette wants property separated immediately, and for each party to pay their own legal fees.

She listed 'miscellaneous jewellery and other personal 
effects' as well as 'earrings and accumulations' amassed before, 
during and after her marriage to be confirmed as separate property but no word
on whether that includes her $2 million, 20.5-carat diamond ring.

It's a businesslike approach that's typical of the Kardashian model.

Momager: Kris Jenner is the driving force behind the Kardashian empire

After Kim started the day with her advert for their latest enterprise, Kris Jenner waded in with her own promo, for both QVC AND her book.

She wrote on her Twitter: 'How fab is 
this sequin top I'll be selling at QVC tonight??! Just like the one I'm 
wearing on my memoir cover!!!'

Meanwhile Kourtney changed the subject with: 'Happy Halloween! I am ready for costumes and trick or treating!'

Their incongruous tweets stood out in the tidal wave of commentary on the showbiz story of the day.

One fan who tweets as Bookgirl96 summed 
up the prevailing mood when she wrote: 'The Kim Kardashian definition of
'forever' is 'when the check is cashed.'

It was referring to the tellingly 
passionless statement that Kim eventually released: 'I hope everyone 
understands this was not an easy decision. I had hoped this marriage was
forever but sometimes things don't work out as planned. We remain 
friends and wish each other the best.'

The network's urge to protect their golden goose's integrity is understandable.

Four million viewers watched the original wedding special, and 900,000 are estimated to have tuned into each repeat.

Birthday girl: Kim even celebrated her 31st birthday last month with Kris in New York

But the Kardashians appeal rests upon
their viewers feeling that they are allowed an honest, almost 
voyeuristic, glimpse into this gilded world.

If fans believe their emotional connection is being exploited, it's likely they'll turn off in their droves.

The
machinations of 'momager' Kris Jenner are well documented but if it's 
starting to look like the hapless Kris was co-opted into her plans 
purely because he plays basketball and has the initial 'K,' her 
matriarchal bossiness could be viewed as calculated exploitation.

So with Kim and Kourtney Take New York 
premiering on November 27, in which the short-lived romance will be 
documented, Kim needs to convince her pay-masters that there were hearts
in her almond eyes at one point, and not just dollar signs.

The end: Kris and Kim were grim-faced after a meal on Thursday night, this was the last time they were seen together

Celebrities and VIPs took to Twitter in their droves in the wake of news Kim was filing for divorce from Kris.

While some were sympathetic, the 
reaction was largely cynical, with hashtags 
'thingslongerthanKimsmarriage', 'REASONSYOURSINGLE', and 'DIVORCE' among
the topics trending on Twitter.

CNN talk show host Piers Morgan - who has interviewed Kim in the past - retweeted:
'Kim Kardashian sold the rights to her wedding for $17.9 million. Her 
marriage lasted 72 days. That comes to a nifty $10,358.80 per hour.'

Late Show with David Letterman writer Justin Stangel weighed in: 'Wow -- @KimKardashian getting divorced. I'm shocked! Reality show weddings usually last.'

Some of Humphries' fellow NBA player mocked the divorce too. Houston Rockets' player Terrence Williams tweeted: 'You can't make fake love work not even money.... It's just TV entertainment smh.'

Samantha Ronson, whose ex-girlfriend Lindsay Lohan was a guest at the wedding, exclaimed: 'Wait, so it was actually a real wedding?'

Musician Questlove was thinking along the same lines: 'Wait, Kim Kardashian got married?'

Gossip blogger Perez Hilton
was seemingly angered that Kim had apparently made a mockery of her 
right to marriage. He wrote: 'I love @KimKardashian, but as a gay man in
America who is treated as a second class citizen when it comes to civil
marriage, I am offended!'

There were a few supporters out there, however. Kelly Osbourne tweeted: '@KimKardashian thinking of you stay strong don't listen to the haters 
listen to your heart! Xoxo.'

And music mogul Russell Simmons also offered some kind sentiments: 'Hoping the best for Kim'
