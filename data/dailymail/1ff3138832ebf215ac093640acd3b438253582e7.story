A series of crashes on an icy interstate toll road involving 40 vehicles that left one person dead and several others injured are under investigation, New Jersey State Police said Tuesday.

The accidents began on the New Jersey Turnpike just before 9:15 p.m. Monday during a mix of rain and snow flurries and below-freezing temperatures in Cranbury, a township about 40 miles southwest of New York City.

Two tractor-trailers obstructed the road when they lost control in the truck lanes as they attempted to avoid earlier crashes, triggering a chain-reaction crash involving 13 vehicles in which Daryl Williams, 52, of Bordentown, New Jersey, became trapped in his car and died, state police said.

Wreckage: 40 vehicles total were involved in crashes in both the inner and outer lanes, according to New Jersey State Police 

In total, there were 21 vehicles involved in multiple accidents on the inner roadway, which is reserved for cars, and 19 vehicles involved in crashes on the outer roadway, which is used by trucks and cars, state police said. 

Ice was a factor in the pileups, authorities said. 

Multiple people reported injuries, but none was considered life-threatening, state police said.

The southbound car lanes reopened to traffic around 3 a.m. Tuesday, but the truck lanes did not reopen until after 8 a.m.

The accidents were under investigation and police did not issue any tickets. 

A State Police spokesman told Daily Mail Online Tuesday that the crash involving Williams took place in the outer lanes.

Victims in the various crashes were transported to multiple hospitals, the spokesman said.

One patient was transferred overnight from the hospital's Hamilton affiliate to the New Brunswick location and is currently listed in good condition, Haigney said.

Haigney said that 27 patients were treated at the Hamilton location and released.

Courtney Spahr, spokeswoman for Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, confirmed that 27 people were treated, saying they were not admitted to the hospital.

Spahr also confirmed that a Hamilton patient was taken to the New Brunswick hospital. 

Capital Health Regional Medical Center in Trenton had 19 patients, two of whom were admitted Monday night, spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor Said. The patients were in stable condition and have since been discharged, she said.
