Alan Pardew has been named the Barclays Premier League manager of the month for November after guiding Newcastle to three victories from four matches.

Pardew's side beat Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park, overcame West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at the Hawthorns and also claimed a 1-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers at home.

The only blot on Pardew's copybook for November was a 1-0 loss against West Ham United at Upton Park.

It is the third time Pardew has picked up the award during his career, placing him joint-14th in the all-time list of managerial winners.

In fact, the last time the Englishman won it was a year ago in November 2013, when his Magpies side went on a superb run and shot up into the top five in the Premier League.

The first time Pardew claimed the accolade was in February 2006, while he was manager of West Ham. 

The award completes quite a turnaround for Pardew who saw a large section of the Magpies faithful calling for his sacking after Newcastle's dreadful start to the season.

With the Tynesiders languishing in the bottom three of the Premier League in the middle of October, it took a 1-0 home victory over Leicester City to turn their campaign around.

But, in their previous home match, the Magpies trailed Hull City 2-0 and a group of supporters raised banners with 'SackPardew.com' emblazoned across them - a website which had been set up with the sole objective to have the Newcastle boss removed from his position.

Papiss Cisse's two goals rescued a point for Pardew's seemingly beleaguered side and there has been quite a turnaround in fortunes in recent weeks.

Since then, Pardew's side have claimed eight victories from 12 matches in all competitions - including becoming the first side to beat league leaders Chelsea.

The Magpies will head to the Emirates for Saturday's late kick-off this weekend as they look to pile more misery on Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

However, Pardew will be forced to field third-choice goalkeeper Jak Alnwick - who is just 21 - and the supposed 'curse' of the manager of the month could potentially strike again as a result.

The other nominees for the November managerial award were Chelsea's Jose Mourinho - whose side remained unbeaten at the top of the Premier League until last weekend - Burnley boss Sean Dyche and Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini.

It is often said that the Premier League manager of the month award is a 'curse' for any boss; their side will inevitably lose their next match. Newcastle travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Saturday evening and look set to field a third-choice goalkeeper, so the supposed 'curse' could come back to bite Pardew. Here, Sportsmail looks at whether or not the 'curse' is fact or fiction...

- The 'curse' hit Swansea City manager Garry Monk as his side succumbed to a 4-2 loss away at Chelsea after he won the August award. Perhaps it is unfair to say a curse struck when losing away at the league leaders, however.

- Southampton boss Ronald Koeman celebrated his September award by hammering Sunderland 8-0 in the most eye-catching result of the season so far. It seems the supposed curse did not affect the Saints.

- October's winner Sam Allardyce saw his West Ham United side draw 0-0 away at Aston Villa, hardly a curse there either.
