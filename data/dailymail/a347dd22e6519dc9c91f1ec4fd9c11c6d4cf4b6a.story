Moscow will continue to buzz Britain with its long-range bombers at the same intensity for the whole year, a top Kremlin commander has made clear. 

Recent weeks have twice seen RAF Typhoon fighter jets scrambled to escort Russian Bear bombers as they flew close to British airspace, but there will be no let-up.

General-lieutenant Anatoly Zhikharev, commander of Russian long distance military aviation, has made clear in comments not previously reported in the West that the bomber flights will remain at a high level throughout 2015.

General-lieutenant Anatoly Zhikharev, commander of Russian long distance military aviation, insists bomber flights near to British airspace will remain at a high level throughout 2015

'According to the plan of strategic deterrence, the flights of long distance aviation will be continued as a part of military training and with the same intensity,' he is on record as saying.

This would apply not only to flights in the eastern Atlantic, but also over the Arctic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, he stressed.

Zhikharev said that in 2015, Russia will get six more upgraded Tu-160 strategic bomber planes, and the Tu-95MS will rise to 43.

His words were echoed by the commander of the Russian air force, who hit back at Western press reports over the flights close to NATO borders.

'It is true that our long distance aviation airplanes are flying and will be flying to the remote geographic regions to the furthest allowed distance,' said Viktor Bondarev.

'It is necessary for training the crews and for keeping an eye on the capacity of the planes.

'All flights are performed in strict accordance with the international rules of air space usage - only over the neutral waters without entering the air space or breaking the borders of other countries. 

 

The military chief's comments come following two incidents in which Russian jets were escorted by RAF Typhoons after being caught flying near British airspace

'According to the plan of strategic deterrence, the flights of long distance aviation will be continued as a part of military training and with the same intensity,'said General-lieutenant Zhikharev

'At the same time, almost all the flights of our planes are accompanied by fighter planes of NATO countries or their partners whose aviation bases are located not far from the route of our aircraft.

'The intensity of NATO and US intelligence flights have increased since 2014, and the number of such flights above the Baltic and Barents seas is eight to 12 per week.'

Retired general Pert Deinekin, formerly head of the Russian air force, even issued a taunt that 'the Brits have forgotten what we can do', referring to the frequency of flights in the Cold War, which have now returned.

'We have always performed at our best against those who instigate us to start a conflict,' he warned, using rhetoric redolent of the Soviet era when these 'behind the corner' flights - pilots' slang for a routing along the Scandinavian peninsula towards Britain - were common.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon last week said that the frequency of recent flights - such as those close to Cornwall and Dorset by Russian warplanes capable of carrying nuclear weapons - were on a scale not seen since the end of the Cold War.

Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included:

Wednesday: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall.

Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel.

Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth.

Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland.

Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne.

Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland.

Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain.

He also branded Putin 'a very real and present danger' to Britain's allies in the Baltics.

Russian TV station Zvezda, backed by the Defence Ministry in Moscow, released a video of British and French fighter jets escorting a Tu-95 bear earlier this week.

The film was shot from inside the cockpit of the long range bomber.

Russian military expert Viktor Litovkin told the same channel: 'We are not such nit-picking people.

'We do not make noise in press each time a NATO plane flies close to our borders or our aircraft when they are on a military mission.

'Something that is a routine matter for our pilots, for them turns into a reason for hysteria a la Cold War times.'

Moscow claims that NATO countries are similarly drastically increasing their probing flights close to Russian territory.

In 2014, NATO intelligence aviation performed more than 200 flights close to Russian borders, compared with 2013 when there were 125 flights.

'The devices on board of such planes allow investigation of the whole territory of Kaliningrad region,' said Bondarev, referring to Russia's exclave in the Baltic, between NATO countries Lithuania and Poland.

'The routes of these flights are very close to the Russian border and it allows to perform radio-electronic intelligence up to 500 kilometres deep into the territory and to follow the work schedule and characteristics of army management, anti-aircraft systems and aviation.

'The flights of US strategic intelligence RC-135 planes are made almost daily.

Prime Minister David Cameron (left) dismissed last week's incident, saying the Russians 'are trying to make some sort of a point. He said that the action, authorised by Russian President Vladimir Putin (right), should not have been dignified 'with too much of a response'

'For example, in 2014 there were about 140 RC-135 flights, and in 2013 there were only 22.'

Moscow's ambassador to London,Dr Alexander Yakovenko, this week echoed that view.

He said: 'Military activity by Nato aircraft at Russian borders is far more intense, having doubled since early 2014, reaching 3,000 sorties that year.

'By way of comparison, Russian reconnaissance aircraft carried out just over 200 sorties over the Baltic Sea area from March to December 2014, compared with 125 over the same period in 2013.

'The growing disparity between the actual situation and the official rhetoric of some Western leaders is not helpful for restoring trust, which is probably the main victim of the crisis in relations between Russia and the West.'

Last week, Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, said planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by Russian jets in a highly dangerous 'game of chicken'.

Two Russian bombers last week skirted British airspace off the coast of Cornwall, where they were intercepted and escorted by two RAF Typhoon fighters.

The two Typhoons, armed with air-to-air missiles, were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire after the Russian bombers were spotted at 6.30pm on Wednesday.

They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast.

That incident came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth last month.

Lord Stirrup said the flights were not 'joy rides' but 'mission rehearsals' designed to test Britain's capability to react. 

Speaking on  Sky News's Murnaghan programme, he said: 'They are becoming more aggressive. 

'These aircraft - Russian Bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides. They are mission rehearsals.

'These aircraft launch stand-off missiles against Western targets and just as they used to do in the Cold War they are practising those profiles.

'They are testing us, they are testing our defences, they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that's very dangerous.

'So we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision, not between RAF and Russia aircraft, but between Russian aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing.'

Official figures show that RAF jets have been scrambled to deter Russian plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014, including 8 times last year.

A third of all incidents in which RAF pilots were deployed involved a plan from Russia. 

Footage of British and French fighter jets escorting a Russian bomber were released by a Kremlin-backed TV station earlier this week.

The video was filmed from the window of one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes.

Prime Minister David Cameron defiantly dismissed the incident, saying the Russians 'are trying to make some sort of a point, and I don't think we should dignify it with too much of a response'.

He added: 'I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets, the pilots, the systems in place to protect the UK.'
