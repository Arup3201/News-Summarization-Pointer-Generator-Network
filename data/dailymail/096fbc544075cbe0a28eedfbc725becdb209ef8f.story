The quest to find scores of buried Spitfires in Burma was yesterday beginning to descend into farce as doubts grew that any would ever be found.

Recrimination and disappointment were in danger of splitting the team of experts searching for as many as 136 of the Second World War fighters.

The project had finally started after 17 years of effort by a Spitfire devotee trying to find the aircraft last seen boxed up in large crates in 1946.

Excavation: Heavy diggers had been brought in to help with the search for the buried Spitfires at Yangon International Airport in Burma but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there

But divisions among members of the team emerged after they had been searching near the capital Yangon for two weeks.

Yesterday that dig was  suspended and the bizarre treasure hunt will move to a second location 900 miles to the north.

According to David Cundall, the man 
leading the hunt, fresh scientific equipment is required before digging 
can resume at Yangon. However, other members of the operation have now 
cast doubt on the prospect of finding anything at all.

Last night, the internal divisions 
only added to the confusion over the quixotic attempt to unearth the 
aircraft. They are believed to lie in three locations across Myanmar 
(modern-day Burma) and could be worth up to £1million each.

A 21-strong team of archaeologists, 
geo-physicists and sponsors has been at the first site near  Yangon’s 
international airport for two weeks and intended to announce their 
initial findings at a press conference tomorrow.

However, that was suddenly cancelled 
on Thursday after the team had probed a few feet below the surface and 
found live cables and functioning technical equipment connected to the 
airport.

‘We had to stop the dig because, while
we have equipment to detect Spitfires at 20ft, we don’t have the 
equipment to detect cables at 5ft,’ said Mr Cundall, a farmer from 
Lincolnshire.

Yesterday, the BBC reported that some 
of the archaeologists now doubt the existence of any Spitfires. Since 
they have yet to visit two other sites identified by Mr Cundall, this 
has created divisions within the operation.

‘The digging went incredibly slowly and I made my opinions known,’ said Mr Cundall.

Hope: The Spitfires are believed to have been buried as a way of disposal when the war came to an end

Blessing: Mr Cundall speaks with a Buddhist monk who was brought to bless the site before digging began

Site: the Burmese Government has given Mr Cundall's team permission to dig for the planes at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport

Although he is the brains behind the 
project, the excavation work and archaeologists are being funded by 
wargaming.net, a video games company, ‘The archaeologists weren’t 
digging in the area we believe holds the Spitfires,’ Mr Cundall added.

‘Instead, they wanted to see what sort of war remains were buried.’

His frustrations were shared by war veteran Stanley Coombe, 86, a witness to the original burials.

Last night, having just returned from 
Yangon, he said: ‘They were digging in the wrong place and I told them 
so.’

He has very clear memories of seeing large crates being interred on
the site shortly after his 20th birthday in 1946.

Mr Coombe was stationed in what was 
then Rangoon while serving in the Royal Berkshire Regiment.

‘I asked 
this RAF chap what was in these huge crates and he said: “You’ll never 
believe it, but they’re Spitfires”.

‘It was cheaper to bury them  than take them home and they didn’t want them falling into the wrong hands.’

Last night, the sponsors were 
unavailable for comment.

Meanwhile Mr Cundall made plans to continue 
digging at the second site at Myitkyina where a submerged crate has 
already been discovered.

‘The Myitkyina dig looks promising,’ 
says Spitfire expert Peter Arnold, who is accompanying Mr Cundall.

‘They
dug a deep hole by hand and at the bottom hit upon the corner of a 
wooden crate with a metal strap around it.

‘The crate was full of muddy water and
nothing more was done with it.

However, it’s sitting there waiting to 
be dug up properly.’

To add further confusion to the 
situation, a rival Israeli excavation team has appeared on the scene in 
the hope of persuading the Burmese authorities to allow them to dig for
the planes.
