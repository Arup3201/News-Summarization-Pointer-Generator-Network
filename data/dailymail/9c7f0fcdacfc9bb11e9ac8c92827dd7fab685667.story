Libya is braced for further bloodshed after negotiations between rebel troops and Gaddafi loyalists over the surrender of a town where it is believed the tyrant may be hiding broke down.

Thousands of soldiers loyal to the country's National Transitional Council (NTC) have surrounded the stronghold of Bani Walid, 95 miles south east of Tripoli, where at least 100 heavily armed, pro-Gadaffi fighters have dug in.

The rebels claim some civilians in the town have been slaughtered and fear others will  be used as human shields.

Negotiator Abdullah Kanshil told reporters that hopes of a peaceful surrender were gone after talks with Gadaffi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim failed.

Mr Kanshil, himself a resident of Bani Walid, claimed Gaddafi loyalists had demanded the rebels entered the town unarmed.

He said:  'From my side, negotiations are finished. They said they don’t want to talk, they are threatening everyone who moves.

'They are putting snipers on high rise buildings and inside olive groves, they have a big fire force. We compromised a lot at the last minute,

'I urge Gaddafi people to leave the town alone.

'We feel sorry for the people of Bani Walid. We hope for the best for our city.'

Mr Kanshil said rebel fighters were stationed 
outside the town were waiting for the green light to launch a final 
assault.

Rebel forces believe Gaddafi loyalists have slaughtered more than a dozen people who had been held captive in a room in Bani Walid.

There has been some speculation that members of Gaddafi’s family, perhaps even the former  leader himself, may be hiding there.

Gaddafi's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said in a telephone interview that the ousted leader was somewhere in Libya, 'safely surrounded by loyal supporters'.

Mr Ibrahim said: 'He’s in the country. He’s in a safe place surrounded by many people who are prepared to protect him.'       

In a defiant audio message on September 1, Col Gaddafi referred to Bani Walid as 'an armed fortress'.

The interim government, based in Tripoli, said it is now sure Col Gaddafi's son, Khamis, has been killed.

They say he died fighting close to Tripoli and has been buried near Bani Walid.

Intelligence sources reported one of Gaddafi's other sons Saif al-Islam had left Bani Walid on Saturday, heading south.

There was no information on the whereabouts of another son, Mutassim.

While anti-Gaddafi forces now control most of the Libya, some central and southern areas still remain loyal to the ousted dictator.

Nato has reported bombing an ammunition storage facility near Bani Walid as well as striking targets close to Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte.

NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the Sirte was also surrounded by troops poised to attack.

He said: 'There are ongoing negotiations regarding Sirte between the elders and various tribes and the free Libya forces surrounding Sirte.

'The time is coming when talk is done with and we will enforce our will upon liberating the city of Sirte.'

Naji al-Maghrabi, commander of one of the NTC brigades positioned outside the town, said: 'We are awaiting the green light from the council.

'If they tell us, "Move into Sirte now," we will.'

One of his fighters, Belqassem Souliman, added: 'They have no way out but to surrender or die.'   

The U.N. mandate which permits Nato to conduct bombing missions in order to 'protect Libyan Civilians' expires on September 27 and the interim government is keen to seize control of the entire country by then.

Panos Moumtzis, UN humanitarian coordinator for Libya, said he was worried about humanitarian problems in areas where Gaddafi loyalists are still in control.

He said: 'We are looking very closely at the situation in Sirte. 

 'We are preoccupied about the protection of civilians in this area. We understand that there is a dialogue taking place. We would really like to see a peaceful solution as fast as possible.'
