Blackpool might be sitting bottom of the Sky Bet Championship table after just one win in 15 games but it seems the Seasiders have a secret weapon in their ranks.

Teenager Dom Telford has only made a single first team appearance but has garnered a reputation for scoring wondergoals in the youth ranks - twice being nominated for the League Football Education's goal of the month, which included a 35-yard chip against Liverpool that was a contender for goal of the season.

And, the 18-year-old has done it again with an outrageous solo goal in a youth team match against Padiham that saw him pick up the ball at the halfway line before gliding effortlessly past a succession of defenders and finishing with a rasping shot into the top corner.

With new manager Lee Clark's debut ending in a 2-0 home defeat by Ipswich on Saturday, which was Blackpool's fourth loss in a row, the time could be right to introduce some new blood if the Seasiders are going to stave off relegation this season.

Clark returns to former club Fulham on Wednesday evening, where he insists sentiment will not get in the way of reversing Blackpool's fortunes.

'I had seven fantastic years there. I've got terrific memories of the place, but I'm going there with allegiances to Blackpool and trying to get a result,' he said.
