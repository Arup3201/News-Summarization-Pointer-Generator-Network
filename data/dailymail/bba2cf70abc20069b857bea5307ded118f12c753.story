It was a year where the fast food chains outdid themselves with their rather peculiar creations. 

Burgers stained with charcoal bamboo and cheese made from squid ink, a pizza with a crown-crust of chicken fillets and an ice-cream sundae studded with bacon excited and appalled in equal measure.

From KFC's chicken burger stuffed with beef and Pizza Hut's cranberry sauce crust to KFC's popcorn chicken nachos and McDonald's Crab Croquette, here are 14 of the world's most astonishing junk food creations.

Japan's Crab Croquette consisted of a snowcrab and mushroom croquette with ketchup in a ciabatta bun

BARMY BURGERS 

While there's nothing wrong with the concept of a crab burger, the McDonald's crab croquette has us feeling a little but unsettled. 

Available only Japan, the snowcrab and mushroom croquette was swaddled between a ciabatta bun and covered in ketchup.

It was said to taste pleasantly fishy, similar in texture to the restaurant's filet-o-fish burger.

In Canada Burger King transformed the country's unofficial national dish of poutine - chips served with gravy and cheese curds - with their own rather messy twist adding a chopped up Whopper, mustard, ketchup and pickles to the already stodgy mix.

KFC's all-meat monstrosity was a slab of beef stuffed between crumbed chicken and topped with  bacon

Sausage or a pizza? Luxembourg's Pizza Hut had a sausage roll crust pizza, which came with a cheesy dip

Burger King's  restaurants in South Korea offered customers a beef patty topped with blueberries (in fruit and sauce form) and a mushroom waffle-patty hybrid burger served with a side of raw mushrooms.

KFC's now infamous Double Down, a heart attack waiting to happen, saw the usual burger bun replaced with pieces of chicken. 

South Korea took the concept even further with the addition of a slab of beef smack bang in the middle of the burger, turning it into the Double Down King.

The quadruple-meat concoction offered hungry customers two pieces of crumbed chicken, bacon, and a beef patty coated in a two types of sauce for  less than £5.

Pizza Hut used 'soft cheese technology' to connect the Doritos to the outer edge of the pizza

Pizza Hut worldwide went meat mash-up mad like chicken fillet and cheeseburger crusts in the Middle East

KFC had a dalliance with dairy, serving Brazilian customers chicken sandwiches topped with Philadelphia cheese and creamed corn while diners in the Philippines were served a chicken drumstick marinated in cheese, with a side of saffron rice.

Domino's Pizza in India ventured into the sandwich business with their Subwich, a three-bean patty with bell peppers and spicy relish served between two pizza crusts. 

The vegetarian offering was part of the chain's foray into conquering the lunch break market in India. 

Burger King Japan's black bun burgers Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond both featured black cheese made with bamboo charcoal, a black-pepper burger, onions, garlic sauce made with squid ink and an eye-catching black bun.

KFC's nachos box with tortilla chips, popcorn chicken, salsa and cheese made its entrance in Australia 

It's not the first time the chain served black burgers. Back in 2012 it introduced the Premium Kuro Burger and in 2013 the Kuro Ninja went on sale, which was identical to the Kuro, with the addition of a slice of bacon. 

McDonald’s in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong also sold black bun burgers this year containing a beef patty topped with onion and black pepper sauce.

HYBRID PIZZA CRUSTS 

A topic worthy of its own feature, Pizza Hut's menu revamp this year signalled the start of some rather interesting crusts.

There was the double whammy of the Crown Crust Chicken Filet Pizza and  the Crown Crust Cheeseburger Pizza which debuted in the Middle East.  

South Koreans were treated to shrimp, calamari, sausage, bacon, steak, cranberry and cream cheese in theirs

An unholy alliance of meat and cream, Burger King's bacon sundae is said to be salty, crunchy and sweet

Then South Koreans were introduced to surf-turf and dessert pizza which had shrimp, calamari, sausage, bacon and steak cranberry (or apple) and cream cheese crust - a savoury pizza with distinctly dessert-like flavours.

But the pièce de résistance of crusts made its entrance in Australia in November.

The Doritos crust may have been the cleverest fast food invention we had seen... or the worst.

Fans of Pizza Hut Australia were wailing in consternation at the creation, taking to social media networks to express disbelief at the monstrous marriage of nacho chip and pizza.

Using 'soft cheese technology' Doritos are connected to the outer edges of the pizza so, the chain says, diners can 'intuitively enjoy two of their favourite things simultaneously'' 

In Luxembourg, Pizza Hut stuffed their crusts with sausage rolls, served with a cheesy dip. It was a starter and main course in one meal that did particularly well in the country.  

While not strictly a pizza, KFC's nachos box sits quite well in this category. The product, which sounds like it was created just for Americans, was actually made for Australian outlets.

McDonald's China's Black & White pie has a coconut filling encased in a deep-fried chocolate covered shell 

Almost as soon as it appeared on menus, there were complaints from customers claiming that their box of nachos covered in popcorn chicken and smothered with salsa and cheese looked nothing like the advertisement. 

DANGEROUS DESSERT

Some would call this unholy. An alliance of meat and cream formed to titillate the tastebuds of its American diners, Burger King's bacon sundae is said to be salty, crunchy and sweet - and has had the thumbs up from food bloggers in the States. 

Smoky shards of bacon rest atop soft serve vanilla ice cream, and caramel and chocolate sauce is drizzled on top of the concoction. 

A further well-grilled hefty rasher is placed on the side of the cup, to be used as a spoon to scoop the ice-cream.

In China McDonald's revealed their new Black & White pie. Similar to a Bounty bar, the deep-fried dessert has a coconut filling and a chocolate flavoured pie-shell and was available in the chain's restaurants from August to September this year.
