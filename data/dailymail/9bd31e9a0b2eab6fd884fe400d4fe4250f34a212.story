It has rapidly become the favourite pastime of people the world over - taking a picture of yourself and plastering it over the internet for all  to admire.

From A-list Hollywood royalty to that funny-looking bloke down the pub, it seems many of us can barely go five minutes without whipping out our mobiles to grab a few quick frames.

Even U.S President Barack Obama is not above it all - famously posing up with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt at the funeral of Nelson Mandela.

But now several locations across the world are moving to stamp out the narcissistic craze with bans and fines so are we finally seeing a war on selfies? 

Garoupe, France 

A section of The Garoupe, a popular beach in Southern France, is cracking down on people constantly boasting about their holidays to friends back at home by working with mobile network, Three, to create designated 'No Braggies Zones'.

A spokesperson for the beach said: 'The Garoupe beaches are among the most glamorous and pristine beaches in all of France and we want people to be able to enjoy our exclusive beach in the moment, not spending the majority of their time bragging to their friends and family back home.'

The 'braggie', similar to the 'selfie', is a word that has firmly wiggled its way into the popular lexicon, and is a term that's been coined to describe the humble brag pictures of people enjoying a fancy cocktail, walking in the sand or gazing at a sunset. 

Iran 

Iran's footballers were warned they could face punishment if they take selfies with female fans who turned out in droves to see their idols play at the Asian Cup.

The head of the Iranian Football Federation's moral committee said players risked being used as a 'political tool' if snapped with female fans.

Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic of Iran

Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic, but flocked to see Iran's games hosted by Australia where no such rule applies.

Head of Iranian Football Federation's moral committee, Ali Akbar Mohamedzade, issued the warning last week as photos of players with female fans circulated on social media.

'National team players should be aware that they won't be used as a political tool so that those who take pictures with them don't use these photos against the players,' Iran's Shahrvand newspaper quoted him as saying.

'So according to this they should not take photos with everyone. If the players don't respect this, we will be obliged to take action.' 

South Korea

In December last year  South Korean authorities banned the use of  selfie-sticks - short poles with a clip on the end to hold a mobile phone which make it easier to take selfies.

Officials decided the sticks' use of Bluetooth makes them 'telecommunications devices' that must be tested and registered in case they interfere with other gadgets.

Basic selfie sticks are simply an extendable pole, meaning the selfie-taker sets the phone timer to take a picture. 

But more advanced versions have Bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smartphone meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture. They come in a variety of colours and styles. 

As well as being popular for group shots, the sticks are increasingly appearing at sporting events and concerts as a way of getting above a crowd to capture an action image.

Saudi Arabia 

Islamic clerics have issued a warning against people taking selfies on their Hajj pilgrimages to Mecca saying they 'defy the wish of our Prophet'. 

The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has seen a rise in the number of pictures being taken on camera phones during the rite of passage in Saudi Arabia as followers share their experiences with family and friends back home.

But some scholars have taken issue with the practice, which they see as a 'touristy' distraction from the prayers and rituals that form one of the five pillars of Islam. 

Islamic clerics have issued a warning against people taking selfies on their Hajj pilgrimages to Mecca saying they 'defy the wish of our Prophet'.

Jeddah-based scholar Sheikh Assim Al-Hakeem told Arab News: 'Photography without a legitimate reason is an issue of dispute among scholars.

'However, despite this difference of opinion, there shouldn't be any dispute when it comes to the real meaning of Haj and the essence behind it.

'It is based on sincerity and following the sunnah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) when he went for Hajj, he said: 'O Allah, I ask of you a pilgrimage that contains no boasting or showing of'. 

Taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our Prophet.'

Meanwhile, fellow scholar Abdul Razzaq Al-Badr added: 'It is as though the only purpose of this trip is to take pictures and not worship.'

Camera phones were, until a few years ago, banned from the holy mosques, but authorities appear to have relaxed the rules more recently. 

Pamplona, Spain 

This is one selfie ban that few could complain about.

Last year a man attending the annual Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain, was fined $4,100 (3,000 euros) for taking a picture as he attempted to flee the charging bulls. 

Selfies have been banned by organisers of the Pamplona Bull Run as a protective measure for runners navigating the streets as the animals charge behind them

Event's organisers say the ban is a protective measure for runners who must navigate the streets of Pamplona as the bulls charge behind them and should really be concentrating on nothing else. 

15 people have been killed during the Pamplona Bull Runs  since 1911, with the last death five years ago. 

New York

Starting from next month, New York will become the first U.S state where it is illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat. 

The measure - which specifically prohibits contact between members of the public and big cats at animal shows - was passed after self-portraits with the animals started becoming more popular online, particularly with some young men on dating sites.

Australian Open Tennis, Melbourne

Tennis fans eager to capture a selfie at the Australian Open have been warned against using selfie sticks courtside - but the message hasn't sunk in with the players themselves.

Organisers are discouraging people visiting Melbourne Park against using the controversial stick to take snaps during matches over fears it could block other competition goers’ views.

Tennis Australia say that the sticks have not been banned but they have ‘asked for people to use their discretion and use them sensibly’.

But stars such as Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic don't seem to mind at all - with the Russian star posting a hilarious selfie with her shy boyfriend, Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, while the Serbian men's favourite has happily posed with fans.

A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We made the decision not to ban them because we think people will be happy to use them responsibly.

‘People love them and many people got them for Christmas, they are a big novelty and we don’t’ want to stop people using them.’

Organisers are most concerned about the sticks distracting fans and players during matches.

They have requested people ‘don’t use them in and around the courts when you might be affecting people's views… so don’t use them during in a match… it’s working very well so far,’ the spokesperson said.

As part of the Australian Open’s social media plan, 20 dedicated selfie zones have been set up around the Park.

‘The selfie zone idea was more of a call to action rather than telling people where they should take their photos,’ Tennis Australia said.

London 

David Cameron and Barack Obama may be among the politicians who have joined the trend of taking ‘selfies’

But voters who take a picture of themselves in the polling booth  could be jailed, it has been warned.

British voters who take a picture of themselves and their ballot paper in the polling booth risk breaching secrecy laws and could be jailed The Electoral Commission has  warned

The Electoral Commission wrote to all returning officers involved in last year's local and European elections to tell them the selfies are illegal.

People who tweet photos of themselves and their ballot papers risk breaching secrecy laws and face a £5,000 fine or up to six months in jail.

But campaigners have said the pictures, which could be nicknamed ‘boothies’, could have encouraged people to vote.

The phenomenon has been popular in the Netherlands and some U.S. states where the polling booth selfies are legal.
