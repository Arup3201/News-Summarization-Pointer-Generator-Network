He was one of the world’s most-wanted tax exiles and allegedly totalled astonishing unpaid tax bills of more than $100million over 20 years.

William H. Millard, 79, founder of retail chain ComputerLand, was last seen by tax authorities on the remote Pacific island of Saipan in 1990.

But despite vanishing soon after selling his firm, he has now been tracked down to the Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, court papers said.

The astonishing news about the man once listed as one of America's richest men was revealed by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.

The U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which includes Saipan, is now using a law firm and investigators’ help to get the money.

Mr Millard is linked to a vast network of more than 50 shell companies, trusts and bank accounts, reported the Wall Street Journal.

‘This is one of the most sophisticated and complicated cases of offshore asset structuring that we have ever seen,’ Michael Kim, prosecuting, said.

Last Christmas an investigator spotted their target at dinner with one of his daughters in Florida, Mariana government officials said.

Mr Millard has not yet commented, but 
his former attorney Terry Giles said it was ‘ludicrous and insulting’ to
suggest he was hiding.

College dropout Mr Millard was a 1970s 
technology pioneer in California and he turned ComputerLand into a huge PC retail chain.

It had around 800 stores and his stake in the company was valued at $1billion at one point, reported the Wall Street Journal.

He was known for his lavish spending, private jets and working 18-hour days whilst eating peanut-butter sandwiches.

But he left ComputerLand, having a fallout with franchisees and management, and soon moved with his family to Saipan.

He eventually sold his remaining shares in 1987 and the family left Saipan, where he had half-built a turreted castle on the coastline, in 1990.

But the commonwealth got a tax judgment 
against Mr Millard and his wife for $36million in court in 1994, 
reported the Wall Street Journal.

Commonwealth officials then picked up 
traces of his movements in Singapore, Ireland, Brussels, Hong Kong and 
the Caymans.

'I hope he will do the right thing and 
pay his debts. But most people do
not let go of $100 million easily'

partner of Kobre & Kim

But then the commonwealth hired New York law firm Kobre & Kim and a private investigator tracked Mr Millard's daughter’s home to Orlando, Florida, in December.

The investigator soon spotted Mr Millard talking a walk outside and they tracked him to the Grand Cayman Island, lawyers said.

‘I hope he will do the right thing and pay his debts,’ Mr Kim told the Wall Street Journal. ‘But most people do not let go of $100 million easily.’
