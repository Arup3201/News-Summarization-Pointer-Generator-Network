Los Angeles police received an unusual call on Tuesday, after a man reported seeing two women loading a 4ft alligator into a van and driving off.

Fearing that the women were planning to abandon the creature in the desert, the retired police officer tailed them as he contacted the authorities.

When police pulled the van over the driver admitted to having the alligator, and added that a kangaroo was on board too.

The women explained they were part of the Zoo to You project, which brings exotic creatures to schools.

Unfortunately the alligator, named Spike, has soiled his cage on the way back from Quartz Hill Elementary School and the women had pulled over to clean him up.

Deputy Michael Rust told the Los Angeles Times that at first he did not believe the call about the exotic animals.

'When I heard it on the radio, I'm thinking, "Yeah, an alligator. OK",' he said. 'Maybe an iguana, but an alligator?'

Realizing that no creatures were in danger of being harmed, the police took a few 'snaps' of the alligator on their police car, before sending him on his way.

Alligators get their heat from sunning themselves on rocks so, as well as enjoying being the center of attention, Spike also made the most of his chance to warm himself on the police car.

Restroom break: Zoo to You had pulled over to give Spike the alligator a bathroom break on the way home

In their report, the Los Angeles Police 
Department said: 'It seems the alligator forgot to use the restroom 
before leaving the school and soiled its cage. This caused the ladies to
 stop,' NBC 4 reported.

The Zoo to You project in Paso Robles offers permanent homes to abandoned, injured or abused wild and exotic animals, from tigers and alligators, to lizards, porcupines and eagles.

Some of the animals are used in their education program and are taken to schools to help teach children about conservation.

It is not the first time Spike has been the center of attention. In April he met Jay Leno as he appeared on The Tonight Show.

The talk show host rubbed his belly to send him to sleep on the show, aired on April 5.

When Spike was pulled over by police, he was traveling back from an elementary school with Zoo to You's kangaroo.

Deputy Rust added: 'We get all kinds of animal calls, from bulls to bears to mountain lions. But I've never heard of an alligator.'
