A beer can fanatic has turned his collection of more than 83,000 cans into a tourist attraction, charging guests $379 a night to sleep in his house.

Jeff Lebo, 51, has been collecting cans since his early teens and has amassed thousands of unique tin cans from around the world.

Now the beer can collector has turned his record-breaking collection into the draw card for his guest accommodation, with guestrooms decorated with wall-to-wall cans at his Brewhouse Mountain Eco-Inn, in the forest of the Conewago Mountains, Pennsylvania.

With five bedrooms and two bathrooms, the inn sleeps up to 10 holidaymakers among his can collection.

Mr Lebo has kitted out each room with all of the usual home comforts but decorated each with themed beer cans from various regions including America, Europe and Asia.

The ultimate boozer: Mr Lebo charges $379 per night for the entire guesthouse which can sleep up to 10 holidaymakers

The guesthouse even has its own bar.

Mr Lebo said: ‘I started collecting vintage beer cans and ‘breweriana’ [collectible items with a brewery name or label] back in 1975 when I was 13-years-old.

‘Over the years, the collection grew by leaps and bounds. I always wanted to have a place where I could display the collection and in 1998 I finally built this place.

‘It's an incredible place for people to stay and generally people love it because it is so unique.

‘A place like this requires a person who is able to think outside of the box in order for it to be fully appreciated.’

Serene sip: Mr Lebo said that the house, in the forest of the Conewago Mountains, is 'incredible' and a 'unique place to stay'

Trash to treasure: Mr Lebo started collecting cans and 'breweriana' when he was just 13-years-old and always wanted somewhere to show-off his collection and so built the guesthouse in 1998

The house and beer can displays were built with the help Mr Lebo’s father Fred, friends and other family members.

Guests have travelled from around the world to stay at the bizarre boozer and many even bring additional cans to add to the collection.

He said: ‘We have had guests from all over the world as well as a number of American tourists so it's been a great deal of fun.

Family effort: The house and the beer displays was built with the help of Mr Lebo's father, friends and other family members

‘I specialize in rare beer cans from around the world and America and I'm always on the hunt for new additions.

‘I always say to people to never throw their cans away - I will take any and every collection.’

Individual rooms, such as the Pacific Room, German Room and African Room, are priced at $78 per night or you can have exclusive access to the Inn for $379 a night.
