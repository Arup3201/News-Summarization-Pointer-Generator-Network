Keen sailor Mark Fear was found hanged in his home on the Isle of White

It is thought that Mr Fear struggled following the death of his partner of a stroke in December

Mr Fear was discovered by a friend in his home in Cowes, Isle of Wight on Monday.

He was confirmed dead half an hour after police arrived at 1.22pm.

Coroner’s officer Dick Leedham said: ‘A post-mortem report gave the cause of death as asphyxiation and suspension.’

The couple ran an the Kendall Fine Art gallery in Cowes.

The gallery represents over 80 contemporary artists and holds a new show of around 100 new paintings every four to five weeksThey regularly hold drinks receptions, and offer animal painting services.

They entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

A former vice-commodore at the Royal London Yacht Club, Mr Fear was a keen sailor and was involved heavily in the community on the Isle of Wight.

Mr Fear’s sisters Paula Maher and 
Christine Leigh said in a statement: ‘Mark’s family and close friends 
are very grateful for the loving concern and sympathy shown by so many 
friends and colleagues.’

Coroner Caroline Sumeray opened and adjourned a hearing to a date to be fixed.

Kenneth Kendall, the first newsreader whose face was seen  on British television screens, died aged 88.

Kendall, who was known to millions for his elegant style and unflappable manner, had suffered a stroke.

More recently he became familiar to a new generation of viewers as presenter of the game show Treasure Hunt.

It was on September 4, 1955, that he made history by becoming the first BBC newsreader to appear on TV.

Prior
to that, presenters’ voices were heard over stills and footage of 
events because of fears they might, by some facial grimace, display 
political bias which could dilute the BBC’s  authority and impartiality.

Even after Kendall and his colleagues became visible to viewers, they remained austerely impersonal.

‘In the early days, our names were not even allowed to be mentioned. That was far too showbizzy,’ he once said.

‘We
were only professional broadcasters reading stuff written by somebody 
else. The BBC had auditioned a few actors, but they were turned down 
because they acted the news – which is exactly what was not wanted.

‘In those early days, some people didn’t understand anything about television.

‘My
cousin’s charlady honestly thought I could see her when I was on the 
screen. One day she said, “I fell asleep watching Mr Kenneth last night 
and when I woke up my false teeth had fallen out. I feel so ashamed that
he saw me without my teeth in”.’
