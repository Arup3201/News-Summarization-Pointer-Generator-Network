A Christian chaplain stationed at a military base in Alaska has been censored for posting an article on the site’s website that an organization fighting for soldiers right to religious freedom has described as 'bigoted.'

Air Force Lt. Col. Kenneth Reyes, who serves at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, wrote an article entitled, ‘No Atheists in Foxholes: Chaplains Gave All in World War II’ for his regular ‘Chaplain’s Corner’ column.

The title referenced a famous 1954 speech by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said: ‘I am delighted that our veterans are sponsoring a movement to increase our awareness of God in our daily lives. In battle, they learned a great truth - that there are no atheists in the foxholes.’

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation, run by Michael Weinstein, left, is calling for Lt. Col. Kenneth Reyes, right, to be disciplined for his 'anti-secular diatribe'

Just five hours after the article was posted, it was taken down following complaints from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), reports Fox News.

It describes itself as a ‘civil rights organization’ whose goal is to 'ensure that members of the United States Armed Forces receive the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom to which they are entitled by virtue of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.’

The organization contacted the base commander, Col. Brian Duffy, on behalf of its 42 members stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and demanding he take action Reyes’ 'anti-secular diatribe.'

The MRFF claimed Lt. Col. Reyes violated military regulation AFI 1-1, section 2.11 which requires 'Leaders at all levels must...avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates...'

'No Atheists in Foxholes': The title of Reyes' article was a reference to a famous remark made in a 1954 speech by President Eisenhower

In a letter to Duffy the organization accused Lt. Col. Reyes of using a 'bigoted, religious supremacist phrase' which  'defiles the dignity of service members.'

Now the MRFF, which is run by Michael Weinstein, is also demanding that the chaplain should be disciplined.

‘Faith based hate is hate all the same,’ the group said in the letter. ‘Lt. Col. Reyes must be appropriately punished.’

Meanwhile pro-Christian groups are angered that the article was taken down and claim that it is Lt. Col. Reyes' first amendment rights that have been violated.

'A chaplain has been censored for expressing his beliefs about the role of faith in the lives of service members. … Why do we have chaplains if they aren’t allowed to fulfill that purpose?,' the Family Research Council told Breitbart.

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation claims to represent 34,115 men and women in uniform and says 96% of those clients are Protestant or Roman Catholic.
