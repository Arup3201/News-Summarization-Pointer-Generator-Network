This is the moment a huge python regurgitates a full-grown dog in front on stunned bystanders on a Bangkok street.

The snake - which appears to measure more than 12ft in length - writhes around as the large swollen mass in its stomach is slowly brought tack through its dislocated jaw.

First the dog's hind legs emerge, then the rest of its body, in the video clip filmed on the phone of an onlooker.

Warning: Graphic content

Stuffed to bursting: The body of the dog can been seen in the swollen stomach of the python 

Open wide: The snake dislocates its jaw as it forces the carcass of the dog from its body

The entire, horrifying spectacle unfolded on Thailand's Burana district in little more than three minutes.

A snake-handler can then been seen capturing the snake at the end of the video. 

It
is thought the hungry animal, which kills its prey by constricting 
before swallowing it whole, bit off more than it could cope with.

Quite a mouthful: The undigested dog emerges from the mouth of the large python in front of shocked bystanders in the busy Burana district of Bangkok

Full: Experts believe the python had eaten more than it could cope with and regurgitated the dog so it was able to move

Unable to move with the large weight of the dog in its stomach, the snake regurgitated the dog in order to lighten its load.

Since being uploaded to YouTube and LiveLeak, the video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.

The
event of a snake bringing back up undigested food is rarely seen but 
quite common in the natural world, according to experts.

Stomach churning: The horrifying incident was captured on camera and uploaded to video websites where more than 150,000 people have watched it

Regurgitation: A snake handler was on the scene to deal with the enormous reptile one it had regurgitated the dog

Australian Reptile Park reptiles and spiders supervisor, Julie Mendezona told ninemsn:
'It seems like a typical case where the animal's eaten something, 
because it's hungry, but with snakes once they have eaten a large item 
they can't really move very well.

'All
that commotion is spooking the snake and he can't get away quick 
enough. He's probably pretty scared at the moment, so what he's trying 
to do is get away.'
