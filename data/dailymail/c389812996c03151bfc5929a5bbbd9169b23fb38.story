Palm oil plantation workers were today blamed for the deaths of 14 pygmy elephants on the remote island of Borneo.

Wildlife rangers believe that the creatures could have eaten toxic substances laid to keep away 'pests' from the highly lucrative crop.

The animals live on land in the Gunung Rara 
Forest Reserve which is very close to palm oil fields.

Thriving: The orphan pygmy elephant is being cared for at a wildlife reserve where it was taken after the death of its mother

A total of 14 pygmy elephants are now know to have died. Four adults were discovered yesterday in addition to ten bodies found earlier in the week.

Vets said that all the dead elephants had suffered severe bleeding and gastrointestinal ulcers, suggesting they had been poisoned.

Among the survivors is a three-month-old calf which was pictured pitifully trying to rouse his mother after she dropped down dead.

It is now being cared for at a wildlife park in Sabah where rangers have found it a home with other orphans.  

Wildlife workers fear that more elephants could have been poisoned and are lying undiscovered in the remoter parts of Borneo.

Laurentius Ambu, 
Sabah’s director of wildlife, said: ‘We are very concerned that 
many more carcasses are going to turn up.

'Because the elephants 
travel in herds they are going to be picking up the poisons together so 
we fear that there are still more dead that are going to be found.’

He said that rangers were scouring the island for areas where poison could have been laid.

‘My hunch is that there may be more (carcasses). I don’t think it’s an accident,' he added, explaining that the area where the dead elephants were found is 
part of a 100,000-acre (40,469-hectare) piece of 'commercial forest 
reserve' land managed by state agency Sabah Foundation.

He said the area
was slated to be used as a tree plantation for sustainable logging. So 
far, two palm oil plantations and a logging company operate in the area,
he said.

Mr Ambu said far too many jungle areas 
in Sabah were being broken up by agricultural or logging activities, 
without corridors linking them to allow animals to pass through.

'This shouldn't be. The fragmentation
of forests has disrupted the elephants' traditional routes to look for 
food.

'It is highly suspected that the 
poisoning is blatantly done or that it's a well-planned programme.'

Police are investigating the deaths and officials have declined to say whether there are any suspects.

Meanwhile, conservationists say they 
are deeply concerned about the effects the palm oil industry is having 
on the wildlife of Borneo.

A spokesman for the WWF said that the dead elephants were found in areas being converted for plantations, giving fresh urgency to activists' warnings of
rising conflict between man and wildlife as development accelerates.

'The central forest landscape in Sabah needs to be protected totally from conversion,' the group said in a statement.

'Conversions result in fragmentation of the forests, which in turn 
results in loss of natural habitat for elephant herds, thus forcing them
to find alternative food and space, putting humans and wildlife wildlife in direct conflict.'

Suspicious: Conservation officials believe the elephants, discovered in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, had been poisoned

'Sad day': A total of seven female and three male pygmy elephants have been found in the forest over the past three weeks

The first ten known deaths of the 
pygmy elephants were made public this week, capturing wide attention as 
only about 1,200 of the elephants exist worldwide.

Authorities released several 
photographs of the elephant carcasses, including a particularly poignant
one of the three-month-old surviving calf trying to wake its dead 
mother.

Most of the pygmy elephants live in 
Sabah and grow to about 8 feet (245 centimetres) tall, a foot or two 
shorter than mainland Asian elephants.

Known for their babyish faces, large 
ears and long tails, Borneo pygmy elephants were found to be a distinct 
subspecies only in 2003, after DNA testing.

Sabah is one of the poorest states in
Malaysia. Sabah Foundation was granted huge forest concessions, 
totaling about 14 percent of total land area in Sabah, by the state 
government to enable it to generate income to fund its aim of improving 
the lives of poor rural people.

The Sabah Foundation website said it 
had adopted sound forest management policies to ensure the areas are 
managed on a sustainable basis.
