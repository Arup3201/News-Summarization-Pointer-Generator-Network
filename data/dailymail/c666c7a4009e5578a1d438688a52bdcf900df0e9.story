Teachers have been encouraged to introduce pornography into the classroom, using sex education lessons to explain that porn is 'not all bad' and 'hugely diverse'.

The recommendations, included in an educational guide, suggest that teachers confront 'myths' about porn and inform children as young as five about sexualisation.

The guidance could have significant influence in British schools after the Government's decision to keep sex education lessons voluntary, leaving schools to devise their own ways of teaching the subject.

Guidance from the Sex Education Forum, whose members include the NSPCC and Barnardo's, encourages teachers to introduce pornography into the classroom

The Daily Mail has led a long-running campaign to introduce measures to protect young people from the growing influence of porn.

But the guidance, produced by a coalition of charities, encourages dialogue in the classroom about all aspects of pornography.

Issued by the Sex Education Forum, whose members include the NSPCC and Barnardo's, the guidance encourages teachers to inform children over the age of 11 about subjects such as sexting, whereby sexually explicit images and pictures are sent in text messages.

Critics said that parents would be 'horrified' by the possible introduction of pornography into classroom lessons.

Under a section titled 'We want teachers to know', the guide includes advice that 'that porn is hugely diverse – it's not necessarily all bad'.

The 'wish list' section, which aims to create the 'ideal environment' for teaching about sexual issues, also advises teachers to 'speak frankly and confidently' about pornography.

In a model lesson plan, it is 
suggested that children are told about the differences between what is 
'real' and 'unreal' in pornography, using a device known as the 'planet 
porn game'.

The guidance, contained within the body's first Sex Educational Supplement titled The Porn Issue, also suggests that teachers use a website that describes porn as 'great' and something that can be enjoyed.

A statement on TheSite.org reads: 'Sex is great. And porn can be great. It's the idea that porn sex is like real sex which is the problem.

'But if you can separate the fantasy from the reality you're much more likely to enjoy both.'

Younger children should be taught about 'image manipulation in advertising and body image', according to the guide.  

The Family Education Trust's Norman Wells criticised the guide, saying: 'The intention appears to be to steer children and young people away from a belief in moral absolutes and to encourage them to think that there are no rights and wrongs when it comes to sexual expression.'

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Many parents will be horrified at the prospect of their children being taught about pornography within such a framework.

'To take a no-holds barred approach to sex education has the potential to break down pupils' natural sense of reserve and to encourage casual attitudes towards sex.'

'If we want children to view sexual intimacy as something valuable, special and worthy of respect, it needs to be addressed with modesty and restraint. To give lessons on pornography is to play with fire.'

The Government announced in March that sex education would remain voluntary under the National Curriculum after the previous Labour administration tried to make the lessons compulsory.

The Daily Mail has been calling for tough restrictions to protect youngsters. David Cameron has promised that new computers will be automatically be fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them - but has not said when this will happen.
