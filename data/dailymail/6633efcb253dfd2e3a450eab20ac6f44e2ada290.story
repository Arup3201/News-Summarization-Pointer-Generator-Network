The International Space Station will have its most female-heavy crew in years as when Italy's first female astronaut joins the vessel this weekend.

Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, will launch into space from a facility in Kazakhstan this Sunday, where she will join Russian Elena Serova, who has been in orbit since September.

It will only be the second time that two women have been on board the ISS at once, making the six-member crew one third female.

Companion: Elena Serova, a Russian, is already in orbit on the International Space Station. Cristoforetti's arrival will make the crew more women-heavy than it has been since 2010

Cristoforetti's arrival will also bring a new first to space, as she will bring a specially-designed Italian espresso machine along with her.

The so-called ISSpresso machine, which weighs 44lbs, is designed to work in zero gravity, and will be the first device of its kind outside the earth's atmosphere, the Guardian reported.  

A joint statement from coffee company Lavazza and space-food makers Argotec said Cristoforetti: 'will be not only the first female astronaut from Italy to go into space, but also the very first astronaut in the history of the conquest of space to savor an authentic Italian espresso in orbit'.

She will take just 20 capsules with her, but more can be sent up if the machine proves popular.

Cristoforetti's expedition has not been attended by looming questions of gender, unlike that of Serova, who found herself quizzed on her hair and make-up decisions by Russia media.

'Space is what I do for work, and that's what I think about it: It's my work,' Serova said in a NASA interview before launch in late September. 

Russian reporters asked if she was taking up makeup and wondered how she would wear her hair during her six-month mission.

Serova ignored the makeup question. As for her hairdo, she shot back:

'I have a question for you — why don't you ask the question about Alexander's hair, for example,' she said, referring to crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev seated next to her at the news conference. 'I'm sorry, this is my answer. Thank you. More questions?' 

Both Serova and Cristoforetti will spend six months aboard the 260-mile-high complex, following in the footsteps of nine American women who logged lengthy stays.

Two of those U.S. women shared the place in 2010, with four men. Another two women rose to station commander rank.

Cristoforetti is the first woman assigned to a lengthy space station mission by the European Space Agency, which recently masterminded the Philae rover landing on a comet.

Serova is one of only four Russian women to fly in space and the first to live at this space station. It was 1963 when Russia launched the world's first spacewoman, Valentina Tereshkova, beating America by two full decades, and 1984 when it flew the first world's female spacewalker, Svetlana Savitskaya.

That's my ride: Cristoforetti, and her espresso machine, will be carried into space by a Russian Soyuz-FG booster rocket, pictured above at its launchpad in Kazakhstan

Serova and Cristoforetti's joint flight comes as U.S. medical researchers take an updated look at gender differences in space. With space station missions spanning a half-year and expected to last considerably longer on trips to Mars, NASA wants to make sure all astronauts — male and female alike — stay safe and healthy.

This month, the Journal of Women's Health published a series of studies on the impact of gender on adapting to space.

It turns out that women tend to suffer more faintness when trying to stand upon immediate return to Earth and also more vertigo, according to the report, and they appear to lose more blood plasma during spaceflight. Male astronauts seem to suffer more vision impairment due to intracranial pressure in orbit than women, although the difference is not statistically significant given the small number of subjects, researchers noted.

There also are concerns about astronauts' reproductive health stemming from space radiation as well as weightlessness.

'Many questions remain unanswered,' the executive summary concluded.

Dr. Saralyn Mark, an endocrinologist who serves as a government science adviser, said in an accompanying commentary that the findings can still be useful in shaping health-related policies and procedures.

Mark and the other authors and researchers — representing NASA, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute in Houston and various universities — recommend that more women fly in space, and more astronauts of both genders participate as test subjects.

That will be challenging given the overwhelming number of male astronauts. Of NASA's 43 current active astronauts, 11 are women.
