Disney Channel star Debby Ryan has revealed further details about her relationship with an abusive male friend, just a few months after sharing for the first time the level of abuse she had suffered at his hands.

The 21-year-old star of Jessie and The Suite Life on Deck told People how the friend, whose identity is not known, was 'emotionally and mentally abusive' - and how she finally decided enough was enough.

'I was like, "I'm a powerful woman and I'm a producer",' she said. 'I never thought that this [would be] happening to me, and it was absolutely happening to me. It was kind of late in the game by the time I realized that this was not healthy.'

'It was a couple of years ago,' the Alabama-born actress explained, adding that the abuse first began at a time when her life seemed 'amazing' - she was the star of one hit Disney Channel show and already had another one under her belt.

But she says one of her close friends began growing increasingly jealous and demanding of her time and attention.

The star described how on one occasion, her obsessive friend followed her to her car, grabbed her wrists, and took her keys, before crawling into her passenger side window so Debby couldn't leave to see her other friends.

The abusive friend - who Debby insists is not her ex-boyfriend, Twenty One Pilots drummer Josh Dun - also tried to move in with her, so Debby paid for a nearby hotel room to to give him another place to stay.

'That was literally just for sleeping,' she explained, adding that the pair would still see each other 'every day, hours a day, month on month on month'.

When her friend threatened to kill himself if Debby didn't spend more time with him, the actress realized that  it was time to put an end to the relationship once and for all. 

On top of her game: Few of her other friends knew about Debby's struggle; most of the time, like on the set of her show Jessie, the star's life seemed carefree

'I realized I'd done everything that I could do,' she said. 'It's not my purpose to sacrifice my own happiness and sacrifice my own mental health so that this guy doesn't overdose. 

'I called someone and had someone go and be with him, and I removed myself from the situation and realized he's no longer mine to deal with.'

Now, Debby has decided to speak up to help other young people cope with abusive relationships.

She has teamed up with Mary Kay and Love Is Respect's Don't Look Away campaign, which offers abusive relationship counseling over text message to those who text 'loveis' to 22522.
