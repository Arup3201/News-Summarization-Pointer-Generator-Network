Schools across the country reported problems as Nick Clegg’s flagship policy of giving free meals to all young children was introduced yesterday.

The initiative was hailed a ‘massive success’ by the Liberal Democrats, but even schools in Mr Clegg’s Sheffield backyard admitted they couldn’t cook their own hot meals.

Nine primaries in the city are bussing in meals cooked at neighbouring schools amid claims of a £400,000 shortfall in funds to upgrade kitchens.

Reports also emerged of canteen renovations over-running and deliveries of vital equipment such as tables and chairs failing to turn up.

One school is offering hot meals on a ‘first come, first served’ basis while another even considered serving airline food supplied by local airports before opting for cold sandwiches.

As they battle to implement the controversial £1billion policy, some schools are seating children for lunch in classrooms, music rooms or Portakabins because they lack dining space. 

Others are running three lunch sittings, restricting pupils’ choice of food and asking seven-year-olds to serve drinks to younger pupils to take pressure off staff.

Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws declared the scheme, which involves offering free lunches to all four to seven-year-olds, a ‘massive success’, while Mr Clegg insisted that giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that ‘giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom’.

But critics claim the educational and health benefits touted by Mr Clegg have yet to be rigorously proven. 

They also claim councils and schools have been forced to raid other budgets to push the initiative through because the Government failed to properly fund it.

Oliver Coppard, Labour’s candidate against Mr Clegg in next year’s national polls, said: ‘In trying to get this policy in place before the General Election, Nick Clegg has – as usual – over-promised and under-delivered.’

At Dudley Infant Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, hot meals are on a ‘first come, first served basis’, with a cold packed lunch available as an alternative. In Portsmouth, Solent Infant School will use its music room as a lunch area and a Portakabin has been installed at Devonshire Infant School to provide additional dining space.

Bournemouth Council said 12 primary schools – half of the town’s total – will start the year by offering free cold packed lunches to some or all of its key stage one pupils rather than hot meals.

Nick Clegg yesterday made a string of assertions about why his policy was destined to be an overwhelming success. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK sorts the claims from the reality.

CLAIM: All the evidence, and this has been stress-tested and analysed, shows it has a dramatic effect on educational performance.

REALITY: The Department for Education’s own evaluation of pilots in London and Durham found a 1.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in reading at Key Stage 1 and a 2.2 percentage point increase for maths. 

Critics says that, overall, this is barely statistically significant. For the highest performing children, there was no positive impact. 

Crucially, the authors of the study admit the reasons for the improvement in overall performance were not clear. 

The pilots included a wider programme to promote healthy eating, such as providing advice to parents, which may also be responsible.

CLAIM: It is good for children’s health.

REALITY: The evaluation stated there was no evidence the two-year pilot led to significant health benefits. 

For instance, it found ‘there was no evidence of any change in children’s Body Mass Index’. 

Researchers also found the pilot did not appear to significantly improve children’s behaviour or absence rates from school.

CLAIM: The policy is about having children share a healthy meal together at lunchtime rather than having children parcelled off, one group at one end of the room on free school meals and the other not.

REALITY: Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he could think of no examples in ‘living memory’ of schools segregating pupils who receive free school meals.

CLAIM: I strongly dispute this idea that as we balance the books we don’t do more to invest in a future in which every boy and girl irrespective of their birth gets the best possible chances in life.

REALITY: The key point. Firstly, with the deficit still running at more than £100billion, the Government is not ‘balancing the books’. 

The money to pay for school meals amounts to £1billion of extra borrowing. 

Many head teachers argue it could be spent far better elsewhere.

Coincidentally, councils warned last month of a £1bn shortfall in the funding they need to provide the school places needed to cope with Britain’s rapidly growing population. 

The number of children in classes of more than 30 has increased by 200 per cent since 2010 – breaking the Prime Minister’s promise to create ‘small schools with smaller class sizes’.

Julian Rutherford, of Principals Catering, which supplies schools in the South East, said: ‘We are ready to launch the expanded free meals policy but it is likely there will be teething problems.

‘We are having to transport food into 16 schools which do not have kitchens, mostly in Faversham and Sittingbourne.’

In Somerset, the BBC reported that 46 schools out of 201 are unable to provide hot meals. In Buckinghamshire, the figure was 45 out of 159. 

Lynda Mitchell, contracts manager for North Somerset Council, said she had been ‘almost reduced to tears… by builders not meeting agreed deadlines and not apparently caring’.

Jo Wotton, a catering manager for five schools in Cornwall, tweeted that one school was refusing to offer free meals at all ‘until they get their kitchen in October’.

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There will be some schools that will be providing a cold meal this term while they wait for the building work to finish off.

‘The logistics of getting large numbers of children through, how you schedule the timings of lunch and whether you’ve got kids eating in their classrooms or not – all that will be quite difficult for schools. They’ll manage it but it’ll put a huge burden on them.’

Some £1billion has been earmarked over two years to cover the cost of meals, while £150million has been spent upgrading kitchens, with an additional £22.5million going to smaller schools. 

The Department for Education said only 239 out of 16,500 schools would be providing a cold meal instead of a hot one this week.

Mr Laws said: ‘I am absolutely delighted that our statistics, which come from local authorities and schools, show that 98.5 per cent of schools across the country – 16,500 schools – are delivering a hot meal option from the start of term.’

It was a ‘massive success’, he said.
