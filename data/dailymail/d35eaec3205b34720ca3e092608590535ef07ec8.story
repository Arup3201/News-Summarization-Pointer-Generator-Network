The mother of the UK's biggest family could soon be crowned Britain's best parenting blogger after posts about her brood of 16 kids reached the final.

Sue Radford, 38, who has nine sons and seven daughters, set up a blog to capture memories about her children's lives.

But after the competition received more than 20,000 nominations, Sue is one of only 75 bloggers to reach the final of the UK's MAD Blog awards.

The Radford Family Blog, which is read by more than 100,000 people every month, tells of the ups and downs of being mother to the UK's biggest family and offers tips for parents, as well as easy-to-make recipes.

Sue, who lives with husband Noel, 41, in a nine-bedroom former care home in Morecambe, Lancs., said: 'I am delighted and amazed.

'I started writing a blog in 2013 just as a way to capture memories about my children's lives and its grown from there.

'Being a finalist means the world to me, and all my family are so proud.'

Sue, who starred with Noel and their brood in Channel Four TV show '16 Kids and Counting', tells the tale of how the couple met as childhood sweethearts, and offers an insight into the Radfords' extraordinary daily life.

The blog also tells the heartbreaking story of how they lost her 17th baby last September after a miscarriage.

One
 of the posts reads: 'I saw a friend in the ultrasound department who I 
was talking to, we wished each other good luck and I wasn't thinking for
 one minute that it would be a day that would change our lives.

'I
 had my eyes fixed on it waiting to see our beautiful little baby and 
the first thing I thought was 'oh wow' look how much bigger he/she is. 

'We could see little arms and legs and then my heart sunk and the reality hit me that I couldn't see a heartbeat.

'I looked away at the wall praying that she was going to say oh look there's the heartbeat, but there was just silence.

'I have never felt such unbearable pain like it.

'Nothing
 prepares you for those words 'there is no heartbeat' and I cannot get 
the image of our baby on the screen out of my head and that will live 
with me forever.'

The couple, who married when they were 17 years old, had their first child in 1989, when Sue was aged just 14, and their latest in 2012

The couple, who married when they were 17 years old, had their first child Chris in 1989, when Sue was aged just 14, and their youngest, Casper, came along in 2012.

They are also parents to Sophie, 19, Chloe, 18, Jack, 16, Daniel, 14, Luke, 12, Millie, 12, Katie, ten, James, nine, Ellie, eight, Aimee, seven, Josh, five, Max, four, Tilly, three, and Oscar, two.

The Radfords, who run a bakery and are completely self-sufficient, receive no state benefits.

Incredibly, each day the family eats three loaves of bread, two boxes of cereal and 18 pints of milk, while an average supper can include 16 pork chops, 15lbs of potatoes, three cabbages and 30 carrots.

Sue added: 'I know people stare. Some think they won't get the attention they need, but people don't realise how dedicated we are.'

The Radfords will find out if they are a winner at a red carpet award ceremony in London this September.

If Sue wins, she will receive £750 of shopping vouchers. Vote for the Radford blog to win by going to www.theradfordfamily.co.uk.

I have never felt such unbearable pain like it. I just sat staring at the wall in disbelief that our baby was gone.

I have gone through so many emotions from overwhelming grief to feeling so down to thinking I never ever want to see another pregnancy test ever again because the thought would totally freak me out and emotionally I just couldn't deal with it to just so angry and wondering why? was it something I did?

When I was at secondary school for the five years that I was there and also for the five years that Sue was there not once did the uniform change. We had a choice of a jumper or a blazer plus the P.E kit.

So why now do schools- secondary and primary feel the need that they need to change these uniforms every couple of years. Our primary school changed theirs two years ago but to be fair we have used this school for 14 years and this was the first time that they had changed it.

It’s a different story for the high school, we have just had yet another letter saying that they are going to change uniforms again, so we have gone from jumpers to blazers as they said they are smarter looking but oh no they have changed their minds again and we are now going back to jumpers with a new logo so I would imagine that the P.E kit will want changing also.

This week has been fun in the Radford house, we’ve had Tillie with chicken pox, luckily she hasn’t really suffered with them and definitely hasn’t been as covered in them as what I remember last time ours got them. We haven’t had any children get chicken pox for over 8 years but it would be just before we are due to go on holiday!
