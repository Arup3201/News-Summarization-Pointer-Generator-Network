The key witness in the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was arrested for lying to cops three years ago and currently has an outstanding arrest warrant.

Dorian Johnson, 22, was arrested by police in Jefferson City, Missouri, in June 2011 after he allegedly stole a delivery package off a doorstep in an apartment complex. He was attending college at Lincoln University in the city, which is about 120miles west of Ferguson.

When cops asked Johnson for his name, he told them he was Derrick Johnson and that he was 16 - though he gave officer a birth date that would have made him 17, according to an arrest report obtained by MailOnline. 

Officers later found a student ID in Johnson's sock that gave his real name.

He was charged with misdemeanor theft and filing a false police report. He pleaded guilty to the latter charge. When he didn't show up to court to answer the theft charge, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest.

Johnson was with Brown on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri, when 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson. Shortly after the shooting, Johnson told local TV stations that Brown had been surrendering when Wilson opening fire without cause or warning. The footage played on TV networks across the nation.

'(Brown) put his hands in the air and he started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired several more shots and my friend died... He didn't say anything to him, he just stood over him and he was shooting. 

'We wasn't committing no crime or bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood.'

Johnson's account of the shooting sparked fury in Ferguson and outrage across the nation. Johnson later gave several more interviews, including to CNN and MSNBC.

Ferguson police later released  a police report that named Brown as a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store minutes before he was killed and listed Johnson as being at the scene.

Johnson never mentioned the robbery in his TV interviews. 

Johnson's lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., told WND-TV that the outstanding warrant had been 'resolved.' 

He said Johnson had been arrested in St. Louis on the warrant. After 14 days, when the deputies from Cole County never came to extradite him back to Jefferson City, St. Louis police released him without charge. 

Last week, St. Louis NAACP president Adolphus Pruitt told the Post-Dispatch that Johnson's arrest for lying to police didn't hurt his credibility as a witness.

'He’s been very clear about what occurred, and now we have ... four others stating facts that support the statements he’s been making,' Pruitt told the newspaper. 

'Why would that diminish other accounts that are relatively the same?'
