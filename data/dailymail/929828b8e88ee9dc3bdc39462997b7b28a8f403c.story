Patients endured ‘completely unacceptable’ conditions when they were forced to stay in a hospital’s day-surgery ward for up to four days because of NHS bed shortages.

With no showers on the ward, they had to clean themselves in disposable cardboard wash bowls filled with water.

And because there were no proper catering facilities, they were given sandwiches and frozen ready meals heated in a microwave instead of freshly prepared food.

Pindersfields General Hospital: Legal restriction to stop it from keeping patients in the surgical day unit for more than 23 hours

Patients on the ward also had to leave their belongings on the floor because there were no bedside cupboards.

The failings were discovered at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, by Care Quality Commission inspectors.

To ensure the ‘safety and wellbeing’ 
of patients, the watchdog body has now banned the hospital from keeping 
them on the day-surgery ward for more than 24 hours.

Patients on the day unit did not receive freshly cooked meals for days and washed in disposable bowls

The disposable cardboard wash bowls 
they were required to use are favoured  by NHS staff over plastic ones 
as there is  a lower risk of infections being spread between patients.

Due to a clause in the hospital’s 
catering contract, it cannot provide patients with hot food from the 
kitchen on the day- surgery ward.

Stephen Eames, interim chief executive of the trust, said: 'We do accept that the facilities and environment on this unit were not entirely suitable for inpatients'

Patients were only meant to stay in 
the unit for up to 24 hours before being discharged or transferred to 
another ward, but some had to remain there for four days.

Malcolm Bower-Brown, deputy director 
of the CQC in the North, said: ‘The failings we witnessed on this unit 
at Pinderfields Hospital were completely unacceptable.

‘The CQC took swift action following our inspection to ensure the safety and wellbeing of patients.

‘The decision to place an urgent 
condition on a provider’s registration is not one we take lightly. 
However, when we find poor practice, as we did in this case, we will 
take immediate action to ensure patients are not at risk.’

The hospital will now have to prove to
the watchdog that it  has made substantial improvements and may face 
further  inspections. Patients staying in the ward had all undergone day
surgery including having hernias removed, varicose vein treatment or 
dental operations.

Most having such procedures are 
allowed to go home on the same day, but some have to stay on after 
developing complications or taking longer to recover.

Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow public 
health minister, said: ‘The failings here are totally unacceptable, and 
it’s a real concern that incidents like this seem to be becoming 
increasingly commonplace because of the strain the NHS has been put 
under.’
