Designers regularly find their goods copied and sold to tourists desperate to have the latest 'it bag'. But no one would have guessed that bargain superstore Primark would be affected by copycats.

Looking for all the world like the real thing, a fake version of the popular fast-fashion high street clothing chain has opened up in Dubai - much to the shock of the genuine Primark owners.

British shoppers in Dubai who have visited the phoney Primark store say the clothes bear little resemblance to the clothes found in the real Primark stores.

Located on Bank Street in the Bur Dubai district, the fake store has been opened by Iranian expatriate Yaqoub Hatami and four partners.

The brand means little to its Arabian customers, with only tourists and ex-pats recognising the familiar name.

Discussing the venture the entrepreneur claims he didn't know about the famous UK brand when he opened - but now says he would like to be an official partner of the genuine Primark brand, which is owned by Associate British Food.

Legal battle? A spokesman for the real Primark, pictured above, said the store was 'not legitimate' and the company was considering its legal options

He said: 'We are talking to them now, we want to be their franchise partner here in Dubai, we can make Primark famous in the Middle East.'

A spokesperson for the Ireland-based brand said: 'This is not a legitimate store and the company is considering its legal options.'

If the UAE close the branch Hatami could face a fine of up to Â£1,680.

This
is the second courtroom battle for the budget chain following a fake 
childrenswear branch opening in Norway last month. Trading standards 
have been notified of both.

Primark currently operates 236 stores in the UK, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Portugal
