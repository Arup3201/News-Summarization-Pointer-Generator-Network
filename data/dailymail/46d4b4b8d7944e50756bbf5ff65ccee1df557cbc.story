Woolwich terror suspect Michael Adebolajo was filmed encouraging 1,500 followers to turn against Britain in a hate-filled rant on the anniversary of 9/11.

Video footage unearthed by the Daily Mail shows the alleged killer addressing a crowd of young Muslims outside a mosque in north London.

Standing on a platform above a large crowd, Adebolajo yells: ‘Do not be scared of the filthy kuffar [non-believers]. They are pigs.’

Holding forth: Adebolajo at the rally on the eighth anniversary of September 11 outside Harrow Central Mosque in north London

Moments after his speech – delivered in 2009 on the eighth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington DC that left nearly 3,000 dead – some of the crowd hurled bricks and fireworks at the police.

Film of the extremist rant follows the revelation – the day after the slaughter of Drummer Lee Rigby last week – of photos of Adebolajo standing behind hate preacher Anjem Choudary outside Paddington Green police station six years ago.

It prompted MPs to call for an inquiry into what MI5 knew about Adebolajo and the other terror suspect Michael Adebowale.

The emergence of the video shows for the first time the prominent role Adebolajo played as an Islamic radical.

It is bound to raise further questions over whether the police and the security services should have intervened earlier.

Last night, Michael Adebowale, 22, was charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby and possession of a firearm. He will appear at Westminster Magistrate's Court today.

Adebolajo is thought to remain in a serious condition and it could be weeks before he is fit enough to be questioned.

The video of the 28-year-old Muslim convert is one of many incendiary sermons that can be found on YouTube.

During his speech outside Harrow Central Mosque in north London in 2009, Adebolajo tells the crowd not to be scared of  the police.

Wearing a white skull cap and a traditional black Islamic robe, he says: ‘You are here only to please Allah. You aren’t here for any other reason.’

The demonstration was organised in response to a nearby protest by the English Defence League and a group called Stop the Islamisation of Europe.

During the 80-second clip, Adebolajo says that the Prophet Muhammad fought against ‘way worse’ opposition.

‘They are pigs,’ he shouts. ‘Allah says they are worse than cattle. Do not be scared of them. And do not turn your back to them. Don’t be scared of them, or police, or the cameras.’

A witness at the rally said of Adebolajo’s address: ‘After the speech some of them started running around. An imam even came out at one stage and told the hotheads to calm down and get inside the mosque, saying that they should be praying.

‘I thought it was time for me to get out.’

The Stop Islamisation of Europe group had pledged that its protest would be peaceful and  eventually claimed it called off the protest following appeals  by police.

But despite the presence of nearly 500 officers, tensions spilled over when a gang of 100 Islamic radicals – their faces covered with ski masks – chased members of far-Right groups who had turned up.

It is not known whether Adebolajo was part of this group, although at one point he had urged his supporters to avoid violence and be ‘sincere to Allah’.

Police arrested ten people.
