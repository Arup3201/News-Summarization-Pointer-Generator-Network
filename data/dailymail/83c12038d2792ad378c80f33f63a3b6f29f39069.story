When lifeboatman Mark Thorne lost his wedding ring in the sea during an emergency call-out, he pulled out all the stops to get it back.

He scoured the shoreline with a metal detector and even searched for it underwater using scuba gear, before finally giving up hope.

Now, six years later, he has finally been reunited with the precious piece of jewellery after a friend stumbled across it during a walk at low tide.

Lifeboatman Mark Thorne has been reunited with his wedding ring, six years after he lost it in the sea

Mr Thorne, pictured with his wife Sarah, lost his ring at sea while he was helping to launch a life boat in 2009

Mr Thorne's platinum ring, which has a distinctive dent, came off his finger and plopped into the water in 2009 as he helped to launch a lifeboat in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset. 

It was eventually found by his friend Steve Woolford who had taken a stroll along the shoreline.

Mr Woolford said he had remembered the lost ring and thought 'you never know, it's worth a look' – before spotting it glinting in the mud. 

He added that he was 'over the moon' with the discovery.

Mr Thorne said he was 'really, really chuffed' to be reunited with the ring. 

'When I was a lifeboatman every time I got a shout I would move it to my right hand because it fitted better on that hand when my hands got cold,' Mr Thorne, who is now a paramedic, said.

'But it pinged off and plopped into the harbour.

'After I lost it I searched in dry suits with some fellow crew but found nothing. I even employed a man with a metal detector to help find it and went down every month on low spring tides to no avail.

'Luckily the ring does still fit but it was always slightly loose.

'I really did believe it was gone until Steve found it years later. I'd like to say a massive thank you to him for continuing to look, even after I'd given up finding it.'

Mr Thorne's wife Sarah added: 'It's absolutely crazy. When Mark lost it I never thought I'd see it again but it's definitely his ring. It's an incredible end to the story.'

The former lifeboatman, who married in 2004, said: 'I think I owe Steve a bottle of whisky.'

Mr Woolford said he had always kept an eye out for the ring because he works on the harbour.

He said: 'It was an exceptionally low tide in Saturday afternoon so thought I would have a look, just in case.

'I climbed down the ladder to get onto the seabed and literally just two feet out in the mud there it was.

'I remember Mark telling me it was a thin, platinum ring with a smell dent in which was the same as the one I found.

'The magnitude of the situation didn't sink in at first and I put it on Facebook rather than phone Mark straight away.

'He saw it later that evening and came and picked it up. If we were women we would have been hugging each other and crying about it, but Mark said "cheers" and I'm waiting for him to buy me a beer.

'It is a great feeling to give the ring back to him after all these years. He must have resigned himself to the fact that he had lost it forever.'
