A top Buckingham Palace official appeared court today accused of receiving more than £100,000 in bribes in return for awarding contracts for work at royal palaces.

Ron Harper, 62, was deputy property manager at the Royal Household from 1994 until his suspension in 2012. 

It is alleged that between 2006 and 2011, company directors bribed Harper in return for him awarding them large contracts for work at the palaces.

The maintenance work at Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace and Kensington Palace, was funded by the Civil List, now called the Sovereign Grant, and came straight out of taxpayer's pockets. 

Harper, who was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen in 2004, appeared at Southwark Crown Court with eight other men and one woman, who are yet to enter pleas.

Harper, from Sudbury, Suffolk, is charged with four counts of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments.

Steven Thompson, 60, of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, and Bernard Gackowski, 61, of Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, former directors of Melton Power Services, are both charged with one count of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by abuse of position.

David Woodhams, 46, of Stanmer Village, Brighton, a former director of DWEC, Aseai Zlaoui, 39, of Witham, Essex, and Christopher Murphy, 54, of Witham, Essex, directors of BSI Nordale, and Harry Howard, 80, of Chadderton, a director of Atlantic 2000, are all charged with one count of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments.

Alan Rollinson, 65, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, a relative of Harper's, is charged with one count of converting or transferring criminal property.

They are all due to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on November 28, for a plea and case management hearing.
