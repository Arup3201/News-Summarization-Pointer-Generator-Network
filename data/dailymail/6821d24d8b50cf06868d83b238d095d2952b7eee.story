A fundraiser for a pregnant widow whose husband was killed suddenly in a tragic snowmobile accident has earned more than $65,000 in the space of five days.

Jeffrey Kinn, a 29-year-old metal worker from Greenville, New York, who didn't have life insurance, died last Thursday in a head-on collision between two snowmobiles, leaving his six-months pregnant wife Tyler, 23, without a father for their first child, a son.

The GoFundMe campaign was launched by the couple's best friend, Kaitlin Bray, who told Times Union: 'Greene County is one of the poorest communities in New York State. There is not an abundance of wealth here. The fact that people are donating anything at all, and everything they can, is what small-town living is all about.'

Kaitlin wrote of the campaign: 'My own pain is unbearable. None of us could even fathom Tyler's pain. Jeff would want to know that we will do anything to take care of his girl and we will.'

The other snowmobiler, William VanAlstyne, 32, from nearby Hannacroix, survived the collision and is being treated for his injures at Albany Medical Center Hospital.

Tyler, who married Jeff in September, is an administrative assistant and the younger sister of one of Jeff's high school friends.

According to reports, Jeff met Tyler at a birthday party and told friends immediately that he would one day marry her.

It took three years, however, for Jeff to persuade the object of his affection to date him, and another three years before they married.

Flood of support: The campaign, which was set up by the couple's best friend, has raised more than $65,000 since it was launched on Saturday, two days after Jeff's fatal accident

'Jeff was due to be a father in June 2015, and was looking forward to raising his son “the country way”,' his obituary reads.

'[He] worked for his father Brian at Modern Metal Fabricators in Hannacroix for many years. Jeff and Brian were two peas in a pod and were the best of friends.'

The funeral took place on Tuesday afternoon, and attracted long lines around the funeral home for four hours.

Kaitlin, who launched the campaign on Saturday, two days after Jeff's fatal accident, wrote in the description: 'To say that Jeffrey Kinn was an amazing, funny, loving, give the shirt off your back kind of guy would be the ultimate understatement.'

First-time mom: Donations made to Tyler will be used to help her financially support herself and her unborn son, who is due in June and will be named Wesson Roy 

Grateful: Kaitlin Bray (pictured), who launched the fundraiser, said, 'Greene County is one of the poorest communities in New York State. The fact that people are donating everything they can is what small-town living is all about'

She added, 'I know with every part of my being that Tyler will most likely kick my butt for doing this and say something like "this is totally unnecessary".... But truth be told, we feel helpless. So this my friend is our way of helping.'

Donations flooded in for the cause - currently standing at more than $64,000 of the $80,000 goal, and the money, donated by 630 people so far, can be used by Tyler in any way she sees fit.

'Whether this allows Tyler to take the time off of work she needs to grieve this loss, or she stashes money away for a college fund, or finishes the construction projects that Jeff had been working on since he bought the house... this is our way,' Kaitlin states.

A college fund has been set up at the National Bank of Coxsackie for the baby, who will be named Wesson Roy.
