BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis, 52, blames increased drug use among gay community on lack of children

BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis has revealed that gay people take more drugs because they don't have children, it has been reported. 

The gay broadcaster, who has always been candid about his own sexuality, said homosexuals were more prone to destructive behaviour as they were not bound by the same 'discipline.'

He was said to have described drug taking as 'socially infectious' among the gay community and said it was not helped by their slightly greater disposable income.

'The gay community has less discipline because it doesn't have kids to go home to, and slightly more disposable income, and then add to that that when these things catch on they tend to have a momentum,' the 52-year-old broadcaster told Attitude magazine. 

'Once gay people start taking drugs, they'll take more drugs because it's socially infectious and one person will take them, then another. I just think it's something gay people have to watch out for.' 

Davis comments come after the British Crime Survey found drug use among gay and bisexual men was three times higher than for straight men and was higher in the majority of individual drugs consumed including cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and cannabis

The same report concluded illegal drug use by gay and bisexual women was four times higher at almost 23% than among heterosexual women. 

This is not the first time that Davis has discussed drugs. 

In 2010 he was accused of using a new purge of health and safety rules to promote the legalisation of cannabis.

During an interview with, Lord Young, he seized on the Tory peer's remark that: ‘Frankly, if I want to do something stupid and break my leg or neck, that’s up to me.’ 

When Lord Young replied: ‘Haven’t you ever been skiing?’ the presenter retorted: ‘So if I want to smoke cannabis, that’s up to me as well, presumably?

‘What principle distinguishes between me doing something dangerous that can break my neck and having a spliff?’ 

The journalist, who presents the BBC Two current affairs programme, told Attitude magazine that he was 'tortured' during his teenage years due to his sexuality.

Mr Davis,who was formerly an economist before joining the BBC, said he now hopes 16-year-old's in the same position think 'it's not a very big deal.'

Davis, 52, who took over from Jeremy Paxman as Newsnight host, said that drug taking was socially infectious in the gay community

Mr Davis, who is also known for his role on Dragons’ Den and Radio 4 flagship breakfast news show Today, replaced Jeremy Paxman as the host of Newsnight last year.

When his appointment was announced Tony Hall, BBC director general said: 'Evan is an outstanding journalist, an extraordinarily clever and intelligent interviewer.

'He has a wonderful presence on TV. I’ve got no doubt he will be a really great presence on Newsnight.'
