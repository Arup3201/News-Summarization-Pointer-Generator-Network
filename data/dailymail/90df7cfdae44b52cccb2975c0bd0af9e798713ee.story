Nirmal Gill, 49, allegedly murdered his wife Rosemary Gill, 48, in the bedroom of their home on July 20 last year

A jealous husband battered his wife to death with a metal dumbbell after he hired private detectives and found out she was having an affair, a court heard.

Nirmal Gill, 49, is accused of murdering wife Rosemary, 48, after becoming ‘possessive’ and suspicious of her behaviour.

He contracted private investigators who fitted a tracking device to Mrs Gill’s car, a jury heard.

Gill then followed his wife and spotted her embracing her ex-husband during a secret meeting at a motorway service station, the court was told.

He is accused of carrying out the fatal  attack three days later, using a metal dumbbell to strike his wife in the head at least 12 times at their home.

Mrs Gill’s naked and bloodied body was discovered eight hours later by the couple’s daughter, Jasmine, 19, who had been sleeping in the room next door.

 Michael Fitton QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Gill admits manslaughter due to a loss of control, but denies murder.

But he argued: ‘He didn’t lose control of himself when he beat her to death – he knew what he was doing. He was killing her in revenge for what he had discovered about her behaviour because she had been unfaithful.

‘He was killing her because he was a jealous man who was never going to forgive her, not just for the affair but for lying to him. She paid for her affair with her life.’

Mr Fitton said Mrs Gill had been married to Andrew Cooper between 1982 and 1986, before marrying Gill in 1989.

‘To the outside world, the marriage appeared to have been happy enough, but those in the house were aware  that in reality it was otherwise,’ Mr  Fitton said.

The marriage began to struggle in 2013 and the couple began sleeping separately, Bristol Crown Court was told.

Mrs Gill met with Mr Cooper at the beginning of the year and they rekindled their friendship and later their relationship, the jury was told.

 By June, Mrs Gill informed her husband she wanted a divorce and contacted a solicitor to begin the legal process, Mr Fitton continued.

The couple argued, with Mrs Gill calling police for help on four separate occasions between June 9 and 21, the lawyer said.

‘The defendant, who had clearly expressed his love for Rosemary many times and continued to do so, was deeply upset about the decline and breakdown of the marriage,’ Mr Fitton said.

On July 19, Mrs Gill and Mr Cooper met at the Gordano Services on the  M5 near Portishead in Somerset, at 1.30pm, with the defendant following in a borrowed car.

Later that day, Mrs Gill and Gill spoke about their relationship and agreed it was ‘coming to an end’, the jury heard.

In the evening Mrs Gill left to meet Mr Cooper at a pub in the Cotswolds, where she told him Gill had agreed to leave home, it was said.

Mrs Gill returned home at around 10pm, texting Mr Cooper that Gill was asleep.

At 3am, neighbours heard banging noises at the three-bedroom property in Bristol. Miss Gill discovered her mother’s body at around midday, with her father sitting on the side of the bed.

'Possessive' Gill had hired a team of private investigators after he became suspicious that his wife may have been having an affair, Bristol Crown Court heard

On July 19, Mrs Gill and Mr Cooper met at Gordano Services on the M5 at 1.30pm. Gill allegedly used the agency to track his wife's Audi and followed her in a borrowed car.
Later that day, Mrs Gill and Gill agreed their relationship was 'coming to an end', the jury heard

She told him to leave the property and he returned at 9pm when he was arrested by police, the court heard.

In an interview, Gill initially told police he had flown into a rage after his wife called him a ‘sad, pathetic man’.

He later told officers he had taken a ‘cocktail of drink and drugs’ and could not remember attacking his wife, the jury was told.

The trial continues.
