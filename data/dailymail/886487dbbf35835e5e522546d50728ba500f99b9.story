A Mexican wrestling star suffered a fatal blow in the ring on Friday night in front of the thousands of fans in attendance - and the fight continued for nearly two minutes as he lay motionless on the mat.

Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, known as Hijo del Perro Aguayo, went limp on the ropes after a flying kick from one of his opponents, Oscar Gutierrez, known as Rey Misterio, Jr., hit his neck. 

The team match continued for almost two minutes before the other participants and the referee realized Aguayo was seriously injured and tended to him, according to video shot in a municipal auditorium in Tijuana, Mexico.

Mexico is famous for its colorful characters and costumes in professional wrestling, popularly known as lucha libre. 

The elder Aguayo was a lucha libre sensation from the 1970s to 1990s.

The younger Aguayo began wrestling in his teens and also was very popular, leading a group called 'Los Perros de Mal,' or the bad dogs.

Bleacher Report writes that Friday's match was supposed to be a celebration and it was Mysterio's first time fighting for the AAA since 1997 after leaving the WWE. 

Wrestler Hijo del Santo said: 'It makes me very sad because he was a professional colleague and I have great affection for his father.

'I think the fans in Japan, the US and Mexico, of course, where he was very popular, must be in mourning, especially because of his youth. 

'He had much ahead of him.'
