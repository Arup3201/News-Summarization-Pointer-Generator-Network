As the tallest building in Europe, it demands a grand opening ceremony to match its imposing presence.

And if last night's dress rehearsal is an indication, the Shard will dazzle the skies above London when it officially opens its doors tomorrow night.

The run-through featured a light show using lasers and searchlight beams that crossed over its neighbouring City skyscrapers.

Run-through: A dress rehearsal last night for the Shard's opening ceremony featured a dazzling array of laser beams and searchlights in the skies above London

Thursday's event will feature 12 lasers and 30 searchlights will illuminate the building, which stands at 310 metres (1,016ft).

The Shard is fully clad in glass, so the sun's rays on a cloudless day give it the appearance of a shining beacon.

It has 95 floors and is tipped with a gleaming spire.

Facilities will include a hotel, restaurant, viewing platform, flats and offices.

Work on the landmark began in February 2009 and an estimated £450million has been spent on its construction.

The building offers uninterrupted 360-degree views of the capital, on a clear day stretching for 40 miles in every direction.

Visitors will be able to enjoy the view from an observatory that will be 72 floors up.

Billed as a ‘vertical city’, it will 
comprise offices up to floor 28, then three floors of restaurants; a 
five-star 19-storey hotel of 200 rooms; ten apartments over 12 floors – 
each seven times larger than a semi-detached house and likely to fetch 
tens of millions of pounds each; and, finally, the observatory and 
spire.

Designed by Italian Renzo Piano to resemble an iceberg emerging from the Thames, the Shard has not been without controversy.

English Heritage has expressed fears 
about the ‘major and detrimental’ impact on views of St Paul’s 
Cathedral, the Tower of London and the Palace of Westminster.

Unmissable: Sunlight reflects off the almost-completed Shard at the end of May as construction continued on the building
