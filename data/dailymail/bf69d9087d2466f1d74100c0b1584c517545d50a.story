A Virginia lawmaker who resigned his seat following a sex scandal involving a teenage employee won it back during a special election Tuesday.

Apparently plenty of voters in Joseph Morrissey's Richmond-area House of Delegates district were OK with his conviction in the scandal involving his 17-year-old secretary, whose nude photo was found on his cellphone and allegedly shared with a friend.

Morrissey has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying his phone was hacked. The young woman, who denies they had sex, is now pregnant.

But he successfully conducted a political campaign – for the seat he was forced to vacate upon his guilty plea to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor – from behind bars. 

With all the precincts reporting, Morrissey defeated Democrat Kevin Sullivan and Republican Matt Walton by a comfortable margin. He won 42 percent of the vote, compared to 33 percent for Sullivan and 24 percent for Walton.

HANDS UP, DON'T JUDGE: Morrissey has said he might try to commute to the statehouse from jail during his sentence related to an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl

'This is a victory for the ages,' University of Mary Washington political science professor Stephen Farnsworth told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

'Rarely has a politician with as many problems emerged victorious. For a man who has more baggage than Amtrak to win speaks volumes for his ability to connect with the district despite all of his liabilities.' 

Prosecutors in Morrissey's criminal case said that in addition to the sexual relationship he carried on with Myrna Pride, now an 18-year-old college freshman, he sent a naked photo of her to a friend.

Part of the evidence against him, which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in July, was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third-party, reading: 'OMG, I just f***ed my boss.'

He claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24-year-old woman named Brittany McKinney, who grew jealous after Pride rejected her lesbian advances.

But special prosecutor William Neely told the Richmond Times-Dispatch at the time that Morrissey 'had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.'

Morrissey's victory was not unprecedented: Through four previous elections, most voters overlooked or even embraced the lawmaker's flamboyant history of fistfights, contempt-of-court citations and disbarment. The 57-year-old bachelor, who fathered three children out of wedlock with three different women, repeatedly won at least 70 percent of the vote as a Democrat.

Morrissey said in a telephone interview that the results show people aren't interested in the drama that landed him in jail. 

'They're interested in my body of work in the General Assembly,' Morrissey told the Associated Press. 'Nobody works harder for their constituents than I do.'

He also said Sullivan's ads focusing on his latest scrape with the law backfired: 'People hate negative campaigns.'

The lawmaker has made a career of never backing down. He hung boxing gloves in his office and promised 'Joe will fight for you' in campaign ads on city buses. In 2013 he waved an AK-47 rifle inside the House chamber while arguing for gun control.

That brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an Uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned Morrissey, then a prosecutor, for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence.

The 57-year-old has seen his law license suspended and revoked, has paid a $500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999, lost a job teaching law in Australia for hiding his disbarment, and earned his nickname – 'Fightin' Joe' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991.

He resigned his seat — effective Tuesday, the day of this special election — as part of a plea deal. The misdemeanor conviction allowed him to avoid a felony trial that could have barred him from office and put him in prison for years.

He originally faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor, possession of pornographic images of an underage female, and solicitation to obtain the images.

But Morrissey wouldn't give up — he promptly quit his party to run as an independent for his seat, sleeping in jail and wearing an electronic monitoring device as he campaigned during the day.

Legislators from both parties denounced him as unfit to serve and began studying how to expel him if he won.

'Mr. Morrissey's election tonight does not change the fact that his actions fall grievously short of the standards of a public servant in the House of Delegates,' House Speaker William Howell, a Republican, said in a statement.

MUG SHOT: Morrissey has been in and out of jail for decades, in between suspensions and revocations of his law license

NOT SHOOTING STRAIGHT: Morrissey brandished an AK-47 during a floor debate about gun rights, but had earlier admitted losing track of an Uzi that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches

House Democratic Minority Leader David Toscano and party caucus chairman Scott Surovell said in a joint statement that Morrissey's 'conviction and actions over the past two months were reprehensible, and we will be exploring every avenue in regard to his status as a member of the House of Delegates.'

According to House Clerk G. Paul Nardo, it takes two-thirds of the 100-member House to expel a member – something that hasn't happened since 1876. The Virginia Constitution says a legislator can be kicked out for 'disorderly' behavior – which isn't defined.

Morrissey vowed to wage a voting rights battle on behalf of the people who re-elected him if his foes try to remove him.

His latest troubles began when Coleman Pride told authorities that the lawmaker was preying on his daughter when she worked at his law office in 2013 — allegations he repeated in campaign ads last week for Morrissey's Democratic opponent.

But Morrissey's staunchest defender is Myrna Pride, now 18, who went public this month with her side of the story.

She insists she never had sex with Morrissey but has refused to identify the father of her unborn child. And she publicly defended Morrissey on Monday in a radio interview.

Richmond radio host Jack Gravely was interviewing Coleman Pride on WLEE about his daughter's relationship with Morrissey when the lawmaker called in to defend himself. Ms. Pride then showed up at the broadcast studio in person, accusing her father and others of manufacturing the entire scandal to get back at Morrissey for his help in a dispute over her father's child support.

It was Morrissey's role in that family dispute that reportedly prompted police to serve a search warrant of his office Monday afternoon, with only hours to go before the voting started. Morrissey called that a political dirty trick.

'The only person that has shown any respect or kindness, or been there for me, is Mr. Morrissey,' Myrna Pride told a WTVR reporter on Monday. 'Right now it's a friendship. I don't speak with him often. I call here and there to check on him. I want to see how his spirits are going.'

Morrissey supported her in turn.

'She is a very smart young lady,' he told the radio host. 'She is kind, she is considerate. She will go on to do very well.'

OPPOSITION: On Sunday, Jan. 11, women protested against Morrissey as he left the Richmond Crusade for Voters, Inc. 74th District forum

Neely, the special prosecutor, has a long history with Morrissey. He unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of the politician's law license in 2011, claiming he 'completely lacks any moral compass' and engaged in 'notoriously unethical practices.'

That opinion came with a litany of evidence.

He landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl, landing in jail. In 1993 the Virginia State Bar Association yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge.

That case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $25,000 to get himself off the hook, and another $25,000 to a list of charities Morrissey chose.

Charges against Morrissey in that case were later dismissed.

Five years later, his license was suspended a second time after a 90-day stint in jail for contempt of court, for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters. A judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years.

In 1999 Morrissey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor.

According to a legal brief filed by the home contractor's attorneys, Morrissey shouted, 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to beat your head in,' before beating the victim and 'smash(ing) his head into the corner of a brick wall.'

In 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court, which he paid off with a $500,000 check in 2007, The Daily Caller reported.

But Morrissey wasn't as diligent with his community-service sentence: A court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off, and sent him to jail for another 90 days.

The bar association 'disbarred' him for that offense, tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012.

But meanwhile, Morrissey made headlines for losing his job teaching law in Australia when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the U.S.
