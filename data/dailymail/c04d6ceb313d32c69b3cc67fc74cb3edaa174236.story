Many a holiday snap has the same components - golden sand, blue waves breaking in the background and a sandcastle or two.

But these professional beachscapes taken from a helicopter show the familiar scene of the family photo in a completely different light.

Photographer Gray Malin took to the skies to achieve these dramatic aerial views of the world's beaches, which he shot over a period of eighteen months.

View from above: Some of the aerial shots look directly down on the sunbathers from a distance. This shot has pulled away from the people and their sun loungers, turning them into dots on a canvas

Deep blue sea: Hollywood-based Gray Malin traveled for 18 months while he worked on the project. He said his inspiration came from people playing in a swimming pool

Sun worshipers: Eye-catching patterns and shapes are created by colourful bikinis, towels and parasols against a backdrop of beige sand

Mr Malin took rides in 16 helicopters over six different continents to observe and photograph beach scenes.

He said he was first inspired by sunbathers at a swimming pool. He then expanded the project to take in beachscapes.

He said: 'I became mesmerised by the spectacle of hundreds of sunbathers and swimmers splashing around in this gigantic pool. I took a photo of the scene and it ended up being the creative spark that ignited the series.'

In an interview with enpundit, Mr Malin said: 'When I get up in the air and start looking down on those beautiful beaches and pools, I begin to start seeing the world as art.

'Each geographic location is made up by the beautiful, vibrant patterns of many things, such as beach towels, surfboards, and umbrellas, all of which create repetition of shape and form.

Summer fun: The depths of the ocean are visible in this picture that shows the sea's different shades of aquamarine

Where sand meets the sea: The dramatic contrast of pristine sand a murky sea makes for a memorable image

'As you begin to take a closer look at 
each candid image and study the interaction of people, you begin to find
entertainment in whatâ€™s going on.'

This project 'a la plage, a la piscine' (at the beach, at the pool) aims to capture the colours and shapes that appear on the beach and the patterns that are created by sunbathers.

Mr Malin's new perspective on beach scenes were taken by leaning out of a door-less helicopter and timing the picture perfectly.

The Hollywood-based photographer travelled to Bondi Beach, Australia, Brazil and Portugal to photograph some of the world's most beautiful beaches.

Different way of looking: This rare shot of a deserted beach completes the project's aim to capture the world's beaches in different seasons

Sea of parasols: Colour is added to this busy beach by vibrant red parasols. Only from this angle can the viewer appreciate the patterns they create on the sand
