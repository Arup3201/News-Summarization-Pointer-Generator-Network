They must spend their days locked up behind bars, living shoulder to shoulder with murderers, rapists and drug dealers, yet they have committed no crimes.

Meet the desperate mothers, children and babies who have been forced to move into a bleak Filipino prison alongside their incarcerated relatives after being left homeless by Typhoon Yolanda.

Over five million people saw their homes destroyed when the typhoon hit nine regions in the central Philippines on November 8, 2013, leaving behind a wide swath of destruction.

The  category five storm brought winds of up to 235 miles per hour causing massive landslides and flooding. In all some 14 million people were affected, with over 6,000 people losing their lives. 

Desperate times: One of the many Filipino families forced to live in prison with their incarcerated relatives after they were left homeless by Typhoon Yolanda 

New York-based photographer Lawrence Sumulong visited Leyte Provincial Jail in the Philippines earlier this year to document the unusual situation where large numbers of displaced families have been forced to move in with their incarcerated relatives.

At  Leyte he was surprised to find women and children walk freely among inmates. While most of the inmates claim to be serving time for petty crimes such as theft or drug trafficking, their photo releases reveal many more are actually serving time for more serious crimes. 

He said: 'My assignment was to verify whether families of the inmates were continuing to live inside the destroyed jail, which was a story that journalist, Aya Lowe had originally broken.

'Leading up to my trip, there was news that access to the jail was restricted and the families had long since relocated.'

'The backdrop of a prison as a site for family portraits also presented a surreal and existential take on what could be a fairly straight ahead reportage story.

'From my distant vantage point in New York City, the disaster as it unfolded had become an abstraction in my mind. I didn't care to see the work of non-Filipino journalists representing a tragedy in the Philippines. I wanted to view, process, and relay the experience in my own way.'

Much to his surprise all of the families had continued to live alongside the inmates and wardens. He decided to take the portraits in various corners of the prison.

'The portraits that I am presenting represent a small sampling of the many families that I photographed. I didn't have the insight into what the jail had originally looked like.

'But these newly reconstructed spaces seemed familiar and reminiscent of some of the homes that informal settlers or squatters would often build in various parts of the Philippines.'

He says that the presence of family members made it difficult to ascertain and comprehend the crimes that the inmates had been accused of.

'I was told that petty crimes such as robbery and drug trafficking were the main culprits. However, upon looking at the makeshift release forms that I had asked each family and inmate to sign, murder and rape were the most prevalent.'

A working society has sprung up inside the prison, with its own water sanitation, security, and even fruit stands.

'Most report that as dangerous as bringing their families to such a situation is, life on the outside is still worse as the country continues its slow recovery.'

Many inmates inside worry that they may never be able to leave with their families when the outside infrastructure recovers.

'Visually, I was inspired by Chien Chi Chang's uncanny book, The Chain. Although my images don't hold a candle to that series, it helped organise how I thought of shooting that situation.'

Though the prison is desolate, it is still equipped with electricity, water purification, security and a sick ward, which is much more than you would find outside of its gates. Unfortunately, those staying in the prison are still subject to disciplinary measures.

'In one family portrait, a boy holds a light bulb upside down. As a trope in and out of context, that to me says something about the overall situation.'

Mr Sumulong found the atmosphere in the prison was somewhat relaxed, which he found rather disquieting. He believes that there is a cliché in the media about the resilience of the Filipino people and spirit.

'I am not comforted by that statement or the appearance that life seemingly goes on.

'I am currently contending with what it means to leave that moment and place behind. Most concretely, the loss of records leaves the judicial process crippled and both the inmates and their families are lost in a type of purgatory or limbo as to what the future holds.'

'It is remote, obscure to the media, and impoverished to the extent that improvisation and adaptation emerge in surreal and absurd ways, for example re-purposing a prison as a gated community.

'At this point, it feels unnecessary for me to simply return as a photographer unless I can enact a change or help someone.'

The Yolanda typhoon devastated the country's court system, washing away a large amount of court records forever.

One man Mr Sumulong met said due to the loss of court records due to the Typhoon Haiyan, he feared that the judicial process has been completely crippled and the future of all of the inmates and the livelihoods of their families' lies lost in limbo.

Even before the disaster, this particular inmate had been residing at Leyte Provincial Jail for over 10 years awaiting a trial.

The photographer feels that his project Raising a Family Behind Bars, he has used the fate of the Leyte Provincial Jail to create a metaphor or a microcosm depicting the humanitarian crisis in the Philippines.
