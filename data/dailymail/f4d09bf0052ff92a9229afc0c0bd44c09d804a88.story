A shock new poll by YouGov has revealed that although the majority of Britons do want Prince Charles to become King, just 16 per cent want the Duchess of Cornwall to become Queen.

Although the Duchess has become increasingly popular in recent years, 46 per cent of those polled said she should take the title of Princess Consort when Charles ascends to the throne instead.

The Duchess, who is currently visiting Mexico with the Prince of Wales, has never spoken of future titles, although it is known that Prince Charles would like his wife to eventually become Queen.

Popular: Although most said Charles should be King, they thought William would be a better monarch

Top choice: 60 per cent of those asked also said that the Duchess of Cambridge would make a better Queen

The poll also looked at the line of succession and found that although a majority of Britons are in favour of Charles becoming King following the Queen's death, a significant minority wanted the throne to go directly to Prince William.

Interestingly, despite the majority preference for Charles taking the throne following the Queen's death, 58 per cent of those asked said they thought William would make the better monarch.

The Duchess of Cambridge fared similarly well, with 60 per cent of those polled saying she would make a better Queen than Camilla.

There was some good news for the Prince of Wales, however, with 64 per cent agreeing that tours, such as the current royal tour of Colombia and Mexico, are good for Britain's image abroad.

An overwhelming 71 per cent also said that tours, including Prince Harry's upcoming visit to Oman and the UAE, should remain a key part of the royal job description.
