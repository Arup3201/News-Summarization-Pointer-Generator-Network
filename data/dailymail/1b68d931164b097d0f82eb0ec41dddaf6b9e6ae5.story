Happy Couple: Tamera Mowry and Adam Housley were married in May of 2011 and have a son - Tamera revealed the horrific racial abuse she has suffered since her marriage to Housely

Sister Sister star Tamera Mowry has tearfully told Oprah Winfrey that she was labeled a 'white man's whore' among other horrific racial slurs for her marriage to Fox News correspondent Adam Housely.

Teen star Mowry, now 35, married Housely three years ago and since their happy day the couple have been remorselessly attacked by online trolls who reduce the identical twin to an emotional wreck with the strength of their barbs.

The TV star who appeared alongside her sister Tia in the hit 90s sitcom, was interviewed for Oprah: Where Are They Now and made the harrowing claim that since her marriage she has 'never experienced so much hate ever in my life, ever'.

Attacked primarily on Twitter, Mowry broke down in tears as she tried to reconcile her love for her husband with the bile of internet haters.

'See, this is where I get emotional, because it's hurtful,' Mowry said.

'Because when my husband and I are so openly -- and we're fine with showing -- is love. Love. But people choose to look past love and spew hate. That's what hurts me, because I've never experienced so much hate ever in my life, ever.'

Mowry described the most shocking example of abuse she received online as she wiped away her tears while talking to Oprah.

'I get called ‘white man's whore,' she said. 'The new one was ‘back in the day you cost $300, but now you're giving it to him for free.'

The popular television star who also appeared in a reality show with her sister grew up in a bi-racial family herself - compounding her shock at the abuse she received.

'I couldn't even fathom or think of these words, because I'm a product of it,' she said. 

'My mom is a beautiful black woman and my dad is an amazing white man, and I grew up seeing a family. I didn't grow up saying, ‘Oh, that's a white man.'

She added that an especially hurtful remark she saw online involved her twin sister, Tia who is married to actor Cory Hardrict.

'They say, 'Oh, Tia's a true black woman because she married a black man,' Tamera said. 'Oh – I'm less of a black person because I married white?'

However, Mowry told Oprah that she refuses to bow to the sniping from trolls online and beamed with pride as she spoke of her husband who she married in Napa Valley in May 2011 and 14-month-old son, Aden.

'I love my husband so much,' Mowry said. 'I love our family. I love our dynamic. I'm proud to be in the relationship I am because it's based on love. Pure love.'

Tamera Mowry and her sister Tia recently announced that they would no longer be continuing their reality show, Tia & Tamera, which launched on Style Network in 2011.

The show featured the Mowrys in their home life, including Tamera and husband Adam Housley.

'Wanted to say Thank You for all the love and support. But most of all welcoming me, my husband, and my son into your homes for 3 seasons,' Tia Mowry wrote in announcing the conclusion of the show.

The show first aired in 2011 on the Style Network, but was transferred over to E! on October 2013.

It followed the Sister, Sister stars as they tried to balance their acting careers while managing the major shift of marriage and motherhood in their lives.

Tia was married in 2008 to actor husband Cory Hardrict after meeting on-set of the movie Hollywood Horror and had their only child Cree Taylor Hardrict on June 28, 2011.

The older twin by two minutes, Tamera, followed both of her sisters milestones by marrying Fox News Correspondent Adam Housley in May of 2011 and giving birth to son Aden on November 12, 2012.

Adam Housely is a the Los Angeles correspondent for the Fox News channel and has extensively reported from around the Pacific region.

In the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in 2011, Housely came within 70 miles of the Fukushima nuclear reactor that was devastated by the natural disaster.
