BBC staff members have taken to wearing ear plugs after 'noisy' performances were carried out inside the newly-revamped headquarters in London.

The complaints over loud music came as the £1billion development of New Broadcasting House, in Portland Place, nears completion.

The building was designed to include atrium spaces, which were thought could enable BBC staff and audience members to meet and watch performances.

New: The World piazza performance space was designed so audiences and BBC staff members can interact

But the idea has not met with wholehearted approval from staff, who have complained about the noise emanating from inside the headquarters.

Oliver Jones, a producer on World of Music on the World Service, wrote to the BBC's magazine Ariel about the matter.

He said: 'I work on the seventh floor in New Broadcasting House and the level of noise made it extremely difficult to concentrate on work - you could hear it even with headphones on.

Some BBC staff resorted to wearing ear plugs to avoid being distracted by the noise outside

'It's [atrium] not suitable as a performance space, as the noise gets to so many parts of the building and affects so many people who are trying to work hard.

'Even if it was the loveliest music in the world, there are lots of other distractions in the open plan design and we don't need any more.'

According to The Telegraph, another BBC worker said he and his colleagues used ear plugs to drain out the noise.

However the BBC have acknowledged the issues raised regarding noise levels.

A spokesperson told Mail Online; 'This was a one-off event held in an indoor atrium space. 

'We have taken on board staff comments, and as a result, do not plan to hold an event of this kind again in this area of the building.

'This is all part of the natural learning process of settling into a new building.'

The outdoor World piazza, which on the other hand will be encouraged to be a performance space, is due to be fully opened from April 2013.

Created by Mark Pimlott, the space has been described as a new 'art pavement at the heart of the new central public space',

It consists of more than 750 stone flags inscribed with place names from around the world and there is a subtle scheme of small embedded lights with audio installations.

The BBC said: 'This unique public arena will provide a place to linger and see the BBC in action, a performance and exhibition space and a cafe.

'The World reflects the global dimension of the BBC's broadcasting.'
