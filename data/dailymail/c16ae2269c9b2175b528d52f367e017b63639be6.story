A mother-of-five went on a night out wearing just her bra, knickers and a coat attacked another woman who tried to help her by suggesting she put more clothes on. 

Lisa Warner, 36, went out in Worcester scantily dressed in just a bra, knickers and an overcoat in freezing temperatures on January 11 this year.

But when Lisa Mills approached her because she was concerned for her welfare in her state of undress, Warner lashed out and grabbed her hair and spat ferociously at the 44-year-old. 

Lisa Warner went out on a freezing January evening wearing just a bra and knickers but turned on a woman, spitting at her and pulling her hair, when she suggested the mother-of-five put more clothes on

Three people had to restrain an angry Warner so that paramedics could treat Miss Mills for facial injuries. 

In a police interview, Warner accepted she 'had a drink or two' and 'could not remember very much about what went on'.

At a hearing at Worcester Magistrates' Court Warner was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay compensation of £50, court costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £15.

Mark Soper, prosecuting, told the court: 'Miss Warner was wearing underwear with a coat over the top.

'Her son was trying to get her to go back to her home address. It was quite a cold night.

'Miss Mills and her friend approached the defendant to suggest she go home because of the temperature and her lack of clothing at which point Miss Warner turned on Miss Mills.

Warner had been at the Punch Bowl pub in Worcester when the row between the women took place 

Warner had gone out to the pub in Worcester scantily clad and later admitted she 'had had a few drinks' 

'She reached her arms up over the railing to try and slap Miss Mills over the head.

'She stood up on the lower wall, bent over the railing and quite simply she spat at Miss Mills. It landed on her shoulder.

'She grabbed her by the hair, pulling her forcefully and held onto her for two minutes.

'It took three people to remove Miss Warner from attacking Miss Mills.'

Warner has two previous convictions, a public order act offence in 2008 and sending an indecent or an offensive message from 2012.

The court heard Warner spat at Miss Mills and pulled her hair, clutching at the strands for two minutes

Mark Lister, defending, said Warner lived next door to Miss Mills' father. He said 'There are ongoing issues between the families.

'Miss Mills did not have any need to speak to Miss Warner at all.

'It is unfortunate she got involved.

'Miss Mills was the author of her own misfortune in this. She (Warner) bitterly regrets what happened and asks you to accept her apology.'
