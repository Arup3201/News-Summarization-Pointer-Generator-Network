Thieves have trashed the memorials of tragic conjoined twins Hope and Faith when they ransacked their family home.

It is estimated the attack on the twins' parents home in Tregear, Sydney, on Saturday, caused thousands of dollars worth of damage.

Parents Renee Young and Simon Howie are devastated by the incident.

'I can't describe it, I don't know what they get out of coming in and breaking everything,' Ms Young told the Daily Telegraph.

The mother also said the thieves carelessly broke a number of the girls' mini statues.

'They're little things but it's the little things that are getting me.... the worst,' she said.

Tiny sisters, Hope and Faith were known as Australia's 'miracle' conjoined twins born with identical faces and separate brains but sharing a skull and body. 

The girls were the result of an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus, which causes a baby to be born with two faces. 

They were born weighing just over two kilograms on May eight this year and lived for just 19 days before they died.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Hope and Faith were memorialised by a pink box in their parents' bedroom but that was damaged in the attack.
