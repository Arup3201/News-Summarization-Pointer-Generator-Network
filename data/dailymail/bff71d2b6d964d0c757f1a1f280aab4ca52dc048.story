A baby whose heart stopped fro 26 minutes has survived and is now home from hospital after just a month.

Midwives at Burnley General Hospital had almost given up on little Isla Simpson when she was born on September 21 and they realised her heart was not beating.

Her mother Becky Simpson, 20, had experienced a normal pregnancy and Isla was born after 39 weeks - but it was only during labour that problems began when she was not moving or crying.

She was immediately given CPR and her heart finally started again after 26 minutes. 

Ms Simpson, from Clayton-le-Moors in Lancashire, said: 'They pulled the emergency cord and suddenly about 20 or 30 people were in the ward.

'I was watching them give her CPR and it was terrifying. It went on for 20 minutes, at which point they usually stop, but they kept going and luckily her heartbeat came back.'

She continued: 'I saw her a few hours after the birth and it was heart-breaking because she was sedated and still really struggling to breathe.

'She looked blue and her organs were starting to die from the lack of oxygen.

'The doctors thought she wasn't going to survive and that whole week was the hardest of my life. Every day we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst.'

Following the birth, Isla spent a week on a ventilator in the neo-natal intensive care unit.

Doctors were still unsure whether she would make it, but she kept breathing once the ventilator was removed.

Ms Simpson added: 'I had decided that if she couldn't breathe without the machine I would let her go - it was causing her so much pain to have it down her throat.'

Isla has suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen to the brain, but the extent of it is not yet known. It is also likely she will have cerebral palsy.

Becky Simpson, pictured with almost five-week old baby Isla, says she feels like the 'luckiest mum in the world'

The single mother says she feels like the luckiest in the world and added: 'I think she can still have a very good life.

'We'll try and do as much as we can for her by taking her to all sorts of different classes and not just sit her in front of the telly.

'When she's awake she's very alert and reacts when I talk to her.

'She's here and that's the main thing.'

Doctors have not been able to explain why Isla's heart was not beating when she was born.

Angela O'Toole, midwife matron at Burnley General Hospital, said: 'All the staff used their expertise and professionalism in ensuring Isla had safe, personal and effective care.

'The staff supported Becky through a difficult time and we are overwhelmed that she has taken the opportunity to publicise this.

'Everyone in the unit will miss Becky and Isla, but it's obviously brilliant that they are able to go home as a family and we wish them all the best for the future.'
