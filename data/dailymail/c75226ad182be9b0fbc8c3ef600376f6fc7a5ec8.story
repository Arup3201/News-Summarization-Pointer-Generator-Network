Beers and ales have been brewed for centuries but it appears the taste hasn't changed all that much during this time.

Chemical analysis from two bottled drinks found on a shipwreck in Finland has revealed their similarities to modern-day lagers. 

This includes high levels of ‘green leaf’ flavours, sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent.

Chemical analysis from two bottled drinks - known as A56 (pictured) and C49 - found on a shipwreck in Finland has revealed their similarities to modern-day lagers. This includes high levels of ‘green leaf’ flavours, sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent. The bottles date back to the 1840s

The bottles were found in the summer of 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the Baltic Sea.

It was found at a depth of 165ft (50 metres) just off the coast of the Åland Islands, Finland.

Archaeological evidence suggests the shipwreck occurred during the 1840s, but the schooner’s name, its destination, and its last port-of-call have not yet been identified.

The cargo consisted of luxury items, including more than 150 bottles of champagne, and five bottles that look like typical early 19th century beer bottles were also brought to the surface.

One of these cracked in the divers’ boat and the liquid that foamed from the cracked bottle looked and, according to the divers, tasted like beer.

Initial taste tests said beers were ‘vinegary, goaty and tasted of sour milk’ and this said to have been caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years. 

But when experts  chemically analysed the samples they discerned specific flavours such as 'green leaf, sweet apple and rose.'

Initial taste tests said the beers were ‘vinegary, goaty and tasted of sour milk’ and this said to have been caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years.

But when experts from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and  the Technical University of Munich tested the beers they pinpointed specific flavours.

The experts took samples from two of these bottles – known as A56 and C49 – and analysed their physicochemical characteristics and flavour compounds.

They also analysed six reference beers including Leffe Brune, Koff Porter, Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier, Paulaner Hefe Weissbier, Aldaris Porteris Alus, and Olvi Sandels.

The results were normalised to make sure the ethanol concentrations in the ancient beers matched, or were within the range of, those found in the reference beers.

‘Bottles A56 and C49 were similar brown glass bottles,’ explained the researchers.

‘Bubbles of gas, presumably CO2, formed during sampling, producing a light foam.

‘Both beers were bright golden yellow, with little haze.

‘Both beers smelt of yeast, dimethyl sulfide, Bakelite, burnt rubber, over-ripe cheese, and goat.

‘As the samples warmed to room temperature, the smell of hydrogen sulfide disappeared and that of butyric acid - particularly strong in C49 - strengthened.’

This analysis found green leaf flavours were  high in C49. The level of Methylbutyl acetate, associated with banana flavour compounds, is markedly low in both shipwrecked beers. But 3- Ethyl hexanoate and Ethyl decanoate - which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both

The bottles were found in 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the Baltic Sea. It was found at a depth of 165ft (50 metres) just off the coast of the Åland Islands, Finland (marked). Archaeologists said the schooner’s name, its destination, and its last port-of-call have not yet been identified

Compared to modern beers, the shipwrecked beers contain similar levels of potassium but significantly more sodium, which is believed to have come from seawater on board the shipwreck.

Ethanol contents are between 2.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent, comparable to typical weak modern lagers and ales.

Both beers are acidic, with pH only one unit below modern levels, and the colour strengths are in the range of modern ales and lagers, but much lower than those of porters or stouts.

Since the beers were found, a brewery in Finland has recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible.

Called Stallhagen Historic Beer 1843, the beer is a ‘spontaneously fermented beer’ using malt and wheat.

The brewery said: ‘Today’s pure cultured yeast stocks didn’t exist at that time. Beer was produced using local wild yeast strains, each of which became specific to the brewers in the area.

The beer is golden yellow and has almost none of the typical bitterness or hops aroma.'

It added that 1843 has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer.

Stallhagen’s version is 4.5 per cent and pairs with white fish, roe, and mussels, as well as apple tarts. 

When looking at fermented sugars, the researchers found a small amount of maltose in A56. 

Levels of this sugar are much higher in C49, which contains more maltose than is typical in modern beers.

Both beers, especially C49, contain unexpectedly large amounts of glucose, but fructose and sucrose were not found in either shipwreck beer.

Yeasts produce compounds that contribute to the flavour of fermented drinks.

From this analysis the experts found green leaf flavours are relatively high in C49, as is 1-propanol which gives it a stronger alcohol taste.

The level of Methylbutyl acetate, associated with banana flavour compounds, is markedly low in both shipwreck beers.

But 3- Ethyl hexanoate and Ethyl decanoate – which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both, with A56 having more sweet compounds than C49.

A56 also has more rose flavour compounds than C49, in particular more 2-Phenylethanol and 2-Phenylethyl acetate.

The findings have been published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

A brewery in Finland recently recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible. Called Stallhagen Historic Beer 1843, (pictured) the drink has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and its makers claim the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer. But it was created before the recent analysis paper was published

The brewery said: ‘Today’s pure cultured yeast stocks didn’t exist at that time. Beer was produced using local wild yeast strains, each of which became specific to the brewers in the area.

'The beer is golden yellow and has almost none of the typical bitterness or hops aroma. The role of hops in breweries in the 1800s was not as important as it is in modern beer production.’

It added that 1843 has ‘champagne-like’ soft bubbles and the beer’s taste is closer to wine than to beer.

Stallhagen’s version is 4.5 per cent ABV and pairs with white fish, roe, and mussels, as well as apple tarts.

On board the schooner, divers also discovered unique bottles of champagne including one of world's oldest champagne from Veuve Clicquot, Juglar and Heidsieck.

A total of 145 bottles of champagne were salvaged. The bottle of shipwrecked Veuve Clicquot recently sold for $43,630 (£28,750) at auction.
