A Utah man known to be a white supremacist will go to jail for kidnapping, tying up and tattooing a woman against her will, authorities announced.

Robert Calder, 40, was sentenced Monday to one year behind bars after pleading guilty to felony kidnapping. An aggravated assault charge against him was dismissed, records showed.

The judge suspended a one to 15-year term and instead gave Calder credit for 162 days served and also ordered him to serve out a 36-month probation, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Where it happened: The suburban Salt Lake City apartment complex where Calder held, tattooed and beat the woman against her will

Calder, who goes by the name ‘Stinger,’ found himself in police custody after he and six members of the Silent Aryan Warriors gang met a woman he soon accused of being an undercover FBI agent, according to an affidavit cited by the paper.

He pointed a gun at her face before tying her ankles and wrists and gagging her with a sock, according to police. The sock was held in place with duct tape wrapped around the woman’s head.

Stinger is then believed by police to have told the woman he would ‘finish her tattoos’ before using an ink gun to write ‘RATTA 100%’ on her stomach.

Calder then repeatedly beat her until she passed out, police said.

Stinger was the only gang member she could identify out of the seven that were in her apartment that afternoon. He would not snitch on the others.
