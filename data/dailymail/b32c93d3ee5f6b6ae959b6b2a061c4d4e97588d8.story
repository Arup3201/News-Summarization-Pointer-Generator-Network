Russian President Vladmir Putin has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize.

In a bizarre revelation, former Labour peer Lord Truscott revealed he had nominated the Russian President for his recent actions in Syria.

However the Labour party moved quickly to disown the idea, insisting it was not party policy to give a gong to the President.

Lord Truscott took the Lords by surprise at question time by announcing that he had taken the unusual step over nominating Putin for the prize.

Instead the prize this week went to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal.

Lord Truscott, who sits as a non-affiliated peer after being suspended for misconduct in 2009, said: ‘Many people would argue that the Russian-led Syrian peace plan is the most significant peace initiative this year.

‘To recognise this and encourage Russia in its peace-making endeavours, a few hours ago, I nominated President Putin for the Nobel peace prize.’

The peer, who has written a biography of the president, asked if the Government would dissent from such a move.

But this was sidestepped by Cabinet office spokesman Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who told him: ‘This has been a joint US-Russian peace initiative. It's not purely a Russian-led peace initiative.

‘We welcome the constructive response Russia is now making on Syria and we hope and expect that the Russians will ensure President Assad and his regime are represented at the Geneva Two peace conference at the end of November.’

However Labour frontbencher Lord Triesman told peers: ‘I should make clear that it's no part of the official opposition's policy to nominate President Putin for the Nobel peace prize.’

The initiative to destroy Syria's chemical weapons was ‘plainly welcome’ but there was still much more to do to secure peace, he said.

Lord Truscott and another Labour peer were suspended for six months in 2009 after being found by a Lords committee to be willing to change laws in exchange for cash.

The two men denied the allegations made by the Sunday Times.

Lord Truscott, who resigned from the Labour Party, argued he has been made a scapegoat.
