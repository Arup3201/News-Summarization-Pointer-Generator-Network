Ian Jones, 45, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, allegedly grabbed a student's breasts and told her she had a peachy bum, a court has heard 

A college tutor allegedly grabbed a female student's breasts, told her she had a peachy bottom and offered to pay her £30 if she took off her underwear in public, a court has heard.

Ian Jones, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, also lifted up a student's top in front of classmates and grabbed another girl's thong before commenting on its colour, the court was told.

The 45-year-old also allegedly described another girl's breasts as 'a couple of airbags', and mimicked having sex with another alleged victim when she went to pick up her bag. 

Prosecutor Graeme Simpson told the court how Jones had allegedly abused his position of trust by 'bullying' the girls in an 'overtly sexual' way. 

He is accused of 18 charges of sexual assault against five female pupils which are alleged to have taken place between 2008 and 2012.

At the time of the alleged offences, Mr Jones was teaching a motor vehicle repair course at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in Nuneaton, Warwarkshire.  

Speaking about the first victim, Mr Simpson said: 'He walked up to her and put his hand into her coat pocket and moved his hand and touched the crotch of her jeans.

'She asked what he was doing, and he said he was looking for fags.

'Then when she bent over to pick up her bag, he put his hands on her breasts and tried to pull her backwards.'  

Warwick Crown Court heard how Jones was arrested in 2012 following an incident with a girl at the college.

When a police investigation was launched, three other pupils came forward.    

Speaking about one of the incidents, the girl told the jury how the man approached her from behind, pushed her so she was bending over and pushed himself against her as if simulating intercourse.

She said: 'I stood up and turned to face him. He put one of his hands in my coat pocket. He tried to push his hand down towards my crotch area.

'I managed to pull that hand out, and he tried to put his other hand in my other pocket and I grabbed it to stop him.

'I just wanted to get out of the room because he had unnerved me. I turned round and bent over to pick up my bag and I felt both of his hands with some force grab both of my breasts.

'It took me a while to get his hands off. I left. I was shaking and crying. It shook me up.'  

The jury was told how, on one occasion, she was talking to some other students when slapped her bottom and said she had a 'nice peachy bum'.

Speaking to the jury, she told: 'I said 'I know it is,' but I found it quite disgusting. No-one has the right to do that.

'The next day I told my tutor. He told me I needed to report it, but I didn't want to report it at the time. I thought I could handle it myself. I didn't want to make a big fuss.'

But the court heard how the girl confided in her boyfriend and her tutor referred her to the college's safeguarding team. 

She told the jury: 'At first he seemed the same as my teachers but then I noticed a change in the way he behaved towards me.

'He began looking me up and down and making comments, which made me feel not very nice, nervous.'

She told how, after just a few weeks, Jones walked over to her while she was with friends during her lunchbreak.   

She said: 'He pulled the front part of my top forward towards him and leaned forward so he could look down my top. I told him to get off. He said "they look good today". I felt violated.'

On another occasion, Jones saw her in the college car park and told her he could see her knickers through her skirt, the court was told.

She said: 'He said he would give me money if I took my pants off and gave them to him. He took out his wallet and took £20 and £10 out and offered to give it to me.' 

Jones is also accused of lifting up another girl's top 'exposing her bra and breasts in front of her classmates,' the girl told the court.

She added: 'I felt guilty because he'd done things to me I should have reported earlier. If I had, maybe he wouldn't have done that to her.' 

Jones denies the charges.

The trial continues.
