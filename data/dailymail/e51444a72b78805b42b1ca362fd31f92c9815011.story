It was a case of practice makes perfect for Tulisa Contostavlos as she wore her best courtroom outfit to date on Wednesday.

The former X Factor judge was in court to appeal against a conviction for punching the celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party.

But Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and threw out the appeal.

Practice makes perfect: Tulisa wore her best courtroom outfit to date of a cape and knee-length dress at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Wednesday

Although it was an afternoon of bad news for the star, she did finally managed to pull off a chic court outfit, after several attempts to turn the courtroom into a catwalk last year ended in failure.

Tulisa, 26, made of string of appearances in court in 2014, when she was cleared of arranging a drugs deal and also found guilty of assaulting a celebrity blogger.

But although the results of the two cases were remarkably different, there was one constant - Tulisa's mismatched sense of style. 

She finally transformed her look for her appearance at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday though in a thick black cape with ladylike striped dress beneath.

The knee-length hemline and loose fit were demure enough for court, and made a stark change to the tight, thigh-length ensembles of 2014.

The singer also injected some glamour with red patent platform heels and her long black hair worn loose. 

On her arm, she carried a large leather tote with ruched detailing and she also wore a simple pendant necklace.

In court, the pop star was found guilty of hitting Mr Morgan, who she suspected of putting her sex tape online, at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party.

Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing,  refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she 'lost control'.

During her days in court in 2014,Tulisa attempted something of a style overhaul, smartening up her look with an array of trouser suits, high-collared silk blouses and formal frocks - often very different from her usual look.

Previously the singer was often seen in revealing 
bandage dresses and shorts skirts but 
she meant business as she stood up in court in super-smart attire.

She ditched her usual style of cleavage-baring outfits and chunky gold jewellery in favour of a demure, no-nonsense image. 

But the singer unfailingly messed up the look every time, whether the the dress was too short, the coat and dress mismatched or the suit was simply too cheap-looking.

Tulisa has clearly learnt from her fashion mistakes though.

Last year, when Tulisa faced drug charges in relation to a story that appeared in The Sun at Southwark Crown Court, she took the case very seriously, attending every single hearing regardless of whether she was required to or not.

During this time, she experimented with hair colour, heel height and hem length. 

But each time, it terms of style, the outfits never quite worked.

Often, she matched a light pastel with a harsh black, creating a half-finished look.

One of her strangest looks was on June 27, when Tulisa marched into court in a pistachio green trouser suit, teamed with nude stilettos and a button-down blouse featuring a chain-link print design.

A few days later, the star relaxed her image and she wore her hair in a long side ponytail and dressed in a floaty short dress.

The £150 Ted Baker Eponi style featured a watercolour tree print, contrast trim and belt, three quarter sleeves and button fastening.

But the pale blue blazer that she added at the last minute was too bright next to the black on both the dress and handbag.

Her appearances in court in late 2013 and early 2014 were much better as the star stuck to a simpler wardrobe.

Her all-black outfits, accompanied with a blonde hairstyle left little chance for faults.

It was only when Tulisa branched out during the summer months that her outfits started to falter.
