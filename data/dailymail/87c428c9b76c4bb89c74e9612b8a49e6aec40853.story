Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, begins tomorrow, and across Asia preparations are being made, showering the region in bright colours and gold.

The five-day celebration symbolises the victory of good over evil, new beginnings and light from darkness - and commemorates Lord Ramis' return to his kingdom Ayodhya after completing a 14-year exile.

The word Diwali translates as 'row of lamps' and devotees illuminate and decorate their homes using lanterns, garlands, oil lamps, candles and colourful light bulbs.

Many draw colourful rangoli – traditional decorative patterns made with rice flour – outside their homes.

Dhanteras, the first day of the five-day Diwali Festival, celebrated in parts of India, holds special significance for the business community due to the customary purchases of precious metals on this day.

Meanwhile, Nepalese Hindus celebrate their own version of Diwali - known as Tihar festival, during which they worship cows, which are considered a maternal figure, and other animals.

Outside India, the largest Diwali celebrations take place in Leicester, during which around 35,000 people commune along Belgrave Road for the switching-on of the lights.
