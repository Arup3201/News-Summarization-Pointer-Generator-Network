Uncertain future: Although Maria's birth mother Sasha Ruseva, 35, insists that she wants her daughter back she more likely to be placed with a foster family

The mother of ‘blonde angel’ Maria – the little girl who sparked an international investigation after she was found living with a Roma gipsy couple in Greece – stands little chance of ever being reunited with her daughter.

Instead, the youngster’s future will almost certainly be with a foster family in either Greece or Bulgaria.

The child has been at the centre of a global interpol investigation since she was found during a police raid on the Tabakou gipsy settlement near Farsala, central Greece, earlier this month.

Officers became suspicious because she bore no resemblance to the woman falsely claiming to be her mother – Hristos Salis, 39 – or her partner, Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40.

The pair have now been charged with child abduction.

Meanwhile, Maria’s birth mother, Sasha Ruseva, 35, remains in Bulgaria, where police are investigating claims that she sold her daughter.

‘Given the circumstances of the two 
women, it is extremely unlikely either will see Maria in the foreseeable
 future, if at all,’ said a source.

The Athens charity Smile of the Child has been appointed as Maria’s temporary guardian.

A spokesman for the organisation, Panagiogis Bardalis, said Maria, thought to be aged about four, was coping well.

‘She seems a normal, happy child,’ he said. ‘She is playing, she is doing well under the circumstances.’

Prosecutors
 claim Salis has registered ten children in Greece since 1993, sometimes
 using a fake identity. Salis insists that she did not buy Maria 
although police suspect she paid  about £850.

Her large family allowed her and Dimopoulou to claim £2,370 in child benefit each month. Meanwhile, Ruseva is waiting to hear whether she too will face charges. 

Waiting: Sasha Ruseva with one of her ten children, who she claims is albino, she and her husband live with their sizeable family in a Roma camp near Stara Zagora in Bulgaria

She claims she handed over her daughter while working as a farm labourer near Farsala in 2009 but denies receiving any payment.

Ruseva and her husband live with their nine other children in a hut in the Nikolaevo Roma camp, near Stara Zagora,  Bulgaria.

She has insisted she wants Maria back. But Diana Kaneva, head of social services in Stara Zagora, appeared to rule out any reunion. ‘At a later stage we will take measures to protect the child and perhaps she will be placed in a foster family,’ she said.
