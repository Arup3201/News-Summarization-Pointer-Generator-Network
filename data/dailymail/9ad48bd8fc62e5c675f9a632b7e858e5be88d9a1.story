Disneyland is the place of dreams but for this little boy that dream became somewhat of a momentary nightmare.

Filmed on his first ever ride of the Radiator Springs Racer at Cars Land in California, young Jaden appears absolutely terrified.

Clutching the arms of who appear to be his parents either side of him, the youngster squints and frowns as the ride gets going and excited cheers sound around him.

Not impressed: The young boy frowns as the 40mph Radiator Springs Racer ride at Cars Land begins

Hold on tight: Jaden clutches the arms of those around him and braces himself as the ride gets going

Swaying in his seat he tries to take in everything that is going on around him and is quick to reply to the request to lift his arms with a resounding ‘no’.

Bracing himself as the ride appears to pick up a bit of speed, he grimaces and puffs his cheeks while holding on even tighter.

As the ride comes to an end and begins to slow down the youngster exhales air in relief and loosens his grip on those either side of him.

Grimacing throughout, the young boy takes a big sigh of relief and puffs his cheeks as the ride begins to slow

Opening to the public in 2012, the Radiator Springs Racer is a simulated slot car type ride that travels both indoors and outside and reaches speeds of up to 40mph.

But despite the speed and the terror experienced on the ride, Jayden’s parents claim that he wanted to go straight back on the ride for another go when it was all over.
