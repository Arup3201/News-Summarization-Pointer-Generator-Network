Victim: Kim Pham, 23, was brutally beaten outside a bar in the early hours of January 19 and was deemed brain dead later that day

A 23-year-old woman who was beaten to death after allegedly photobombing another patron has been laid to rest as police still search for a third person of interest.

Annie Hung 'Kim' Pham was left brain dead after being attacked on January 19 outside of an Orange County nightclub.

Hundreds of mourners attended her funeral held in Westminster, California on the outskirts of Los Angeles on Tuesday- just three days before what would have been her first wedding anniversary.

Her husband led the pallbearers who helped carry her casket to her cremation.

‘I always try to have a tough-guy mentality, be the protector of our family, but she was the one who taught me how to let down my guard and to share something beautiful,’ her stepbrother  Jason Nguyen said at the service.

Her family 
kept her on life support until they could donate her organs- only 
learning that she was an organ donor once they arrived at the hospital- 
which her family thinks is telling of the person she was.

Organ registry One Legacy site announced that Pham's donations helped save five lives.

Her
 heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and liver were used for critical 
patients and her donated skin tissue was used for burn dressings, bones 
that could help fractures and prevent amputations, and her bone marrow 
is available for orthopedic use.

'We are so blessed to have had Kim 
in our family because she was truly a one-of-a-kind soul,' her family 
said in a statement released to the organization.

Heartbreaking: A funeral was held for Pham on Tuesday at Blessed Sacrament Church in Westminster, California- just three days before what would have been her first wedding anniversary. Her husband was a pallbearer

Hundreds of mourners ca\me to pay their respects

Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime

'She always put 
others' needs before herself and never thought badly of anyone. She kept
 love in the center of her life and preached kindness and respect for 
others.

'We will always remember her as a sweet, vibrant, and wise 
daughter, sister, and friend. She is our little angel and God's gift to 
all of us.'

So far two women are in police custody
 and investigators have released the photo of a third woman that they 
think may have information pertaining to the attack.

Vanesa
 Tapia Zavala, 25, was arrested on Monday and is accused of taking part 
in the early morning beating. She entered a not guilty plea but remains 
in police custody on $1million bail. She faces 15 years to life in 
prison if convicted.

Candace
 Marie Brito, 27, has been identified as the second suspect and has been
 arrested for her alleged involvement in the attack. She entered a plea 
of not guilty.

Brito’s attorney said that the coverage 
the case has gotten in the area, which has a sizeable Vietnamese 
population, is hindering his client’s chances of receiving a fair trial.

‘Ms. Pham has been anointed a saint and the people on the other side- specifically, my client and Mr. Reed’s client (Zavala)- have been vilified internationally,’ attorney Michael Molfetta told KTLA.

Information: Police have released this photo of an unknown person of interest in the case as they believe she may know something about the case

‘This young lady died tragically; she died unnecessarily.  

‘What
 occurred out there — whatever occurred out there — was stupid, was 
mindless, was senseless and should never have resulted in the death of 
anybody, much less a young person.’

A
 third woman’s photo has been released in hopes that someone will 
recognize her and help the police get in touch with her as they believe 
she has some information about the incident.

The Los Angeles Times
 reports that one of Ms Pham’s friends who was not at the nightclub at 
the time of the attack heard that Ms Pham accidentally walked into the 
background of a photo and the subjects who had intended to be the focus 
of the shot attacked her in retribution.

Pham was beaten about 12.20am Saturday January 19 outside the Crosby Bar and Nightclub.

She was declared brain-dead Sunday, but was kept on life support for two more days so her organs could be harvested.

Pham and a group of friends were headed into the club as another group was coming out, and police say that something prompted the fight during that impasse.  

'Three people at various times, depending on what video you look at, were involved physically with Ms Pham,' Santa Ana police chief Carols Rojas said to The Los Angeles Times.

'While there was a physical altercation, we don't know what precipitated it.'

Zavala was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones.

Tragic: Ms Pham's husband led the pallbearers into the church and later into the crematorium

Thought-provoking: Ms Pham had previously blogged about ways to enjoy your 20s by avoiding self-doubt

Zavala's attorney, Kenneth Reed, told 
reporters after his client's arraignment that she was knocked down 
during the scramble, and he doubted reports that it was a beat-down.

'I
 refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman 
stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything,' Reed 
said. The lawyer characterized it as 'a melee, a bunch of people 
fighting.'

Reed says he’s 
been contacted by one of the potential suspects – and friends of Pham 
who say they’ve spoken with people involved in the incident – said the 
violence outside the club was chaotic and involved at least a half-dozen
 other people.

Zavala lost 
her phone in the brawl, and it was recovered later by police, according 
to Reed, who said she is 'devastated' by the violence.

'Your day is fine, your life is fine, 
you have a 5-year-old son, you go out one night on a Friday with your 
boyfriend and then your life is turned upside down and you find out 
someone is killed,' Reed said of his client.

'No matter what the situation is, you're going to be devastated.'

Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in

Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground

The
 fight that ended with Pham unconscious has drawn national attention as a
 short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub 
attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd 
of about 50 people.

In the 
video, one person is visible crouching to take another cellphone video. A
 bouncer from the club appears to try to intervene, well after the 
violence began.

Her family 
was shocked that Ms Pham would have been involved in a brawl, making it 
even more likely that it was an unintentional slight that prompted the 
altercation.

‘She would
 go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back from 
them’, her stepsister Lisa told The Los Angeles Times.

‘That’s the kind of person she is.’

Ms
 Pham wrote an uplifting post on her personal blog that was later published on Elite Daily before her death, 
titled ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid Having In 
Your Twenties’. In the post, she called on people her age to stop being 
fearful.

On the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote: ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when we choose to do another.

Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident

‘We may even choose to justify it by announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’

She tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of ‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your time’.

On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours stalking people online is pointless.

‘We are taught that with photos, we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on social media is quite unnecessary.’

She explained that in ‘Fear of the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to ourselves is to not take the chance’.

Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’

‘Perhaps in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not paralyze us from feeling, living and loving.

‘If you are forthright in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’
