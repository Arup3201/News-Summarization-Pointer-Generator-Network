Peter Howes, 53, siphoned off his parents' cash and wound up a number of trusts by forging his brother and mother's signatures

A man has been jailed for four years after cheating his brother out of a £1.5million inheritance because he was fed up with him being the ‘favourite’ son.

Peter Howes, 53, resented his brother Jonathan moving to Hong Kong and Singapore – leaving him to care for their elderly mother – and siphoned off cash from their parents’ estate.

Howes wound up a number of trusts and settlements by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce and 55-year-old brother.

He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 together.

The family estate should have been split equally between the brothers, but Howes transferred cash into a joint account with his mother, before moving it into a sole account in his name.

The cash was then handed to his former partners and used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company.

But the ploy unfolded when Mrs Howes died aged 81 and Jonathan discovered his brother’s deception during a conversation with lawyers.

Following a three-week trial Howes was found guilty of five counts of fraud.

Handing him four years and four months behind bars, Recorder James Watson QC described him as ‘ruthless’.

‘This is a case which involves an unusual blend of both tragedy and seriousness, and in light of … the seriousness of your dishonesty and scale of the sums involved, it seems to me that I have no choice but to adopt a lengthy period of custody.

‘On one level this case could be viewed simply as a breach of trust towards your mother, carried out in a systematic and methodical manner. Throughout this period your mother and brother trusted you to look after her.

‘You did this in one respect but in terms of her finances you failed her dishonestly. You failed her in … your judgment and you have been convicted of dishonesty and abuse, and that word abuse can be used in its full sense of your role.’

Bristol Crown Court heard that Howes’s father Thomas set up a number of trusts in 2002. The brothers were told proceeds of the estate ‘should be divided equally between them’ if both parents died.

Howes, of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, was given prime responsibility for the trusts’ administration following his father’s death in August 2004.

He wound up one settlement and gave half the proceeds – £109,000 – to his brother, convincing him the rest was still in the trusts.

But Howes began to look into other accounts, faking his mother’s signature to access the money and to close a settlement.

It was only when Mrs Howes died in November 2010 and emails were sent between a solicitor and Jonathan regarding family trusts, that he discovered what his brother had done.

In a victim impact statement, he said he did not bring the case to have his brother punished, but to bring to light what had happened.

He added that his parents had intended the money to go towards their grandchildren.

Ed Burgess, prosecuting, told the trial: ‘There is some talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son … But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that [Howes] practised deceit, in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to … in excess of £1.5million.’
