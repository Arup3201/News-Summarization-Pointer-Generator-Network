A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an Arizona sheriff that sought to halt President Barack Obama's plan to spare nearly 5 million people from deportation.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, herself nominated to the federal bench by Obama in 2010, said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had legal standing to challenge the immigration program the president announced last month.

She suggested the topic is better left for Congress and the Obama administration to sort out.

The case 'raises important questions regarding the impact of illegal immigration on this nation, but the questions amount to generalized grievances which are not proper for the judiciary to address,' Howell wrote.

The White House held up the decision on Wednesday as confirmation that the president's executive actions are on the up and up.

'Judge Howell's decision today confirms what the Department of Justice and scholars throughout the country have been saying all along: the president's executive actions on immigration are lawful,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

'The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that federal officials can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws, and the actions announced by the president are consistent with those taken by administrations of both parties for the last half century.'

In the first courtroom battle over Obama's plan, Arpaio's lawyer, Larry Klayman, told reporters on Monday that the president violated the U.S. Constitution by doing an end-run around Congress.wever, there are 'serious issues of constitutionality involved' in the president's actions.

'It's not policy, he's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution,' Klayman said in remarks outside the courtroom.

He argued that the program would let more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes, burdening law enforcement – Arpaio's area of concern.

'It's not policy, he's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution,' Klayman said of Obama.

Arpaio has often clashed with the federal government over the enforcement of immigration laws and he has filed suit to stop new policies announced by Obama.

He claims that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in his jails this year were repeat offenders, buttressing his view that federal officials have done a poor job of deporting criminals.

But Justice Department lawyer Kathleen Hartnett said Arpaio's lawsuit seemed to be raising a 'political dispute' rather than a legal claim the court could address. 

The Obama administration had called the case 'speculative and unsubstantiated' and had urged the court to dismiss it.

Howell at times seemed exasperated with Klayman, a longtime conservative activist who has filed hundreds of lawsuits against the federal government, including challenges to Obama's U.S. citizenship, during his presentation.

When Klayman said his client has been threatened because of his tough views on Obama's immigration policy, Howell responded: 'That just doesn't cut it for me.'

Howell also said it did not appear that Arpaio could show a 'concrete' injury he has suffered from the new policy, especially since it will take months before the bulk of it actually goes into effect.

'If Congress doesn't like it, doesn't Congress have the power to step in?' she asked. 

Judge Beryl A. Howell, nominated by Barack Obama, heard the case focused on claims that the president has violated the Constitution by doing an end run around Congress and that drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped

Obama's plan, derided by conservatives as an 'amnesty' for millions of lawbreakers, marks the most sweeping change to the nation's immigration policies in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight on Capitol Hill.

The changes include work permits and three-year deportation stays for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally.

It mostly applies to those who have been in the country more than five years and have children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.

Under the program, the Department of Homeland Security would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security, public safety or border security.

DHS officials could deport someone if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest.

The White House has insisted that Obama is acting under proper legal authority to enforce the nation's immigration laws. 

Larry Klayman of the conservative nonprofit Freedom Watch is representing the Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff's office in the lawsuit, and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Obama from granting legal status to approximately 4.7 illegal aliens in the United States

Arpaio has suffered a series of stinging political defeats in his quest to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his Arizona county.

Just last week he agreed to give up a major part of his efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were dismantled by the Obama administration and the courts.

Arpaio's office said Dec. 17 that it would disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen IDs to get jobs.

After complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that charged he was engaging in racial profiling – most illegal immigrants in Arizona are Hispanic – his office was found to have done so at least in some traffic stops.

As a result the federal government had stripped him of special federal immigration powers and investigated him for alleged civil rights violations.

Arpaio, however, remains popular in Arizona, where voters have elected him six times. 

He is best known for operating a series of outdoor 'tent city' jails where male inmates are limited to wearing pink underwear and those over age 18 are required to register for the Selective Service military draft.

In 2007 he launched an in-house jail radio station that broadcasts patriotic songs, Frank Sinatra tunes, educational shows and classical music 20 hours each week.
