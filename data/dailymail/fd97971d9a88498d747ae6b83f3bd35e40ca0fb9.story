Unless you’re fortunate enough to be flying business class, airline meals are usually something to be endured rather than enjoyed.

The food is often either soggy or dry, the choice is likely to be limited to a couple of dishes, and by the time the stewardess gets round to serving you, your preference may not even be available.

Another grumble is that the meals are served up at times that may suit the crew but not you – so you may discover that lunch arrives at 11am and dinner at 5pm.

Tired of airline food? Airport restaurants now offering takeaway options for the plane - called 'on-board picnics'

You can take your own food, of course, and a sandwich and drink bought at the airport can save you a packet, especially on low-cost flights, which often charge punitive amounts for their in-flight catering.

Heathrow has more interesting culinary options to take on to flights. Last month, it began offering ‘on-board picnics’ from the many restaurants across its five terminals. It claims it is the only airport in the world to provide this.

Several of them will place items in their own cool bags at no extra charge to take aboard – and last week I sampled some of their offerings.

Caviar House & Prunier Seafood Bar will prepare anything from its menu (apart from oysters) to take away in its slick, black cool bag. My very palatable smoked salmon and shrimps (£27) came on a plastic tray with slices of brown bread and a wedge of lemon, with three mini ice blocks to keep it all chilled.

YO! Sushi at Heathrow offers 'plane Japanese food' meals, including platters of sashimi and nigiri sushi

From YO! Sushi, you can pick up its ‘plane Japanese food’ meals costing £15 or £17, in a fun container emblazoned ‘I am a cool bag’.

With a decent-size platter of sashimi and nigiri sushi, a pot of fruit salad and a carton of coconut water, mine was reasonable value. Cheaper, single-item dishes are also available.

My third offering was from Gordon Ramsay Plane Food. About 80 passengers a day are buying the restaurant’s three-course picnic meals costing £12.95. Mine included thin slithers of roast beef with a green salad, and a generously sized chocolate and pecan brownie. It was all rather good – especially as you end up with a Ramsay-branded cool bag. The picnic menu – see gordonramsay.com/planefood – offers a choice of dishes for each course and, like the others, can be pre-ordered. 

Heston Blumenthal's Perfectionists' Cafe will put its pizza in standard takeaway boxes upon request

The other restaurants I visited could all package food to take on to the plane, but most didn’t flag up the service and did not offer cool bags either.

Nonetheless, some are definitely worth considering. For example, Heston Blumenthal’s Perfectionists’ Cafe will, on request, put its pizzas (from £9) in standard takeaway boxes. Though the pizza will be cold by the time you’re at 35,000 ft, in all likelihood it will taste a lot better than in-flight meals.

Other points to note. Caviar House and YO! Sushi meals came with instructions to eat within two hours, so don’t wait to tuck in until you’re halfway to Hong Kong. In this respect, it strikes me that raw seafood is arguably the worst option for in-air picnic food.

Cool bag: One of Gordon Ramsay’s Plane Food picnics, which can easily fit under your seat when you're done

The restaurants’ cool bags will easily fit in an overhead locker or under your seat, and are collapsible once empty. But when full, they are large – Caviar House’s measures 11in x 0.7in x 4in and is therefore too big to fit into most carry-on cases.

Many airlines flying from Heathrow generally allow a compact second bag, but check if in doubt.

If you don’t want a fancy meal, Heathrow has other options. The cheapest? A £3.79 meal deal from Boots for a sandwich, a bag of crisps and a drink.
