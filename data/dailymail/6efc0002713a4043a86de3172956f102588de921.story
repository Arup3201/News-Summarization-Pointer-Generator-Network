When the sun is shining, it’s tempting to take an impromptu day trip or mini-break to the seaside.

But pet owners who want a day or two off from their beloved cat or dog need to ensure their pet will still get regular meals.

Now one entrepreneur has come up with an automatic pet food dispenser to solve this problem and provide food while owners are away.

One entrepreneur has come up with an automatic pet food dispenser to provide food while owners are away. Here, a black labrador waits for his meal to be dispensed by the Wi-Fi connected PetPal feeder

The stainless steel cylinder measures 32inches (81cm) tall and 11inches (28cm) in diameter.

It connects to a Wi-Fi network so owners can feed their pets remotely.

Owners communicate with the feeder using an Android or iOS app.

The feeder dispenses a measured meal five times in 24 hours and can be used manually by pushing the lid if owners are at home.

Users can take a photo and video of their pet using the app. The feeder also has a motion sensor and can take a 30 second video when movement is detected.

When food is low, an email is sent to owners to remind them to top the feeder up.

The feeder claims to be waterproof and raccoon and squirrel-proof.

The stainless steel cylinder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day, or a user can remotely control it using an app on their smartphone or tablet.

Unlike other automatic feeders, the PetPal can take photos and videos of dogs and cats and allows absent owners to talk to their pet via a built-in microphone and speaker.

The device was invented by Ken Powers in California, who came up with the idea after he struggled to find someone to feed his two cats when he went on holiday.

Powers, who works as an electrical engineer, said: ‘I wanted to be able to interact with the cats while I was on vacation.’

‘I have been in the electronics business 
for 30 years, so once I committed to making a feeder, I wanted to make 
the best feeder on the market.

‘The cats needed to be fed outside, and the feeder had to prevent the raccoons from taking all the food.

‘The PetPal feeder easily connects to your Wi-Fi network, and you connect to your PetPal via an Android or iOS app.'

He explained users of the high tech dispenser can feed animals up to five times a day, or log in using the app to decide when to feed their pets themselves.

‘You can talk, listen, feed, watch and take photos and videos. There is even motion detection which takes 30 second videos of your pet,' Powers continued.

The feeder measures 32 inches (81cm) tall and has a diameter of 11 inches (28cm).

Powers failed to secure the funding he needed for the device on a recent Kickstarter campaign, but is intent on raising cash to put the invention into manufacture in other ways.

There is currently no indication as to when the feeder will be available to buy, however.

It is estimated to cost £217 ($365) and Powers aims to reduce the price to £178 ($299) once PetPal is mass produced.
