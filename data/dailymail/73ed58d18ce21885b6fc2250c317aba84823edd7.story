Deafening footage has emerged of the deadly  tornado which ripped through Mississippi last week leaving at least four people dead.

William Bozeman was working at Bumper to Bumper, an auto repair business in the city of Columbia, when winds up to 165mph hit on December 23.

He quickly whipped his cell phone to capture the storm and luckily survived the experience. 

The heart-pounding 54-second clip starts with the sky plunged into a foggy darkness.

High-speed gusts can be heard sweeping through the area.

Far from being terrified, Bozeman screams in exhilaration.

As the sky brightens, it becomes clear the he is cowering behind some machinery in a bid to weather the storm.

Pieces of debris fly past the lens and rain appears to pelt down. The video then cuts short.

Lucky escape: Corey Mead, a meteorologist for the national Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the intensity of storms diminished after they passed through Mississippi

Bozeman was in one of the heaviest hit areas, as his workshop was right in the tornado's path along the 98 highway bypass.

He told WDAM-TV he lost his cell phone during the chaos. However, once the weather had died down he was able to retrieve it from the rubble.

Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant  issued a state of emergency when the natural disaster struck, hastening the availability of  resources needed for storm relief.

His office said the vortexes knocked out power to more than 7,000 customers.

The twisters were spawned by thunderstorms that originated over south-central Louisiana, then tracked northeast before barreling through southeastern Mississippi.

Corey Mead, a meteorologist for the national Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the intensity of storms diminished after they passed through Mississippi. 

Relief efforts are expected to continue well into the New Year.
