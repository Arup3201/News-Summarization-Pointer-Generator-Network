They fought, and suffered terrible injuries, on battlefields across the world.

Now 300 wounded or emotionally-traumatised soldiers will have a little piece of Britain to call their own.

A pioneering £27million veterans' village is set to be built on a 55-acre site in the scenic countryside.

Pioneering: A new retreat is being built for injured veterans and will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility (2), 200 bungalows (7), a leisure centre (3) and a donkey sanctuary (11)

The village will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility, 200 bungalows, leisure centre with swimming pool, social club, lakes, woodland walks and a donkey sanctuary.

In a first of its kind in the UK, its population will almost entirely be made up of former troops who have suffered horrific physical or psychological injuries on the battlefield.

A large number of servicemen and women will have been badly-wounded in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The project, dreamed up by the Veteran's Retreat charity, would be built on a former tileworks close to the hamlet of Newlands, Northumberland, and the village of Ebchester, County Durham.

The trustees will seek planning permission in December and hope to open the first homes and care facility late next year.

Despite concerns from local residents that the new development will blight the countryside, the charity points out that it is on a brown-field site that housed a factory.

The veterans' village will also create up to 500 jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment and pump money into the local economy.

The plans were launched by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, the youngest soldier ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest military decoration for valour.

Launch: Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC helped to unveil the new retreat earlier this week and said it would offer something no doctor could

Lance Cpl Beharry, now 32, of the 1st
Battalion, Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, was honoured for saving 
members of his unit from ambushes on May 1 and June 11, 2004, in Al- 
Amarah, Iraq.

He suffered 
serious head injuries after a rocket propelled grenade hit a vehicle six
inches from his, causing shrapnel injuries to his face and brain.

Yet he managed to drag several comrades to safety.

He said: 'For guys to be able to sit down and talk about the old days and what they have been through is something that doctors cannot offer. So we, as ex-servicemen and women, are going to cure ourselves.

'We are regimented and we are one family and we will look after each other. On civvy street you do not have that - this is a good way of continuing friendships.'

Gary Russell, who suffered a serious leg injury in a landmine explosion in Bosnia, in 1995, said the village would be welcomed by military veterans. 

Ambitious scheme: Bill Liddle, who is leading the scheme, hopes it will be completed in five years

The father-of-three, from Consett, County Durham, who served with the Royal Fusiliers, said: 'People who are coming out of the service can find it difficult and may need counselling and medical treatment, such as physiotherapy, if they have been injured.

'When you are with someone who has been through what you have been through, you can talk about your experiences and that makes them easier to deal with. 

'To have that sort of environment sitting there waiting for you when you come out, with a bungalow if you are in a wheelchair and with medical facilities on tap, is just a brilliant idea.'

Veteran's Retreat hopes to raise initial funds of more than £100,000 to get the project up and running.

The ambitious scheme is being led by former military policeman Bill Liddle, 64, who hopes the facility will be completed within five years.

He said: 'We want to change the lives of hundreds of ex-service personnel who suffer physical or emotional trauma by providing a unique residential and medical facility, dedicated to the long-term care and support of former troops.

'It was fantastic to witness such over-whelming support, not only from the local community, but also from veterans themselves. This is the least we can do for guys who have given so much.'

The Duke and Duchess of Northumberland are the charity's official patrons.
