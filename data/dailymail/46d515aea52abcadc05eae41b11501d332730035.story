A yellow Labrador that got spooked on a Christmas Day hike in the C snapping her leash and plunging 150 feet down a cliff, was rescued in the dark by a climber who rappelled to a narrow ledge where the dog was trapped.

David Schelske of West Linn told the Oregon Humane Society that when thee-year-old Sandy bounded around a bend and disappeared he figured her for a goner.

He hiked to the bottom of the cliff and saw her stranded on a narrow ledge 70 feet above.

At around 7 pm, an eight-person crew helped Humane Society volunteer John Thoeni descend.

He fitted a rescue harness on the frightened dog, and the two were hoisted to safety. Sandy suffered minor injuries but walked out to the trailhead.

Dr. Amy Amsler from the Oregon Humane Society climbed down to rescue Sandy after she fell 150ft down a cliff in the Coloumbia Gorge
