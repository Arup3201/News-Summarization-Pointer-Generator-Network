A woman was forced to wait for four hours in hospital without her partner while suffering her fourth miscarriage - and surrounded by women waiting for abortions.

Chantelle Skinner had to listen to young girls waiting for a termination, who were saying they did not want their babies, while she was distraught at losing hers.

The grieving woman's partner and mother were not able to comfort her while she waited after she was informed that it was a full clinic that morning and that no visitors were allowed.

Chantelle Skinner, 25, went to hospital after suffering her fourth miscarriage. She says she was forced to wait in a ward with people discussing optional miscarriages. She is pictured with her partner, James Settle

Because Ms Skinner, from Withernsea, East Yorkshire, is 25 she was not allowed to have support from her partner, James Settle, 27, or her mother, teaching assistant Karen Skinner, 46, at a time when she needed it most.

Ms Skinner, who, like her partner, is in the navy, has written a letter to Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, who run the Hull and East Yorkshire Women and Children’s Hospital, complaining about the insensitive treatment.

She wrote: 'I was sitting with girls having terminations - they had support from relatives yet I was not choosing to terminate my baby.

'I was going through the heartbreak of losing a wanted baby and was denied support from my partner and mum when it was needed most.

'The baby was not just mine, it was my partner’s too. He felt helpless as it was, but not being able to be there holding my hand and support me made him feel worse.

'To be sitting by my bed from 7.30am until it was my turn for surgery at about 11.30am was agonising.'

Ms Skinner, who is in the navy, says that while she was at the hospital she was also surrounded by mothers coming and going with their new babies when she had just lost hers

Ms Skinner has had three previous miscarriages. On one occasion she was at the same hospital but was in a private ward and had her family by her side.

But this time her sadness was magnified by being alone in an inappropriate environment.

She said: 'I was on ward 30 where all the young girls were talking about how they didn’t want the baby.

'I also had to see people walking in and out of hospital with their new babies, when I’d lost mine.

'There were also pictures all over of new babies and happy parents and it just made me feel awful.

'It’s like putting Rapunzel in front of women going through chemo, you just don’t do it.

'No one should have to go through that.'

Ms Skinner's baby had died and she had to go to the hospital for surgery to remove the dead foetus and the pregnancy tissue.

Now Ms Skinner and her partner are saving for tests to see if they can get to the bottom of why she keeps having miscarriages. NHS tests so far has shown everything is normal.

After suffering three previous early miscarriages Ms Skinner had hoped this pregnancy would be successful but a scan at nine weeks on March 6 showed the baby’s heart had stopped.

The hospital has said it is unable to comment on the case because of patient confidentiality

She went for the procedure the following day.

A spokesperson for Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are unable to comment specifically on the care Ms Skinner received for reasons of patient confidentiality.

'However, we can confirm we have received a letter from her, we are looking into her concerns, and will respond directly to her in due course.'
