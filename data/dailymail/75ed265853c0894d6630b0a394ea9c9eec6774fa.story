For Britain’s first Lottery-winning pub syndicate, the chance to safeguard their jackpot by investing with a well-known retired local accountant seemed like a sensible step.

But furious villagers have now been told that millions of pounds of their winnings and other savings have been lost in the disastrous scheme.

Police are investigating David Reeves, 68, after he confessed the losses to his clients, who are thought to include several members of the Tudor Tavern pub syndicate which won a £3.6million jackpot in 1997.

Last night angry villagers said they wanted answers and accused Reeves of losing their life savings and pensions in the failed scheme.

One victim claimed that he even asked residents to give him more money so he could claw back their investments.

It also emerged that Reeves is not registered with the Financial Conduct Authority – a requirement for anyone investing other people’s money.

The 6ft 5in ex-policeman and former used car salesman handed himself in to police last weekend after leaving his home in East Preston, West Sussex.

As well as members of the pub syndicate, other Lottery winners from the area are also thought to have been affected as well as local residents – from pensioners to wealthy businessmen – who simply wanted to invest money for the future.

The sums handed over range from as little as a few thousand pounds to £1million, victims said.

One businessman who believes he has lost money in the scheme said: ‘Around 80 people have been affected and have lost a lot of money. We’re talking several million pounds.’

The victim, who has known Reeves for several years but did not want to be named, added: ‘We’ve all had this letter.

'It basically says that he has lost everybody’s money and he is asking them to reinvest so he can try to claw it back again.’ 

A former client of Reeves said: ‘There are a lot of angry people in the village who are desperate for answers. It is not known if it’s just bad investments or if he’s done something underhand. He’s been investing in the American markets for years and has in the past made people money.’ 

Another former client added: ‘He’s been running this private investors’ group for years and years. People have lost their pensions and life savings.’ 

Reeves has not been seen since news of the losses broke last week, but angry villagers have been spotted approaching his rented detached bungalow looking for answers.

Another victim said: ‘I haven’t been able to get hold of him since getting the letter. It looks like he’s gone to ground.’

Outrage: Last night villagers in East Preston accused Reeves of losing their life savings in the failed scheme

Reeves, who has been described as a recluse by neighbours, has lived in the village for 30 years.

He retired as an accountant after being diagnosed with cancer. It is believed that he then operated a private investors’ club in which residents of the seaside village entrusted him with their life savings.

A spokesman for Sussex police said: ‘A Littlehampton man contacted local police on Friday 28 February to report matters relating to investment schemes he had been operating for some local people.

‘Initial inquiries are being made to establish the full circumstances. No arrest has been made at this stage.’ 

The Financial Conduct Authority said that anyone investing money on behalf of other people should register with them. They said that Reeves had not registered.
