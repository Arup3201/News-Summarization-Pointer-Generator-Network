Transport in central London was severely disrupted today after a signal control room at one of the capital's busiest stations was flooded with cement.

The leak at Victoria station forced Transport for London to suspend the Victoria Line between Warren Street and Brixton.

The line section, which runs through stations including Oxford Circus and Green Park, closed at around 2pm this afternoon and is expected to remain disrupted for the rest of the day at least.

Chaos: The Victoria Line was shut  after a signal control room was flooded with cement, so worker rushed to find sugar to stop it setting

Stranded: The leak onto signalling equipment  caused the Victoria Line to close at around 2pm between Warren Street and Brixton - it only reopened this morning

The incident took place while contractors were working on a long-term upgrade of Victoria Station.

It left tens of thousands of rush hour commuters searching for an alternative way to get home, with TfL saying the line would be affected for the rest of the day.

Nigel Holness, London Underground's operations director, said: ‘This afternoon our contractors were working on the new station in an area next to the Victoria line signal control room.

‘These works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room, damaging equipment.

‘This has meant there are no signals working on the southern section of the line.

‘Our engineers are working hard to resolve the situation as soon as possible to get services back up and running, but the line is expected to be affected for the remainder of the day while repairs are carried out.’

Error: The cement was meant for some foundations, but spread into a control room causing panic among staff

The Victoria Line section closed runs through Oxford Circus, Green Park and other popular stations

Passengers were initially told the closure was due to ‘flooding’ at Victoria Station.

But pictures were later posted on the UsVsth3m website purporting to show a layer of cement in the affected room.

Passengers are being advised to use the Northern and Bakerloo lines. Replacement buses are also running between Green Park and Brixton.

Anger: Passengers were initially told the closure was due to 'flooding' at Victoria Station, but TFL said this was down to 'confusion'
