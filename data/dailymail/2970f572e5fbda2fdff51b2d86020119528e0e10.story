These are the amazing scenes as an incredibly rare albino raccoon plays in the backyard of a Tennessee house beside the owner's pond.

The mammal, which was born without its normal pigment, was videoed by the householder in Knox County, near Knoxville and uploaded onto the internet. 

Animal experts believe that only one in every 500,000 raccoons are born albino and while they can live to their full age, their lack of colouring makes them easier to spot by predators. 

The householder said: 'Three sibling raccoons showed up about a month ago at our bird feeders. Two of them were albinos.The unnamed householder said: ' 

'They visit a few times each week for sunflower seeds. Now they have separated and show up in the daytime as well as at night.

'The ringtail sleeps in the gazebo feeder during the day and the albinos wander blindly around.'
