For those of you who have dogs that stress out when you leave home without them, you may feel you've tried everything to comfort them. But have you tried lulling them into submission, say, with a song written by a Grammy-award winning pop star; conceived specifically for canine ears?

Andrew Dost, a member of FUN, the fizzy pop-rock band behind We Are Young, was asked to write the pet-soothing music by DOGTV, a popular multimedia network intended to 'relax' and 'stimulate' dogs when they are home alone.

'I approached this composition project differently than I would for human ears,' Mr Dost said in a statement, leading FEMAIL to test this curious concept on Pringle, the highly-spirited chihuahua.

Calm down: Andrew Dost, a band member of FUN and a Grammy-award winner no less, has composed a piece of music intended to soothe anxious dogs, which we tested on Pringle (pictured)

Usually, Pringle, who I've had for seven years, is about as charming and laid back as a chihuahua can possibly be.

That is, until any of her favorite people leave our apartment, at which point she throws herself at their ankles like a rabid squirrel and barks consistently for a solid five minutes, before trotting off to her bed without a care in the world, and settling down for a nice long nap.

I've tried various methods to ease her temporary distress, all without success; so even though I laughed out loud when news first broke of Mr Dost's concept, curiosity won me over.

I did ponder, too, whether Mr Dost was inspired to write this music as an ode to his band mate Jack Antonoff, who was recently bitten by his girlfriend Lena Dunham's over-anxious dog, Lamby. Ms Dunham subsequently had Lamby put on Prozac to calm him down, and we can only guess whether she has experimented with this song too. 

Back to Pringle, and a few minutes before my roommate left for work this morning, I switched on the mellifluous tones of Mr Dost's song.

The music, for my ears at least, was lovely. Smooth electronic notes punctuated with harps, and the sounds of scuffling and whispering wind. 'I made sure the range of frequencies and instrumentation were tailored to a dog's unique sense of hearing,' explains Mr Dost.

Pringle, however, couldn't have been less phased. I eagerly trailed behind her, speakers held aloft as she ran chaotically from room to room, but to no avail.

At one point, while she was taking a quick breather from her personal tragedy, the sound of gentle panting appeared in the song, and she turned her head towards the source of the sound quizzically, before letting out an almighty yawn.

I took this to signal progress, and played the highly enjoyable music a few more times for both of us. Since the yawn though, Pringle had forgotten that she was supposed to be upset, and had taken herself off for her morning nap. The five minutes were up, and I doubt the music had much to do with it.

I remain intrigued, however, by the concept of DOGTV, on which this sort of music plays on loop all day.

Cured? Pleasant as the song was, it did very little to interrupt Pringle's daily separation-anxiety-induced meltdown

The network claims to have done their homework on lonely dogs, stating on their website: 'Through years of research with some of the world’s top pet experts, special content was created to meet specific attributes of a dog’s sense of vision and hearing and supports their natural behavior patterns.

'The result: a confident, happy dog, who’s less likely to develop stress, separation anxiety or other related problems.'

At $4.99 a month for DirectTV subscribers, and $9.99 for its online streaming service, I imagine this material would, at the very least, soothe an owner's separation-anxiety as they guiltily leave their homes every day.

Indeed, there is a small part of me that feels warm in the knowledge that it's possible for Pringle to kick back with some good music while I'm gone, whether she notices or not.

Mr Dost is donating his fee to A Rejoyceful Animal Rescue, a shelter in his hometown of Detroit.
