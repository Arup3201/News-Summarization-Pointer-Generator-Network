Xabi Alonso said goodbye to Real Madrid on Friday and admitted he turned his back on a possible return to the Premier League because he did not want to spoil his Liverpool legacy.

The former Spain midfielder, who joins Bayern Munich from Real Madrid after five years at the club, has been linked with a return to England with former coach Jose Mourinho in the past and even to former rivals Manchester United this summer.

But speaking from the Bernabeu he said: 'I had five great years at Liverpool and I would rather just keep that memory as it is. The interest came in from Bayern in the last two weeks and it's the right decision.

'At the end of last season I knew that winning the Champions League would usher in a new era for the club and I need to start a new era too. 

'I detected that this might be the moment when it was right to leave. 

'We fought hard to win the club's tenth European Cup after losing three semi-finals, it was a weight lifted and a good time to move on.'

Some Madrid fans say they feel betrayed by his decision to join such a big European rival and one that is coached by former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola.

But when asked about his part in some of the more fiery Clasicos against Guardiola's Barca, Alonso said: 'What happens on the pitch you leave on the pitch.

'This is a decision about football nothing else. And I think Madrid are well covered in midfield.'

Many believe playing under Guardiola will be a stepping stone to a management for Alonso, who is coming at the end of a playing career in which he has already worked with most of Europe's finest coaches. 

He said: 'I'm going to learn a lot. I've been lucky to have had some great coaches. My dad was a coach too. I will learn at Bayern and that is an extra motivation for going. I've learned from Carlo [Ancelotti], [Jose] Mourinho, [Manuel] Pellegrini and now I'm sure I will learn more. I have spoken to Pep and he has told me what he wants from me.'

Xabi Alonso is the latest Spanish player to join Bayern's ranks since Pep Guardiola took over as manager.

Javi Martinez was already at the club before Guardiola took over, but he has since brought in Thiago Alcantara, Juan Bernat, Pepe Reina and now Alonso.

Guardiola has also surrounded himself with Spanish staff, such as aide Manel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and match analyst Carles Planchart.

Real Madrid confirmed Alonso's move via an official club statement: 'Real Madrid CF and Bayern Munich have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Xabi Alonso.

'The player will appear before the media on Friday at 11:00pm in the press room at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, accompanied by the Director of Institutional Relations Club , Emilio Butragueno.'

The La Liga giants sanctioned Alonso's departure following the arrival of former Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos. Munich's sporting director Matthias Sammer believes Alonso will give Bayern new options, saying: 'If that will work, I would have a very good feeling for the club and the coach.

'After the injuries of Thiago and Schweinsteiger we have been looking for someone, who could help us immediately. And Xabi Alonso could play on top level for two years.'
