There were blue and white beachballs, a few inflatable bananas and even a pink flamingo flying around the away end of St Mary’s before kick off. But the Ipswich fans’ celebrations came too early as their side battled to a draw against Southampton to force an FA Cup replay.

Mick McCarthy’s Championship side took a surprise early lead against their Barclays Premier League opposition, but Southampton levelled to take the tie into another game.

The travelling support came in force and will have many more behind them on January 14 when another 90 minutes of football, plus the possibility of extra time and penalties, will decide who progresses and if they can celebrate properly.

The Ipswich manager joked afterwards: ‘I just said to lads, “Well done, it’s the last thing we really wanted.” I said it tongue-in-cheek, I didn’t want to lose.

‘Why can’t I have a cup run as well? I want to continue our good run of form. I came down here and watched Arsenal lose to Southampton and they were worthy winners.

‘I knew we had a big support coming and was conscious of that in terms of team selection. We had a strong team out.’

The visitors netting the first goal sparked the match into a proper FA Cup tie and the flicker of an upset began to fill the stadium.

On 19 minutes full-back Tyrone Mings, who Arsenal are interested in signing, played in a deep cross from the left and Darren Ambrose did well to loop a header into the top right corner from eight yards out. The ball seemed to hang in the air for an age before dropping over the dive of Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster and in.

But then the home side started to stamp their league superiority on the game and equalised in the 33rd minute. A ball into the box by James Ward-Prowse, playing the unusual role of right-back, caused havoc amongst Ipswich’s defence and Morgan Schneiderlin snuck in to lob Ipswich goalkeeper Dean Gerken from close range.

From then on, Southampton dominated. Before the goal, Gerken used his feet to deny Steven Davis when through on goal and dived to keep out Ward-Prowse’s free kick which was curling into the bottom left corner.

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman was angry with the officials afterwards for not awarding a penalty in the second half when Mings challenged Long on the right and only a free kick was given.

‘I watched on the television afterwards,’ Koeman said. ‘It’s clear it’s in the box. Maybe the referee can’t see properly but the linesman has to see it.

‘They had unbelievable spirit in team, they had 5,000 fans supporting the team. I was afraid and the final result is that. What I don’t like is that we have to play a replay.’

Koeman and his players will now have a long journey to Ipswich on a Wednesday night sandwiched either side of trips to Manchester United and Arsenal, where victory will be far from guaranteed. Expect to see plenty more pink flamingos at Portman Road.
