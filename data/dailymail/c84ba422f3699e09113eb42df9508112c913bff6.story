Extraordinary footage has emerged of a 'Spiderman' group of thrill seekers who jump on moving trains and scale the roof tops of high rise buildings.

The trio call themselves Public Enemy and in an 11-minute video they show off ways to experience unrivalled views of Melbourne by scaling buildings and trains.

In the footage, they are seen using hidden or restricted staircases to gain access to the rooftops of the city's high rises - including the Melbourne GPO, Rydges Hotel, Crowne Plaza and The Langham - as well as one of Australia's largest construction sites, the 72-storey Prima Pearl.

The group called Public Enemy have released an 11-minute video on YouTube of their adventures

In the footage, they provide unique views of Melbourne's CBD - including some of its iconic buildings

From the rooftops of these buildings, they get a bird's eye view of some of the city's best known landmarks - including Flinders Street Station, Southbank and St Paul's Cathedral.

But what has alarmed Victoria Police the most are the group's train-surfing antics, where they are seen jumping off station platforms and latching themselves onto the outside of moving trains as well as breaking into the train driver's compartment.

The footage - which has so far garnered more than 8,000 views - emerged just days after the body of a naked 25-year-old man was retrieved by police in a stunt gone wrong.

It is thought the man was electrocuted by power lines after he climbed to the roof of a moving train while it was pulling into Balaclava station, near St Kilda, in Melbourne's south-east.

Victoria Police said they are now investigating the alarming footage

The group have also filmed themselves breaking into the train driver's compartment

Victoria Police Inspector Darren Cooper said the kind of videos released by Public Enemy was 'glamourising' risky - and sometimes life-threatening - behaviour.

'I consider this [behaviour] as very, very risk, quite silly in many ways,' he said.

'I think it's becoming more and more public. Online creates an audience [where] you've got access to tens of thousands of people instantaneously.

'Sometimes it's the motivation for these individuals...to increase their profile.'

Police say most of this behaviour was graffiti-related

They have warned people against putting themselves in such risky situations

Police say the online culture gives them access to a wider audience which is a possible motivator for this behaviour

Insp Cooper also shed some light on how they were gaining access to areas that are not open to the public.

'Some of these people are quite sophisticated, they operate in crews,' he said.

'They have got a different range of techniques - [including] access keys. We've seen in the past they tended to be Metro [train operator] workers.'

Insp Cooper confirmed police would be investigating the video to catch offenders.

He said a lot of the behaviour seen in the video was graffiti related and there were teams dedicated to investigating these crimes.

The release of the footage comes just days after a 25-year-old died in a stunt gone wrong where he climbed on top of a Melbourne train

Police say groups like Public Enemy use many different techniques to gain access to restricted areas - in the past, some have found to be Metro train staff

Their behaviour has been labelled as 'risky and dangerous' by police
