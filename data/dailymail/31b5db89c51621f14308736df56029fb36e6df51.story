He’s worth $250million and is running for the White House, but Mitt Romney is still trying to portray himself as an ordinary down-to-earth guy.

The GOP presidential candidate was condemned earlier today for saying he has been worried about getting a ‘pink slip’ at least twice in the past.

Now he has stunned a business audience in Nashua, New Hampshire, by telling them: 'I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.

'You know, if someone isn’t giving 
the good service, I want to say, "I’m going to go get someone else to 
provide this service",' Mr Romney said.

Still smiling: GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been condemned for saying he has been worried about getting a 'pink slip' at least twice in the past

He told a chamber of commerce how 
individuals should have their own health insurance, so the insurers have
an incentive to keep clients healthy.

The multimillionaire was saying that people should be able to switch health insurance companies and have more options in order to get the best deal.

Opponents said his statement on job termination notices was unfortunate because Mr Romney has 
always had money to fall back on.

‘I know these are tough times,’ Mr Romney said. ‘I've learned what it's like to sign the front of a pay cheque, not just the back of a pay cheque.

‘And to know how frightening it is to see if you can make payroll at the end of the week. These are experiences that many of you know.

'I know what it’s like to worry about whether you're going to get fired. There were a couple of times I wondered if I was going to get a pink slip.'

Mitt Romney is leading the latest Florida GOP poll with 36 per cent - a dozen points ahead of nearest rival Newt Gingrich on 24 per cent.

The Quinnipiac University survey put them ahead of Rick Santorum on 16 per cent, Ron Paul on 10 per cent, Rick Perry on 5 per cent and Jon Huntsman on 2 per cent.

The Florida primary is on January 31. More than half of respondents said they could change their minds.

Mr Romney is facing a mounting attack from GOP rival Newt Gingrich, who says he used his work to benefit from the losses of thousands of jobs.

The former Massachusetts governor made a
fortune working at investment firm Bain Capital, which Mr Gingrich 
claims ‘looted’ other companies.

‘He’s trying to identify with regular 
folks but he’s seen as somebody who’s wealthy,’ New Hampshire political 
expert Andy Smith told the Boston Herald.

Rick Perry responded to the comments by saying Mr Romney must have been worried 'whether he was going to have enough of them to hand out'.

He said in Anderson, South Carolina: 'Bain Capital - with all the jobs that they killed - I’m sure he was worried that he’d run out of pink slips.'

'I know what it’s like to worry about whether you're going to get fired. There were a couple of times I wondered if I was going to get a pink slip'

Mitt Romney

His rival Jon Huntsman said: 'Governor Romney enjoys firing people - I enjoy creating jobs.'

GOP voter Jerry Delemus added that Mr Romney should consider what it's like to be fired without any money to rely on.

The candidate made the comments 
following criticism from former House Speaker Mr Gingrich ahead of New 
Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday.

As soon as the lights went up in Concord, New Hampshire the other five candidates decided that they needed to take Romney down a peg or two.The feistiest by far was Newt Gingrich. Sarcasm dripped from his lips as he responded to Romney's well-polished (and not especially convincing) tale about not being a career politician by saying: 'I realise the red light doesn't mean anything to you because you are the frontrunner.' - TOBY HARNDEN

‘Bain, at times, engaged in behaviour 
where they looted a company, leaving behind 1,700 unemployed people,’ Mr
Gingrich said in Concord.

Gingrich campaign group Winning Our Future posted a video saying some deals made by Mr Romney and Bain left others in a ‘pit of despair’.

Twenty-two percent of all 77 businesses the firm invested in from 1984 to 1999 filed
for bankruptcy or shut within eight years, reported the Wall Street Journal.

But Mr Romney appeared on Sunday with GOP heavyweight New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to give him an extra boost.

A Romney spokesman told the National Journal Mr Romney was taking about his post-college working life and working 'up the career ladder'.

Democrats are expected to hit back by giving fake pink slips to people attending Mr Romney’s meetings in New Hampshire on Monday.

Mr Gingrich's supporters will spend 
$3.4million in South Carolina, with the majority on attacking Mr Romney's time at Bain, reported Politico.
