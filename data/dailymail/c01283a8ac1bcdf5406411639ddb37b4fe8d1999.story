A New York bus monitor who received more than $700,000 in donations from well-wishers who watched her being relentlessly bullied in a YouTube video is still living a frugal lifestyle a year on.

Karen Klein, from Greece, New York, was tormented with profanity, insults and threats by four middle school children during a school bus run.

A 10-minute cellphone video of the abuse was taken by 
another student and spawned an
outpouring of $703,833 in donations for Klein from all over the world after it was uploaded to the internet.

But despite the huge donation, the 69-year-old is still living in her home of 46 years and hasn't splashed out on a single luxury with the cash.

Happy ending: Karen Klein received more than $700,000 in donations from well-wishers after a video of her being abused by young children was posted on the internet - but still chooses to live a frugal lifestyle

But despite continuing to count the pennies, Klein has been able to retire from her job as a bus monitor.

She has also used $100,000 as seed money for the Karen Klein Anti-Bullying Foundation, which has promoted its message of kindness at concerts and through books.

She has also spent some of the money helping family members and friends but 'the rest is under lock and key' to provide for her during her retirement.

Klein's daughter, Amanda Klein-Romig, told the Huffington Post: 'There are other people who it would probably change dramatically. But for her, no, everything's the same pretty much. It's not like she's jaunting every weekend to a different place.'

Klein owes much of her good fortune to Max Sidorov. The Toronto nutritionist set up the a fund for Klein after viewing the video with the help of fundraising site Indiegogo.

Sidorov said that he two bullied as a student and started the drive with the goal of raising $5,000 to send Klein on vacation.

But he couldn’t have expected the flood of financial support that came in, enough to send Klein on more than 140 vacations.

An Indiegogo spokeswoman said that more than 30,000 people from 84 countries contributed to the fund.

Shortly after receiving the money, Klein said that the attention has already sent her all over North America.

She told CBC News: 'I came [to Canada]. I went to New York City to be on the Today Show; I went to Boston to be on a radio show.'

Klein
told the network that she visited New Orleans on country singer Tim 
McGraw’s dime, and took a trip to California 'thanks to Anderson 
Cooper.'

The video shows Klein trying to ignore a stream of profanity, insults and threats from the seventh-grade boys.

One
of the students can be heard saying: 'If I stabbed you in the stomach, 
my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** 
lard.'

At one point, she even breaks down in tears.

Tormented: Klein, 68, was taunted and

The four middle school students were suspended for a year, and have been barred from regular bus transportation.

In an interview with the Associated Press in July last year, Klein said the punishment was ‘fine with me.' Klein said they'll still be going to an alternative school - 'they won't be just sitting at home doing nothing.'

She said that the best part of her ordeal going public, and the resulting school action, 'is that they have to do community service - for senior citizens.'

The Greece, New York, grandmother has since retired.

Klein said that her decision to leave the job she held for three years was tough but wasn't based on her now infamous encounter with the mean-spirited seventh-graders.

Speaking at the donation ceremony last year, Klein said: 'When you’re an adult and you get bullied, that’s one thing. I can handle it, but children can't. They just... it sticks with them forever, and I hope it stops.'

Painful memories: Speaking from her home in July, Klein said how hurt she was by the boys' vile words
