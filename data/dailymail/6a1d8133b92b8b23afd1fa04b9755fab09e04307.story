Getting the best seat by the pool should be no problem this summer thanks to a luxury new chair on wheels - complete with parasol and wine cooler.

The LoungePac is a foldable sun lounger which not only comes with a 4ft diameter umbrella but also built-in speakers.

The 22lbs device opens in just 10 seconds to guarantee beachgoers and holidaymakers a comfortable seat whatever time they pitch up at the poolside.

The music system hooks up iPods and phones to play out tunes from the speakers in the headrest.

Inventor Dan Pedemonte, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said: 'This is quite possibly the world's best outdoor portable lounger.

'The lounger-chair combination is packed with all kinds of gadgets and goodies for loungers.

'To start with, it transports on wheels in a fashion similar to that of rolling luggage.

'It folds out from its transportable state in about 10 seconds, and is then ready to go with no assembly required.'

Made from lightweight aluminium, LoungePac is priced at £150 ($230) and could ideal for getting a good view by the sea, at outdoor concerts or at plays

The chair features two coolers with cup holders for keeping drinks or food close at hand. The leg support can be removed and used as a table and the pillow on the back gives some added comfort

'The chair also features two coolers with cup holders for keeping drinks or food close at hand,' added Mr Pedemonte.

'The leg support can be removed and used as a table and the pillow on the back gives some added comfort - much more relaxing than a plastic chair.

'The pillow can be removed to allow loungers to read a book while looking through a face hole.'

The blue LoungePac has an adjustable back from upright to horizontal position.

Made from lightweight aluminium, it is priced at £150 ($230) and could also be ideal for getting a good view at outdoor concerts or plays.

The device is made from salt water resistant materials and comes with a tote bag to help keep personal items out of the sand. When open, the chair is 6ft 5ins long and can carry a maximum 245lbs in weight when upright

Holidaymakers can either wheel their LoungePac (9.9kg) around or carry it around as a backpack.
