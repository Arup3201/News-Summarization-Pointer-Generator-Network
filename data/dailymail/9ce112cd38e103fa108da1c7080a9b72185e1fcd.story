Two orphaned baby wombats have picked up an unlikely skill after a tragic start in life, learning to play soccer in the back yard of their temporary home.

Dudley and Moria-Joy were rescued by Judy Bailey around 12 months ago on the NSW South Coast after their mothers were killed by cars.

'They were both found on the side of the road in their mums' pouches after their mums were run over by cars,' Judy’s niece Kirsten Bailey told Daily Mail Australia.

Soccer is now ‘a regular hobbie’ for the marsupials. ‘It’s how they get exercise,’ Kirsten explained. 

When they were first rescued, Dudley weighed just 720g but now they are both a healthy 8kg.

'Judy will look after them on her enclosed property on the South Coast until they are 22kg and old enough to be released into the wild. 

'Besides soccer, they enjoy digging dirt to make burrows, eating grass and lots of sleeping,' Kirsten said. 

Judy has been rescuing wildlife for around a decade, but it’s not just wombats – she also takes in injured kangaroos, wallabies, birds and possums and cares for them until they are strong enough to be released into the wild again.

They were found in the pouches of their dead mothers but are now enjoying a happy life at Judy Bailey's home until they are old enough to be released into the wild 

Kirsten said they wombats love to play around and 'bond with humans quite easily'

Kirsten said the little wombats have ‘a lovely big area for them to play in’ out the back of Judy’s home.

One day, Judy threw a soccer ball to them and they’ve been playing with it ever since.

Their sporting antics were filmed and published on YouTube last week, with Kirsten’s husband Luke describing them as ‘too cute for words’.

‘The wombats are her babies, they are so cute,’ Kirsten said.

The mini marsupials have formed a strong bond since being orphaned 

‘They are very affectionate; they love a cuddle and playing around and bond with humans quite easily. It can make it dangerous to release back into the wild but it’s OK if the location is far away from the roads,’ she added.

Dudley and Moria-Joy will be driven out into the bush and released as soon as they are big enough, in the wild wombats are usually weaned after 15 months.

Whether they’ll take their ball with them remains to be seen.
