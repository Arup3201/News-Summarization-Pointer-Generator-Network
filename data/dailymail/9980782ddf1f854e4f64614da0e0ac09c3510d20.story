Harry Enfield has bared almost all as he paraded down a gloomy British beach in a spoof advert.

The 53-year-old comedian donned some eye-watering swimming trunks, leather shoes and a fetching moustache to march down the bitterly cold sand for Save The Children.

Enfield, who is best known for his role in 2000 film Kevin and Perry Go Large, was aiming to recreate the ‘Whatever's Comfortable’ advert for Southern Comfort from two years ago.

He later puts on a stand-out jumper and picks up a collection bucket to highlight Christmas Jumper Day next Friday - aiming to raise money for the charity by getting people to wear a festive pullover.

Enfield said: ‘When the director Paul Weiland rang me up and said we want you to mirror this bloke from a really famous advert; we think he looks exactly like you, I was obviously really flattered and leapt at the opportunity.

‘I'm the total opposite in taste and physicality to the character I'm playing today; in real life I've got a six-pack and an impeccable taste in jumpers.’

The Bafta-award winning Enfield has had a career spanning four decades and characters ranging from Loadsamoney, the Slobs, Tim Nice But Dim, Tory Boy and Smashey and Nicey.

Other celebrities backing the campaign include actress Isla Fisher, television presenters Jon Snow and Alex Jones, Strictly Come Dancing's Bruno Tonioli, Mark and Jess Wright from The Only Way Is Essex, singer Myleene Klass and BBC Radio One DJ Fearne Cotton.

Enfield was recreating the ‘Beach’ advert from the Whatever's Comfortable campaign, in which a large man appears extremely confident in himself as he casually walks down a beach.
