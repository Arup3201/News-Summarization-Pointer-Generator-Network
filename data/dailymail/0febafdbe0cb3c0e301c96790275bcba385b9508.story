Newcastle midfielder Cheick Tiote has said he wants to leave the club, and claimed there has been contact from Arsenal.

The 28-year-old has spent four years on Tyneside and there had been suggestions that he would be offered a new contract, but that now appears in doubt. 

Tiote told press in his home country: 'I want to leave. I've spent four years with Newcastle. I think I have reached a stage where it's maybe time to look elsewhere for a new challenge.

Cheick Tiote has said that he would like to leave Newcastle in the near future and find a 'new challenge'

The 28-year-old was the subject of interest from Arsenal and Lokomotiv Moscow during the summer

'I will focus on upcoming games and let's see what happens between now and December. 

'It is true there were contacts for me from Arsenal and a club in Russia. I'd prefer to stay in England.'

While many supporters may have been expecting departures in the near future, manager Alan Pardew had looked the likeliest candidate.

The news will come as a blow to Newcastle, especially considering Pardew was singing Tiote's praises just days ago.

He said: ‘I love him. He’s everything you want in a Newcastle player.

‘He has the quality, and of course you’ll never underestimate the fact that he wants to win. That’s something we have to be very careful about on training days!

'I just love that he’s a winner. It can overcome so many obstacles as a footballer.'
