Benjamin Price went from earning more than £500,000 a year to claiming £71 a week in benefits

A city banker who complained that his £518,000 pay packet was not enough was made redundant months later and now lives off £71 a week in benefits, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Morgan Stanley trader Benjamin Price, 39, said he had effectively ‘signed my own death warrant’ by making a complaint about his pay.

His annual earnings had dropped from £533,000 to £518,000, with the bank  blaming the cut on the global financial crisis. Mr Price objected and four months later he was made redundant, leaving him to survive on unemployment benefit, East London Employment Tribunal was told.

Now he is claiming £1million in unfair dismissal and breach of contract.

He is also claiming to be a ‘whistleblower’ about the culture at the American banking giant, where making complaints is ‘seen as detrimental to your career’.

Mr Price, of Wimbledon, South London, accuses the bank of reneging on a deal to improve his pay after he turned down a job offer from a rival.

He said he had been headhunted by Citibank in 2010 and offered a deal worth $1.1million (£670,000) a year.

But he agreed to stay at Morgan Stanley after his bosses promised to match the offer, he claimed.

However, not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal, they cut his wages too, he claimed.

He was made redundant in  January 2012 after 14 years at the bank, having worked his way up from analyst to senior trader in the company’s derivatives division.

He said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses.

Mr Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up.

Mr Price, 39, had worked at Morgan Stanley for 14 years when he was made redundant in January 2012

‘This effectively was me signing my own 
death warrant at Morgan Stanley. That was the deal,  $1.1million, they 
offered when I turned down Citibank, and I would not just keep quiet 
about it. I was made assurances by my senior manager at Morgan Stanley, 
Craig Verdon, that they would match this offer.

‘I asked for a written contract from 
Mr Verdon that he would match the $1.1million offered by Citibank, but 
he told me due to the UK 50 per cent bonus tax at the time, he would not
provide one.

‘When I was 
paid $850,000 (£518,000) the following year – not the deal agreed – I 
was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed.’ But 
Citibank never put its offer in writing either, and was not ‘hammering 
on his door’ to hire him, the tribunal heard.

Thomas
Linden QC, representing Morgan Stanley, said Mr Price had never 
received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer.

During
a heated exchange, Mr Linden claimed: ‘The truth is you didn’t have an 
offer to match. It is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “it 
isn’t enough”. I don’t think I’ve ever met a banker who thinks he is 
overpaid.’

The trader replied: ‘I have written my witness statement and 
sworn an oath and you keep asserting I am lying.

Mr Price told the tribunal he signed his own 'death warrant' with the company by complaining about pay

‘I don’t think anyone can sit and say being paid $800,000 is being underpaid, but it just was not what was agreed.’

On
the culture at the banking giant, Mr Price claimed: ‘The practice at 
Morgan Stanley is to attempt to pay you a minimum it thinks it needs to 
in order to keep you happy and not look to move  to a competitor.

'Speaking up at Morgan Stanley is welcomed so long as you are agreeing 
with senior management, and making complaints is seen as detrimental to
your career, as it is wholly at their discretion how much compensation 
you will be getting and promotion is impossible without backing.

‘I
am aware that going up against Morgan Stanley will harm my chances of 
finding employment elsewhere in the industry in the future.’

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
