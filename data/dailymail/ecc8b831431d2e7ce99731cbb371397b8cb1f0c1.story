Britain could be in for a cheap Christmas this year, as a sharp drop in commodity prices and a fierce supermarket price war looks set to keep prices low for festive shoppers. 

Overall prices in Britain's shops fell for the 17th month running in September, as deflation rose to an annual 1.8 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in August, new figures reveal.

And it is hoped the drop will continue up until December, as big name stores and supermarkets battle for custom and lure shoppers in with competitive deals. 

Meanwhile the price of sending some parcels is to be cut in the run up to Christmas, saving consumers up to £5.20 per package, the Royal Mail has announced.

Festive bargains: Britain could be in for a cheap Christmas this year, as a sharp drop in commodity prices and a fierce supermarket price war looks set to keep prices low for festive shoppers

The size of a 'small' parcel will effectively double to 2kg, at a cost of £2.80. A package this large would have previously been classed as 'medium' size and would have cost customers £8.

The promotion will last from October 20 to January 18, allowing families and businesses to make savings by sending larger items at a reduced rate, and cramming more into a single package than they would have been able to previously. 

The British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index indicated good news for hard-pressed consumers struggling with low-wage increases in the run-up to Christmas, and marked the 17th month that prices showed a fall on the same month last year.

 The BRC data looks at food and non-food prices across the high street.

Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: 'Consumers can take heart that the outlook for inflation remains modest. 

'Falling commodity prices, the strengthening of sterling, benign pressure in the supply chain and, critically, fierce competition across the retail industry suggests lower shop prices for consumers will continue.'

According to the BRC figures, non-food deflation - which includes clothing and footwear, electricals and DIY among its seven categories - stood at 3.2 per cent in September, as intense competition among retailers continued to drive down prices.

The report said bargains in furniture, flooring and electricals, as well as a boost of activity in the housing market, supported robust sales in this sector.

The BRC data doesn't include categories such as electricity, transport, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture - which are included in the Office for National Statistics' consumer prices index. 

That gave an inflation figure of 1.5 per cent for August.

The BRC report said food inflation stood at 0.3 per cent in September - the lowest figure on record from December 2006, amid a fierce price war in the grocery sector.

Supermarkets have been battling to stave off competition from budget rivals Aldi and Lidl, whose winning formula of low cost essentials and cut-price luxuries has proved a hit with cash-strapped households.

BRC director general Helen Dickinson said continuing deflation was good news for UK households: 'Retailers are turning their attention to Christmas by reading current conditions and matching consumer sentiment well with their promotions and offers.

'In particular, food inflation remained at an all-time low.

'In September, over a third of all groceries going through the tills were on some sort of promotion or special offer, meaning savvy shoppers are picking the deals that work best for them, allowing them to effectively budget.'

Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at analysts Nielsen, said: 'There are historic low levels of price increases across the high street, and with more price cuts expected from supermarkets over the next few weeks, shoppers will continue to get great savings.

'Whilst sales patterns are still difficult to predict, not least following the unusually warm late summer, we can anticipate a continuation of the current low levels inflation and even deflation for the rest of the year.

'This will help shoppers to plan their spending in the run up to the start of Christmas trading.'
