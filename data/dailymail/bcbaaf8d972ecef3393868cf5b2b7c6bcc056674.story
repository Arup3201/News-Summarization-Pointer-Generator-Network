The shadow chancellor was a close ally of Gordon Brown

Ed Balls says he is ‘more bothered’ about passing a Grade 8 exam on the piano than serving in the next Labour cabinet.

The shadow chancellor he would ‘love’ 
to be a part of a future Labour government but that it is not an 
‘all-consuming passion’ for him.

Mr Balls is widely regarded as one of 
the most ambitious figures in Westminster, but in an interview with the 
Yorkshire Post he says he has already achieved enough that his next 
career move is not his priority.

‘I would love to be part of Ed’s 
Labour government but what I do next for me is not an all-consuming 
passion.

'I’m more bothered, in a personal sense, about getting to grade 8
piano by the time I’m 50.’

Mr Balls, who is 46, took his grade 1 exam last year and passed his grade two a couple of months ago.

Asked about his leadership ambitions, 
Mr Balls said: ‘I’ve played an important role in making the Bank of 
England independent and the Every Child Matters agenda in education.

‘I’ve done enough things which I know 
have made things better, or good, in our country to not feel as though 
the most important thing is what I do next in my career.’

He added: ‘The danger for a politician
is always that you worry that once you’ve gone your epitaph will say 
“hopes unfulfilled” but I think mine would be “he did some good things 
and he did his best” and that’s enough.’

Mr Balls used the interview to warn that Labour should not rule out holding a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU.

He said it is ‘economically very 
dangerous’ for David Cameron to call for a referendum by 2017 ‘because 
it leads to great instability and uncertainty’.

Key change: The shadow chancellor has made steady progress with his piano lessons, which he demonstrated at last year's Labour conference 

Sour note: Mr Balls claims he could do a better job than George Osborne at tuning up the economy

But he added: ‘I don’t think we should
set our face against a referendum and I certainly don’t think we can 
ever afford to give the impression that we know better than the voting 
public and that we’re going to carry on regardless.’

Mr Balls also admitted that the last 
Labour government got it wrong on immigration by not restricting 
immigrants from Eastern Europe in 2004.

‘The problem for Labour is the 
perception, and there’s some truth in this perception, that the controls
weren’t tough enough,’ he said.

‘When they joined the EU, we didn’t 
have the transitional controls and that was a mistake. ‘Also, we didn’t 
do enough to enforce the minimum wage to make sure the agency workers 
coming from Eastern Europe couldn’t be brought in to do the same job, 
undercutting the wages of people in the same workplace. That caused us a
big problem at the last election, there’s no doubt about that.’

Mr Balls also conceded that Labour has yet to convince voters it can be trusted with the economy.

‘We haven’t won that argument yet, but both George Osborne and David Cameron have lost the argument,’ he said.

A spokesman for Mr Balls said that he 
is very keen to become the next Chancellor and that his comments were 
intended to indicate that he is more interested in the piano than being 
Labour leader rather than serving in another Cabinet.

‘It’s pretty clear what he would like to do on that front,’ the spokesman said.
