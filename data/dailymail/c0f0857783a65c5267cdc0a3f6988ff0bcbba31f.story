Two California 
judges who had sex in their respective chambers - one with his clerk and
 the other with multiple women - have been censured for those acts along
 with other related misconduct, a state judicial commission said on 
Tuesday.

Orange County Superior Court Judge Scott Steiner was censured by the state Commission on Judicial Performance for engaging in sexual activity in his chambers on multiple occasions with women

The two judges serve in separate superior courts in different parts of the state and their discipline cases were unrelated.

Orange
 County Superior Court Judge Scott Steiner was censured by the state 
Commission on Judicial Performance for engaging in sexual activity in 
his chambers on multiple occasions with women.

The commission called it 'the height of irresponsible and improper' behavior.

'It
 reflects an utter disrespect for the dignity and decorum of the court, 
and is seriously at odds with a judge’s duty to avoid conduct that 
tarnishes the esteem of the judicial office in the public’s eye,' the 
commission said in a written order.

The
 commission said Steiner also wrote a letter of recommendation for one 
of the women to the Orange County District Attorney's Office and called 
there to express irritation when she was not hired.

'Judge
 Steiner cooperated fully in the investigation. He apologizes and 
appreciates the Commission’s thorough review and fair findings in this 
matter,' attorney Paul Meyer, who represented Steiner in the matter, 
said in a written statement.

The
 commission also censured Kern County Superior Court Judge Cory 
Woodward, who it said carried on an intimate affair with his court clerk
 from July of 2012 until May of last year, engaging in sexual activity 
with her in his chambers and in public places.

The
 commission said Woodward passed notes of a sexual nature to the clerk 
during court proceedings and lied about the relationship when confronted
 by his presiding judges in a bid to block her transfer.

Steiner also wrote a letter of recommendation for one of the women to the Orange County District Attorney's Office and called there to express irritation when she was not hired

'Judge
 Woodward cooperated fully with the Commission’s inquiry. As the 
Commission recognized, he expressed great remorse and contrition,' 
Meyer, who also represented Woodward, said in a separate statement.

'He 
has apologized and appreciates the thorough review of the Commission in 
this matter.'

Both 
Woodward and Steiner were allowed to remain on the bench despite the 
censure.

In both cases, the commission cited their acknowledgement of 
wrongdoing and expressions of remorse.
