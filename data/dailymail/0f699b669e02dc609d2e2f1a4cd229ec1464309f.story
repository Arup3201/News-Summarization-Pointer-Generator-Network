A 22-year-old pregnant woman from Chicago has been accused of whipping to death her 3-year-old son with a belt and an electrical cord.

Tylesha Griffin, of West Rogers Park, was charged with first-degree murder Sunday, two days after the child, Donnell Coakley, was found unresponsive in his bed.

The toddler was rushed to St Francis Hospital, where he passed away a short time later.

Monstrous charges: Tylesha Griffin (left), 22, from Chicago, was charged with first-degree murder in connection to the beating death of her 3-year-old son, Donnell Coakley (right) 

Too late: Paramedics arrived at the family's home in the 6500 block of North Seeley Avenue in Chicago Friday night 

The death was classified as a homicide after an autopsy determined that little Donnell had suffered 'abusive injuries.'

The boy was allegedly struck more than 100 times on his buttocks, legs, back, arms and head.

Court documents cited by the local news blog RedEye Chicago indicate that the child suffered a chipped front tooth, a massive gaping wound exposing muscle on his left arm, and had patches of hair missing from his head.

Tylesha Griffin's young son also had burn marks all over his body, and he may have been bound based on ligature markings on his wrists.

Harsh punishment: The 22-year-old, who is expecting another child, told police that Donnell was occasionally disciplined with a belt 

Police officers responded to the woman's apartment in the 6500 block of North Seeley Avenue at 8.40pm Friday. Little Donnell succumbed to his injuries just over an hour later in the hospital.

Earlier in the day, Griffin and her boyfriend left the toddler in the care of relatives to attend an appointment with the man’s parole officer, a police source told CBS Chicago.

When they returned home, they reportedly discovered Donnell in bed with vomit around his mouth. Instead of taking him to the hospital, the parents cleaned the child up and tucked him in again.

It was not until hours later that Griffin called 911 to report that her son was unresponsive, according to court documents.

Fatal delay: It allegedly took Griffin (left and right) and her boyfriend hours to seek medical help for their son

Griffin and Donnell's father returned home from meeting the man's parole officer and discovered the toddler lying in bed in his own vomit 

When questioned by police about the wounds on her son's body, Miss Griffin allegedly said that Donnell was occasionally disciplined with a belt.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said the boy’s two siblings have been taken into protective custody.

Tylesha Griffin is being held without bail. She is due back in court November 26.
