A Washington D.C. father has died after he suffered a heart attack outside a fire station but a firefighter allegedly refused to help until a 911 dispatcher had officially assigned him to the call.

Medric 'Cecil' Mills Jr., 77, collapsed Saturday afternoon at a shopping center parking lot in Northeast D.C. His Daughter, Marie Mills, who was with him running errands said several onlookers ran to the adjacent Engine 26 for help but their desperate pleas went unanswered.

'When it's a cardiac case, seconds matter and they didn't help my dad,' Ms Mills said.

Tragic death: Medric 'Cecil' Mills Jr., 77, right, collapsed and died Saturday afternoon with his daughter, Marie Mills, left after a firefighter at the adjacent Engine 26 allegedly refused to help

She told Fox News that when her dad suffered the heart attack, they could see a firefighter standing in the open doorway of the firehouse across the road but he didn't react.

'I mean everybody was screaming and hollering at him across the street,' she said. 'Why [couldn't] he come? It's not making sense and I think it was three separate people who went across to the fire station.'

Ms Mills said the firefighter, later confirmed to be trained in basic life support, told the good Samaritans to call 911 and said he couldn't help until he was officially dispatched to the call.

'When I saw my dad was having shallow breaths, I ran to the curb and started screaming for him to come and help my father,' she added.

Finally, when an ambulance and engine
 were dispatched from another location, they were sent to the wrong part
 of the city, Northwest not Northeast D.C., according to Fox News.

Ms Mills said tearfully: 'That's why my daddy lay on that ground.'

Engine 26 has launched an investigation into Mr Mills' death, which is being overseen by the city's deputy mayor for public safety and justice, the Washington Post reported.

D.C. mayor Vincent C. Gray called Ms Mills and 'apologized for what appeared to be a dereliction,' his spokesman, Pedro Ribeiro, said. 'We're going to investigate exactly what happened.'

He added that if the allegations are true, it would be a serious breach of the public trust.

'When you go to a fire station, you should expect that someone there is going to help you,' Ribeiro told the Washington Post. 'This gentleman was not served. We need to answer why he was not served.'

He added that if there is some protocol requiring a 911 dispatch before help is rendered, 'then protocol be damned.'

Engine 26 spokesman Tim Wilson told the Washington Post the firefighter contacted a supervisor, which is standard procedure when someone comes to a firehouse seeking help.

But then, he said, 'That's where it gets a bit muddied. He said officials are still trying to figure out the sequence of events.

Mr Mills died at MedStar Washington Hospital Center at 3:38 p.m. Saturday.

Edward C. Smith, the president of the firefighters union, said: 'This shouldn't have happened. We need to find out why it happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.'

Mr Mills had lived in D.C. all his life and, at 77, still worked for the city at parks and recreation.

'That's how much he loved Department of Parks and Recreation and his city,' Marie Mills said, 'and he died in the city that didn't do anything to help him.'
