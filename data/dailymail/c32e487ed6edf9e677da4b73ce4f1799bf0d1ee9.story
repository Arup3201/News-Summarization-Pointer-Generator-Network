A team of older men have celebrated completing a pioneering 35-year health study - beating killer diseases by making simple changes to their lifestyle.

Health experts told volunteers to follow five simple rules - eat well, work out, drink less, keep their weight down and never smoke.

They were told if they followed the healthy-living plan they would avoid heart disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia.

More than 2,500 men agreed to be monitored for the rest of their lives - but only 25 managed to stick to the rules they were given in 1979.

The 'survivors' are now in their eighties and nineties and yesterday celebrated their long lives at a party held by the research team.

The study in South Wales is the longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease.

From 1979 to the present day, researchers from Cardiff University followed the lifestyle habits of men aged 45-59 living in the Caerphilly area.

They found that those who followed four or five of the specified healthy steps were 60 per cent less likely to develop dementia.

There was a similar reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, along with 40 per cent fewer cancers.

There was also a 70 per cent cut in the risk of diabetes, according to evidence presented yesterday at a Healthy Ageing summit run by the university.

Retired teacher Leighton Jones and former warehouse cashier Ray Grace are both in rude good health after following the healthy guide lines laid down to them by the University scientists.

Granddad Mr Jones said: 'I have followed the healthy steps for many years now and feel pretty fit. Cycling keeps my body fit while scrabble keep the mind fit.

'I do have a beer or wine most nights but I drink in moderation.'

Bachelor Mr Grace, 80, travels all over Wales and the West Country refereeing college American football matches and walks and jogs two miles every day near his home in the village of Llanbradach.

And Mr Grace, a member of the British and American Football Referees Association, has no intention of retiring from the sport he loves.

He said: 'I'll go on as long as I am able to. I've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it.'

Mr Grace said: 'I'll go on as long as I am able to. I've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it'

Mr Grace said he was happy to co-operate with researchers throughout the life of the project saying: 'As far as I'm concerned it's been a great success.

'It has been invaluable for me and I'm pleased to have been part of it.

'I've stuck pretty well to the healthy lifestyle laid down and met with the researchers half a dozen times over the years.

'It has been invaluable for me and I'm pleased to have been part of it.'

The volunteers gave researchers regular reports of their physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet.

Their wives and families helped by completing a food frequency questionnaire.

The recommended physical activity was to walk two or more miles to work each day, cycle 10 or more miles to work each day, or regular 'vigorous' exercise.

Every five years the men were re-questioned and re-examined along with their medical records to identify new cases of diabetes, heart disease and strokes. 

Professor Peter Elwood, who has led the School of Medicine study since its inception, said the findings were a 'wake-up' call.

'Thirty years ago, only 30 men in our study followed all five of our recommended healthy steps,' he said.

'Although following these steps does not give them complete protection against disease, the men who, despite living healthily, developed a disease did so at a much older age than the men neglectful of their lifestyle.

'Thus the development of heart disease was delayed by up to six years and it was up to around an additional 12 years before dementia took its grip.

'On the less rosy end of the spectrum, 40 men in every 100 lived a life so neglectful that by any definition their lifestyle was unhealthy. They experienced none of the reductions in disease.'

Professor Elwood added: 'The appalling fact is that recent surveys across the whole of Wales yield almost identical proportions of men and women following the healthy and unhealthy lifestyles found in Caerphilly 35 years ago. 

'And the picture isn't much better in England: 53 per cent of men drink more than the recommended amount and only half of men meet the government-recommended scores for well-being.'

The advice given by the project has become familiar from other research showing that staying slim, eating lots of fruit and vegetables, exercising regularly, drinking in moderation and never smoking boosts longevity.

The Caerphilly participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low, so three or more portions a day was accepted as 'healthy'. Fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories was classed as a good diet.

Those regarded as physically active were walking two or more miles or cycling ten or more to work each day, or taking 'vigorous' exercise regularly.

Low alcohol consumption was defined as three or fewer units per day, with abstinence not treated as healthy behaviour.

Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer's Society which part-funded the project, said: 'These studies are expensive and complicated but essential to understand how dementia can be prevented.'

The Caerphilly research was a pilot for the much larger UK BIOBANK study involving more than 500,000 Britons. This is led by Professor John Gallacher, who also works at Cardiff.
