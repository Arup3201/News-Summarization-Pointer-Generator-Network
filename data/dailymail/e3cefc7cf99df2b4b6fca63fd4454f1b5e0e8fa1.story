Hundreds of desperate Venezuelans are being forced to beg for medicine on Twitter because the crumbling economy has left the country unable to import basic medical supplies.

Using the hashtag '#ServicioPublico', Venezuelans are pleading with foreigners to send them treatments for all manner of conditions - including blood disorders, viruses and infections.

Things have got so bad in the country that experts are claiming that 15 per cent of those who die of cancer would have had a chance of survival had proper radiotherapy treatment been provided. 

Supply: This  photograph shows the inside of a refrigerator storage area at a blood bank in Caracas. A year ago, the blood bank was open for 12 hours every day. Now, it only takes donations on weekday mornings

Decline: A patient is seen resting at the Central Hospital in Maracay, Venezuela. Legions of ailing Venezuelans are being neglected by a national health care system that doctors say is now collapsing

One tweet using the #ServicioPublico hashtag was sent on behalf on 22-year-old Vanessa Chacón, who desperately needed 10mg of Infalgan solution for use in injections to treat her severe coronary condition, according to Ozy.

The tweet itself was sent by her uncle Nelson Jaimes who, despite being a pharmacist with good contacts, has had no luck obtaining his niece's medicine himself.

'My niece is very sick. We haven't been able to locate the drug in pharmacies or in hospitals,' he said. 'We who are inside the pharma business can't locate the products. What can a regular citizen expect to find?,' he added.

The lack of medicine in Venezuela has got so bad that businesses who used to regularly deal with pharmaceutical companies have now severed their relationships as there simply isn't enough medicine available to make the industry profitable. 

Pharmacy shelves lie empty, with even basics like vitamin C, folic acid, headache pills and remedies for mosquito bites almost entirely unavailable in the capital Caracas.

Not enough: Using the hashtag '#ServicioPublico', Venezuelans are pleading with foreigners to send them treatments for all manner of conditions - including blood disorders, viruses and infections 

Ill: Evelina Gonzalez  is on a list of 31 breast cancer patients waiting to have tumors removed at one of the country's biggest medical facilities, Maracay's Central Hospital. The hospital's physicians sent some 300 patients in need of cancer operations home last month

Every day several hundred people take to Twitter to beg total strangers for help in obtaining the medicine their loved ones so desperately need. The vast majority of these posts go unanswered, and those replies that are received are usually just messages of support or sympathy, not help.

Shockingly the crisis is only getting worse as Venezuela's economy  crumbles and a lack of foreign currency in the country means internal distributors have no way of paying international suppliers.

Medical shipments have dried up as Venezuelan pharmaceutical companies seek to pay off their combined debts of well in excess of $245 million, rather than bring in additional expensive products.

A black market in goods is understood to have been established, with drugs being smuggled in from neighbouring Colombia, but the supply ins't nearly enough to provide medicine for all who need it.

The only response from the Venezuelan government to the developing crisis so far had been to issue an directive stating: 'It is strictly prohibited for patients or their families to bring medicines or medical supplies for their treatment, even if hospitals don't have the necessary supplies.'

The government is said to have clamped down on hospitals discussing the shortage of medical supplies and there were reportedly arrests made when protesters took photographs of a long queue outside a pharmacy in the capital.

This morning Venezuela's bolivar currency plunged during the debut of a new exchange rate system aimed at easing the country's crippling economic crisis.

The central bank said the bolivar averaged 170 to the U.S. dollar in the first day of trading on the new market where businesses and individuals can circumvent decade-old currency controls and now legally buy greenbacks. 

That compares with 6.3 and 12 bolivars per dollar for priority imports and 190 bolivars on the black market.

President Nicolas Maduro is counting on the new currency system to better allocate dollars that have become scarcer as a result of a plunge in oil prices.

But economists say that with fewer dollars overall entering Venezuela shortages will remain widespread and inflation already running at over 60 percent could worsen.
