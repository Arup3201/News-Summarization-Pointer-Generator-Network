She is the fair skinned fashion blogger whose time on reality TV show Made in Chelsea has made her synonymous with on-screen drama and friendship faux pas.

But now Rosie Fortescue is ready to be taken seriously and is using the positive (and the negative) comments to make her mark on the fashion world.

With her highly successful fashion blog At Fashion Forte about to be launched as a smartphone app and a place on the panel of styling website Just Fab, Rosie has the fashion world at her feet.

Made in Chelsea star and blogger Rosie Fortescue is focusing on her true passion for fashion

'I always watch Gossip Girl and 90210 and you can never find out what outfits the stars are wearing so I set up my blog so viewers can access the outfits I wear on the show.

'I get lots of comments and questions about what I wear and also what make-up I use for my pale skin so I wanted to create something accessible for viewers. It's all so exciting and happening so fast,' she told MailOnline.

The star firmly established herself on the e4 show but after putting herself in the public eye and showcasing her drama filled life for millions of viewers every week, the 22-year-old has finally learnt to deal with the public negativity.

She said: 'Twitter has calmed down a lot. There are often offensive comments but we've all learnt to be strong and tolerant and now we deal with it.

No stranger to the spotlight, Rosie is now on the panel of styling site Just Fab and has plans to turn her blog into an app

'We have realised that the people who write that stuff are just looking for a reaction.'

But one thing Rosie is constantly complimented on, by both viewers and her co-stars, is her immaculate sense of style.

'My style isn't very girly. I love tailoring, structuring and lines. You'll never catch me in puffy dresses, they don't suit me.

'But I've learnt what does look good one me, I know tailored trousers suit me and blazers. I love sexy pointed heels and you don't need to get your legs out to look sexy, it's all about how you feel in an outfit,' she said.

She particularly rates frenemy Millie Mackintosh's style. 'I think Millie dresses the best in the show. I think she and I have a similar style, we are both obsessed with hats.'

She really reates co-star Millie Mackintosh's style and says they both love hats

And as for the boys, she loves Mark Francis' style but think Ollie Proudlock is the one who can pull any look off with ease.

But one co-star whose fashion footsteps she won't be following in is Louise Thompson- who recently unveiled a clothing line with Goddiva.

'I don't think I'd do what Louise did. I am very specific about who I'd work with. If I did a collaboration I'd want full input and because I love fashion so much I'd never just take any opportunity that comes my way.'

Instead, Rosie is focusing on developing her app and relishing in an (almost) drama-free season of Made in Chelsea.

A love of fashion clearly runs in the family and her twin sister launched an underwear line called Cheek Frills

'This season is really fun. It's nice to be removed from the drama, I was only involved before because I was supporting Louise.

'The
dynamics have changed and my friendship with Millie has been a natural 
progression, we hang out outside of filming and have lots of mutual 
friends,' she said.

One
girl she won't be forging a firm friendship with is newcomer Lucy 
Watson who recently caused a stir by refusing to attend Rosie's dinner 
party with Jamie Laing and later showing up with his friend Andy Jordan.

'I don't have an issue with Lucy, we just aren't friends. I didn't know her before and I'd say were not at all similar,' said Rosie.

Rosie recently stepped out with a male friend but says she is a private person and wouldn't bring a boyfriend onto the show

While her co-stars are busily 
immersed in on-screen love triangles and drama, Rosie believes that love
should be something saved for when the cameras stop rolling.

'I am quite a private person and 
believe that you need to maintain something that is yours and yours 
only, someone to go home to.

'As for romance, well...we will have to wait and see.'
