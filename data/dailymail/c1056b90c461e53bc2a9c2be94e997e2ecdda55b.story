Her videos about sex, relationships, love, gender, life see viewers flock to her YouTube channel in their thousands. As well as having enjoying Emily Hartridge's tongue-in-cheek views fans get to relish a new 'pretend boyfriend' each week.

So as this week's offering about why men love women sees ex-athlete and TV presenter Andy Shepherd, 28, take the form of boyfriend, the video has unsurprisingly spurred almost 20,000 views.

'Andy is also a presenter and a really good actor so was a perfect pretend boyfriend. Also he's good looking which always helps,' said Emily.

This week, why women love men: Emily's hilarious videos get tens of thousands of views

Reason one, penises: Andy looks displeased as 'girlfriend' Emily cuddles up to his crotch instead of him

Emily's first reason that women love men in her video is 'the fact that they have penises'.

To illustrate her point with a 
sketch, she comes home from work and dismisses Andy's greeting instead 
opting to cuddle up to his crotch. 'I've missed you,' she says.

Her second reason is, bizarrely, that you can't get angry at men when they borrow your clothes. Viewers are treated to a scene in which Emily walks in on Andy wears a pretty blue dress while watching the television.

Her surreal scenes are intended for some 'much needed light entertainment', as her disclaimer reads. 'You might not agree with everything I say and that's fine,' she says.

Reason three is when a man smells good 'it is so intoxicating'.

'Sometimes if I walk past a guy on the street, who doesn't even have to be that attractive, if he smells good - that is me turned on,' she says.

'I call myself fairly independent, and I'm not the kind of girl to to rely on a man,' she says, but adds that she finds it sweet when a man tries to protect her and her out of harm's way.

Men are laid back: Unlike highly strung Emily who shouts at Andy when he offers her a cup of tea

Andy is seen shouting at her to get down and leaping to her rescue when she asks him to 'get that spider'.

Emily next points to men' take it or leave it approach to life. 'Women can sometimes be highly strung and overreact,' says Emily.

She also loves it when 'you talk about how much you love your sisters or you mum in front of us - it really works,' she says.

Reason seven is that 'men remind us of our dads,' says Emily. She quickly backtracks, looking around and saying, 'who said that?'

'There's something endearing about men having the ability to solve any problem just by throwing a ball,' she says. This is illustrated with a sketch of Emily complaining about their being nothing on TV and a ball being thrown at her.

Next we see Emily walking down the street in a modest buttoned-up shirt when Andy approaches her to compliment her on her 'great rack'. She appreciates his comment and states reason nine that women love men being that they are 'enthusiastic about bodies, even if we sometimes are not'.

Finally, her tenth reason is that women love it when men show their emotions.

'If a guy cries in front of you, as a woman you have just won the emotional lottery,' she says, as we see her initiate sex inappropriately as Andy cries over a deceased loved one.

She recently 
did a blind date for OK! Magazine and presents Jacked In for Virgin Media.
