Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel suffered yet another injury setback during his first appearance since joining AC Milan on a season-long loan deal.

The Dutch midfielder, who was forced into missing a large proportion of the 2013/14 season and the 2014 World Cup after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last September, limped out of his new side's encounter against Empoli in the 31st minute.

Van Ginkel will undergo medical testing on Wednesday in order for AC Milan to determine the extent of his ankle injury.

Blues starlet Van Ginkel sustained a serious injury this time last year while playing against Swindon Town 

News of yet another injury will come as a major blow to the 21-year-old.

The former Vitesse Arnhem starlet made just four appearances for parent side Chelsea before being shipped out on loan to Italy.

Jose Mourinho forked out £8million to make Van Ginkel his second summer signing after sealing a return to Stamford Bridge in July 2013.
