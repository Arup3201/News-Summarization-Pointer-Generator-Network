Russia sent a naval convoy to reopen a military base in the Arctic in support of Vladimir Putin's claims to vast energy riches under the ice cap

Russia yesterday sent a naval convoy to reopen a military base in the Arctic in support of Vladimir Putinâ€™s claims to vast energy riches under the ice cap.

The move comes the day after a ceasefire in Ukraine saw a major territorial advantage to his separatist supporters, and as Russia contests Canada, Denmark, Norway and the US for the right to exploit the mineral wealth of the Arctic.

The Arctic Circle is estimated to contain 22 per cent of global recoverable energy resources.

The base will also supervise the Northern Sea Route between Europe and Asia, viable since ice melted in the region.

The presidents of Russia and Ukraine said on Saturday that a ceasefire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists was holding up fairly well and they discussed urgent humanitarian aid for the shattered region.

Residents and combatants in eastern Ukraine welcomed the respite in a five-month conflict that has killed at least 2,600 people but said they did not expect it to last.

They also each accused the enemy of using the truce to rebuild their forces.

The presidents also expressed support for the full involvement of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a rights watchdog, in monitoring the ceasefire.

Envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatist leadership and the OSCE approved the ceasefire in Minsk on Friday as part of a peace roadmap that also includes an exchange of prisoners of war and establishing a humanitarian corridor for refugees and aid.
