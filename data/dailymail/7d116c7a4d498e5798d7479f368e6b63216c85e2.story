George Osborne received a treble boost yesterday – as shares hit a record high, government borrowing tumbled, and the Tories saw a modest 'Budget bounce' in the polls.

In the latest sign that a feel-good factor is returning to the economy, shares in Britain's biggest blue chip companies went through the 7,000 barrier for the first time.

The FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 60.19 points to 7022.51, giving a confidence boost to millions of savers and people with pensions.

All smiles: George Osborne, at Old Trafford today, received a treble boost - as hares hit a record high, government borrowing tumbled, and the Tories saw a modest 'Budget bounce' in the polls

Taking it in: The Chancellor, with former England and Manchester United midfielder Sir Bobby Charlton, can take satisfaction from a YouGov Poll that showed the Budget had been well received by voters 

The Chancellor was also cheered by a YouGov poll showing Wednesday's Budget has gone down well with voters.

The survey gave the Tories a two-point lead over Labour – reversing a one-point Labour lead in a similar poll carried out just before the Budget. It put the Conservatives on 35 points, with Labour on 33.

There was further good news for the Conservatives when official figures revealed that government borrowing fell by a third in February to £6.9billion, £3.5billion lower than it was in February last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Annual borrowing for the year to February stood at £81.8billion, 9.7 per cent lower than last year, leaving the Chancellor well on course to meet his updated target for cutting the huge deficit left by Labour. 

However the ONS was also forced to revise up the national debt after admitting an embarrassing £5.5billion miscalculation over the Government's bailed-out bank assets.

Mr Osborne also went on the offensive, publishing Treasury figures which suggest Labour would borrow a staggering £138billion more than the Tories if they seize power in May. 

He told the Federation of Small Businesses conference in Birmingham that Labour's plans were a 'clear and present danger' to the economy. 

He later told LBC radio that – unlike Labour – the Tories would start to pay down Britain's £1.5trillion national debt.

He said: 'It sounds like an abstract concept, the national debt. But it means this country has to spend billions on interest repayments that could be spent on services like the NHS – and it harms growth. If the Labour Party get in then the national debt will start to rise again. We would be sliding back into economic chaos.'

Yesterday marked the first time Britain's index of blue chip companies has breached 7,000 points since it was launched on January 3, 1984.

This is good news for investors and those with a pension.
