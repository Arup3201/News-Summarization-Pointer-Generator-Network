A Southampton father has found a novel way to get his children to change the loo roll in the toilet.

Ingenious Will Reid who has been trying to instruct his children, Beth and James on household chores decided that the only way his children would listen to him was if he posted the video online.

This is the first  in what he describes as a 'series of instructional videos to help them with life.'

'Obviously me telling them face-to-face is not working,' the exasperated father says.

'So I've tried to be creative and I've come up with the idea of using social media to try and reach you.

'This first instructional video is number one in the series – how to change the toilet roll.

'I know this is a difficult one so, James and Beth, please pay attention.'

He then turns the camera to a toilet roll holder with an empty roll on it before panning to a fresh, new roll on the window ledge.

Beginning his step-by-step instructions, the dad then says: 'The first thing you've got to do is you've got to find a new toilet roll.'

He means business: Will Reid filmed the video to show his children how to change loo roll. This is the first in a series of 'instructional videos'

The camera then pans down to the toilet roll holder.

'Second thing is, this is the toilet roll holder,' he continues.

'Now as you can see guys, there's an empty one already on there.

'So the first thing you have to do is remove this empty one,' he says, reaching out to the toilet roll holder.

'Like this,' he says, demonstrating how it's done as he slips it off the holder.

The camera zooms in on a close-up of the fresh loo roll on the window ledge 

The offending item: The empty loo roll holder waiting to be restocked. The video received over 200,000 views in three days

Speaking in utmost seriousness, he continues with his guidance.

'And then we take the toilet roll.' At this point the camera pans to the top of the window ledge and the father's hand is seen reaching for the roll.

The camera then pans down again, as he says,' And we place it on there,' as he slides the fresh new roll onto the toilet roll holder.

'Like that,' he exclaims in tones of triumph.

But the father hasn't finished with his instructions as he goes on to tell his children that there is one more step to the task. 

Demonstration: Will Reid takes off the loo roll and ends the instructional video by thanking his children for watching

'Make sure you watch that a few times as the advance level would be to take the empty toilet roll holder and put it in the bin,' he says drily.

'But I feel that might be just a step too far at the moment,' he says, bringing the camera back to his face, 'so we'll keep it as is at the moment.'

'Thank you very much for watching.'

The video was first posted on a private family group before being publicly shared online.

'My kids said this wouldn't go world-wide as no one would be interested! I guess there are other parents out there that feel the same as I do', he posted on YouTube. 

'I jokingly said to my kids that I would post it wider if they didn't start being more tidy,' Mr Reid told Storyful. 'They said to go ahead as I wasn't funny and no one would be interested.'

The clip however has gone viral, receiving over 200,000 views in three days.
