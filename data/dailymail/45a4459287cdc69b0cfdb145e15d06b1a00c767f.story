The number of Americans who see illegal immigration as the nation's most pressing problem has spiked from 3 per cent to 17 per cent since May, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.

That percentage now tops government corruption, the U.S. economy, jobs, health care and every other hot-button issue, driven by a flood of tens of thousands of illegal immigrant children pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border.

When Gallup announced the results of the same poll in two months age, 'immigration' and 'illegal aliens' ranked eleventh out of 47 issues, attracting a deep level of worry from fewer Americans than those who put homelessness or foreign aid at the top of their lists.

One in six Americans now say 'illegal aliens' are the most important U.S. problem, judging from the language Gallup used in its telephone surveys of more than 1,000 adults

But since then horror stories about children of all ages crossing illegally into the United States, most of them accompanied only by mercenary 'coyotes,' have dominated national news.

American taxpayers are on the hook for costs associated with housing, feeding and legally processing the minors.

'The numbers have doubled since 2011,' Catholic Relief Services regional director for Latin America Richard Jones told a U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday.

Gallup found that growing concerns about illegal immigration are largely driven by Americans in western states, where 24 per cent say it's the most pressing U.S. problem.

Wednesday's spike nationwide is at its highest since 2006, when the U.S. Senate debated and passed President Obama's comprehensive immigration reform bill – which has yet to have a hearing in the House of Representatives.

Obama is now asking Congress to authorize $3.7 billion in new spending to respond to the border crisis, money that Republicans are reluctant to approve since little of it would be earmarked for strengthening border security.

Some Democrats in recent days have seemed to welcome the deluge of 'unaccompanied alien children,' the term used by the Department of Health and Human Services.

'We are all connected. We can't just build a wall or a fence and say no more,' Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis tweeted on Tuesday. 'This is America. Our doors are open.'

Most politicians on the political left are pointing to Obama's languishing legislative proposal as the answer. His plan would stop immigration officials from pursuing the deportation of millions of existing illegal immigrants, instead focusing resources on intercepting new border-jumpers.

'Our nation’s immigration system is broken, which requires genuine, comprehensive reform,' tweeted House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat.

The question of what to do with more than 400 Central American children who reach the U.S. each day while they wait to see an immigration judge has become a heated one, with state after state declining to bear the financial burdens beyond what the federal government is willing to pay.

Concerns about communicable diseases have made those concerns all the more newsworthy.

Connecticut became the latest state to say 'no mas' on Tuesday, refusing to open a largely decommissioned facility for developmentally disabled adults.

The institution was slated to house 2,000 child immigrants.

Anti-immigration activist Judy Lairmore was one of about 300 people protested the arrival of buses carrying illegal immigrants on Tuesday in Oracle, Arizona, where they were to be housed

President Obama has borne the brunt of anger from many Americans, especially those in western states, who have become impatient with a government they say is catering too much to immigrants who cross the border illegally

In the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, which has absorbed at least 600 such children, public schools and hospitals are stretched to their breaking point.

Mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy told Fox25 in Boston that 'it's gotten to the point where the school system is overwhelmed, our health department is overwhelmed, the city's budget is being substantially altered in order to accommodate all of these admissions in the school department.'

More than 600 new students have enrolled in public schools since May, including 248 from Guatemala – 126 of whom are illegal immigrant minors.

'Many of them [will] do two years in the ninth grade,' the city's school superintendent said, noting that a large number are illiterate.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to open up his city's services to illegal immigrant children, drawing the ire of homeless advocates who say Angelenos living on the streets need help first.

In Westminster, Maryland, a building that will soon be the site of temporary child housing was defaced with graffiti on Saturday.

'NO ILLEAGLES HERE. NO UNDOCUMENTED DEMOCRATS,' read the spray-painted scrawl, according to the Associated Press.

The exterior wall was partially repainted this week

But most of the temporary housing is being set up in border states like Texas, where the Baptist Child & Family Services charity has received a $50 million federal government contract to purchase and operate a Texas resort hotel as a 600-bed luxury detention center for children who have just snuck into the U.S. from the south.

The property features two swimming pools and a tennis facility.

The Americans for Legal Immigration PAC has organized more than 170 protests nationwide for Friday and Saturday, attracting Americans upset with President Obama for accommodating the influx of new immigrants.

The administration is hampered by a 2008 law that requires the federal government to offer temporary housing to children from 'OTM' countries – those 'other than Mexico.' The measure was passed in order to provide relief to minors fleeing human traffickers and sexual slavery.

Republicans in Congress say granting Obama's latest funding request should be predicated on a change in that law so the U.S. can immediately deport such children, as it already does with Mexican nationals.

They also allege that the White House's sudden immigration policy shift in 2012, which delayed the deportation of people brought to the U.S. as children before 2007, sent a message that the U.S. will welcome children regardless of their legal status.
