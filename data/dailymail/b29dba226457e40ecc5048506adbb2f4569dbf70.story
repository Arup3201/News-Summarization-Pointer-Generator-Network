Oreo has come under fire for sending a tweet containing the n-word - before promptly deleting it.

Just before 11.30pm on Sunday, Oreo sent an automatically generated tweet to a user called F***ING N*****, meaning that it included the offensive name in its message.

'@F***INGN***** Sweet! Check here for a chance to get a free pack of one of our new limited editions,' it wrote.

Twitter users spotted the offensive term and sent a slew of shocked responses.

Offensive: Oreo tweeted to a user called 'F***ING N*****' on Sunday night - before 
promptly removing the message. Oreo said that the mistake occurred after using an
 'auto-reply feature' during a giveaway

'This is why you don't use auto tweets,' one user wrote, while another added: '@Oreo hey dumb a** watch who you [retweet]'.

A spokesperson told MailOnline that an 'auto-reply feature' was to blame for the mistake.

'Last night, tied to an online brand promotion, we offered consumers the chance to be among the first to try our new U.S. limited-edition cookie flavors,' she explained in a statement. 'As part of this, we utilized an auto-reply feature which acknowledged consumer tweets as they came in.

'Unfortunately, a response was inadvertently sent to a Twitter handle which contained offensive language. As soon as we became aware of this, we immediately removed the post and apologize if anyone was offended.'

The Oreo Twitter feed indeed sent the same message to hundreds of followers.

Twitter does not have its own function
 to automatically retweet or respond to followers, but a third party 
website can be used to set this up.

The function is used to provide a quick answer to followers when they ask a structured question but Twitter warns on its support pages that it will deactivate accounts that send spam messages through these third parties.

It's not the first Twitter feed to come under fire for using the offensive term.

Last October, senior White House advisor San Pfeiffer spark outrage after he accidentally wrote the n-word instead of 'bigger' in a tweet.

Pfeiffer was responding to a post from Johnathon Martin early Tuesday morning when he tweeted: '@jmartNYT also a much [n-word] factor on the right.'

Pfeiffer apologized soon after, clarifying that the racial slur was obviously 'a horrendous typo'.
