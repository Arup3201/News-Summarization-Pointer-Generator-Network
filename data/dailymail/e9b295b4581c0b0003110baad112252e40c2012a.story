A top climate change expert at the Environmental Protection Agency has admitted to defrauding the government out of more than $900,000 by claiming he was an undercover CIA agent so he didn't have to show up for work for months at a time.

John C. Beale, 65, was the agency's highest paid employee and reported directly to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy during most of the 13 years he ran the scam.

NBC News reports that no one at the agency questioned or looked into his claims that he was working undercover for the CIA. He left the office for weeks or months - claiming he was at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or in Pakistan working on covert missions.  

Really, he was home reading, riding his bicycle or doing housework. Sometimes he escaped to his vacation home on Cape Cod, prosecutors say.

He billed taxpayers for 33 plane flights between 2003 and 2011, including personal trips to London and California, which he flew first class. He stayed in five-star hotels and billed the government for expensive meals and limo rides. The total cost: more than $266,000.

He also publicly 'retired,' but managed to continue drawing his $206,000 salary for 18 months - despite brazenly throwing a retirement party for himself that was attended by McCarthy.

EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was Beale's boss during most of the 13 years he allegedly committed fraud

He even lied and said he had contracted malaria while serving in the Vietnam War in order to get a handicapped parking spot. He neither had malaria nor served in Vietnam, according to prosecutors.

EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan told NBC that Beale perpetrated a 'crime of massive proportions.'

In October, Beale admitted to the shocking fraud. Prosecutors are asking for a 30-month prison sentence, but defense lawyers say the judge should give him leniency because he suffered from a 'highly self-destructive and dysfunctional need to engage in excessively reckless, risky behavior.'

Sullivan, who investigated Beale, said he believes the culture of the EPA made it ripe for this sort of fraud.

'There’s a certain culture here at the EPA where the mission is the most important thing,' he told NBC.

'They don’t think like criminal investigators. They tend to be very trusting and accepting.'

Beale is a Princeton-educated 'senior policy adviser' who worked as one of the EPA's top climate change experts.

He
 helped rewrite the Clean Air Act in 1990, led EPA delegations at 
climate change conferences in 2000 and 2001, and helped negotiate carbon
 emissions agreements with India and China.

Sometime along his career, his work stopped being enough.

He was caught only after McCarthy, who was appointed EPA administrator in July, discovered that he was still on the payroll in March 2012 - nearly six months after his retirement party.

She called for an investigation, which led to the criminal charges. Beale didn't actually retire until this April.

Beale is married to Nancy Kete, who President Barack Obama appointed the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. She is currently managing director of the Rockafeller Foundation.

The couple own a $872,000 townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, and a $626,000 vacation home on Cape Cod.
