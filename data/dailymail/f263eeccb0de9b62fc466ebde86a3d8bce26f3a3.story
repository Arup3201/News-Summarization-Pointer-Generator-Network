Critique: Wolf Blitzer said government should delay Obamacare until website is fixed

Wolf Blitzer has hit out at the White House over the launch of Obamacare saying the health insurance marketplace is not ready for the programme.

The CNN anchor urged the government to listen to advice from the Republican party and hold off on the health insurance scheme until the website providing the care cover plans work properly.

Since the launch on October 1, the state website Healthcare.gov has experienced problems which has resulted in thousands left unable to sign up for affordable health cover.

‘If they weren’t fully ready, they should accept the advice that a lot of Republicans are giving them.

'Delay it another year, get it ready, and make sure it works,” Blitzer said on CNN yesterday.

‘They know how to do it, but if they didn’t get it ready on time, then maybe fix the problem and make sure people don’t have to worry about it,’ he added.

Despite efforts by thee Health and Human Service Department to fix HealthCare.gov and other associated websites glitches have frustrated millions of consumers unable to complete their applications.

The website problems gave Republicans reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’.

'Americans have seen once again that Obamacare is not ready for prime time,' Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, said in a statement on Friday.

'A dysfunctional website is the least of that law's problems,' he added.

The government made an attempt to turn the online issues into positive coverage, blaming the glitches on high demands.

'Americans are excited to look at their options for health coverage, with record demand in the first days of the marketplaces,' said the release announcing the planned fixes.

The statement was headlined: 'Health Insurance Marketplace Open for Business - Week One Success.'

The
 state-level markets were designed to be the gateway to health insurance
 for people who don't have access to coverage on the job.

Middle-class
 consumers will be able to buy government-subsidized private plans, 
while the poor and near-poor will be steered to Medicaid in states 
agreeing to expand the program.

Glitch in the plan: The launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace has not been a smooth ride for Obama

Federal
 and state websites experienced problems this week. Some states, 
including Maryland, have also announced they are scheduling repairs.

The
 federal site, which serves 36 states, drew millions of users, an 
indication of strong consumer interest.

Yet many people were unable to 
get on the site. They encountered a screen that told them to wait, and 
they did, sometimes for hours.

Refreshing the screen only sent them to 
the back of the line.

Quite a
 few got hung up trying to create security questions to protect their 
accounts. The drop-down menus providing the questions would not 
populate.

As a result, 
consumers could not advance through the application process and learn if
 they were eligible for a tax credit to help pay premiums, much less 
pick a plan.

Some who did make it through were timed out because they took too long comparing plans.

To
 add insult to injury, the first days of Obamacare saw a lukewarm 
interest in signing up for cover.

California, the ultimate blue state 
whose federal lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of Obamacare, 
turned less than 1 per cent of its Web visits into 'Covered California' 
participants on Tuesday.

Connecticut
 saw a similarly low rate of interest with 28,000 visitors, and took 167
 applications for health insurance, indicating just 0.59 per cent of 
Connecticut residents who sought information about their state's 
Obamacare program on Monday decided to become part of it.
