In 1890, Queen Victoria was on the throne, Preston North End won the Football League, and Mrs Spicer laid the foundation stone of the the James Spicer Memorial Church Hall School, in Chingford, north-east London.

But after years of its congregation dropping, it closed and was bought by a Brazilian interior designer, Gianna Camilotti, and, as these incredible pictures show, was turned into an astounding home and office.

Ms Camilotti, who was raised in Italy, converted the Grade II listed church after falling in 'love at first sight' with the building.

Ms Camolotti, who was raised in Italy, says she fell in 'love at first sight' with the 124-year-old church, which served as a school and meeting place for decades

Using her skills as an interior designer, she transformed the Grade II listed church building into a luxurious home and office, fitting her bedroom with an arched mirror

Better than an organ: The piano in Ms Camolotti's decadent , open plan living room has a self-playing function so she has some company while she works

When she first visited the church it was in a worn-out state.

But Ms Camilotti she saw the potential the gothic building, which still had its original curved oak beams, vaulted shaped doors and elegant tall windows from when it was built in the 19th century.

She installed contemporary furniture and lighting by Italian designers, plus some items, such as the large sofa in the lounge, cushions and dining table, which she designed herself.

Speaking of the first time she saw the church, the interior designer said: 'I'd been searching for a house of my own for months and here it was. Love at first sight. It was magic.

'From the start I had in mind a house that shouldn't only be beautiful, but the perfect place to work and have fun.

'In a way, it's the same sensation I've experienced throwing colours onto a white canvas. In this case, the church was my white canvas because when I arrived it was just the floor, walls, a tall ceiling and nothing else.'

The long L-shaped sofa in her huge living room is perfect for relaxing in the evening, and the TV lies in front of the building's 19th century arched windows

Ms Camolotti converted the church but kept some of the features, such as the windows seen here, juxtaposed against the glass panel see-through walls by a bedroom

Walking downstairs, Ms Camolotti comes out into the open plan living space which includes a modern kitchen. The grand wooden beams can be seen on the top floor

The long table, which Ms Camilotti works from, can be turned into a dining table which seats 12 - perfect for hosting friends for a dinner party or piano session

After months of restoration, the former church school, where children had been taught the three Rs and the organ thundered out the hymns of John Wesley, was finally ready as modern, luxury home.

The house is kitted out with a self-play piano, to give Ms Camilotti some entertainment while she works, a long L-shaped sofa and a large TV, which sits in front of the arch windows that remain from the old church.

Also installed is an extra long table for work which, when necessary, becomes an elegant dining table that seats 12. 

Because the church, like many, is quite dingy, Ms Camilotti has filled the rooms with concealed lighting and spotlights.

The church requires 106 lights, including 15 placed outside in the garden, which glows red in the evening.

Flowering shrubs are set against the brickwork which is now clean from the grime of smoky chimneys. 

The building's ceiling is nine metres high, and 11 when the loft is included, but Ms Camilotti, who has restored churches in the past, says the ceiling is lower than usual.  

The bedroom, complete with tiger print pillows and throw, looks onto the living area from nearly nine metres above, and still has the wooden beams from the original build

Ms Camilotti said she was inspired by her travels to France, as well as remote places in Italy. She added that she was going for 'a Mediterranean atmosphere'

Ms Camilotti said: 'I am so pleased with the way it looks. I have never owned a property with low ceilings, but I must admit, this was a challenge. And I've always loved a challenge.

'I named the house 'Everybody' because it can accommodate up to 18 people. And, it looks impressive' 

'From the start I had in mind a house open to friends, to enjoy cosy dinners and karaoke parties that had an atmosphere of London piano-bars and I think I have achieved it.' 

Speaking of the garden, she says: 'I was inspired by memories of travels to France as well as remote places in Amalfi, Italy with its lavender in flower, olive trees and bistro-style chairs - in other words, a Mediterranean atmosphere.'

To preserve the late Victorian origin of the building, the weathered foundation stone is still in place, declaring that is was a Mrs Spicer who officiated on behalf of her late husband on a cold January day in 1890. 

'She would probably have blinked seeing the colour and softness compared to her world of Victorian drabness.' Ms Camilotti said.  

Every year around thirty church buildings in the UK fall into disuse.

Falling attendances, changing social patterns and merging of parishes, all contribute to the widespread closures. 

Many are declared redundant, no longer required for regular public worship, but some re-emerge as art galleries, coffee shops and places of work. 

The interior designer kept the original foundation stone, laid on a cold January morning by a Mrs Spicer - widow of James Spicer who the church hall was named after

 The church, like 30 others every year, fell into disuese. Some are turned into coffee shops, art galleries or officers. This one was turned into a luxurious, modern house
