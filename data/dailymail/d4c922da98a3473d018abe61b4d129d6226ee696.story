Meet Adolf, the poor Chihuahua puppy who is a canine dopelganger for  the Nazi German dictator.

With a patch of black 'fringe' and a tiny moustache, the eight-week-old dog bears such a resemblance to Adolf Hitler that he was named after the Fuhrer.

But his owner Claire Walsh from Gorseinon, Swansea, reckons nap-loving Adolf is a beauty.

Hairdresser Claire said: 'I put photos of them on Facebook, and some of my colleagues and other people started commenting about him.

'Everyone says he resembles an infamous World War Two leader.

'He looks like he's got a side parting, and there is a little mark on his nose which has gone black.'

'We have called him Adolf - although obviously, it is just tongue in cheek.

'We don't have any time for what Hitler stands for, but we can see there is a resemblance.'

Owners Claire and Niall Walsh from Gorseinon, Swansea, as well as their son Zak (pictured with Adolf) thought he beared such a close resemblance to Hitler they named him after him

The family is now looking for new homes for Adolf and his siblings - although Claire and husband Niall's son Zak, 11, has already grown attached to the young canine.

'Zak loves him,' said Claire. 'He is the cheekiest in the litter, and is full of character.

'One of the pubs has already gone, but we are still looking to find homes for the others.'

Claire said: 'I bred the puppies myself, and have been looking to sell them.'

But Adolf is not the only pet to bear a resemblance to his namesake.

In 2013, MailOnline reported on puppy Patch, a shih tzu and French bulldog cross from Walmgate, Yorkshire, whose black fur resembled the Nazi leader's trademark haircut and moustache so much he too had been nicknamed Adolf.

While in Belfast, it was Deborah Cochrane's goldfish George that developed a distinctive black mark above his mouth creating an uncanny resemblance to the fascist dictator.

George followed in the pawsteps of a string of cats who became nicknamed 'Little Kitlers' for the dark patches of fur below their noses.

The infamous 'Hitler house' which became an internet sensation in 2011 after comedian Jimmy Carr retweeted a photo of the building, saying 'here's a house that looks like Hitler'

The black and white cats, which have similar markings resembling Hitler's side parting and moustache, even have their own website- catsthatlooklikehitler.com.

But perhaps the most famous of all Hitler lookalikes is the house which is just four miles away from where Adolf the puppy lives. 

The end property on a terrace in Port Tennant went viral, after comedian Jimmy Carr retweeted a photo of the building, saying 'here's a house that looks like Hitler'. The lintel above the door echoes the toothbrush moustache of the Nazi dictator and the black sloping roof resembles his hair. 

This angry-looking black and white cat, which have similar markings to Hitler's side parting and moustache, is one of many that have appeared on catsthatlooklikehitler.com
