Incensed: Kate Humble says the public don't value their food enough and waste far too much

TV presenter Kate Humble has claimed food is not expensive enough.

The 45-year-old Lambing Live star accused the public of not valuing food because it was too cheap - and they were disconnected from the farming process.

Humble, who has presented popular science and wildlife programmes for the past 15 years, told the Guardian: ‘Food waste is endemic but we don’t value food because it’s not expensive enough.

‘Four pints of milk for a quid, are you kidding me? And the reason we can buy that without thinking of the implications is because we’re so disconnected from the land and farming process.’

But with food prices rising, the former Springwatch presenter’s comments may infuriate some.

Earlier this week, a charity claimed it had handed out than a million emergency food parcels last year.

Mrs Humble was speaking at her 117-acre former council farm in Trellech, Monmouth, which she runs with her TV director husband Ludo Graham.

Supermarket and restaurant prices are set to rise through the course of the year as food inflation outstrips general inflation.

She added: ‘Everyone’s going to hate me and call me a middle-class b**** but I’m past caring because I’m so incensed.’
