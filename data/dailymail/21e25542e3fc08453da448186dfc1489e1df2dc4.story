A Banksy artwork which was stencilled on a wall outside a cash-strapped youth club has been sold to a private collector for £403,000.

Mobile Lovers, showing a couple embracing while checking their mobile phones, appeared next to Broad Plain Boys' Club in Bristol in April.

The piece, attached to a piece of wood and screwed to the wall, was removed by members of the youth club with a crowbar.

'Mobile lovers': The stencil created by Banksy, that mysteriously appeared next to a boys' club in April, has sold for £403,000 to a private collector in the UK

Emerged: The artwork was completed overnight next to the Broad Plain Boys' Club, Bristol. It was identified as a Banksy piece when the artist posted an image on his website

Club owner Dennis Stinchcombe then moved the piece to a corridor and invited members of the public to come and view it, with donations optional. 

The  youth group, who needed to find £120,000 just to stay open after struggling due to the recession, insisted Banksy wanted them to have it and planned to sell the work to fund the future of the club - which has been open for 120 years. 

But within days, police removed the stencil and handed it to the city council, which put it on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery while its ownership was established.

The exhibition attracted more than 10,000 people in its first weekend.

'Blessing': After the artwork was moved to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, the club's owner Denis Stinchcombe received this letter from the artist, saying they could do 'what you feel is right' with the piece

However, Mr Stinchcombe then received a letter from the elusive artist, stating that 'as far as I'm concerned, you can have it'.

It read: 'As you know I recently painted on a doorway near the club. This was mean to be a small gift to the area but apparently a financial one would have been more useful. 

'I don't normally admit to committing criminal damage, but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought any time soon, you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece.'

The following day the city's Mayor George Ferguson received a similar letter confirming it was genuine.

After confirming the origin of the correspondence, Mr Ferguson tweeted: 'Just received confirmation by #Banksy that note to #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club is authentic. Great to have a clear resolution.

'Thank you Banksy': Members of the youth club designed this banner to show their appreciation to the graffiti artist. The future of the cash-strapped club was saved because of the sale of his stencil  

'As far as I'm concerned it [the artwork] now belongs to the club as I'd agreed once confirmation received from Banksy. 

After the announcement, the club started to receive offers from around the globe and today it was  sold to private collector in the UK - securing the future of the club.

'We are incredibly lucky to have Banksy donate their piece to our club,' Mr Stinchcombe told a packed press conference at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.

'Within 12 months we could have well been closed, which means 120 years of exceptional youth work in Bristol would have been lost.

'That would have been a tragedy for Bristol.'
