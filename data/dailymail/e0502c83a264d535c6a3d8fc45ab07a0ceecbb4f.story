Juventus have appointed former AC Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri as their new coach a day after Antonio Conte unexpectedly left the club.

The Turin side announced that Allegri 
will be presented on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the start of their 
pre-season training.

Conte, who was under contract with Juve for a further season, surprisingly stepped down on Tuesday just one day into the Bianconeri's pre-season preparations.

Much to ponder: Allegri has been out of a job since January, when he was sacked by AC Milan

Andrea Pirlo could be on the move from Juventus following the appointment of Allegri.

The Italy midfielder revealed he left AC Milan because Allegri did not consider him part of his first-team plans.

'The real reason why I left Milan was because Allegri wanted to use Massimo Ambrosini or Mark Van Bommel in front of the defence instead of me.'That meant that I had to change position on the pitch. So I said ‘no thanks’ to Milan and chose Juventus.'

The 46-year-old Allegri has been out of a job since being dismissed by Milan in January, with the Rossoneri in the midst of a nightmare season when they trailed Juve by as many as 30 points.

The difficult campaign at Milan does not appear to have damaged the coaching prospects of Allegri, who joined the San Siro outfit in 2010 after two successful seasons in charge of Cagliari.

The Tuscan-born tactician led the Rossoneri to the scudetto and the Italian Supercup in 2010-11, his first season in charge, and was voted by his peers as 2011's Serie A coach of the Year.

Conte led 
Juve to a third consecutive title in the 2013-14 campaign, the first 
time the club has achieved the feat since a five-season title run in the
 1930s.

Conte hinted that his departure was due 
to differences with club officials over the transfer market.

He 
reportedly wanted to sign highly priced players like Chile's Alexis 
Sanchez, who instead left Barcelona for Arsenal, and Colombia's Juan 
Cuadrado, who is still entertaining offers to leave Fiorentina, but the 
club didn't agree.

He
 is widely expected to become Italy's new coach. Cesare Prandelli 
resigned after the Azzurri exited the World Cup at the group stage in 
Brazil.
