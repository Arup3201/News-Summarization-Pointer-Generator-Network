She may have shot to fame on Made In Chelsea as a self-proclaimed 'player' known for her hilariously cutting rejections and cold-hearted attitude but Lucy Watson says she has a more sensitive side and wants her fans to see that.

The 24-year-old reality TV star has opened her heart and penned a dating guide, which she promises will be the modern girl’s no-holds-barred guide to 21st century dating, relationships and break-ups. 

Speaking to MailOnline about The Dating Game, she said: 'I haven't seen any book out there for girls, it's ridiculous. I've had quite a few relationships at a young age and I wish I'd had someone to give me advice. My book is like an older sister.'

Dating guru: Lucy Watson, who shot to fame on Made In Chelsea, has penned a new dating guide to help women 'find strength' and avoid being played

Lucy promises that her £12.99 book will give you the answers that your friends can’t, many of them learnt the hard way, as well as rules for first dates, social media, playing hard to get and relationship do’s and don’ts.

'I've learnt a lot and I want to give women the strength to do the right things. There's some funny stories in there from my past experiences and it's all extremely open and honest.'

Big sister: Lucy promises that her £12.99 book will give you the answers that your friends can't - many of them learned the hard way - and will act like your 'big sister'

While she appears thick-skinned on the E4 show, Lucy says that she's been left broken-hearted by past relationships.

'I have stayed in horrendous relationships,' she confessed. 'I've endured years of crying, losing weight, low confidence and ruined myself. I wish I had been stronger.

'I wish I had realised the right time to say to someone, "No, you're not good enough."

'I'm actually a real romantic at heart and I'll do whatever it takes to be with someone that I love.'

The book, which will hit shelves on May 22, will guide readers through the perilous world of first dates, falling in love, break-ups and the emotional minefield of exes, but most importantly how a strong woman playing the game should never be played - something Lucy now knows all about.

'Guys are really crafty and good at trickery; I don't want girls to fall for that,' she said.

Sharing her top tips for pulling a guy, Lucy said: 'A guy should always approach a girl and desperation is the biggest turn-off ever.

'Meet a guy somewhere other than in a club, you can't hear what they're saying and they're only interested in what you look like.

'Less is definitely more and caked on make-up is not attractive.'

One relationship Lucy is bound to open up about in the book is her on-off fling with co-star Jamie Laing.

On Wednesday's episode the pair had a heated discussion about the Candy Kitten’s entrepreneur’s recent behaviour.

You big flirt! Lucy, pictured with on-off lover Jamie Laing, as well as Proudlock and Mark Francis, said she always knew that Jamie wasn't the right guy for her

Meeting
 in a local café, a disgruntled Lucy had plenty to say about Jamie’s 
indiscretions during a trip to Miami with pal Spencer.

‘You said you loved me and you acted 
in a completely different way,’ she said. ‘I know if I said I loved 
someone I wouldn’t make another gesture and go away and sleep with other
 girls.’

Jamie responded: ‘I completely appreciate that me going to Miami and sleeping with another girl is going to hurt you.'

Lucy added: ‘You shouldn’t throw around the word love.’

Jamie looked bemused: ‘Why not?’

She replied: ‘Because you shouldn’t say it if you don’t mean it.’

Bright future: Lucy, pictured with Cheska Hull and Louise Thompson, has dreams of having her own TV show

Lucy tells us that she always knew it was never meant to be. 'It wasn't a relationship with Jamie, it was more of a fling. I always knew he wasn't the guy I wanted to be with and he proved me right.'

Lucy is currently single and 'trying to date', describing her perfect man as 'someone nice, tall, dark, handsome and amazing.'

She admits she hasn't met any nice male celebrities because they all have 'huge egos' but would love to land a date with 'incredible' Brad Pitt.

Aside from penning her debut tome, Lucy has been working on her jewellery line, filming for Made In Chelsea most days and planning for the future.

'I want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so maybe one day I will look into that.

'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said.

Welcome to The Dating Game, people. Way too often, girls fall for 
players who they know are going to screw them over, or they throw 
themselves at guys and wonder why they've never heard from them again, 
or they stay in dead-­end relationships because they are too scared of 
being alone.

These girls aren't strangers, they're me, they're my 
friends, they're all of us. But it's not our fault. Dating nowadays is 
seriously complicated and the more attached we get to someone the more 
confusing it seems to become.

That's why I decided to write this book. 
It's taken a lot of long and painful lessons for me to work out how to 
play the dating game and I've often wished someone could have just told 
me the rules from the start, before I had to learn them the hard way.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I've mastered them all or that 
I've got a perfect track record. In fact, as you will find out in this 
book, my experience of cheats, double betrayals and public scandals 
makes my record far from ideal!

But the dating mistakes I've made and 
the experiences I've had to go through have taught me that I won't put 
up with anybody who doesn't treat me the way I deserve, ever again. I am
 never going to settle for just any guy that comes along… it's got to be
 the right guy.

And, hopefully after reading my book, neither will you. 
It's about time that we learned how to play men at their own game. In 
The Dating Game, I've hopefully covered all the bases, from being 
single, to going on first dates and figuring out if he's that 
interested, to making a relationship work and even how to get over an 
ex.

I want to make sure that if we play the dating game properly none of
 us will be played ever again.
