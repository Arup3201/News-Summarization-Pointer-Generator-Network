Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood has denied he is interested in the current head coach vacancy at Newcastle.

Sherwood, who was Spurs boss for the final five months of last season, has been linked with numerous clubs since his departure from White Hart Lane.

However, despite being a leading candidate for the St James' Park hotseat, Sherwood insists he is biding his time until the right job becomes available.

'This one, for me, is not something I will be interested in,' Sherwood told talkSPORT.

'I want to make sure the next one [managerial job] is going to be the right one. I want to be picky, I want to be picking the right one.

'I am still a young manager and I think there is plenty of time for me. I don't want to rush back into the first job [offered]. I'm desperate to get back in but I'm not desperate for anything.'
