Victim of gunman's stray shot: Sabrina Moss died in hospital after she was shot while out celebrating her birthday

A nursery teacher gunned down on her 24th birthday in a botched gangland killing screamed 'I've been shot, I've been shot' as she cried for help, witnesses said today.

Sabrina Moss left a restaurant in Kilburn, north London, clutching a kebab, and was murdered by a gunman who was trying to kill someone else.

The mother-of-one died from a gunshot wound to the chest, a post mortem has revealed.

A 24-year-old female friend who was 
standing next to her was also shot.

She remains in a critical but stable
 condition in hospital but Scotland Yard has confirmed her injuries are no 
longer life threatening.

Staff at Woody Grill, where Sabrina bought her food, rushed to stem the flow of blood with napkins but she could not be saved.

The owner of the takeaway said: ‘I heard bangs but 
wasn’t sure what they were until the girls ran into the shop. Sabrina was screaming, “I’ve been shot, I’ve been shot".'

Detectives say she was an innocent victim who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Miss Moss, who leaves behind a four-year-old son, died in hospital from her injuries.

The two women are thought to have been gunned down by a man firing a shotgun from the other side of the road.

Yesterday forensic officers examined a car and the restaurant, which were both peppered with shot from the shotgun pellets.

Scotland Yard arrested two men, who have now been released without further action.

Last night Miss Moss’s parents John and Andrea paid tribute to their daughter.

In a statement they said: ‘Our family has been devastated by this horrific incident that has changed our lives for ever.

‘Sabrina was a fun-loving girl who made friends wherever she went. She was a lovely daughter and a perfect mother to her young son, whom she adored.

‘She cherished working as a nursery teacher and treasured working with the children, who undoubtedly will miss her dearly.’ 

Her mother added: ‘She had nothing to do with any gangs. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ Susanna Flavius, Miss Moss’s aunt, said the family were struggling to come to terms with their loss.

The 37-year-old care worker said: ‘Her mother is still in shock, she can hardly speak.

‘Her dad called me last night to tell me Sabrina had been shot.

‘Sabrina was really nice and really kind. She loved children.’

Mike
 Hillman, owner of Hillman Butchers which is next door to Woody Grill, 
said he saw  paramedics trying to save Miss Moss when he arrived to open
 his shop at 4.30am.

The 79-year-old said: ‘When I turned up the road was closed off and the police were in the process of taping off other areas.

‘There
 were around six police cars, two ambulances and an air ambulance 
vehicle. The barrier went around my shop and I was told to stay behind 
it. In a period of around five minutes I saw three girls come out of the
 kebab shop.

‘They were banging on the shutters, they were hysterical. The girl that was murdered was then brought out on a stretcher.

‘They had parked up across the other side of the road after a birthday party and came in next door to get food.’

Mike Hillman added: ‘Shootings don’t happen around here. There’s been stabbings, but
 guns are never used. It’s come as a shock to us all.’

As officers continued to search the area for clues, friends left an array of flowers and messages at  the scene.

One
 tribute read: ‘To my beautiful friend Sabrina. They took you away from 
us but we will be reunited one day. Rest in paradise my angel. Love you 
always, Natalie.’

Another note said: ‘RIP Sabrina, good friends are hard to find. I will miss you.’

Acting
 Detective Superintendent John Sandlin, from Scotland Yard’s homicide 
and major crime command, yesterday said: ‘At this early stage, I believe
 the two women were innocent parties who were caught in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.’

He 
appealed for witnesses or anyone ‘who saw anything suspicious in the 
Kilburn area’ to call the police, adding: ‘In particular, I need to hear
 from anyone who saw two males who came into the High Road from Messina 
Avenue and, after the shooting, made off on foot back along Messina 
Avenue.’

Anyone with information that might assist the investigation was asked to call the incident room at Hendon on 020 8358 0300. To remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
