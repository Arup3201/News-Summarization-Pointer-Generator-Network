An old Romanian woman sparked a police investigation after confessing on her deathbed to selling off one of her son's identical twin boys the day after they were born.

Teodora Maria was just 19 when she gave birth to the twin boys Nicolae and Alexandru at local hospital in Slatina, in south-west Romania's Olt County.

But a day later she was told by her mother-in-law, Maria, that Alexandru had died.

Teodora Maria holds up pictures of her son after her mother-in-law, Maria Maria, confessed to selling off his twin a day after he was born. She and her husband Gheorghe have launched an appeal to find the missing boy

Maria's son Gheorghe, the father of the twins, said he was shocked by his mother's confession

She told local media: 'I was only 19 and perhaps didn't understand things as well then as I do now, but I did think it was strange that I wasn't given any paperwork or the body.

'My mother-in-law Maria told me she was taking care of it all and she never handed anything over.'

But last week Maria Maria, 73, made a tearful confession to a priest and her family that the baby had not died, and that in fact she had sold him at birth to a childless couple.

She said that she had arranged it with her other daughter-in-law Niculina Maria, who worked at the hospital and helped forge the adoption documentation.

The remaining twin, Nicolae Maria, now a priest himself, said: 'I have often spoken to people who told me they had seen me somewhere that I never was. I believe they must have seen my twin brother and mistaken him for me.

'It means that even now we must look similar and I'm hoping that if he sees my picture, he will recognise himself and get in touch. Or if not at least somebody that knows him will contact me.'

The family have posted pictures of the remaining twin, Nicolae, on social media in the hope that if his twin Alexandru is still in the country he will recognized. They fear he may have been adopted abroad however

The family have posted Nicolae's picture on social media and released it to Romanian newspapers in the hope Alexandru will be recognised.

But they accept it's likely he might have been adopted abroad. Many Romanian babies were adopted by wealthy foreign couples before the practice was stopped under pressure from the EU.

After Maria Maria's confession, her son and grandson raced to question her more, but she died before she could provide any more details.

When the family spoke to police officers confirmed none of the documentation for Alexandru's death was in order and it seemed clear that the baby had not died on November 1, 1984, as they had been told.

In fact hospital records showed he was still at the hospital and being breastfed on November 4.

Denials: Niculina Maria, 51, Maria Maria's other daughter-in-law who she accused of being complicit in the sale of the boy. She has denied the allegations says she was as shocked 'as everybody else'

A police spokesman said: 'It seems that both babies were still there although the parents didn't know about it, and because they were identical twins who were only ever given to the teenage mother one at a time she didn't realise that they were both still alive.'

Niculina Maria, 51, Maria's other daughter in law who worked at the hospital and who she implicated in the sale of the child, denied any involvement.

'I am as shocked by my mother-in-law's confession as everybody else, and I can assure all of my family that I knew nothing about what she claimed,' she said.

At the time Niculina had been named as the godmother of the twins. She is allegedly the person who made sure Teodora was only given one twin at a time so she didn't realise both were still alive.

Maria's son Gheorghe, the father of the twins, said he was shocked by his mother's confession and is now leading a campaign to find his missing son.

Launching the appeal to find out if the boy is still alive he said: 'Alexandru, if you see your photo and your brother on television, please look for us so we can explain what happened.'

'We want him to find out the truth. We never gave him away, he was taken from us,' he said

Nicolae Maria with his family: Now a priest, he says he's praying every day for his brother to be found

Nicolae now lives in Spain with his family. He said that he is praying every day for his lost brother to be found.

'My family have now filed a missing person report even though it is 30 years too late,' he said.

Local police spokeswoman Claudia Radu said: 'I can confirm that the police have started an investigation and this will result in legal consequences.'

She declined to give more details.
