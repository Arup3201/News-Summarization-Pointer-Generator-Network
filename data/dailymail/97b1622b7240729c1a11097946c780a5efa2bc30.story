The Pope's butler has denied stealing private correspondence but admitted to betraying the trust of the pontiff, whom he said he loved like a son would his father.

Paolo Gabriele's trial for aggravated theft began today in a Vatican courtroom, with prosecutors claiming he leaked details of power struggles and corruption from papal documents to a journalist.

The 46-year-old has confessed to passing on information, triggering one of the most damaging scandals of Pope Benedict XVI's time in office.

But he told the court today that he was 'innocent concerning the charge of aggravated theft' although he felt 'guilty of having betrayed the trust of the Holy Father, whom I love as a son would.'

Papal problem: Pope Benedict XVI faced one of the most damaging scandals of his time in office after Paolo Gabriele, right in the Vatican courtroom, leaked information to a journalist

Gabriele also claims he was mistreated by police during his incarceration, and the judge has ordered prosecutors to investigate the allegations.

He says he was kept in a tiny cell at the headquarters of the Pope's police force, with the lights on constantly, which he said contributed to his 'psychological depression.'

He claims the cell he was kept in after his arrest was so narrow he 
could not stretch out his arms.

Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican 
spokesman, insisted that the size of the cell, and the conditions under 
which Gabriele was held for just over two months, conformed to international 
standards.

Explosive revelations: Gabriele said he passed details of power struggles and corruption to journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, pictured, to expose 'evil' within the Church

Vatican police arrested the father of three after 
they found a stash of papal papers in his Vatican City home. In all, 
police carted off 82 boxes of papers, though not all of them were papal 
correspondence.

Prosecutors have quoted him as saying that even
though he knew taking the documents was wrong, he felt inspired by the 
Holy Spirit 'to bring the church back on the right track.'

He apparently wanted to expose 'evil and corruption', adding: 'I was compelled also by my profound faith and desire that there should be light shed on everything in the church.'

Today is the first time the public have heard from
the butler himself about the events that landed him in a Vatican 
detention facility on May 23.

The trial opened over the weekend in
an intimate ground-floor room in the Vatican's courthouse behind St. Peter's Basilica.

On the opposite wall
from where he sat was a photo of Benedict, his boss, the victim of 
the alleged crime, and the supreme judge in the case.

As an absolute 
monarch, Benedict has full judicial authority in the Vatican city state 
and can intervene to stop a trial. He delegates that power to the 
three-judge tribunal, but he can pardon Gabriele and most expect he will
if there is a conviction.

Judge Giuseppe Della Torre has said he 
expects the trial to be over in about four more hearings.

Gabriele faces four 
years in prison if convicted.

The Pope's private secretary, Monsignor 
Georg Gaenswein, said he began having suspicions about Gabriele after he
realised three documents that appeared in the journalist's book could 
only have come from the office he shared with Gabriele.

Other witnesses will include one of the four consecrated 
women who care for the Pope's household, Cristina Cernetti.

Her testimony could shed light on the deeply private world of the small 
'papal family' who live, eat and pray together with the 85-year-old leader of the Catholic church.

The Pope's entourage returned to Rome on Monday after spending the summer in 
the papal retreat of Castel Gandolfo.

Gabriele has said he handed the 
documentation to Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, whose book 'His 
Holiness: The secret papers of Pope Benedict XVI', was published to 
great fanfare in May.

'Like father and son': Gabriele, right, at the start of the trial in the Vatican this weekend. He denies the charge of aggravated theft but says he feels he has 'betrayed' the Pope

An earlier Nuzzi book,'Vatican SpA,' was based on a
trove of damaging documents from the Vatican bank.

'His Holiness' contained dozens of 
reprinted letters and memos: some showed how wealthy donors scored 
audiences with the pope after handing over checks for 10,000 euros; 
others detailed the questionable relationship between Italian and Holy 
See politics, particularly concerning the tax-exempt status for 
church-owned real estate.

The most damaging letter reproduced in 
the book was written by the former No. 2 Vatican administrator to the 
pope, in which he begged not to be transferred as punishment for 
exposing alleged corruption. The prelate, Monsignor Carlo Maria Vigano, 
is now the Vatican's U.S. ambassador.Â

On the eve of Gabriele's testimony, 
Nuzzi - who revealed his source after Gabriele confessed - said he hoped
the one-time butler would make clear why he betrayed the Pope and 
risked so much to air the Vatican's dirty laundry.

'He did it because he saw through his 
own eyes that there were plots, stories and accusations of corruption, 
made by important monsignors, unclear relationships between states,' 
Nuzzi told Italian television TG5 on Monday.

'He thought that by making 
these dramatic stories known he would help bring about the transparency 
promised by the Holy Father.'
