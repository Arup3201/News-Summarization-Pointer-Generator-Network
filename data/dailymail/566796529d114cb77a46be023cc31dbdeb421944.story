A father-of-three claims he ‘would not be here now’ had he not travelled to Germany for an operation he was denied in the UK.

Dr Michael Barsby was initially told he had eight weeks to live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer almost a year ago.

He was told an operation would not be carried out in this country because of the risks involved.

Dr Michael Barsby, 42, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told that it was too risky to carry out an operation. He was given just eight weeks to live. His wife, Susan, then started researching other options

His prognosis improved to a 50 per cent chance of surviving a year once he started chemotherapy.

But 11 months on, he is cancer-free after a private operation abroad, researched by his wife on the internet.

Dr Barsby, 42, said: ‘The risks are the same as with any operation in that complications can lead to death.

‘I knew the risks but it was worth it. It was certainly better than the alternative.’

Now, Dr Barsby has shared his inspirational journey with the world in a four-minute YouTube photo diary, viewed more than 600 times in just over three weeks.

And he is determined to raise awareness and money to fund research into pancreatic cancer which has the lowest survival rate of any cancer.

The fitness enthusiast, who is married to Susan, 43, and has three sons Oliver, James and Christian, went to his GP last year after he developed sudden jaundice and was told he had the devastating disease.

Mrs Barsby discovered that surgery was available in Germany so Dr Barsby travelled out for surgery in February

UK medics said they would be unable to operate - the only way to completely cure the disease - because the tumour was wrapped around important blood vessels.

Instead, he was offered chemotherapy to try to delay its spread and started the process at The Christie in Manchester, but his wife continued to search for a cure.

Mrs Barsby found details of a woman whose condition had improved after having surgery, known as the Whipple procedure, in Heidelberg, Germany.

Dr Barsby, of Clitheroe, Lancashire, met with German consultants in January in a last-ditch attempt to overcome the cancer and was accepted for treatment to remove his pancreas, along with his spleen, gall bladder and part of his stomach.

The couple funded the operation, which cost several thousand pounds, themselves.

The Whipple procedure is generally only offered in the UK in cases where the cancer has shown no signs of having spread to other parts of the body.

It is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients.

It involves removing the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine, the gall bladder and part of the bile duct. In some cases, part of the stomach also has to be removed.

Once these areas have been removed, the end of the bile duct and the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the digestive system.

Dr Barsby also had chemotherapy before eventually being given the all-clear in August this year. It is now 11 months since his diagnosis

Dr Barsby, a GP in Burnley, underwent a further course of chemotherapy in May and was told that his scan had come back clear in August.

He said: ‘Being diagnosed was an incredible shock because I live a healthy life and had only just returned from a mountaineering holiday and felt fine.

‘I didn’t feel unwell but the 
psychological impact of knowing that my cancer had been deemed 
inoperable was devastating, yet we didn’t want to give up.

‘I
 didn’t dwell on the risks involved with the surgery and was just happy 
that they were prepared to operate on me because, if I hadn’t had it, I 
wouldn’t be here now.

‘I
 started to feel better around eight weeks after surgery and the second 
course of chemotherapy, and when the results of a scan in August came 
back clear, I knew that it had been worth it.’

He said that although the operation 
had left him diabetic and dependent on digestion medication for the rest
 of his life, he hoped he could be one of the 3.6 per cent of pancreatic
 cancer patients who survive for five years or more.

Dr Barsby is now diabetic and dependent on digestion medication but he says that he feels as though someone was looking down on him

Dr Barsby is hoping to be one of the just 3.6 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients who survive for more than five years after diagnosis

He
 said: ‘Whilst I am aware that only 3.6 per cent of people diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer ever recover, someone has to be in that 3.6 per 
cent and I am hopeful that I will be one of them and would tell other 
people who have been diagnosed to explore all available options.

The Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients.

It
 involves removing the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small
 intestine, the gall bladder and part of the bile duct.

In some cases, 
part of the stomach also has to be removed.

Once
 these areas have been removed, the end of the bile duct and the 
remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so 
that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the 
digestive system.

After this operation, around one in three patients need to take enzymes to help them digest food.

The Whipple procedure involves long and intense surgery, but is easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy.

‘My life has completely changed but I believe that someone was looking down on me.’

He allowed his wife to produce an emotional diary to help inform people about the condition and raise money to improve survival rates which have remained unchanged for the past 40 years.

He said: ‘Susan put the photo video online to share my story with as many people as possible because it’s still not well understood and it’s massively helped our fundraising efforts.’

Among those to have helped were Dr Barsby's football team, Mad Dogs, who took part in a 20-mile, nine pub walk to raise funds for Pancreatic Cancer UK.

A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘Surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured.

‘Because pancreatic cancer is usually advanced by the time it is diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20 per cent of patients.

‘If a tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels, surgery will not be a suitable option.

‘If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, then the patient will also not be recommended for surgery. This is because the risks of surgery often outweigh the potential benefits.’
