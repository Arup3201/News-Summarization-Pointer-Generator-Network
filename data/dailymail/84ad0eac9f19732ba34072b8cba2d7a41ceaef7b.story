Leaving lectures: Charlie Gilmour, wearing skinny jeans and a jumper, yawns on his return to Cambridge University

Finding it hard to stifle a yawn, this is Charlie Gilmour on his first day back at Cambridge University following his time in jail for his part in the student protests in London.

The adopted son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour served four months of a 16-month sentence after causing national outrage by swinging from a Union Jack on the Cenotaph.

The 22-year-old history student, who is at Girton College, was pictured leaving a lecture on the first day of term last week.

In skinny jeans and a jumper, Gilmour – who was carrying his lecture notes and looked like he had a smart new haircut – said: ‘It’s good to be back.’

He was in his second year at the university when he was pictured swinging from the Cenotaph during the violent student fees protests in London in December 2010.

He was also accused of throwing a bin at a convoy of cars containing Prince Charles, sitting on a protection officer’s car and smashing a window.

He was granted conditional bail so he could complete that year’s exams, then jailed for 16 months in July last year for violent disorder.

He was released from prison last November. In the summer he was banned from entering London during the Olympic Games.

Gilmour was adopted by the Pink Floyd star after his mother Polly Samson separated from his father, the poet Heathcote Williams.

Miss Samson married David Gilmour in 1994 and they have homes in London and West Sussex.Gilmour is in his third and final year at Cambridge.

Previously he attended £9,000-a-term Lancing College in West Sussex.

At the beginning of the week his mum, Miss Samson tweeted that her eldest son was heading back to university.

‘Today son No 1 goes back to uni. Has just asked me to “bag up his clothes." Cries forever,' she tweeted.

‘Final year. So what with that and other departures I’d hoped to manage a cheery wave this time.’
