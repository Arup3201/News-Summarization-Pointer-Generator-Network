When high street stores first started selling bras in the 1920s they were more about providing upholstery than uplift.

Today, as the nation’s men turn their minds to what to get their wives and girlfriends for Valentine’s Day, many will be looking for something racy and lacy.

New material released by the Marks & Spencer Archive gives a fascinating insight into how lingerie has moved from being functional, through comfortable, to the sort of skimpy patches of cloth that might make a pole dancer blush.

Racy: Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley is the face and body of M&S' current glamorous lingerie campaign

Demure: M&S's first attempt at bra design was white and functional

A lingerie collection by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the few success stories for the M&S clothing range of recent years – and she certainly wears it well.

However, generations of women of all shapes and sizes, not least Margaret Thatcher, have come to rely on M&S bras and knickers.

M&S first began selling bras in 1926 with a simple, unstructured, white bra with delicate ribbon straps, while the only adornment was a tiny pink rose at the V of the cleavage.

It was designed to suit the drop-waisted flapper style fashions that were the rage in the 1920s, as seen recently in The Great Gatsby and the latest series of Downton Abbey.

The demure creation marked the start of a new chapter in M&S’ history, which subsequently became famed for the quality and technology packed in to its lingerie.

The first uplift bras were introduced in 1932 under the slogan ‘A perfect figure guaranteed’, while the resourceful store made use of parachute silk in the 1940s to ensure no sagging in the morale of the nation’s women.

Bizarrely, until the 1950s most bra retailers failed to recognise that women came in different shapes and sizes and produced bras in just one cup size.

In 1951, M&S took the bold stance of introducing three - small, medium, large – and by 1953 the chain was selling some 125,000 a week.

Glamorous: Different sizes first arrived in the 1950s and bras could be bought in small, medium and large

Advanced: The first nylon smalls arrived in the 1960s, as did the first wash-and-wear styles

1970s style:  Cup sizes were introduced at the beginning of the decade as was the bikini knicker

The idea of the bra as a fashion statement emerged in the 1950s and M&S began offering a range with embroidered shoulder straps, which might be occasionally peak out from beneath a dress, in 1955. Further innovation brought the first front-fastening bras in 1958.

Advances in technology and the arrival of man-made fibres like nylon in the swinging 1960s allowed new innovations. 

In 1960, a lightweight range of easy to wash and dry bras, suspender belts and panty girdles became available. And in 1965, the first sheer nylon bra was introduced.

As England were winning the World Cup in 1966 M&S was winning its own high street battle with luxury bras including lace option in white, pink and blue. The range outsold all others.

While 1969 brought relief to women struggling with ill-fitting bras with the introduction of cup sizes A,B,C,D & DD.

Daring: Knitted nylon and fine knitted cotton meant that more delicate, racier styles could be introduced

Cheap chic: The first ever 99p bra was launched at M&S in 1978

The 1970s may not be renowned for its trend-setting fashions and style, however there was a revolution going on in stores and underwear drawers.

The hot summer of 1976 coincided with the launch of matching tiny bra and bikini brief sets in knitted nylon or fine knitted cotton, while 1978 brought the 99p bra, a front fastening plunge option made from nylon.

The idea of putting lingerie on display was something most retailers shied away from for decades, fearing embarrassment among customers, particularly men who were wandering through.

In took until 1984 for M&S to start displaying its ‘Feathers’ range on hangers rather than the traditional boxed packs on shelves.

The 1990s was dominated by the launch of practical designs. There was the first ‘mum to be’ collection, washable underwired bras and the first silk options which could be put in a washing machine.

Practical: While the 1970s saw glamour increase, M&S always kept a more practical selection in stock

Inspiration: Modern smalls such as those by Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley take inspiration from the '20s

The first T-shirt bra arrived in 1997, a time when fitness work-outs and jogging became part of the daily routine for millions of women.

In 2000, the M&S Secret Support range was introduced and went on to win the Queens Award for Innovation. The technology was fitted to T-shirts, tops and swimwear and allowed women to go without a bra at all.

Today, the new collection by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley consists of luxury lingerie sets and takes just a little inspiration from the time when M&S sold its first bras with 1920s inspired rose prints.

The 26-year-old British model and actress has proved to have something of a Midas touch with any products she is associated with, whether it is M&S or Burberry.

At the same time, any prudishness that restricted the promotion, advertising and display of lingerie in the past has gone for good.

The chain now promotes its ranges with video posters, moving billboards, that show the young actress turning and posing in front of a mirror wearing very little but a pout.

The lingerie sold by the chain through the years is being displayed at the store’s Marks in Time exhibition in Leeds ahead of Valentine’s Day.
