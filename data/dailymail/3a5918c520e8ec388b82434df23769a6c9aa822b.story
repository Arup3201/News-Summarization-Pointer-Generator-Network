Lucas Silva has been unveiled as a Real Madrid player following his £11.5million move from Brazilian side Cruzeiro.

The 21-year-old midfielder was introduced to the media at the Bernabeu on Monday afternoon after successfully undergoing a medical at Sanitas La Moraleja Hospital.

The news comes just three days after the Spanish giants snapped up 16-year-old Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard.

Silva, who has penned a deal until June 2020, had been heavily linked with Arsenal but the Brazilian opted against a move to the Premier League to sign for Carlo Ancelotti's side.

The highly-rated youngster is regarded as one of Brazil's most talented players, with Real president Florentino Perez hailing him as one of his country's best defensive midfielders.

Alongside Perez at his unveiling, Silva told the media: 'I've come here to learn and to help out.

'It's a dream come true and I'm very happy. I feel very ready to wear and honour this shirt. 

'This is the best club in the world and I'm going to be very happy.'

Silva, who will wear the No 16 shirt, could make his debut against David Moyes' Real Sociedad on Saturday, with Ancelotti forced to shuffle the pack following Cristiano Ronaldo's dismissal in the 2-1 win against Cordoba on Saturday.

Madrid will be pleased to have got a deal for the midfielder over the line after it was revealed earlier in the day  that FIFA have opened an investigation into the signing of two under-age players in 2012 and 2013.

Both Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with a host of clubs interested, but Madrid snapped them up before they could reach River Plate and Milan.

Madrid now have a month to file all relevant paperwork to FIFA and demonstrate they have not contravened the governing body's Article 14, which only allows the signing of under 18s from outside the EU if the player's parents have had to move to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons.

If found guilty, Madrid could be handed a transfer embargo similar to the one currently imposed on arch-rivals Barcelona.
