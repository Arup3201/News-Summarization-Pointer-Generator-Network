The Duchess of Cornwall made history today when she became the first female chancellor of Aberdeen University - and the only Royal to ever hold the post.

Camilla, known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, was honoured by the university with a formal ceremony as she officially accepted the position which dates back to 1860.

The Duchess said she was 'touched' and 
'honoured' by the appointment, and joked about being made chancellor of 
one of Britain's great universities, having left school at the age of 
16.

Camilla was greeted by glorious sunshine and nursery children waving the Union flag as she arrived at the university’s College Bounds.

Wearing a dark navy blue dress and pearls, she joined a procession of university dignitaries, including vice lord-lieutenant of Aberdeen Alison Skene and university principal and vice-chancellor professor Sir Ian Diamond.

Led by a piper, the procession wound through the grounds of King’s College to the university’s Elphinstone Hall where an audience of university alumni, staff and students gathered.

The Duchess, who follows two prime ministers into the historic chancellorship, was first awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Principle and Vice Chancellor Ian Diamond.

An installation speech was made by Colin Duncan, convener of the business committee of the university’s General Council.

Addressing the Duchess, he said: 'We know of your great interest in the life of the university already from the many visits you have undertaken here, and the time you have spent with our staff and students.

'We know also of your many links to the north-east of Scotland that this university is proud to serve and of your great love for the landscapes that border the River Dee which joins the sea in this city.

'Today with your installation as chancellor, those links are further cemented and we wish that you will derive great joy and fulfilment from the role for a great many years to come.'

The Duchess made a declaration of fealty to the university in Latin and was robed before presiding over the rest of the ceremony.

She paid tribute to the 'outstanding' service of her predecessor Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, who stepped down at the end of December having served as chancellor since 1997.

She revealed her husband the Prince of Wales had 'patiently coached' her in the recital of Latin required for the role. The Duchess also spoke of her connection to the local area.

Tradition: The University's role of Chancellor dates back to the merging in 1860 of King's and Marischal College to create the University of Aberdeen

'My father’s family, the Shands, hail from north-east Scotland, from Banff in fact,' she said.

'So this city is central to my Scottish heritage and has taken on an even greater importance now, because whenever I come to Scotland which, I’m happy to say, is frequently, it is in Aberdeen that my visit always begins. It is what I like to call my home port.'

She praised the university’s standing as a world class institution and hailed the new £60 million library, of which Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, was campaign patron.

'I hope very much to be able to encourage work done by the university to reduce illiteracy, an unimaginable handicap to those of us who take our ability to read and write for granted,' she said.

She added: 'I have talked of the university’s great past and I hope that, together, we may be part of what will be its equally great future.'

During the ceremony, the university’s King’s College chapel choir performed Blessing, a piece specially written for the occasion by composer Paul Mealor, who also wrote Ubi Caritas for the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Special occasion: The Duchess of Cornwall in her new role as Chancellor gives an Honorary Degree to Francis Mulholland at Aberdeen University

In her first duty as chancellor, the Duchess presented six honorary degrees to representatives of the arts, law, medicine and sport.

Those honoured included Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, Scottish Paralympic gold medalist Neil Fachie and Oscar-winning screenwriter Sir Ronald Harwood.

Honorary degrees were also bestowed upon former provost of Eton College Sir Eric Anderson; nutrition expert Professor William James and a retired physician and university lecturer Dr Audrey Dawson.

After the ceremony Camilla attended a reception in a marquee in the university’s grounds where she met staff, students and honorary graduates.

Fachie, the first Scot on the Paralympic team to win gold at London 2012 and a former graduate of the university, said he was overwhelmed by the honour.

'It’s the university where I studied in the city I grew up in so to be honoured here is very special.

'It’s very nerve-wracking, it’s more stressful than doing any race as it’s something you’re not used to, but it’s something I’ll never forget.'

He said he had shared his nerves with the Duchess after the ceremony. 'She asked what was next for me and asked me if I was nervous, because she was,' he said.

Mr Mulholland, also a graduate of the university, said it was a thrill and an honour to receive his degree from the Duchess.

He said: 'She spoke very well. It is obvious that she is very pleased to be appointed as chancellor. I am sure it will be very good for the university.'

The Duchess, who is the university’s 11th chancellor, was elected by the university’s graduate body, the General Council, in February.

The life-long role comprises ceremonial duties including awarding degrees to graduates at the end of each year.
