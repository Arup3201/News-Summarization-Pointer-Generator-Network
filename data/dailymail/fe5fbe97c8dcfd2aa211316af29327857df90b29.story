Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas was photographed having dinner with girlfriend Daniella Semaan as Manchester United dropped their interest the former Arsenal star.

Fabregas, 27, was spotted at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant in London as the midfielder was preparing to join up with Spain's World Cup squad.

The pictures emerged at the same time as the news that the new Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal does not want to sign either Fabregas from Barcelona or Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich.

Barcelona have hired a new manager themselves in recent weeks in the form of former player Luis Enrique.

His appointment comes after the departure of Argentine Tata Martino who failed to win any of Spain's three major trophies.

The ex-Celta Vigo manager could oversee a major overhaul of the playing staff in the summer and Fabregas is one of those at risk.

Both Fabregas and Kroos were targets under David Moyes but Van Gaal's preference is Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.
