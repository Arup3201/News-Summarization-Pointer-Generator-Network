Two drunken brothers assaulted a paramedic after calling 999 to report 'poisoned beer'.

Michael, 53, and Anthony Donnelly, 52, requested emergency medical assistance after claiming their lager had been spiked at a pub in Withington, Greater Manchester.

Three ambulance staff went the pub at around 4am but after first verbally abusing a female member of staff, the pair then set upon a male paramedic, punching him in the groin and the face.

The brothers, who live together in nearby Oldham, were sentenced to a four-month curfew between the hours of 7pm and 7am and have been ordered to pay £100 compensation and £400 in costs.

They initially denied assaulting the rescue worker but were found guilty by magistrates.

The paramedic was assaulted as he squatted in front of the men and attempted to stop them verbally abusing his female colleague, the magistrates were told.

Michael Donnelly then punched the paramedic in the groin, winding him.

The victim pushed Michael Donnelly away in self-defence but Anthony Donnelly then joined in, punching him in the face.

The paramedic suffered cuts to his chin but was able to help restrain the pair until police arrived.

During sentencing, the brothers repeated their claim about 'poisoned drink'.

Michael Donnelly told the hearing: 'On the day of the incident, me and my brother suffered a poisoning and we phoned the emergency services for medical assistance.

'As a result of that we have ended up in court and in the dock. We only had four pints of Fosters lager. We were there for four and three-quarter hours. I was unconscious at the bus stop 400 yards away. We were both unconscious. When I came about I phoned them (the ambulance service) on four occasions.'

Anthony Donnelly said: 'I regret striking the paramedic, it was because my drink was poisoned, so it was beyond my control.'

The North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust said it backed tough action against anyone who assaulted staff.

Derek Cartwright, from the service, said: 'It is totally unacceptable that violence is directed towards our staff. The trust does not tolerate abusive behaviour of any kind, whether physical or verbal.'
