The Mississippi martial arts instructor who tried to frame an Elvis impersonator of sending ricin-laced letters to the President has tried to change his original guilty plea by saying that he wants a chance to prove his innocence.

James Everett Dutschke pleaded guilty in January to sending the tainted letters to Obama as well as Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland.

He was set to be sentenced Tuesday in Aberdeen, Mississippi but when he was in court, he told U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock that he is innocent and wanted a chance to prove it.

Dutschke argued FBI agents and federal
 prosecutors committed perjury, specifically regarding his DNA allegedly
 found on a dust mask.

Dutschke said he was making a harmless organic fertilizer not poisonous ricin.

He
 was so confident that the substance was harmless that he offered 
prosecutors a 'free shot' by letting him eat the remaining substance 
that's in evidence.

'I will 
dump the contents of the two remaining letters on a peanut butter 
sandwich and eat it and wash it down with a glass of chocolate milk,' 
Dutschke said.

Chad Lamar, the chief federal prosecution in the case, said there was not perjury.

'The
 defendant is simply mistaken,' Mr Lamar told Judge Aycock.

Hoping for freedom: James Everett Dutschke originally entered a guilty plea for sending ricin-laced letters to the President and other officials but said in his sentencing on Tuesday that he wants to change that (pictured in April 2013)

'The mask he threw in
 the coffee grinder box was the mask that tested positive.'

Aycock did not rule immediately, saying she would look at arguments from the defense and prosecution.

'Your filing the motion to withdraw does not necessarily mean the court will grant it,' Judge Aycock told Dutschke.

'I do want you to understand that your withdrawal is in the discretion of the court.'

She said she will likely hold a hearing before ruling on Dutschke's request.

The ricin case drew national attention not only because of the threat to the President but also because of the internal small-town dynamics at play in the subsequent investigation.

Prosecutors in that case said Dutschke was trying to frame Paul Kevin Curtis, a longtime enemy and Elvis impersonator, who was briefly jailed before Dutschke was jailed in his place.

The ricin charges are separate from three cases where he admitted to inappropriately touching three young girls who were students at his martial arts studio in Tupelo, Mississippi.

Today's court appearance and his attempt to change his plea in connection to the ricin plot is not expected to have an effect on his admission of guilt for fondling three girls, who were 8- to 10-years-old when the incidents occurred from 2007 to 2013.
