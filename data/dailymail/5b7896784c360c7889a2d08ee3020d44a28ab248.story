If you're still holding out hope that you might be part of the 'millionaires' club' one day, then you may be disappointed by a new report which claims the average Aussie  takes 97 years to hit the big money.

While Australia has over one million millionaires in the country, the situation is pretty bleak for ambitious fat-cats.

According to the report, the median Australian adult was worth more than $200,000 in June 2012, the highest in the world for the fifth consecutive year.

However, despite our financial stature on the world map, the latest Global Wealth Report from Credit Suisse, is sure to put a dampener on aspiring Australian's, who were hoping to be part of the glitterati one day.  

Money expert, Michelle Hutchinson from finder.com.au, says many Australians would struggle to enter the millionaires market, going by current statistics and trends.

'The average Australian adult earns $1,516.90 per week and saves just 9.4 percent, which is worth an average of $142.60 in savings per week,' Ms Hutchinson said.

The site's Millionaire Calculator estimates that an average 30-year-old Aussie who is saving $142.50 per week would take 97 years to become a millionaire. 

The financier praised Australians who were growing richer and recognised Australia's rank compared to many other nations  however she believes it is becoming harder for Australians to save.

Interestingly, those who live in a capital city are likely to save 21 percent more than those living outside capital cities. 

'Many Australians are growing richer and it's great to see that we rank high compared to many other nations, she said.

'There are a lot of Australians who would struggle to reach the 'millionaire's club', with the wealthiest 20 percent of households in Australia accounting for almost two-thirds (61 percent) of total household net worth – an average net worth of $2.2 million per household. 

Not surprisingly, baby boomers are the wealthiest people of the nation. 

In 2011-12, households aged between 55 and 59 years  held the highest average net worth of just over $1 million. 

This was put down to the fact that many of the people in this age bracket were nearing the end of their time in the labour force or had recently retired. 

Ms Hutchinson urges potential millionaires to invest their money wisely and take a hard look at their savings accounts.

 'If you are 25 years-old and have $10,000 sitting in your transaction account earning next to no interest, and you save $1000 per month, it will take you about 79 years to reach millionaire status. 

However, if you had your savings in an average savings account with 3 percent interest (using the same scenario), you would be a millionaire in 41 years – that's about half the time compared to saving with no interest earned,' she said.

'So it's important to make the most of your savings and consider using a high interest savings account or add it to your home loan,' she continued.
