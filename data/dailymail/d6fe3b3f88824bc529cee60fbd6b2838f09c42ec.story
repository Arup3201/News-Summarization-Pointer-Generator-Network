Several nominees at the Academy Awards wore black ribbons on Sunday night to remember Sarah Jones, 27, the camera assistant who was hit by a freight train in Georgia last week during pre-production of the Greg Allman biopic 'Midnight Rider.' Her name and photograph were also projected onto a bumper during the ceremony.

Winning director of 'The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life' Malcolm Clarke, 'Gravity' film editor Mark Sanger, and 'Gravity' sound editor Glenn Fremantle all wore ribbons in Jones' memory during their acceptance speeches.

At the end of Bette Midler's performance, a bumper with Jones' name was shown to commemorate her and audience members were directed to Oscar.com for a photo gallery of the late camera assistant, reports Indiewire.com

A bumper with Sarah's name was projected during the ceremony after Bette Midler's performance

Jones died on February 20 when she was struck by a freight train on a train trestle over the Altamaha River near the Doctortown Road crossing in Wayne County, Georgia. Seven other crew members were also injured.

Earlier on Sunday, around 700 mourners gathered at Atlanta Botanical Garden's Mershon Hall to remember the talented young crew member.

In attendance were family, friends, and one other crew member who was injured during the accident.

The Hollywood Reporter writes that the memorial took place just hours before the Academy Awards where a large number of Jones' supporters petitioned the Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to mention the young woman in the Oscar's 'In Memorium' segment.

An online petition collected 62,000 signatures and a facebook and twitter campaign urged attendees to wear the black ribbon in Sarah's memory.

Celebrities like Allison Janney and Anna Faris began instagramming and tweeting photos under the hashtag #SlatesForSarah on another facebook page.

Sarah Jones' supporters rallied to get her commemorated during the ceremony and they succeeded

Though Jones' photograph was not shown along Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter O'Toole, James Gandolfini, Shirley Temple, Harold Ramis, and Paul Walker who Hollywood lost earlier this year, she was still commemorated publicly during the ceremony and her friends and family are thankful.

The Slates for Sarah facebook page wrote following the ceremony: 'Everyone said it was impossible but the love of Sarah and "Sarah's Team" did it!! The Academy saw your slates and heard your voice and Sarah Elizabeth Jones made it to the Oscars as a symbol of a better, safer film world to work in for all the young people coming into the business….We go further working together for change.'

The Hollywood Reporter writes that during Jones' memorial, Union leader Bruce Doering announcd that the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) would rename its annual scholorship the Sarah Elizabeth Jones Scholorship. The scholorship will be given to the child of union members interested in following in their parent's footsteps.

Doering also spoke of the union's important role in preventing accidents like the one that killed Jones.

'Since this terrible accident happened, we're trying to figure out how this happened and we're committed to taking the issue of unsafe conditions as far as we can take it -- and like Sarah -- full-on,' Doering said.

Questions have been raised on whether or not the film had permission to film near the tracks and an investigation is underway.
