Accused: Donald Tisher has been arrested and held without bail for a sexual assault against one of his students at San Joaquin Delta College

A former California sheriff's deputy working as a college coach has been accused of sexually assaulting one of his student athletes.

Donald Tisher, 56, who is a track and field coach at San Joaquin Delta College, is alleged to have attacked the girl at her home in Stockton.

The 18-year-old victim reported to the Stockton Police Department that she was unconscious throughout the attack.

'The specific allegation is digital penetration, which is use of fingers to penetrate the vagina,' said Robert Himelblau, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County District.

The former San Joaquin deputy has worked as a coach at East Union High School and is being without bail.

He is scheduled to make an appearance in San Joaquin County Superior Court at 8:30 a.m. on December 19.

Investigators claim that Tisher knew his vcitm and added that in no way was the relationship a romantic one.

Damningly for Tisher, his stepdaughter spoke to local Sacremento news and said she definitely believes he is guilty.

Asked if she wanted to stand up for him when approached on her doorstep, she replied, ''F— no—excuse my language—no, no I do not want to defend him in anyway,' to CBS Sacremento.
