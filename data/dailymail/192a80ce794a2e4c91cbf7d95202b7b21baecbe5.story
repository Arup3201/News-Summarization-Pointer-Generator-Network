He’s not adverse to using the odd, ahem, colourful phrase himself.

So thankfully the Duke of Edinburgh saw the funny side when he was the recipient of some rather fruity barrack-room language on a visit to the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards in Aldershot today.

The Queen’s husband, who has been Colonel of the regiment since 1975 and takes a close interest in its activities, was standing on the touchline watching a game of football between corporals and guardsmen when one exhausted player could not contain himself as he came off the pitch.

Royal support: The Duke of Edinburgh was standing on the touchline watching a game of football between corporals and guardsmen when one exhausted player could not contain himself - telling the Duke 'I'm f*****'

Doubled up in pain, the substituted soldier appeared unaware that Prince Philip was standing only five yards away as he went through a lexicon of swear words to describe his agony from complaining in no uncertain terms how shattered he was.

‘Are you all right?’ asked the elderly royal, who was talking to a group of sergeants on the touchline.

‘No, I’m f*****,’ said the soldier, still bent double with his head down.

Philip, 92, no stranger to the odd swear word after a career in the Royal Navy, laughed and then continued to chuckle away to himself as the player finally looked up, realised who he was speaking to and walked off looking slightly sheepish.

Sources said he took the blunder in his stride and was ‘heartily amused’.

During his visit to the Lille Barracks, Philip he was briefed on what the 1st Battalion has been doing in recent months.

One of its companies, The Queen’s Company, has been to the Falkland Islands for eight weeks and the prince recalled a couple of visits to the South Atlantic, one of which included an unsuccessful fishing trip.

Presentation: The Duke presents long service and good conduct medals to three soldiers during his official trip

‘I tried fly fishing for sea trout but nothing happened,’ he said forlornly.

He also heard how some members of the battalion had spent four weeks on jungle warfare training in Brunei, where one slightly-built soldier told him about the rigours of lugging 60lbs of kit through dense jungle in driving rain, 32C heat and 90% humidity.

‘You were 24 stone before you went out there, weren’t you?’ Philip joked.

The prince, who posed for a formal picture with officers and presented long service medals to three sergeants, left after lunch in the officers’ mess.

Lieutenant Colonel Chips Broughton, commanding officer of the battalion, said his visit had proved a great boost to the men, whose main duties this year are ceremonial at Buckingham Palace and Trooping the Colour.

‘It’s an honour,’ he said. ‘He is our regimental colonel. He has been a tremendous supporter of the Grenadiers.’
