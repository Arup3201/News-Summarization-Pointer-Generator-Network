Six months ago Kobane was a city in panic as the Kurds were desperately fleeing ISIS forces as they bared down on the border town, fearful that they would be slaughtered like the Yazidis before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis.

Now the terrorists have gone, beaten back into the desert by Kurdish forces and coalition airstrikes, and the residents can return to their 'saved' city. But, as these images show, not a lot of the home they remember is still standing.  

Tanks rust in the streets, buildings reduced to mere shells after bombings serve as temporary shelter for those who survived, while a little girl is reduced to lighting a fire underneath a piece of rubble in the street to keep warm.

A sign which once proudly displayed the town's name now stands riddled with bullet holes, like the few buildings left standing around it.

The battle for Kobane was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against ISIS to date, and represented the group's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. 

At one point things looked so bad that Turkish President Recep Erdogan declared the city was only hours away from completely falling into ISIS' bloodstained hands.

Victory was secured at the end of January after the last ISIS fighters were forced from the city's suburbs and into their strongholds along the Euphrates River. Civilians forced to flee across the border into Turkey are now returning home.

Shell: The rusting remains of a tank sit along the side of a street in the border town of Kobane, just over a month after ISIS fighters were forced out of the city after months of fighting with Kurdish ground forces and bombing runs by coalition warplanes

Ruined: Virtually none of the buildings in the city were left untouched by the battle, which raged for six months, and marks the bloodiest and fiercest fight in the war against ISIS to date. The residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this

Pride: A Syrian Kurdish woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after ISIS fighters fled the city of Kobane. The fighting here lasted for four months, and has left the city in ruins

Making the most of it: Just six months ago this Kurdish boy, along with thousands of other Kurds, were desperately fleeing Kobane, fearful they would be slaughtered if the city was overrun. Now they can return, but little of their previous home remains

Desperate: With little or no access to water and electricity, this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food

Shattered: A Kobane sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it

Homecoming: After four months of fierce fighting the Kurds, who were facing near extinction at the hands of ISIS, are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it

Flattened: A girl rides in a trailer being towed into Kobane by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background. The city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge ISIS troops taking cover there

All gone: A Kurdish man looks out over the destroyed city of Kobane from the balcony of his bullet-riddled home, just over a month after the last ISIS fighters fled for their strongholds along the Euphrates River

Littered: A woman stands among the ruins of her old home, as the streets around her are scattered with rubble, clothes, and ruined cars

Destroyed: The remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in Kobane. Against all the odds, Kurdish forces which were at one point pinned in the centre of the city, managed to fight their way out and claim victory

Nothing left: A man holding a rolled up cigarette and clutching a glass of drink stands among the ruins of his house. At one point the situation here was so dire the Turkish Prime Minister warned the city was hours from falling into ISIS hands

All he has left: A Kurdish man walks back into his home after six months spent hiding from ISIS across the border in Turkey. On his back he carries everything he owns wrapped into a rug

Back to business: A baker goes back to work amid the shattered remain of Kobane as residents go about trying to rebuild their previous lives

What remains: A Kurdish boy walks down the stairwell of his home in Kobane, littered with rubble and a keyboard. ISIS fighters have previously been videoed destroying the instruments for being 'un-Islamic'
