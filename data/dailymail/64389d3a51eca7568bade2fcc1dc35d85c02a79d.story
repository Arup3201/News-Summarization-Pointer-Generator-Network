A woman injured in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing who had several surgeries before having part of her leg amputated recently was discharged from a rehab facility Saturday and has vowed to run the race next year.

Rebekah DiMartino. 27, said she looks forward to getting her stitches out in early December and being fitted for a prosthetic left leg.

'The prognosis is great. I chopped off what was holding me back,' DiMartino said 'The prognosis, is you'll see me running the Boston Marathon next year.'

DiMartino had more than a dozen operations but still dealt with lingering pain. 

Before the surgery, Rebekah had remained upbeat and even threw the leg a 'last supper' celebration.

'The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,' DiMartino said before the operation. 'If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here.'

DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring  270. 

Months of agony: DiMartino had more than a dozen operations but still dealt with lingering pain

Thinking positive: She does not expect her loss of a limb to adversely affect the rest of her life

All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg.

She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection.

Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. 

Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. 

'There is so much I could say about what I am feeling at this exact moment,' she wrote on her Facebook page before the operation.

'Am I scared? Yes. Am I sad that all our efforts for the last 18 months have failed? Absolutely. But beyond the fear and sadness there is something that surpasses it all....relief. 

'I am relieved to know that this is a step forward, when I have been in limbo for so long. I am relieved that my family will no longer have to live in anticipation and worry, of what the future will hold for me.

'I am relieved that I will FINALLY be able to start the process of a FULL recovery. And I am even more relieved that I will finally just get to be Rebekah again.'

She continued: 'Monday is the day that my new life begins. And I am SO excited to see what it holds.'

Quirky: Rebekah has been having fun in rehab and trying to keep her spirits up in the most creative ways

Support: Just hours after getting out of rehab she went onto support her little sister in her State Gymnastics Meet

Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right

Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page just days before the surgery

She had surgery November 10 at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital to remove her left leg below the knee. 

She entered rehab November 14 and went home Saturday to nearby Richmond.

Their Houston-area home still needs some modifications for accessibility, she said.

'I have been wheelchair bound for the last 18 months basically, so when we built our house we built it with wider doors,' said DiMartino, 27.

She does not expect her loss of a limb to adversely affect the rest of her life.

'This is about to be Rebekah unleashed. They haven't seen anything yet. This is the good part of the story,' DiMartino said. 'Not only am I moving on, I am trying to do my part in changing the world while doing it.'

'I am thrilled because I am moving on with my life. I am taking away the old and bringing in the new and I just can't wait to see what it brings.'

Part of that future will include running the Boston Marathon, she said.

Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, was excited to have a 'part robot mom'

She said her seven-year-old son has long been upset about losing her leg, but after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed.

'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted "that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!"' she wrote on her Facebook page.

Her doctors say they are hopeful that she could be taking her first steps in three months.

'I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,' Dr. Bill McGarvey said. 'If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful.'  

She has been sharing updates on her support page, Rebekah Gregory's New Day New Hope.

'And as we approach Thanksgiving next week, my list of blessings gets longer and longer,' she wrote on Facebook on Saturday. 'But today I am just grateful that so many people use their lives to help others, and to have physical therapists that totally kicked my butt!'  '
