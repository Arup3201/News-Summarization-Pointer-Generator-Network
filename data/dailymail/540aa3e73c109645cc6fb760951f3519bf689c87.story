President Barack Obama spoke to an appreciative yet polite audience of about 1,500 young Indians in New Delhi on Tuesday morning, but his White House tech team delivered a 'facepalm' moment to the handful of people who watched online.

As he praised India and the United States for a string of technological achievements, his satellite video feed cut out for a full ten seconds. 

'As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation,' Obama boasted, we transformed ourselves into high-tech –'  

'High tech' glitch: Obama's video feed went out six times during his speech on Tuesday in New Delhi, including a ten-second gap just as he was praising both the US and India for 'high-tech' advancements

United front: Obama walked from the stage with first lady Michelle Obama after delivering a speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi that included a passionate defense of women's rights

Not a 'secret Muslim': Obama himself brought up accusations in some US corners that he's not a Christian as he claims – 'as if that were somehow a bad thing'

That's all people watching on the White House's website and on YouTube heard until a series of buzzes and clicks gave way to the president talking about 'outer space' and crediting both nations for going 'to the moon and to Mars.'

The bulk of Obama's 35-minute speech touched on other issues, though, including nuclear energy, climate change, religious freedom and civil rights.

'There were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin,' the president said.

And he brought up and dismissed the persistent rumors spread by far-right conservatives that he's secretly a Muslim 

'There have been times where my faith has at times been questioned by people who don't know me,' Obama told his audience, 'or they've said that I adhere to a different religion – as if that were somehow a bad thing.'

Nearly 80 per cent of Indians are Hindu, with Muslims the largest religious minority at 12 per cent.

Warm climate: Obama's crowd of young Indians was polite and appreciative as he urged them to demand climate-change policy shifts to benefit their generation

Small crowd online:  YouTube's on-screen counter showed a peak of just 662 online viewers for Obama's speech in New Delhi although it was only 9:30 p.m. on the West Coast when he began

Obama made a point of announcing that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached agreement on the terms of a nuclear energy deal, unlocking potentially billions of dollars in trade from U.S. companies who will be free to supply India with nuclear components and technology, andto build reactors there.

A dispute over legal liability in the case of an accident had kept the U.S. from allowing those commercial transactions. That has been solved, and Obama has reportedly gained assurances that nuclear material transferred to India will be tracked carefully and accounted for. 

'With the breakthroughs we achieved on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement,' Obama said Tuesday morning, 'which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon energy that helps fight climate change.'

But the president underscored his commitment to green-lighting nuclear energy deals only where there is no possibility of weapons development.  

'Even as we acknowledge the world as it is, we must never stop working for the world as it should be – a world without nuclear weapons. That should be a goal for all of us,' he said.

His biggest push was for a push for new Indian commitments on climate change, an issue already on India's front-burner. 

'With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, [and] cyclones getting stronger, few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India,' Obama said.

'Now the United States recognizes our part in creating this problem, so we're leading the global effort to combat it. And today I can say that America's carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades.'

But 'even if countries like the United States curb our emissions,' Obama warned, 'if countries that are growing rapidly like India, with soaring energy needs, don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change.'

The video glitches – and the rest of Obama's speech – were seen by few Americans. At its peak, just 662 people were viewing the YouTube stream that powers livestreams at WhiteHouse.gov.

By comparison, slightly more than 84,000 tuned in last week to see him interviewed by three YouTube 'celebrities' including GloZell Green, a woman known for eating out of a bathtub filled with milk and Fruit Loops cereal while sitting in it.

Obama was introduced by Neha Buch, 33,the CEO of Pravah, a Delhi-based organization that promotes active citizenship and social enterprise for young Indians.

'She lobbies the Government of India on policies affecting the youth,' according to a White House pool reporter, 'and has worked with different U.N. agencies to strengthen their youth-centered work.'

' Most recently, she was involved in the post-2015 Development Agenda consultation process in India as a co-convener of the "Youth Tract" for post-2015.'

The president followed his speech in New Delhi with a sit-down television interview conducted by CNN host Fareed Zakaria.
