Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone is joining Preston North End on loan with view to a permanent deal.

Johnstone, 21, has been on loan at Doncaster Rovers. He played 19 times for the League One side whilst on loan in 2013-14 and only extended his loan with Paul Dickov's side last week.

The 2011 FA Youth Cup winner has joined Preston 'to pursue an opportunity', with Johnstone contracted at Old Trafford until 2017.

Dickov said: 'Sam and Man United have been brilliant throughout so thanks to both parties.'

Preston, managed by Simon Grayson, are fourth in League One - 10 places above Doncaster.

Johnstone, who was born in Preston, never made a senior appearance for United but twice featured on the substitutes' bench under David Moyes.

'I'm very happy to be here,' the 21-year-old told Preston's official website. 'It's my home town, I grew up in Preston and it is a proud day for me and for my family.

'If anyone else other than Preston had shown an interest in me, the likelihood would have been I would have stayed at Doncaster, who have been very good to me, but this being my home-town club it was difficult to turn down.

'My dad played here a long time ago and he is happy and proud and I am looking forward to playing at Deepdale.'

United are due to hold talks with Anders Lindegaard's representatives over coming days as he seeks a move away while Ben Amos will also be allowed out on loan.
