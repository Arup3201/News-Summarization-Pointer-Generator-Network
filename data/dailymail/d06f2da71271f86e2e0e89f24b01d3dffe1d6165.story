Theresa May told police they were not being ‘picked on’ by the Government as she faced down furious rank-and-file officers yesterday.

The Home Secretary was barracked and booed by Police Federation delegates as she defended cuts to police pay and pensions.

Mrs May was told she had lost the trust of officers as she addressed the federation’s annual conference in Bournemouth.

Theresa May was heckled by police officers as she tried to explain changes in their pay and conditions in front of a provocative stage banner

The Home Secretary was jeered throughout her speech to the Police Federation in Bournemouth today

She faced shouts of ‘disgrace’ and ‘resign’ from angry officers as she insisted cuts were necessary for the good of the country.

Simon Payne, of Warwickshire Police Federation, told her: ‘Home Secretary, you may not like this, but we no longer trust you in the police service. Full stop. End of story.’

But Mrs May said that if outdated pay and pensions arrangements were not reformed, the only alternative was job cuts.

She added: 'I know the Fed often say we’re singling out the police. But that simply isn’t true.'

Tom Winsor, pictured, was asked by Mrs May to carry out the most wide-ranging review of police pay and conditions in more than 30 years

Pointing to cuts in prisons and probation and 7,000 redundancies in the Armed Forces, she said:

'So let’s stop pretending the police are being picked on. Every part of the public sector is having to take its share of the pain.' 

She said that even after major reforms to pay and overtime, police in England and Wales would remain the best paid of all the emergency services.

'We have taken the difficult but necessary decision to face up to our debts, deal with our deficit, and get our spending under  control,' she said.

Mrs May entered the hall to a standing protest with officers displaying posters declaring 'enough is enough'.

She insisted the Government was right to reform policing.

She said: 'I know that change can be difficult, unsettling, sometimes even painful.

'But it is my job to tell it like it is, not how we’d like it to be.'

Police Federation chairman Paul McKeever told the conference that cuts to police funding were 'putting public safety at risk'.

He accused the Government of treating policing as a 'low priority'.

He claimed cuts in Home Office spending on police, which will total 20 per cent by 2015, had already cost 5,000 'frontline' jobs.

'You are on the precipice of destroying a police service that is admired and replicated throughout the world,' he added.

Mrs May's speech was greeted with silence from the 1,200 officers at the conference who got their message across with banners

A huge cheer and applause erupted across the conference as one federation member, Dave Bennett, told Mrs May: 'Home Secretary, I believe you are a disgrace'

He said cuts would inevitably lead to higher crime levels. But Mrs May pointed to forces where crime was falling despite officer numbers having fallen.

Federation officers, already angry over a pay freeze, are livid at the prospect of radical changes to overtime, bonuses and working practices.

They condemned the review of pay and conditions carried out by former rail regulator Tom Winsor.

Police Federation members protested against spending cuts and wide-ranging changes to their pay and pensions in central London last week

Mrs May’s insistence that he was independent of Government drew laughter from the 1,200-strong audience.

Around 30,000 off-duty officers marched through central London last week to demand that ministers change path.
