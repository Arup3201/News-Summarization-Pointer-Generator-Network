Every MP in the country is to get a brand new iPad after the general election, costing the tax payer £1million. 

The House of Commons Commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or iPad Air 2, would actually save money.

Liberal Democrat John Thurso, who represents the commission in the chamber, said moving away from Apple's products would be too expensive.

Caught in the act: Tory MP Nigel Mills was caught playing Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad last December

But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Chi Onwurah criticised the decision to lock MPs into the Apple operating system and told Computerworld UK she would have preferred a 'device agnostic' policy.

'As we saw with Nigel Mills and Candy Crush, MPs will be using the games, and the iTunes and other features on the iPad,' she added.

'Locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents can't afford seems like a mistake. And that's without mentioning the tax avoidance issue. I'm pushing for a device independent digital platform for Parliament.' 

Liberal Democrat John Thurso claimed a move away from Apple's operating system would  incur more costs

Apple iPads have been used across Parliament since a pilot scheme was launched in 2012.

Currently 209 MPs have taxpayer-funded tablets with the understanding they use them for working while on the move in Parliament.

But last December a Tory MP was caught playing a game on his iPad for more than two hours during a meeting.

Nigel Mills escaped punishment after he admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush and promised not to do it again. 

Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee.

He had initially said he would merely ‘try’ not to be diverted by the game again, but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said: ‘I guarantee it will not happen again.

In 2013, the House of Commons Commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that 'a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election'. 

The Commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from £100 to £600 and where they decided on the Apple iPad Air 2. 

The cost of supplying the new iPads would be £200,000 a year over the life of the next Parliament.

Mr Thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-Apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than £3 million annually. 

The House of Commons Commission said that buying the 650 MPs an iPad Air 2 each, worth £499, will save money

'Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure,' he said.

'A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes. 

'Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. 

'There would be a significant change to move existing members to a different tablet operating system. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 members and all relevant PICT support staff.'
