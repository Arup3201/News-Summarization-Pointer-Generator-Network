A devastated mother has described how her 16-year-old daughter has transformed from a straight-A student and beauty queen into an uncontrollable delinquent.

In an episode of Dr Phil that aired on Thursday, Stephanie reveals that her daughter Ashley has become dangerously unruly; she has been caught shoplifting, abusing drugs and alcohol and even stole her car when she was just 12.

But the TV host has words for both daughter and mother, admonishing Stephanie for being light on discipline and thereby enabling Ashley to treat her without respect.

Scary behavior: Stephanie reveals that when Ashley doesn't get her way, she becomes violent, screaming, punching holes in walls, kicking out car windshields and threatening to kill her

In the episode, Stephanie reveals that when Ashley doesn't get her way, she becomes violent, screaming, punching holes in walls, kicking out car windshields and threatening to kill her.

To make matters even more dire, she recently discovered a gun in her daughter's car, which Ashley claimed belonged to a former boyfriend, who was 21 years old.

'You're afraid she could hurt you, she could kill you in a fit of rage,' Dr Phil says to Stephanie as he encourages her to be a more involved parent. 'Now, she's armed.'

And the bad behavior doesn't stop there; Ashley admits to having unprotected sex starting at age 14 and has been caught multiple times with marijuana, failing a drug test only a month ago.

Shifting the blame: 'So don't act like this is all my fault - you let me get away with it for too long,' Ashley, who has been known to be manipulative, tells her mother

What's more, she even broke the rules set out by Dr Phil producers, who asked her to stay in a hotel with her mother throughout the duration of filming.

Instead, she went to stay with her boyfriend. 'You didn't respect our rules and guidelines either, did you?' Dr Phil asks her. 'I guess not,' she says coolly.

But the TV host points out that her behavior is just as much a product of her upbringing as it is a part of her personality.

Calling Stephanie a 'doormat' for her daughter, Dr Phil says she needs to change her attitude or risk being abused by Ashley forever.

'OK, here's rule number one: Remember this for the rest of your life: You do not reward bad behavior,' he tells her. 'Because behaviors that get rewards tend to repeat.'

And even Ashley herself recognizes that her mother's submissive attitude is partially to blame for her own belligerence.

Time to change: Dr Phil agrees that Stephanie needs to become a stricter parent. 'You do not reward bad behavior,' he tells her. 'Because behaviors that get rewards tend to repeat'

Progress: Dr Phil offers Stephanie an opportunity to send her daughter to a treatment center which specializes in troubled teens, and she accepts

'You know whenever I used to hang out with my old friends, I would tell you I was going to a party, and you wouldn't say anything about it,' she says.

'So don't act like this is all my fault - you let me get away with it for too long.'

The teenager adds that her estranged father's abusive nature was an added difficulty growing up, and that she fears she has inherited his bipolar disorder.

At the end of the episode, Dr Phil tells the mother-daughter pair that a 'structured environment' is the only setting that can whip Ashley into shape.

'She is going to wind up 17, pregnant, and you're going to be raising the child while she's going out and partying,' he warns Stephanie. 'That's where you're headed, unless you have the backbone to say, "This stops here. This stops now."'Â 

He offers Stephanie an opportunity to send her daughter to a treatment center called Center for Discovery, which specializes in troubled teens. After some hesitation, she finally accepts.
