They chomped, they chowed, they chewed. Wings disappeared and, in two competitors' cases, reappeared, but it was 5-foot-7, 125-pound mother-of-four pulled off 'the greatest performance in Wing Bowl history,'

Molly Schuyler devoured 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive eating contest in Philadelphia.

Ms. Schuyler flew past the previous long-standing record of 337 wings as she finished the last round of the 22nd annual WIP 94 Sportsradio Wing Bowl.

Ms Schuyler captured a $22,000 payday by devouring 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive eating contest called Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia last Friday

Winging it: The mother of four from Bellevue, Nebraska cleaned up at the WIP's Wing Bowl 22

She's no chicken: Molly Schuyler, who stands 5'7" tall and weighs just 125 pounds, ate 363 chicken wings to take the crown - and set a new Wing Bowl record

At 8 a.m. the 120-pound woman virtually swallowed the wings for her breakfast as second-place finisher Patrick Bertoletti from Chicago could only chomp home in second place with a total of 356 wing.

Ms. Schuyler, whose performance host Angelo Cataldi dubbed 'the greatest ever', won $22,000.

Asked by Mr Cataldi what she would do with the money, Schuyler said, 'I have car payments and kids, so it's all good.'

'Who eats 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes?' Mr Cataldi asked, still mystified by the performance.

Victory! Molly Schuyler is the champion chicken eater!

Not bad for a morning's work: Molly Schuyler is handed the winning check for $22,000 before heading to Iowa for her next eating competition

Ms. Schuyler breezed to the first-round lead, eating 186 wings in 14 minutes as the top 10 advanced.

One of those eliminated in the first round was Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, who managed only 65 wings.

The second round lasted 14 minutes, and the final round was a two-minute sprint to the finish.

'To tell you the truth, I didn’t even think I was going to win this, I was looking and hoping to finish in the top three,' said Ms. Schuyler to CBS 3.

'We come from Omaha and we don't really have the kind of wings you guys have out here,' she said smiling. 'I had to 'wing' it.'

The eating and all the surrounding shenanigans took place in front of a sold out crowd.

This weekend she if off to Des Moines, Iowa Friday afternoon to compete in the IHOP Pancake Bowl on Saturday, and then attempt to defend her title later Saturday afternoon at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival.

Where did it all go? Molly has a petite frame. At 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible

'I think I could eat some more,'kid Ms. Schuyler, the Wing Bowl 22 crown skewed on her head.

'This was freaking crazy. I kept eating and I kept saying I didn’t want to know how many wings I ate until the end. I just wanted to focus on what I was doing. But I don’t think I want to eat another chicken wing for a while. Hopefully I’ll be back next year.'

Each year, Wing Bowl brings out some of the region’s best competitive eaters, who themselves have to prove their worth to qualify for the event by performing a miraculous feat of eating.

To qualify for the Wing Bowl, Schuyler ate nine pounds of cottage cheese in 114 seconds. She also holds a world record for eating a 72-ounce steak in less than three minutes.

The previous record of 337 was established in 2012 by one of the world's best-known competitive eaters Takeru Kobayashi.

The only other woman to ever win the contest was Sonya “The Black Widow” Thomas, who won Wing Bowl 12 with 167 wings in 2004.

Wing Bowl creator Al Morganti had predicted Ms Schuyler odds-on favorite for the event at 2-1.

Asked whether she would return next year to defend her championship, presumably still feeling rather full, Ms. Schuyler said, 'maybe!'

Large appetite: Previously, Molly Schuyler wolfed down a 72oz steak in 2 minutes 44 
seconds, earning her a place in the world record books - and a spot of 
indigestion, no doubt

Room for more: Despite the colossal size of her dish, Mrs Schuyler's appetite continues to roll, and she is seen reaching for handfuls of fries

Non stop: Earlier this year, Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by 
demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large 
soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland

Talking about her speed-eating abilities, she added: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon.

‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.'

Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.'

In 2013 Mrs Schuyler competed in more than 20 different food eating contests across the country.

Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat

New-found skill: Mrs Schuyler, a full-time server, only started eating competitively last August

Victories included eating 9lbs of fried mushrooms in 8 minutes and eight beef patties in 1 minute and 46 seconds.

She also beat ‘Man vs Food’s Adam Richman at Jethro's BBQ Diner challenge in Iowa by polishing off a 5lb meat sandwich made of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese in less than eight minutes.

All Pro Eating, the world's only independent competitive eating organization, lists her as the world's number one female.
