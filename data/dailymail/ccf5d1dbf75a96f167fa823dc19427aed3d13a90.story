For millenia we have found comfort in the light from a flickering fire and the rising sun.

But light also takes many forms that are largely invisible and undetectable without modern technology.

Now a new Unesco exhibition, entitled the International Year of Light, is showcasing the wonder of light in all its forms.

Microscopic images as well as photos of natural wonders such as the Northern Lights are featured in a new exhibition that forms part of Unesco’s International Year of Light. This image shows crystals of cold medication and sodium citrate taken using a camera attached to a microscope. It was taken in polarised light, when light is restricted to vibrating in one plane

It aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science, its applications, and its importance to humankind.

‘Light allows us to communicate, entertain, explore, and understand the world we inhabit and the Universe we live in,’ the exhibition website says.

‘This exhibition series shows the myriad things light can do, and how it plays a critical role in our lives every day.’

The year aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science, its applications, and its importance to humankind. This beautiful scene in the Gippsland Lakes in south eastern Australia, shows bioluminescence as well as stars in the Milky Way. It's produced by a chemical reaction inside a living organism. Most bioluminescence occurs in deep water where sunlight cannot reach

All lasers are based on controlling the way that energised atoms release photons, or packets of light. Lasers emit light coherently allowing it to be focused to a tight spot up close or over long distances. The image on the left shows how beaming a laser into the sky, astronomers can measure the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere, allowing for clearer images of distant cosmic objects. The image on the right shows shadows in Antelope Canyon in Arizona as sunlight streams through an opening above

A microscopic image showing a tall green plant with yellow flowers called levisticum (pictured) is among those on show. Polarised light is used to bring out the details of the plant, but is also used for sunglasses, for example. Polarised glasses block most light oriented in a horizontal direction, which often happens when light is reflected from a flat road or smooth water

Among the pictures currently on show are microscopic images showing the composition of cold medication in polarised light, the cells in a mouse's eyes, as well as light bulbs under an X-ray and fibre optics, which are used to connect the world.

Natural wonders such as bioluminescence on a beach, impressive sundogs in the snow, Aurora Borealis, dramatic lightning strikes, fireworks and cosmic images of the Milky Way also form part of the gallery.

Natural wonders such as dramatic lightning strikes against city spaces (pictured) are included in the gallery. This image shows the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In storm clouds, the friction between particles  builds up a large separation of electric charge, creating voltages approaching 100 million volts. This causes a discharge that heats the gas around it to  ten thousand degrees, causing a bright glow observed as a lightning bolt

A laser scanning microscope scans a sample point-by-point, assembling the pixel information to generate one image, forming a high-resolution and high-contrast image in three dimensions. This image shows a mouse retina, where the cells have been stained with fluorescent dye to show different features

Solar panels (pictured) allow us to harness some of the vast energy that is provided to us every day from the Sun. Photovoltaic cells within the solar panels generate electrical power by converting light from the Sun into electricity using semiconducting material such as silicon.  Many people consider solar power as one of the most promising sources of renewable energy

This image shows  the Sun in ultraviolet light through a telescope with better resolution than the most sophisticated high-definition television. This telescope, called the Solar Dynamics Observatory, gets these amazing views of our closest star in an orbit high above the Earth's atmosphere. This gives it unfettered access to ten different wavelengths of light being emitted from the sun

The International Year of Light aims to inspire future scientists and engineers, while also promoting the possibilities of using solar power in the developing world and advances in medicine, communications and astronomy, for example.

The Duke of York, who is patron of the project in the UK, said: ‘The International Year of Light is about how we have used light over the centuries; it is how we are applying light, photonics and various other aspects in order to make the world a better place, not only for ourselves, but for future generations.’

This intriguing photo shows a 'sun dog' - a pair of bright lights seen on either side of the sun, typically when it is setting. Sun dogs belong to a large class of atmospheric phenomena caused by the bending of sunlight by small ice crystals in the air. The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays. If the crystals are randomly oriented in the atmosphere, a complete ring around the Sun a halo is seen (shown)

Optical fibres (shown) - hair-thin flexible strands of glass or plastic - carry massive amounts of data in the form of light and serve as the backbone of the Internet. They can be used in endoscopes for imaging the interiors of both people and machines. or as fibre lasers, can generate light energy to cut everything from human tissue to thick steel

Protozoa, or 'first animals' are single-celled animals that play a key role in maintaining and balance of microbial life. This photograph illuminates one particular type of protozoa called vorticella using a technique called dark field microscopy, which blocks out the direct light from the source, so that only light scattered by the specimen is observed, enabling brilliant bright images to be seen again a dark background

This year has been chosen by the United Nations, because it marks a number of anniversaries of significant discoveries, such as early works of optics by Ibn al-Haytham in 1015 and the centenary of Einstein’s theory of relativity.

Ibn al-Haytham, the Medieval polymath, made contributions to the principles of optics, visual perception and astronomy. His research on optical systems using mirrors led to the discovery that the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant and he investigated the magnifying power of lenses.

Throughout the year, events will take place across the world to celebrate the applications of light.

Scientists have captured  X-ray emissions from young stars with masses similar to our Sun outside our Milky Way galaxy for the first time. In this composite image of the Wing the Chandra - one of our galaxy's closest neighbours -  optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope is shown in red, green and blue and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope is shown in red

While the first headlights on cars were fuelled by kerosene or acetylene, today's versions are far safer and more effective. Newer cars use halogen or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of incandescent bulbs, but reflected lasers may be used in the future. This image combines eight photos, each lasting for 30 seconds, showing traffic on a road

For centuries, lighthouses have kept mariners safe by illuminating rough stretches of water and dangerous rocks.  This image of a lighthouse off the west coast of Wales has additional beautiful illuminated elements. From the top left to the lower right in the sky, Venus, Jupiter, and the Moon reflecting light from the sun can be seen hanging over Dublin, in Ireland

Together with the sun, most people instantly think of light bulbs when considering light. This image shows assorted bulbs as a coloured x-ray
