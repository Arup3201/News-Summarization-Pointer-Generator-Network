These pictures show the tense moment a tiny field mouse confronted and appeared to taunt a cat before making a lucky escape.

The rodent, locked in an intense stare with its feline foe, appears to square up to the cat, raising its front feet into the air.

As the pet moggy moved in for the kill, the plucky mouse turned its tail and made a speedy getaway.

The real Tom and Jerry: The cat and mouse are locked in an intense stare as predator and prey plot their next moves

The encounter between predator and prey was captured by French nutrition student Enora Lebosse in her garden in Brittany.

The 20-year-old said: 'My pet cat, Bastet, was hot on the heels of a little field mouse.

'Her mother gave her a little mouse to play with, but it was very fast and managed to escape.

'I was watching my cats play in the garden and when I saw the mouse I quickly fetched my camera.

'It was like the mouse was talking to Bastet, almost as if they were telling secrets to each other. I was really happy I was able to capture this moment.'

Standing just two metres away, Miss Lebosse watched as the field mouse escaped, darting from the garden.

After the mouse made its speedy getaway, Bastet licked her lips and began searching for a new meal.

Miss Lebosse added: 'When people see these photographs, most of them feel surprised and are incredulous.

'Fortunately, the mouse escaped and so the story has a happy ending, but I was very lucky to capture the moment. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.'
