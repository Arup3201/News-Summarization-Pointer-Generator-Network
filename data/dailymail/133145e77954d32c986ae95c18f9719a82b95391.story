Court: Actor Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving for six months because he ran a red light last year

James Bond villain Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving after jumping a red light, despite maintaining he was trying to get out of the way of a police car.

The veteran actor, writer and director, 75, who played General Orlov in Octopussy alongside Roger Moore, said he had not meant to break the law.

In a letter read out at City of London Magistrates' Court he claimed while driving his VW Beetle through Central London: 'I heard a siren in the near distance and turned to get out of its way.'

But he still pleaded guilty to failing to comply with traffic signals on October 25 last year, earning himself a six-month ban from driving.

Berkoff, who has been caught speeding twice in the last two years and ran another red light in March 2012, already had nine points on his licence.

He was handed three more points today, leading to automatic disqualification.

'Mr Berkoff was driving a Volkswagen Beetle motor vehicle in Upper Thames Street, at the junction with Queen Street Place', said prosecutor Varinder Hayre.

'He crossed the stop line when the light had been red for 1.5 seconds, and he was at a speed of 27mph.

'The police did not offer an immediate conditional offer due to the time the lights had been red.'

Berkoff, star of movies including Beverley Hill Cop and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, initially gave the court his Californian driving licence number, but checks showed he also holds a UK licence.

'Police were given a DVLA notice with nine penalty points, meaning he is liable for disqualification under the totting up procedure', said Ms Hayre.

Berkoff's case was in court last month to be dealt with, but it was adjourned so he could be warned he was facing a ban.

The star was offered a chance to tell magistrates why he should be spared from disqualification, but he did not show up to court.

Berkoff was given six points after being caught speeding on September 18, 2010, and March 11, 2012, and another three points for driving through a red light on March 13, 2012.

Magistrates also fined him £300 for the offence, and he was ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £30 victim surcharge.

Berkoff, of Limehouse, east London, pleaded guilty by post to failing to comply with a red light signal.
