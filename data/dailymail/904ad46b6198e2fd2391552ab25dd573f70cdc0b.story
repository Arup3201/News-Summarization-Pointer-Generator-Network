Health bosses spent thousands  of pounds sending a helicopter and four ambulances to a car crash 70 yards from a hospital – because its A&E ward had been closed leaving the injured having to be ferried miles to other units.

They spent £2,500 despatching the Chilterns Air Ambulance to the accident near Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire, which lost its emergency department a year ago.

Two rapid-response vehicles and two ambulances were also sent to the crash, in an operation that cost up to £3,500.

They were scrambled after a driver in his 80s had a suspected heart attack at the wheel of his Renault Clio and lost control of the car.

It ploughed into a pedestrian, causing him serious leg injuries, then careered into two empty parked cars. The Clio driver was also hurt.

Wycombe Hospital staff rushed out to help, but as the complex now only has a minor injuries unit which is not equipped to deal with badly injured patients, they were unable to take them in.

The town lost its emergency department last October as part of changes to centralise A&E services across the area.

The nearest emergency departments are now 13 miles away, at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, and 15 miles away at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury.

In May, The Mail on Sunday, which has been spearheading a campaign to save the country’s threatened A&Es, revealed how the Wycombe closure had led to serious knock-on effects at these two hospitals.

NHS documents showed 16,000 extra emergency patients would be pushed there every year.

Managers claimed the two A&Es had been bolstered to cope with the extra strain. But studies showed the closure led to soaring numbers of patients waiting more than four hours in the two A&Es last winter.

At Wexham Park, which is in neighbouring Berkshire, 20 per cent of patients ended up waiting more than four hours in the winter – three times higher than the national average.

Hundreds of scheduled operations were also cancelled due to an increase in emergency admissions.

Our report on Wycombe led to questions about the closure being raised in Parliament by Lord Campbell-Savours, a Labour peer.

He asked what assessment the Government had made of the impact of the closure and was told by the Health Minister Earl Howe that there was ‘no Government policy about the closure of A&E departments’.

The crash happened just before 1pm on Tuesday. The first paramedic, who arrived five minutes after the 999 call, ordered the air ambulance thinking an airlift might be urgently needed.

In the end the two elderly victims were sent by road ambulance.

The injured pedestrian, who is in his 70s, went to Stoke Mandeville. Last night, a spokesman said he  was in a stable condition.

The car driver went to Wexham Park where he was checked over and discharged the same day.

Alison Crook, 42, from Bourne End in Buckinghamshire, who uses Wycombe Hospital, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous that they had to send an air ambulance to Wycombe because it lost its A&E.

'If they had kept it, they would have saved all that money.’

She went on: ‘The ambulances now seem to operate as a taxi service between the hospitals.’

Paul Harper, 77, who witnessed the aftermath of the crash, said the organisation by the emergency services ‘was brilliant’.

But he added: ‘The fact they had to send these ambulances to take them to different hospitals – that’s a different matter.’

Mr Harper, a retired businessman who is being treated at Wycombe hospital and was trying to get in for a blood test at the time, feared the closure of the emergency department would put him at risk in the future.

He said: ‘The real crisis for me is if I have to be whisked away in an ambulance, all the way to Aylesbury, which is a ridiculous journey.’

Ironically, the cost of the helicopter mission will not be picked up by the NHS, but by the charity which supports it. The EC135 Eurocopter operates out of RAF Benson in Oxfordshire and costs Thames Valley and Chilterns Air Ambulance £1.5  million a year to run.

The aircraft covers Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire so is affectionately known as the ‘BOB’ service.

A spokesman said: ‘We rely entirely on charitable donations from the public and receive  no central government or National Lottery funding.’

Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Wycombe Hospital and Stoke Mandeville, claimed the emergency department had been closed to create a better ‘hub and spoke model’ in the region.

A Trust spokesman said: ‘In Buckinghamshire, Stoke Mandeville  Hospital has been designated as a trauma unit, with the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford designated as the region’s major trauma centre. Wycombe Hospital has a minor injuries and illness unit.

‘The creation of this hub and spoke model is due to national clinical evidence showing that this improves patient safety and outcomes.’
