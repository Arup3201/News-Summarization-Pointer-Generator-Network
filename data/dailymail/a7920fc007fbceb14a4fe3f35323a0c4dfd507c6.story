Syrian strongman Bashar Assad has challenged the U.S. and France to prove that he used chemical weapons against his own people.

He claimed on Monday that while his armed forces might possess chemical weapons, Syrian soldiers would never have used them in an area where they themselves might be killed.

French newspaper Le Figaro asked Assad to 'demonstrate' that his army 'did not resort to using chemical weapons on August 21 in the suburbs of Damascus in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people,' according to a translation published by Al Jazeera.   

Proof: President Assad says the U.S. and France need to show evidence that he used chemical weapons against his own people

President Obama and French President 
François Hollande have accused him of presiding over the attack, which 
U.S. sources said on Monday included the use of sarin nerve gas.

But those claims, Assad said, remain mere accusations. And 'someone who makes accusations needs proof'.

'We challenged the U.S. and France to show us proof,' he said. 'Mr Obama and Hollande were incapable even when asked to do so by their own peoples.'

Barack Obama is plotting more extensive action in Syria to crush Assad’s military and topple the dictator, it emerged today.

The US President has been thought to be planning limited and targeted strikes to deter use of chemical weapons, after the deadly attack in Damascus which killed more than 1,400 people.

But White House briefings for senior senators suggest the US military intervention will be much wider and more devastating.

General Jack Keane, a former Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, said Mr Obama wanted to ‘degrade’ Assad’s military forces while at the same time ‘upgrading’ those of opposition forces to trigger regime change.

Speaking after talks with senators including John McCain, who has been briefed by the President, General Keane said: ‘The President has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to degrade military capacity of the Assad regime.

‘At the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces.‘And it’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able eventually to topple the Assad regime,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Assad left open the question of 'whether
or not the Syrian army possess these types of arms'. But he suggested 
that since some of his soldiers were among the casualties, any claim 
that the attack originated with them was illogical.

'Suppose that our army wished to use weapons of mass destruction,' he speculated.

'Is it possible that they would do so in an area where they are themselves, and where soldiers were wounded by these arms, as was stated by the U.N. inspectors who visited them in the hospital where they were treated?'

'Where is the logic?'

The Assad regime has suggested since August 21 that rebel groups launched the chemical attacks, a position that has won little backing internationally.

But there remains little global appetite for military intervention in what has become a protracted civil war with near-global implications.

The U.S, Britain and France quickly 
lined up last week to recommend targeted military strikes, but David 
Cameron suffered an embarrassing defeat when Parliament voted down his 
proposal.

The French 
parliament will debate a similar measure on Wednesday, but with the 
promise of new disclosures from the country's intelligence services, 
which reportedly have tracked the Syrian chemical weapons cache dating 
from before the Iraq war.

The
U.S. may be the last to act. President Obama said on Saturday that he 
will ask Congress to approve any military action, even though he has the
authority to order strikes without their permission.

Mr Obama also has the power to recall
the full Congress from its summer break for an emergency session, but 
he has not done so. With a scheduled return date of September 9, any 
vote will be at least a week away.

The Washington Post published
an informal 'whip count' on Monday afternoon, estimating current levels
of support among House and Senate members based on legislators' public 
statements to date.

No logic: Syrian dictator Assad tells a French newspaper his armed forces would not use chemical weapons in an area where they would also be affected

Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children

'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria

That accounting shows 57 of 100 senators undecided, with 23 in favor of military action and 20 opposed. It would take an effort of 40 senators to block any resolution.

In the House, however, only 16 representatives have said they will vote to authorize military action against Syria and 91 said either that they strongly oppose it or are leaning toward a 'no' vote. 

Another 88 have said they are undecided,
and 240 have made no public statements. At least 217 'yes' votes will 
be required to pass a House resolution.

Foreign affairs panels in the Senate and House will return to Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to hear testimony from Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel - a former Senate dove whose marching orders are now decidedly hawkish.

Rather than being part of an open debate, however, those presentations are seen as components of a White House persuasion effort aimed at sparing Mr Obama the defeat Mr Cameron experienced on Thursday.

As part of that effort, Mr Kerry and Mr Hagel, joined by National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, spoke to about 125 Democratic lawmakers during a conference call on Monday, with Mr Kerry insisting that Assad is a 'two-bit dictator' whose time has come and gone.

Assad, however, warned in the interview excerpts Le Figaro published online that military attacks against Syria could result in a regional war that would spiral out of control.

'The Middle East is a powder keg and the fire is approaching today,' he said. 'You can’t only talk about what the Syrian response will be, but what could happen after a first strike. And no one knows what would happen.'

'Everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will be widespread. The risk of a regional war exists.'
