A 6-year-old boy has become the latest victim to die after a woman allegedly drove into a crowd leaving a church Christmas service in California.

Samuel Gaza, 6, died late Thursday at a hospital. His mother, 36-year-old Martha Gaza, died earlier alongside two others: Mary Anne Wilson, 81, and Saeko Matsumura, 87, all of Torrance.

The boy, a kindergarten student at St. James Catholic School, was puled from under the tire of a vehicle and had been in critical condition until his tiny body gave up.

Margo Bronstein, 56, was arrested on five felonies for vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence of a drug causing injury.

'He didn’t seem to be in any pain,' eyewitness Michael Tovar  told KTLA. 

'The thing that touches me the most is the love that was surrounding me at that time — the gentlemen that were helping him. … I think his dad would be so happy to know that he wasn’t alone. 

Authorities are investigating what led driver Margo Bronstein to drive through a red light and into nearly a dozen people as they left a church Christmas event in Redondo Beach, also hitting another vehicle head-on. 

Bronstein, who was arrested at the scene, is believed to have taken prescription drugs, but investigators are waiting for the results of a toxicology test.

Bronstein was charged Friday with four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter and one count of driving under the influence of a drug causing injury. 

Five children and eight adults, including the suspect and the driver of another car, suffered injuries such as broken bones, abrasions and head trauma in the crash Wednesday night.

A message seeking comment left at a phone number listed for Bronstein was not immediately returned, and it wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney.

Officials said they do not have information linking her to any prior arrests or DUI-related incidents.

She had a perfect driving record but was restricted to driving a vehicle with hand-controlled brakes, an additional right-side mirror and adequate signaling device, according to Department of Motor Vehicle records.

The DMV had no record listing her as handicapped, however.

Friends and neighbors said she used crutches at times and a motorized wheelchair at longer distances, but they did not know why.

They said she is always friendly and deferential.

'She's very personable, very kind,' Vanecia Wiley, a manager at the senior housing community where Bronstein lives, told the Los Angeles Times. 'She doesn't want to be in anyone's way.'

The pedestrians on Wednesday night had just attended a student Christmas program at St. James Catholic Church when the motorist sped around the other vehicles in a white Saturn sedan and plowed into the crowd before hitting another car head-on, police Lt. Shawn Freeman said.
