Help could be at hand for aircraft passengers fed up with the sound of wailing babies, non-stop talkers or snorers.

An Israeli company that specialises in noise-reduction products says it has a solution which could put an end to fellow travellers being too loud.

Silentium has developed ‘Quiet Bubble’ technology that it claims creates quiet zones around passengers' heads by reducing noise pollution without the need for headphones.

Silentium says its Quiet Bubble technology can be embedded in aeroplane seats to cancel out ambient noise

Similar to noise-cancelling headphones, the system uses two to four speakers and four to eight microphones

The microchip-based technology cancels out surrounding noise and can be embedded in headrests on planes, effectively turning them into noise-cancelling aeroplane seats, according to the company.

Similar to noise-cancelling headphones, the system uses two to four speakers and four to eight microphones to electronically capture and silence ambient noise.

Silentium chief executive Yossi Barath said: ‘Silentium's noise reduction solutions focus on improving the quality of life.

‘We develop technology that allows manufacturers to introduce premium products and to elevate the “consumer experience”, while eliminating the stress, discomfort and health problems associated with exposure to noise.’ 

According to Silentium, the health effects include sleep disturbance, cardiovascular issues or hearing impairment. 

Silentium is making the technology available to manufacturers to develop new products or apply to existing products such as aircraft seats. 

The system can also be embedded in products in homes, offices, trains or vehicles.

In an effort to lure manufacturers, the company is touting the product at this month’s Aircraft Interiors Expo Americas in Seattle.

Aeroplane manufacturers are also developing or designing products that would allow travellers to fly in peace.

Airbus, the world’s leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, has made a patent application for a virtual reality isolation helmet that looks like something from a science fiction film.

Designed by Frenchman Bernard Guering, the helmet would allow the wearer to fully immerse themselves in in-flight entertainment as it cancels out all other peripheral noise.

Based on crude designs, the futuristic helmet would be mounted onto the back of a seat with a visor that pulls down over a passenger’s face and a high-tech headset that cancels out distracting peripheral noise.

The future of air travel? Each headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses and earphones

Each headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses for better viewing and earphones designed to be used while watching films, listening to music or playing video games.

The helmet would be capable of dispensing pleasant scents and it would deploy a mini-airbag during extreme turbulence to protect the passenger’s head.

But at this point it’s just an idea on paper and there is no guarantee the product will be developed and put into commercial use.
