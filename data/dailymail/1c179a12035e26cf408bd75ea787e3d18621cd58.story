‘His Serene Highness Prince Oliver von Mecklenburg-Schwerin’: Really Oliver Trusgnach, who was arrested in Spain after 11 years on the run

A fantasist who pretended to be a German aristocrat was jailed yesterday after being convicted of stealing more than £115,000 to fund his lavish lifestyle.

Belgian national Oliver Trusgnach, who is gay and called himself ‘His Serene Highness Prince Oliver von Mecklenburg-Schwerin’, was arrested in Spain after 11 years on the run.

He previously hit the headlines after falsely accusing former Belgian prime minister of sexually abusing him as a child.

A judge heard that Trusgnach, 39, spent three years forging his boss’s signature on cheques while working for a prestigious antiques dealer to fund a champagne and cocaine lifestyle and nights out in London. 

He had been appointed gallery manager at the HW Harvey antiques shop in Witney, Oxfordshire, in May 2000.

Alexandra Bull, prosecuting, told Oxford Crown Court that Trusgnach had stolen a total of £115,775 from the English furniture specialist until he fled the country in 2003.

She said: ‘A minimum of 77 cheques were stolen from the company, written out as payable to himself and Mr Harvey’s signature was forged.

‘Beyond the actual financial loss of course, there was also the loss of goodwill from Mr Harvey’s trade suppliers who were left unpaid.’

Trusgnach fled Britain and spent time at his parents’ home in Belgium before moving to Germany and then to Calle can Marti Feliu, in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

He was eventually tracked down after a Europe-wide manhunt and arrested last July. 

He admitted the fraud and theft charges at Oxford Crown Court in October.

Mark Dixon, defending, told the court that Trusgnach had stolen the cash because he had started living a lifestyle he could not afford on his £18,500 salary. 

‘He got into a party lifestyle in London and was spending money on alcohol and cocaine,’ he said.

Mr Dixon said Trusgnach was relieved to have been caught and appealed for leniency because his client pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. 

‘When the walls started to crumble and he was being spotted, he left and went home,’ he said.

However, jailing Trusgnach for two years and three months, Judge Ian Pringle said: ‘I can understand his relief but it probably pales in comparison to the relief of Mr and Mrs Harvey.’

Mr Harvey branded Trusgnach a ‘fantasist’ who lied to elevate his social position.

He said Trusgnach had been living in the Ditchley Park estate, Oxfordshire, with his boyfriend Brandon, who styled himself as Lord Dashwood of the Thomson publishing empire.

However, Mr Harvey had no idea about his party lifestyle and was told the pair had been at dinners at the German consul or out with dignitaries in London – not partying in Soho. 

Andrew Hennell, who employed Brandon Thomson at his antique store in Woodstock, added: ‘They both lived a great lifestyle in Ditchley Park. They were living it up.’

Mr Harvey branded the 27-month sentence ‘light’ compared with the damage Trusgnach’s crimes had done to the business his father founded in 1950.
