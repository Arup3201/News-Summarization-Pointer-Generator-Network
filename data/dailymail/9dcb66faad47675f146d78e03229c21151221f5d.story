A two-year-old boy dressed as Captain America was hit by a bus on his first ever trick-or-treat outing and died by his grandmother's side.

Dohntae Vasquez was thrilled about Halloween and had already been out with neighbors for several hours when the tragic accident happened.

He was being pushed in a buggy across State Road 27, in Lake Wales, Florida, by a neighbor when the man suddenly realized he had dropped his cellphone.

Tragic: Dohntae Vasquez was dressed as Captain America when he was fatally hit by a bus in Lake Wales, Florida on Friday night

He went back to get it, telling the toddler to stay put - but Dohntae jumped out of the buggy and ran towards his grandmother who was yet to cross the road.

After fatally hitting the toddler, the bus driver immediately stopped.

Adults present then tried to resuscitate the boy but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The bus driver was not speeding and told police she did not see the boy running into the street. She has not been charged.

A passer-by, called Carole, had stopped to buy drinks at a store by the highway and witnessed the accident.

Distraught: His grandmother was heard sobbing 'my baby, my baby' as Dohntae died by her side

The retired nurse told My Fox Tampa Bay: 'I came back out and I heard somebody screaming. My baby, my baby.

'There was nothing I could do. There was no saving the child I promised her I wouldn't leave her and I didn't until they took her by ambulance.

She poignantly added: 'They will never have him for any of the holidays. It's something no-one will ever forget.'

One neighbor, Mary Brady, said the toddler's neighborhood are in grieving, adding 'I can't get it out of my head'.

There was also tragedy in Vancouver on Halloween as a group were ploughed into by a drunk driver.

Three were critically injured, while a seven-year-old girl has since died after falling into a coma.

Cadence Boyer and her mother, 32-year-old Annie Arnold, were among a group of trick-or-treaters hit on Northeast 112th Avenue at 8:15 p.m. Friday, KPTV reports.

On Saturday, Vancouver police said Duane C. Abbott, 47, of Vancouver, was speeding and intoxicated when his Ford Mustang shit the group.

Police said Abbott was headed north on 112th when he hit the women and children, who were in Halloween costumes on a sidewalk near 39th.

A 6-year-old girl, who is yet to be identified, also suffered critical injures, as did 30-year-old Chelina Alsteen. Arnold has been treated and released from the hospital.

Jacob Holland, Alsteen's ex-husband, said she has made some improvements, but remains hospitalized with a shattered bone in her leg and a severe neck injury.  

Drink-driver Abbott is hospitalized and, pending discharge, will be booked into the Clark County Jail on four counts of vehicular assault, according to Vancouver police. 

Those charges may change depending on the conditions of the victims.
