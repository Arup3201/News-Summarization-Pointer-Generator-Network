Eric Trump and his new wife Lara (née Yunaska) have been spotted in Uruguay enjoying their first sun-soaked vacation as man and wife.

The 31-year-old son of billionaire businessman Donald Trump and his longtime love Lara, a 32-year-old producer for Inside Edition, were spotted over the weekend strolling happily along a beach in Punta del Este.

Lara, who broke both her wrists in a riding accident just two weeks before her wedding at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on November 8, is now cast-free and seemingly healed.
