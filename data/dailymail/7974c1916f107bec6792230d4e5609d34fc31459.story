Spanish newspaper Marca say Toni Kroos has been acting as the 'GPS' for Real Madrid.

His performance against Barcelona at the Bernabeu saw the midfielder 'dazzle' and the German's 94 per cent pass accuracy has been hailed by those in Spain. 

Interestingly, Marca add: 'Ancelotti unsettled him when explaining what he wanted: he wasn’t expecting to play so deep.' 

If that's Kroos playing unsettled, then the former Bayern Munich star can go far at the Bernabeu.

Over to Italy, and Tuttosport quote Zinedine Zidane as saying: '(Paul) Pogba is like me.'

Look away now Sir Alex Ferguson, because those in Italy believe the former Manchester United player has the potential to become the best in the world.

Even Pogba himself believes it. 'Yes, I dream of being the best in the world,' he says.

Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo report that Barcelona manager Enrique has demanded 'more pressure' from his host of stars at the Nou Camp.

Their 'top secret' report explains that 'the coach must return to his original exciting project'.

AS, on the other hand, focus on Real and their 'goal feast' from Cristiano Ronaldo and Co.
