Unusual: Funeral organiser Joanne Cummings used air conditioning in her vehicle to preserve a man's body in Western Australia

A pair of funeral directors had to store a body of a 200kg man in their car overnight after a Western Australian hospital rejected the corpse because it was too big.

Initially the couple - funeral organiser Jo-Anne Cummings and her partner Gavin Ness - wanted to store the man at Karratha Hospital, but were told by staff it would not fit in the fridge.

Last Wednesday when the body was refused, Ms Cummings and Mr Ness had to drive almost 200km from Roebourne to Hedland Health Campus.

But on arrival the body was unable to be moved because the equipment to transport it from the car was already being used by another corpse.

Ms Cummings said clear communication from Hedland staff could have stopped them driving there and back, with the body in the car.

The owners of Pilbara Funeral Services had no other choice but to preserve the man's corpse by using their car's air conditioning.

They had to kept the car running throughout the night, burning through three tanks of fuel, until they were able to get a chilling container the next morning to store the body in.

'It was about 8pm when we got to Hedland and then we had turn the car around and go back home with the deceased in the car,' Ms Cummings said.

'We had to check on him every half hour because it was just sitting in the driveway and to keep the temperature down.'

A corpse should be kept between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees for the first couple of days.

But Ms Cummings said this was not the first incident of its kind.

A year ago, the same issue came up and Ms Cummings had alerted health officials to the problem then, but it still had not been addressed.

'The initial incident happened about a year ago and we turned up with a 250kg man at the Hedland Hospital,' she said.

'The hospital services manager took one look at him and basically said he’s too fat he won’t fit in the car in front of two police officers and my husband and myself.

'That's the kind of offhand comment we had to deal with.

'We have a population that is larger and it’s not just going to go away.'

Not equipped: A spokesperson for Hedland Health Campus (pictured) said they 'only have equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg'

Long journey: Ms Cummings drove to the morgue at Hedland Health Campus, Colebatch Way, South Hedland, she then had to drive to hours back to her home in Roebourne with the body still in the car

Ms Cummings said the hospital's past failure to act was disrespecting the deceased and their family.

'If it was your child or relative in my car, you wouldn’t like that,' she said.

'They go through a rough enough time without having to worry about where to store their body.'

Ron Wynn Regional Director WA Country Health Service-Pilbara told MailOnline: 'Currently the Hedland Health Campus only has equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg and is not equipped to transfer bodies in caskets.

'Special arrangements have to be made to store bodies weighing more and for those in caskets,' he said.

'We will investigate installing equipment which has a capacity of up to 300kg.'

He also explained that Ms Cummings' arrangement to store bodies at the hospital morgue was on a 'good will' basis.

'The Pilbara Funeral Service does not have body storage facilities in Port Hedland and Karratha and therefore the hospital mortuaries have assisted. However; the Newman funeral director does have storage. 

Shocking: The body of a 200-kilogram man was kept inside Joanne Cumming's car last Wednesday night after the morgue refused to take it

'The WA Country Health Service-Pilbara staff will meet with representatives of Pilbara Funeral Services to develop a formal agreement for receiving and storing deceased persons at Hedland Health Campus. This is currently carried out on a good will basis and there is no fee for this service.

'Hedland Health Campus staff have assisted with the transfer and handling of deceased persons from Pilbara Funeral Services and when the Funeral Director has not been available staff have conducted viewings for the deceased’s family,' Mr Wynn said.

He added: 'It is imperative that at all times a deceased person is treated with the utmost care and respect and viewings are arranged so as not to cause distress and inconvenience to grieving families. We endeavour to do this in all WA Country Service hospitals.'

Ms Cummings was hopeful a positive result would come out of talks with them and the health service.
