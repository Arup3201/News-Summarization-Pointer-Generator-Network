Around 36,000 tickets have been sold to see the two best players in the world - Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - compete at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

The friendly clash, organised by Argentine event producers Torneos y Competencias and World Eleven, sees Ronaldo return to Old Trafford having played for Manchester United between 2003 and 2009.

But only the 'inner bowl' of the stadium will be used for the clash, with the top two blocks of the Sir Alex Ferguson stand and the top tier of the West and East stands shut.

Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates showed off their skills during a brief training session on Monday night

This means only 40,000 tickets are available to supporters, well short of the 75,731 capacity at the Theatre of Dreams.

Last Wednesday it emerged only 15,000 had been sold, with match organiser Leo Morales voicing his concern to Bloomberg. He said: 'I don't know why we haven't had more sales.'

The tickets range from £40 to £60 for adults and £20 to £30 for juniors, while students at Salford University could purchase a ticket for £21.

Argentina captain Lionel Messi will hope to show on Tuesday night that he is still on a level with Ronaldo

The match sees Barcelona star Messi up against Real Madrid's Ronaldo, after Argentina played in London last week against Croatia at Upton Park.

Between them, Messi and Ronaldo have won the last six Ballon d’Or prizes – in both guises – and share 35 major honours, including five Champions League titles.

Argentina won the last match these nations played, a friendly in at the Stade de Geneve in Switzerland in February 2011, when Messi scored a last-minute penalty to render Ronaldo’s goal meaningless. Angel di Maria also scored.
