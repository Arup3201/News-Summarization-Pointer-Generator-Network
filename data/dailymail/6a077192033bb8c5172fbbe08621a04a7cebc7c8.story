On Tuesday, Gutierrez revealed that a collision with Arsenal's Bacary Sagna on the final day of the 2012-13 Barclays Premier League season led to the scan which detected his testicular cancer.

'From then I had a lot of pain that wouldn't go away. I spoke with the doctor straight after and he said: "If it doesn't hurt then don't worry".

'Then it was holiday time and I felt the pain more in the testicle. The season started and in September and October I noticed that the testicle started to become inflamed. I felt a pain when I put my underpants on, it was uncomfortable.

'I went back to the doctor and they told me to have an ultrasound scan and they detected a tumour and told me I needed an operation. I left the clinic crying and went home and told my dad who was there.

'I spoke to the club and said because of the delicate nature of the problem and because in Argentina I was going to understand everything being told to me better, I wanted to be treated there.'

Gutierrez was left writhing around on the floor in agony after the challenge by the full-back
