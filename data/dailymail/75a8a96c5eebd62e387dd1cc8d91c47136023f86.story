The Baftas last night saw an impressive array of leading ladies squeezed into the slinkiest of designer dresses.

Many looked as though they’d been dieting for months to iron out the creases. But, as I’ve discovered, looks can be deceiving.

A revolutionary treatment that looks like a cling film body wrap claims to trim or ‘melt’ up to six inches of fat from your bottom, hips and tummy within an hour.

Too good to be true? Most possibly. But as a busy mother, I’m up for giving anything a go.

Since having my son Mckenzie, six, I’ve yo-yo’d from a size 14 back to a ten — my pre-baby size.

It's a wrap: Kathryn Blundell lost an impressive five inches after her unusual treatment

Today, I’m a large size 12 after an over-indulgent winter. It makes me unhappy — I have a dressing room full of beautiful dresses I can’t wear.

So, with renewed motivation, I find myself in the hands of Vicky Kerrigan, a beauty therapist who performs the Shrinking Violet treatment. I wince when I hear the price — £55 just to be wrapped in cling film?

But it’s far cheaper than liposuction and I’m desperate to get into a nice frock for the weekend, plus the treatment is available nationwide in spa and beauty clinics.

It involves applying an oil-based solution to exfoliated skin, then being wrapped tightly in a heat-inducing cling film-type material for an hour. As well as reducing fat, the makers claim it can also improve the look of cellulite and stretchmarks.

How? Well, apparently the mix of essential oils used in the solution includes juniper, lavender and cypress. They aid phosphatidylcholine — a chemical substance that triggers lipolysis, the process of breaking down certain fats from cells so they can be processed by the liver.

The treatment is popular with women who are looking to get into a tight frock for a special event. Vicky says all her clients have lost at least  some fat.

Indeed, one apparently lost an astonishing 14 in after just three treatments.

It starts with a three-day liver cleanse, where alcohol, caffeine and fatty and processed foods are forbidden.

One could be forgiven for wondering whether it’s this diet, rather than the wrap, that gives the ‘miraculous’ results.

But the theory is that as the liver will need to process the fat released from cells during the treatment, it needs to be in as good a shape as possible.

The more fat your liver can deal with, the more inches you’ll lose, I’m told.

I also have to up my water intake — according to Vicky, if I’m dehydrated, cells could retain fluid, which make it unlikely that I’ll see any results.

I have to stick with this strict diet plan for three days after the  treatment as the fat loss  will continue.

On the day of the treatment, Vicky measures 13 points on my body including my upper arms, waist and calves.

I then lie face-down on the bed while she massages in  the oily solution, starting  with my legs before moving up to the arms. 

Oiled up, it’s time to wrap. I feel a bit like a marinated chicken waiting to be cooked.

I stand up so Vicky can wrap me up using her giant  roll of film.

This is said to create a  barrier around the treatment area. The heat from being wrapped in the film also helps open your pores so the oil is fully absorbed.

While I look and feel as though I’ve been wrapped in bog-standard supermarket cling film, the wrap is actually made from a plant-based material.

It’s tight, but not uncomfortably so. I itch a little, which is normal. I can see why this treatment might not be suitable for people who suffer with claustrophobia.

I’m then covered with a light plastic sheet and fluffy duvet. It all begins to feel rather relaxing. Surely sweating out water must be the secret, as with some other wraps?

‘No, you might be warm, but I make sure you don’t sweat. In fact, we want you to keep drinking before, during and after the treatment to help your liver,’ says Vicky.

True to her word, she checks my temperature throughout and constantly offers me sips of water. At the end of the hour, the duvet is peeled back and I’m cut free from the wrap.

Now it’s time to be measured again. Startlingly, I’ve lost 0.2 in off each calf and my arms, 0.4 in off my waist and 1 in off my hips. My tummy and — bizarrely — my right knee have stayed the same, though my left knee has dropped 0.2 in.

I’ve lost 0.6 in from each upper thigh, and 0.4 in each for the lower thighs. That’s almost 5 in in total, which is at the upper end of the average loss. I’m elated! And my skin looks and feels great.

The trick is to see if the inch loss continues, so I measure myself again 24, 36 and 60 hours later, trying to be as accurate as possible.

Cling film was invented as a waterproof coating for planes in World War II

While I expect my measurements to go back to normal virtually immediately, I’m delighted to find that after 60 hours there is still a difference compared to before the cling film wrap.

I’ve still lost 1.2 in off my hips, 0.6 in off my lower thighs and 0.2 in off my upper thighs — a total loss of 2 in.

A few more days later and those inches still haven’t gone back on.

I can’t help but think this is the perfect quick-fix  weight-loss trick, ideal to get into that tight party dress for the weekend.

Not bad for an hour in bed!
