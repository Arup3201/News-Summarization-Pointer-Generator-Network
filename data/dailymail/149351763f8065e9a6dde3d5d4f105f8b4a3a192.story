Jonathan Somic is overweight, unemployed and lives with his parents but now that he has $200,000 cash in his pocket – he plans on resembling sizzling hot actor Tom Hardy.

After watching himself on the TV screen when he won $212,000 on the Million Dollar Minute show on Tuesday night Mr Somic promptly signed up to a hard core boot camp in Thailand for three months for a complete transformation.

‘I thought “ooh I’m taking up a bit of that screen”,’ he said. ‘I’m hoping to look like a different person - I want to look like Tom Hardy in the movie Bronson.’

‘I would rather have a bit of heft and muscle on me but just a little bit less marshmallow,’ he said when comparing himself to the notorious prisoner Michael Gordon Peterson played by Hardy in the film.

The 26-year-old ballooned to 150kg - the heaviest he has ever weighed, after he lost his job in November and became complacent about his lifestyle

The money couldn’t come at a better time for the biomedicine university student who had to get his father to drive him to the TV studio to appear on the show because he couldn’t afford the bus fare.

The 26-year-old ballooned to 150kg – the heaviest he has ever weighed, after lost his job in November and became complacent about his lifestyle.

‘I’m quite a bad cook and a bit lazy – it creeps on you,’ he explains. ‘You don’t have money to go out but you’ve always got enough to maybe get a pizza or a takeaway and sit at home.’

The Melbourne resident gave up drinking coffee and smoking to cut costs but his appetite naturally increased.

‘When I smoked I rarely had ice cream and now I can’t get enough of it,’ he said. ‘It’s easier to be healthy when you’ve got money – it’s easy to be big when you’re poor.’

The 26-year-old has become the fastest contestant to win big on Million Dollar Minute on Tuesday, scoring $212,000 in five episodes with no losses

Mr Somic plans to lose 20kg before he leaves for Thailand in November and hopes to shed a further  10- 20kgs at the intense holistic retreat.

‘I’m tiring myself out just talking about it but I plan to take nothing over with me and just live the full bare bones dorm life there,’ he said before he takes a month-long European trip with his girlfriend.

He lost 11kg in five weeks about four years ago when he signed up to a similar camp in Thailand.

‘But then my mates came over at Christmas and a little tipple turned into a lot and the 11kg very quickly became 5 or 6kg,’ he said.

Somic is looking forward to buying a brand new wardrobe when the weight starts to fall off.

But he doesn’t plan on blowing all of the cash he won - he has paid off $8,000 in credit card debt.

‘That was a nice feeling after only being able to pay the minimum for 18 months,’ he said.

His mates have started asking for a slice of the $212,000 pie on Facebook

The 26-year-old has become the fastest contestant to win big on Million Dollar Minute on Tuesday, scoring $212,000 in five episodes with no losses.

After he won the cash he didn’t have enough credit on his phone to call his dad with the good news.

‘I made two complete guesses in that final round and I thought ‘no way’ – I cannot risk it to play on any more – I couldn’t bear the thought of losing that much money,’ he told TV Tonight.

The show’s host Simon Reeve described Mr Somic as the ‘fastest and funniest contestant who has pushed a buzzer on Million Dollar Minute’.

‘He brought with him a formidable intelligence and a cracking sense of humour that had all of us in stitches,” Reeve said.

Mr Somic said he had been receiving messages from friends who were surprised by his intellect.

'They are saying "I never knew you were so smart" - it's quite insulting,' he joked.
