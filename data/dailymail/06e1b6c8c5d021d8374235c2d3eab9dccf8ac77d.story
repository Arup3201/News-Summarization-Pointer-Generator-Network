Ruling: Former Daybreak presenter Angela Corpe has lost her employment tribunal against ITV

A presenter on morning TV show Daybreak who claimed she was bullied by her boss following an ectopic pregnancy has lost her sex discrimination claim.

Angela Corpe, 36, alleged she returned 
from sick leave last August to be told by Daybreak boss Ian Rumsey, who 
was once married to the show's main presenter Kate Garraway, that she had 
been overlooked for the job of pool producer on the show.

She claimed Mr Rumsey began a 
meeting between the two of them by saying 'I hope you don’t think your 
ectopic pregnancy had anything to do with not getting the job' before 
behaving in a 'belligerent, rude and aggressive' manner.

Daybreak admitted they had treated her unfairly by not advertising the role and choosing a candidate who had recently applied for another producer job.

However, Miss Corpe lost her claim for sexual discrimination after an employment tribunal ruled that although the recruitment process was unfair, it did not have anything to with her gender or pregnancy.

Giving evidence earlier in the hearing  Mr Rumsey, who no longer works on the breakfast show, said the post had to be filled quickly as that was the nature of TV and he did not think Miss Corpe was interested in the role as her main ambition was to be a reporter.

He claimed he was ‘hurt, shocked and appalled’ by the allegations against him and said he had always been ‘completely supportive’ of Miss Corpe and was saddened when he heard about her loss.

Miss Corpe had argued that she had been convinced she would be offered the job of pool producer, after 
covering it during someone else's maternity leave.

She told the hearing Mr Rumsey had praised her work in the past and told her she was 'very good' at her job.

But after returning to work 
after taking time off to recover from her miscarriage, Ms Corpe was told
that to be eligible for the job, she must have 
already applied for a day producer job, which involved 23 hour shifts 
and sleeping in the studio one night a week.

She added it was a 'ridiculous suggestion' that she should apply for a
job she did not want in the hope in of being offeredone that she
did want.

She told the tribunal in Croydon that at their meeting Mr Rumsey steadfastly 
refused to re-advertise the position and told her he had assumed she did
not want it since she did not apply for the Daytime producer role.

She said: 'He kept telling me what’s done is done and they would not re-advertise the role or consider other candidates.'

She said: 'I believe his exclusion of me was deliberate and the 
exclusion of others who may or may not have applied was a by-product.

Accusations: Ms Corpe's former boss, Ian Rumsey, who was accused of 
threatening and bullying behaviour, is the former husband of Kate 
Garraway

Allegation: Ms Corpe claimed she was passed over for a promotion after taking time off work because of an ectopic pregnancy

'I believe it was on the basis of my ectopic pregnancy because I 
cannot think of anything else he would be able to complain about.'

After the fiery September meeting Ms Corpe said she had cried in the toilet before facing her colleagues in the newsroom.

Mr Rumsey himself has since left ITV 
after network bosses accepted his resignation given the failure of 
Daybreak to attract an audience.

He told the tribunal: 'As a husband and father, my wife and
I have been through various good and bad experiences in pregnancy.

'My first and only reaction was of sadness for Angela and full support for her.

'In all similar matters I’ve acted in a way I would expect any manager to treat my wife.

'In
every circumstance where female workers have told me they are pregnant I
have always been happy for them and told them of my own experiences.

'They
should take great care to look after themselves, with work being far 
less important that their health and the health of their child.

'Angela
seemed to appreciate the support I had given her and she certainly did 
not raise any complaint with me at that time that I was not being 
supportive.'

He married Ms Garraway 1998. They divorced in April 2002.

Still employed by ITV: Ms Corpe has taken on a presenter/producer role elsewhere at the network

Nick
Goodfellow, representing ITV, said Ms Corpe had completely 
misrepresented the meeting with Mr Rumsey and she entered the meeting in
an 'agitated state'.

Under cross-examination he read from emails where Mr Rumsey was 'sympathetic and kind' on learning about her miscarriage.

Delivering the panels judgment, 
employment judge Christopher Baron said they accepted Mr Rumsey’s 
evidence was a ‘reasonable explanation’ for what he did.

Mr Baron added: 'He was misguided, that is accepted. It is not in 
dispute that what occurred was far from being best practise in 
accordance with the European and Human Rights Commission code or the 
company’s equal opportunities policy.

'However, what occurred had nothing to do with the claimant’s pregnancy or her gender.

'It may have been unfair, it may have been unreasonable, but we find it 
was not in breach of the Equalities Act. Therefore the claim fails.'

Miss Corpe, a former Sky News 
reporter, has since accepted a £37,000 a year role with ITV as a 
reporter/producer after being offered the job following the grievance 
process.

She looked upset and declined to comment after hearing the judgment.

Representatives for Daybreak also refused to comment on the outcome.
