It is meant to be the happiest day of a woman's life.

But looking at Amy Guy's sour expression in wedding photos, you'd be forgiven for thinking the opposite. 

However rather than being miserable, the 34-year-old simply cannot smile - due to a rare, potentially deadly condition that destroys muscles. 

The mother-of-two suffers from a rare autoimmune condition called myasthenia gravis, which causes certain muscles - including those that control facial expressions - to become weak.

The condition means  Ms Guy often thinks she is smiling - even when her face is pulled into a pained grimace.

Photos on both her wedding day and the day her daughter was born show her looking pained and miserable - even though she was anything but. 

'Fortunately [despite my condition] my daughter Megan was born healthy,' said Ms Guy, an activities manager.

'It was one of the happiest days of my life, but in the pictures I look so miserable.'   

Ms Guy, from Totton, Southampton, was just 14 when she lost her ability to smile. 

For weeks before, she had been suffering from slurred speech and aching joints. 

Then one day, as a friend tickled her, she caught sight of her reflection in a mirror.  

Despite laughing heartily, her face was pulling an ugly, pained grimace, baring her teeth. 

'I was really scared and began to cry,' she recalled. 

Doctors initially put her intermittent symptoms down to 'growing pains' but as the months passed, they became more frequent and debilitating.

She said: 'One of my eyes started to droop occasionally and people in the street would ask if I was drunk.

'I was just a schoolgirl and so embarrassed.'

Then a few weeks later, at her Saturday job, she suddenly collapsed and was referred to hospital.

It was there that she and her mother met a doctor who, by chance, had recently been on a course and heard of a rare condition called myasthenia gravis. 

Myasthenia gravis is a rare long-term condition.

It mainly affects muscles that are controlled voluntarily – often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and talking.

Sometimes, the muscles that control breathing, neck and limb movements are also affected.

The muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis is usually worse during physical activity and improves with rest.

Tests confirmed Ms Guy had the life-threatening condition, for which there is no cure.

'At last I had a diagnosis, but it was difficult to take in how it was going to affect my life,' she said.

'Three months later, I was too ill to go to school anymore. Five months after my diagnosis, I was in a wheelchair.'

Myasthenia gravis is caused by the body's immune system attacking healthy cells. 

Antibodies then block and damage muscle receptor cells affecting the body's ability to control nerves and muscles.

Those most affected are muscles that are controlled voluntarily – often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and talking. 

Due to the intermittent nature of the condition, there were days when Ms Guy could walk and smile, and others she could barely get out of bed.

The mother-of-two said: 'Even if my face can't express it, my girls know I'm smiling on the inside'

'The medication didn't work very well at first,' she said. 'I had an operation and that helped a bit but sometimes I couldn't smile, my eyes drooped and I couldn't even use my arms and legs very well.'

Despite being warned she might not have the strength to get through pregnancy, she longed for a family of her own and was overjoyed to discover she was expecting in her early 20's, before marrying at 23. 

But after her marriage broke down, she is now raising her daughters,  Megan, 14, and Teagan, four, alone.

She said: 'They help around the house wherever possible and know that sometimes mum gets wobbly or can only smile with her words. 

'We have a special way of communicating.' 

Ms Guy has fought hard over the last 20 years to raise the profile of the MG Association.

She is now writing her autobiography and has already raised more than £2,500 for research into the condition.

She said: 'I've always wanted to show my girls that, even with a disability, you can still achieve your goals. 

'No-one can tell me exactly what will happen in the future, but I live for the moment.'

'Even if my face can't express it, my girls know I'm smiling on the inside.'
