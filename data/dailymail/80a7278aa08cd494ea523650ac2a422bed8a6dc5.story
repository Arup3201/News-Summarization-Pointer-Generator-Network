A crucial plot point in the finale of Breaking Bad was inspired by a 16-year-old fan of the show who died from a rare form of cancer before he ever got to see Sunday evening’s finale.

Kevin Cordasco died from neuroblastoma earlier this year after fighting the rare form of brain cancer for seven years.

A massive fan of the show, Cordasco got to meet Bryan Cranston, who plays Walter White, after a friend of his mom contacted the actor.

Touching tribute: Super fan Kevin Cordasco, who died from cancer earlier this year, helped to influence how the show ends

Breaking Bad, the story of a struggling high school chemistry teacher who becomes a drug dealer, ends on Sunday after five seasons

Cranston visited Cordasco in hospital last September and recalls how impressed he was by the teenager’s devotion to the show.

‘Bright, personable, and knowledgeable, he wasn’t just a fan, he was into the structure of the story, the complexity,’ Cranston told Forbes.

The show’s creator Vince Gilligan also visited Cordasco last October - giving him Danny Trejo’s severed head as a keepsake - he too was impressed by Cordasco’s devotion to the show.

‘I think he was our number one fan ever for Breaking Bad,’ Gilligan said. ‘He was so smart and astute about the show.’

Sadly plans to fly Cordasco to Albuquerque to film a cameo never happened because of his declining health, although he did visit the writer’s room in Los Angeles and once again he left a lasting impression on the people who make the show.

‘I was so happy to meet him,’ said writer-producer Tom Schnauz. ‘He was such a smart, kid so full of life. We got to hang out in the writer’s room and joke and have a good time.’

When Gilligan met Cordasco he had asked him what he’d like to see on show.

‘I came back and reported [what he said] to the writer’s room, and it colored our perception of the show. We added something to these final eight episodes that we wouldn’t have otherwise if Kevin hadn’t mentioned that,’ he recently recalled on the show's Insider Podcast.

Cordasco told Gilligan that he wanted to know more about two secondary characters - Gretchen and Elliott - who had appeared near the start of the show.

In the first season of Breaking Bad, we had learned that Walter White together with Gretchen and Elliott had founded a company called Gray Matter when they were in graduate school

In the first season of Breaking Bad, we had learned that Walter White together with Gretchen and Elliott had founded a company called Gray Matter when they were in graduate school.

We also learned that Gretchen had been Walt’s girlfriend and that after they split up he left the company and sold his share for just $5,000.

Then years later Grey Matter had grown into a $2 billion dollar tech company, while White was a struggling school teacher who had just learned he had cancer.

When Gretchen and Elliott offered to pay for Walt’s cancer treatment, he and instead decided to cook meth to pay for his treatment.

Despite being just 16-years-old, Cordasco was intrigued by the impact that White’s relationship with Gretchen and Elliott had had on the rest of his life.

As a tribute to the teenager who died from cancer earlier this year, the first episode of the final eight had been dedicated to 'Our Friend Kevin Cordasco'

The teenager’s interest in the secondary characters prompted Gilligan to speak with the writers about how they could be re-introduced at the story at the end.

Gilligan also offered to tell Cordasco how the series ended, but the teenager said he would prefer to watch.Sadly that wasn’t to be as he died on March 11.

As a tribute to him, the first episode of the final eight had been dedicated to ‘Our Friend Kevin Cordasco.’

Kevin's mother, Melodie said that her son would have been overjoyed at the acknowledgement.

She said: 'It was just heartwarming; I know my son was sitting there, watching it (saying) ''Mom, Look, I made it." It was overwhelming - the feeling, the love and support.'

Kevin's father, Kevin Senior, said his son identified with main character Walter who also has cancer.

His
father said: 'Bryan Cranston is diagnosed with what could have been a 
terminal illness, a cancer in the first episode. He then began to live 
his life.

'I think that 
Kevin connected with that character, moving forward and never looking 
back, never asking why...(Kevin) didn’t let his cancer stop him from 
doing anything.'

His mother said that Bryan - a father himself - made her son feel very special.

'He was just a great guy to Kevin. Every time Kevin would email him, 
Bryan Cranston within half an hour would respond back to Kevin.'
