This is the shocking moment two arsonists broke into a restaurant and set off a massive explosion.

The incident at Republica in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda on Thursday morning was captured on the restaurant's security cameras.

CCTV footage shows two people, dressed in hooded coveralls, breaking into the restaurant shortly before 4am and using jerry cans to spread fuel across the floor and furniture.

One of the arsonists uses a lighter to start a fire as they run to leave the premises and the place is quickly engulfed in flames. 

Fire crews were called to the restaurant at about 4am and managed to contain the fire to the ground floor of the two-storey building.

The fire is believed to have caused $500,000 worth of damage and has forced the owners to close in the lead up to Christmas.

It's the second fire at the beachside St Kilda restaurant in a matter of weeks.

The latest incident comes just four weeks after three people were spotted throwing molotov cocktails at the restaurant, starting a fire which caused about $50,000 damage. 

Last month, the restaurant's owners posted a photo to Facebook saying 'We're Back! Thank you for all your support and patience'.

Detectives are now investigating whether the two fires are linked.
