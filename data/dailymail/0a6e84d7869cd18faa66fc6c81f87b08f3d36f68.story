Two people were killed when a car crashed through a guardrail and plunged about 75ft off a California freeway overpass yesterday, but their dog survived the horror smash. 

A 44-year-old man, who has not yet been identified, and his passenger, Gwen Bolden, 50, died at the scene after their two-door Mercedes Benz left the 118 Freeway overpass in Chatsworth. 

No one else was involved in the crash, the cause of which is still being determined.

A dog was found alive with barely a scratch on it inside the mangled vehicle and was taken to an animal shelter. 

Pictures of the animal, which had a tag bearing the name 'Harley', on television reports showed it to be in good health. 

According to the California Highway Patrol the driver, who was travelling eastbound, made an 'unsafe turning movement', before the crash at about 12.16am. The car landed on its roof below the freeway.

Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey told the New York Daily News: 'The vehicle was heavily damaged and sadly two occupants proved beyond our help and were pronounced dead at the scene.'

The highway patrol issued a SigAlert shortly after 2.30am and the De Soto offramp was closed. The notice remained in place until about 10am.
