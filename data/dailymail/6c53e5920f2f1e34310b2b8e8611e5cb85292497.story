BBC show Holby City has been accused of risking lives with a 'reckless' portrayal of organ donation - prompting potential life savers to come off the donor list.

Five million viewers watched this week's episode which centred on a heart-swap plot about a brain dead teenage girl and another who needed a transplant.

But NHS Blood and Transplant, which is responsible for organ donation, has criticised the episode which bosses say was full of inaccuracies.

It says the episode caused an undisclosed number of people to remove themselves from the official donor list - meaning their organs will not be available.

In a scathing letter of complaint, the organ authority accused the BBC of 'irresponsibly jeopardising' their work.

Medics said the BBC went ahead with the 'wholly inaccurate' episode after ignoring concerns about the story line from a top transplant nurse

The letter said: 'Despite her sharing professional concerns about the proposed storyline, these scenes were nevertheless retained, presumably for the purpose of creating a more controversial storyline.

'The bodies of recently dead were portrayed as commodities and the wishes of grieving relatives treated with callous disregard. It was in our view inexcusable and reckless.'

The organ authority added: 'We have already been contacted by people asking to be taken off the Organ Donor Register as a direct result of having seen this programme.

'The fictional depiction of organ 
donation was a wholly inaccurate portrayal of the organ donation and 
transplantation system in the UK.

'Organ
donation and transplantation depend on high quality processes within 
hospitals, public trust and transparency and supporting families 
professionally at all times throughout the donation process.

'Depictions such as this may have irresponsibly jeopardised that trust.'

Among
the string of inaccuracies in Tuesday's primetime episode, the mother 
of the donor girl - who had been left brain dead after an accident - met
the recipient's family before the donation.

She
also talked to the transplant team and even witnessed the first 
incision into her daughter's chest - despite withdrawing her consent for
the operation.

Associate medical director Prof James
Neuberger and national clinical lead Dr Paul Murphy warned the 
inaccurate episode could have fatal consequences.

In a letter, the pair said it could mean 'fewer will become donors and fewer will get life-saving transplants.

'If
we are going to save more lives through transplantation then the public
need to believe in the system that supports donation,' they added.

'Those responsible for this episode of Holby City threaten this and have done nothing but harm.'After
receiving 48 complaints, the BBC said the episode was not meant to be 
accurate and future episodes would address the consequences of breaches 
in protocol.

But critics 
pointed out that many of the 4.8million viewers who tuned in may not see
the rest of the series and could be left with a false impression of 
organ donation.

But a BBC spokesman said: 'Holby City has the utmost respect for real life medical professionals and in no way was it our intention to suggest that our portrayal of a heart transplant was an accurate reflection of how such a scenario would typically be handled within the NHS.

'As with all storylines we worked closely with medical experts who advised on transplant protocols but the purpose of this storyline is to dramatise the consequences that could arise should the correct protocols be wilfully ignored.

'This is an on-going story and in the weeks to come viewers will see the main character Mo face up to the fallout of her actions.'
