Borussia Dortmund fans are well-known for their impressive vocal displays during matches, and they proved their reputation once again as they joined in a superb rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone at Anfield on Sunday.

The German club were on Merseyside for a pre-season friendly, but the 1,000+ fans who made the journey were determined to make themselves heard.

Having taken the Anfield anthem to their hearts in recent years, the noise before the game was sensational, and it was captured in the ground by Borussia Dortmund's official Instagram account. 

Unfortunately for the travelling fans, however, the result did not match the support as Dortmund went down 4-0 to a rampant Liverpool attack.

Daniel Sturridge opened the scoring after 10 minutes, before Dejan Lovren netted from a corner just a few minutes later.

Phillippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson then added to the scoreline after half time, but it did not dampen the German fans spirits, who sang right through until the end.
