A mother-of-two miraculously found her engagement and wedding rings two days after losing them on a crowded beach.

Laura Curry thought she had seen the last of her wedding and engagement rings after she left them on packed Poldhu Cove, one of the largest beaches on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall.

However, she made a desperate plea on Facebook for a metal detector and returned to search for her missing jewellery.

Laura, from Millbrook, in Cornwall, took off the rings before putting sun cream on her children Heidi, three, and Dylan, one, and then forgot all about them.

Lost and found: Laura Curry with her wedding and engagement rings which were lost on the beach near Mullion, Cornwall and then found two days later using a metal detector

Laura, who married Royal Navy sailor Paul five years ago, said she put the rings- which were worth £3000 in total- in the inside pocket of a beach tent.

'Unfortunately I then became distracted by my daughter - and ice creams - and completely forgot to put my rings back on.

She now believes the rings went flying when she shook the sand out of the beach tent.

'I didn't realise I wasn't wearing them until about four hours later back at the caravan park where some friends were staying.'

Lost and found: Laura, who married Royal Navy sailor Paul five years ago, said the rings she lost on the beach were particularly meaningful. She helped to design her engagement ring, and a friend made the wedding band

She rummaged through the car and the beach tent, but there was no sign of the rings so she drove back to the beach and spent 40 minutes searching in vain.

'I had to tearfully return home to Millbrook and explain to my husband that I'd lost them.

'He was understandably irritated with me,' she said.

Adding to her anguish was the fact the rings were 
particularly meaningful: Laura helped to design her engagement ring, and a
friend made the wedding band.

Over the moon: The rings lay forgotten in the sand for two whole days and Laura couldn't be happier when she saw them sticking out of the sand

As a last-ditch effort, and without much hope, Laura and Paul put a post on Facebook asking for the loan or hire of a metal detector.

A Torpoint woman dropped off one and a hire company delivered a second detector.

'I was unable to get back to the beach until the Friday. By this time I was convinced I wouldn't find them but felt I had to do this for peace of mind.

'Thursday and Friday were just awful in the house, thinking, "Oh God, what am I going to do?"

On Friday afternoon Laura, husband Paul and their children made the one-and-a-half-hour journey back to the Lizard.

'I had a vague idea of where we were sitting, but when we arrived I thought, "Oh God, it's so much bigger than I remembered."

'There were kids with buckets and spades throwing sand everywhere.'

'We found tent peg after tent peg.

'Then, suddenly, I looked to my left and saw my wedding ring sticking out of the sand.

'I squealed and cried at the same time.'

She said two other families joined in the hunt for her engagement ring, which she found after an hour of looking, and others wished them well.

Eventually Paul found the second ring just a couple of metres from the first.

'Paul was annoyed to start with, but he was very understanding,' Laura said.

'He always loses things and I thought, "This is horrendous. I'll never be able to say anything about that again".'

She added: 'It's incredible really that they were there two days later.

'Anybody could have picked them up from the sand or the tide and waves could have swept them away or even totally buried them.

'It's a fantastic result.'

Determined: On Friday afternoon she and husband Paul with their children made the one-and-a-half-hour journey back to the Lizard - one of Cornwall's largest beaches - to look for them
