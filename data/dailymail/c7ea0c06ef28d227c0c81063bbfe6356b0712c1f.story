Shot dead: Clare Sly, 38, who was found gunned down in her home in Walsall early this morning

A 23-year-old man and his girlfriend are being held on suspicion of 
shooting dead his own mother and her partner in the early hours of this 
morning, neighbours have claimed.

The victims, named locally as teaching
assistant Clare Sly, 38, and her 43-year-old partner Decker Vassall 
were gunned down at their home after neighbours heard rowing at the 
property.

Their bodies were 
discovered at 1.37am at a house on Laneside Gardens, in the Birchills 
area of Walsall, West Midlands. Paramedics tried to revive the pair but 
both died at the scene.

Soon after police arrested a 
23-year-old man, believed to be Ms Sly's son Anthony Vassell, and a 
22-year-old woman, believed to be his girlfriend.

They are understood to have to have 
lived just 15 metres away from Clare's house with her mother Eileen Sly,
69. Any possible motive for the killing is still unclear.

Ms Sly has two more sons, aged around 10.

At Laneside Gardens - a cul-de-sac 
with a path running down the middle - two terraced houses opposite each 
other were being combed by police and forensic teams this morning.

Locals said teaching assistant Ms Sly 
lived at number nine Laneside Gardens and it is understood her son 
Anthony lived with his grandmother at number five.

Some neighbours said Ms Sly worked at 
the nearby Allumwell Junior School. Others said they heard screams 
coming from the house before the shooting.

One said: 'People often cut through from the local pub and it sounded like they were heading in that direction.'

The neighbour added: 'I didn't know 
the woman well but I know that she was a decent, hard-working woman. The
man who was shot is known as 'Decker' but I don't know his real name.

'Apparently she was Clare Sly and her son Anthony has been arrested. It's tragic.'

A neighbour and her son - who both did not wish to be named - said they were close to Anthony Vassell.

They said: 'We have heard that Anthony
and his girlfriend have been arrested, I can't believe it's his own 
parents who are dead.'

Neighbours Carol, 67, and Sydney 
Robinson, 71, named the dead woman locally as Clare Sly the daughter of a
good friend Eileen Sly.

Mrs Robinson said: 'We woke up in the 
morning, maybe gunshot noise disturbed us, and we looked out of the 
window and we could police swarming all over these houses, in particular
Eileen and Clare's house.

'Clare was an absolutely lovely girl, 
she has three sons, and her partner is a few years older than her. 
They're a lovely family.

'We live in a really close knit 
neighbourhood everyone is here for one another, Sydney used to give 
Clare lifts to school when she was a child.

'I can't believe what's happened, a 
double killing in this neighbourhood is unheard of, it's a nice place to
live full of nice people, I feel sick inside.'

Mr Robinson said: 'Clare grew up around here, we never had any trouble from her.

'We were so shocked when we heard, I remember when Clare was born.

'It's absolutely tragic, her mum will be devastated.'

Neighbour Sandy Varma, aged 34, said: 'I'm in shock. It's just not something you expect.

Bill Mason, 81, who has lived in the area for 45 years, added: 'She was at work most of the time.

'I saw her occasionally when she put the bins out and I only spoke to her a couple of times each year.'

Resident Daljit Kaity, 19, said: 'I 
can't believe what has happened, I used to see two little lads playing 
in the front garden of the house.

'It's tragic if they've lost their mum.'

An officer stands behind the property: Police swooped on two suspects shortly after being called to the scene. There were in custody this morning

West Midlands Police said officers 
were called to the house, on Laneside Gardens, at 1.37am on Friday after
ambulance crews attended a property, where two people were found with 
serious gunshot injuries.

A spokesman said: 'Despite the best efforts of medical staff, both the man and woman died at the scene.

'Officers immediately cordoned off the
property and the cul-de-sac as an investigation was launched into the 
circumstances of the deaths.

'After making immediate enquiries a 
23-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman were arrested nearby in 
connection with the incident. They have been taken to a police station 
for questioning this morning.'

Detective Inspector Michaela Kerr, 
from West Midlands CID, said: 'Both the man and woman sustained gunshot 
injuries and they received emergency treatment at the scene, however 
they could not be saved and died a short time later.

'We are treating their deaths as 
suspicious and two people were arrested nearby in connection with the 
incident. They are in custody this morning and will be questioned by 
detectives.'
