Five employees of the Blue Rhino propane gas plant in Florida that violently exploded last night
 are fighting for their lives in critical condition today as 
investigators examine whether a simple spark from a forklift at the site
 could have caused the terrifying blast.

Eight
 people were injured in the explosion in Tavares in Lake County, 
Florida, about 11pm on Monday, though miraculously no one was killed. 
The explosions forced the evacuation of all residents within a mile radius of the plant - as firefighters feared the three massive bulk tanks at the site, each with 30,000 pounds of the gas, would detonate.

Authorities say the plant had 53,000 small 20-pound propane tanks on site when the blast ripped through the facility. Dozens of the tanks were sent high into the air as the gave inside them ignited. Photos of the aftermath show the ground littered with charred propane tanks.

Workers at the plant refilled and refurbished the propane tanks for resale for use in gas grills, RV campers and turkey friers.

Firefighters have said they do not yet know what caused the late-night explosion, though they say a preliminary investigation indicates a combination of human error and equipment malfunction.

A fire department source told WFTV that investigators are examining whether a spark from a passing forklift on site set off propane cause that another worker was releasing - setting off the entire explosion.

For nearly an hour, firefighters were forced to stand back and watch as the propane tanks exploded, one after another after another. 

'In my 36 years in the fire service, I've never seen anything like this,' Tavares Fire Chief Richard Keith said.

Neighbors up to ten miles away from the plant reported seeing, hearing and feeling the explosion

Firefighters say they are thankful that the plant's three large tanks - which hold 30,000 pounds of propane each - did not ignite

Officials said between 24 and 26 workers were 
doing the night shift at the site when the explosions began, and 
then continued every few seconds for a period of around two 
hours.

Fifteen were initially reported missing, feared dead, but Blue Rhino said that by 2 a.m. Tuesday all of its employees had been accounted for.

Two
 critical burns patients were flown to Orlando Regional Medical Center, while another five were 
transported, either air lifted or by ambulance, to other regional 
hospitals. An additional three workers drove themselves to hospital.

More than 200 firefighters and law 
enforcement personnel were on scene as of 1:30 a.m. as the inferno 
continued to burn on the plant that had some 53,000 20lb propane 
cylinders on site.

'All Blue Rhino employees who were there tonight have been accounted for. They left and got out of harms way and ended up in a few different locations,' Lake County 
spokesman John Herrell said just after 2 a.m. 

He added that they were able to get out because they were in the main part of the building, which wasn't on fire.

At an earlier press conference Herrell described the terrifying blasts as 'really surprising,' adding 'it's very, very dramatic and surreal.'

Herrell said no neighboring residents were injured.

A source told the Sentinel that someone may have been filling a propane tank with a leak 
and a spark ignited. But Herrell said it wasn't clear what started the blaze and that the cause was being investigated.

The first blasts happened inside the plant and blew the roof off, Lake County Sheriff Gary Borders said.

Don Ingram, a former plant worker, told Wesh.com at least 15 to 20 people work on the plant each night 

Witnesses, some of whom filmed the blasts, said thousands of 30-foot-high propane tanks loaded on pallets continued to explode every minute or two as of 11:25 p.m.

The blasts began again about 12:30 
a.m. on Tuesday in tractor-trailers loaded with pallets of propane 
tanks. After the second round of explosions, Tavares Fire Chief Richard 
Keith evacuated his firefighters out for fear that they would be 
injured.

Witnesses, 
some of whom filmed the blasts, said thousands of 30-foot-high propane 
tanks loaded on pallets continued to explode every minute or two as of 
11:25 p.m.

Residents described hearing sounds 
similar to bombs going off, shotguns being fired and fireworks popping. 
They also said they saw bursts of light and a bright orange glow in the 
sky.

'I
 heard a loud bomb sounds,' Lisa Garner, 43, who lives in Lakeside, a 
Tavares subdivision near County Roads 461 and 448, told the Sentinel. 'I
 thought somebody ran into my house.'

Blue Rhino relocated to Tavares about seven years ago. Its headquarters is in North Carolina. The plant is used to recommission Blue Rhino propane tanks.

It is believed trucks were stacked with used tanks, that still had residue of propane. Shards of exploded tanks could be seen scattered around the plant.

Fire officials worked for hours to contain the blazing fires, that were dying down by around 1:30 a.m.

Early Tuesday morning, the evacuation
 zone was reduced to a half-mile radius but will remain in effect until 
at least 6 a.m., Herrell said.

A shelter has been set up at the First United Methodist Church near the plant for displaced residents.

Officials set up a mass casualty on scene.

The hundreds of firefighters on scene couldn't get near the flames for a long period because of the extreme heat. They waiting until the fire burned down and in the meantime contained the perimeter.

Don Ingram, a former plant worker, told Wesh.com the staff clock in from around 5-7 p.m. and work a 10 hour shift. He said previously many of the staff were contractors.

The workers refurbish and refill propane tanks, like those used for backyard barbeques. During the 10-hour shift they fill around 4,000 to 5,000 tanks, Ingram said. Blue Rhino's tank exchange service allows customers to trade in an empty tank for a full one at retail locations, according to CNN.
