The 14-year-old girl accused of stabbing her younger sister more than 30 times in their Chicago home set an alarm and arose early to stab the victim while she was in bed asleep, say prosecutors.

The girl retrieved a knife from the kitchen in their Mundelein house then entered sleeping 11-year-old Dora Betancourt's bedroom around 7:50am Tuesday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

She then brutally stabbed and slashed Betancourt with the knife about 30 times, allegedly shouting her complaints against her sister with each thrust, including that the elder had cooked her dinner, and that she had done her chores for her.

Lake County Coroner Thomas Rudd said the girl died from 'multiple sharp force injuries' which were 'consistent with a fillet knife,' according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

He said she suffered about 30 stab wounds to the neck, chest and arm. There were three slicing wounds across her face, and another five defense wounds to the palms of her hands, Rudd said.

Authorities say the teen has confessed to stabbing her sister to death Tuesday morning because she was 'not thankful.'

The
 teenage suspect initially claimed a Hispanic male had broken into the home, but she allegedly confessed after police 
revealed they had found strands of the killer's hair in the victim's 
hand.

The unidentified older sister stabbed and slashed the young girl in a frenzied attack, shouting a reason at her sister each time she plunged the knife into her body, police said.

Stab wounds were found in the girl's neck, arms and torso, some of them defensive wounds. The Lake County Medical Examiner's Office told CBS Chicago 'the young girl's body had so many wounds they couldn't count them all... [and] were so deep they punctured her lung.'

'A struggle ensued,' Assistant State's Attorney Claudia Kasten told the courtroom, according to CBS Chicago. 'She kept stabbing.'

The teen kept stabbing and slashing until Dora's body fell lifelessly off the bed and then called her mother claiming she had been woken by her 
sister's screams, authorities said.

A 911 call had her claiming a 
Hispanic male killed the young girl. The 14-year-old showered her sister's blood off in the bathroom but still had some on her when police 
arrived, they said.

Cops said they discovered the girl's lifeless body in her room with the knife used in the attack still on the bed.

The teenager continued to claim an intruder committed the crime until investigators told her they had recovered strands of hair from the victim's hands. She then confessed to the crime, according to police.

'What could be so bad that she did something like that?' Neighbor Verona DeCosta told NBC Chicago. 'A 14-year-old doing that... that sounds demonic to me.'

The
 girls' mother wept during a Wednesday court hearing where prosecutors said that the older girl had set her alarm early and made her attack 
while her little sister slept.

'With each stab wound, she said she was not thankful for what she had done,' Ms Kasten said, according to NBC Chicago.

The older girl told investigators she made dinner six times that week and that her sister made her mad after hitting her the night before, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Their mother was not home at the time of the attack.

The girl wore gray prison scrubs, sat stone-faced during the hearing and left quickly when it was over, as her mother sat at the same table, but without looking at her, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The sisters shared the same mother but have a different father.

Neither the mother nor the daughter took their eyes off the judge for the duration of the hearing.

'There was evidence of trauma, and while multiple stab wounds were evident, I will defer to the coroner's office,' Mundelein police chief Eric Guenther told NBC Chicago.

He added that officers had been called to the home before, 'but nothing pertains to an incident like this.'

Authorities are currently mulling whether to charge the teen as an adult, reports said.

Unexpected: Neighbors were shocked to hear of the attack, one called the accused murderer 'demonic'

Locals were shocked by the horrifying crime.

'They would always be together,' Mary Anne Gryder told WLS. 'The older one would be taking care of the younger one, and vice versa.'

One neighbor told the Tribune he often saw the accused killer helping her younger sister do cartwheels.

'It's a little disheartening, you wonder why it happened,' another told CBS Chicago.

The family were members of the St John Lutheran Church and the victim attended the St John Lutheran school in Libertyville, where grief counselors were on hand Wednesday to help her friends.

The accused killer's next court hearing is scheduled for January 31.
