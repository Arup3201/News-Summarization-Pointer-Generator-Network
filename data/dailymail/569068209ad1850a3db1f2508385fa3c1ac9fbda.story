Eva Herzigova was launched into super-stardom when she became the face of Wonderbra in 1994.

Now Danish-born model Sølveig Mork is hoping to follow the same trajectory as she is announced as the latest face behind the lingerie brand.

You may not know her name yet, by joining an alumni that includes Dita Von Teese and Miranda Kerr Sølveig is bound to become a household name.

Photographed by Lee Broomfield, the brunette beauty will exclusively model the Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter 2015 ranges.

For the iconic brand, famed for the Hello Boys advert, the new model marks an exciting new phase.

Sølveig's modelling career is on the rise, with a number of high profile campaigns already under her belt, and the brand are now hoping that she will steer them to a new era of elegant maturity.

After being discovered at just 14-years-old, by Unique Copenhagen Models, Sølveig's first job was for Eurowoman magazine. 

She has since graced the covers of ELLE Italie, Grazia France and Sports Illustrated.

The brunette will follow in the footsteps of celebrity models like Dita Von Teese and Miranda Kerr 

Standing tall at 5ft 9in, Sølveig has walked the catwalk for Maybelline, Charlotte Ronson, Kaufmanfranco and Adam Selman.

Martina Alexander, Marketing Manager at Wonderbra, says she hopes that Sølveig will bring an elegant edge to the brand. 

She said: 'We're very excited to announce Sølveig as our new model for the 2015 season. 

'She embodies the sophisticated spirit of the collections and looks stunning in the new Glam and My Pretty Push-Up styles.'

Eva Herzigova

 

The Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, and the brand was developed in Canada over the next 40 years. But it only really gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s.

The bra's redesign and reintroduction in 1994 saw a £16m advertising campaign in the US and UK including billboards showing Eva Herzigova wearing the Wonderbra. 

Wonderbra's iconic Hello Boys advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic.

Makers of the ad were honoured in 2011, when the billboard was declared the most eye-catching ad of the previous 20 years.

Dita Von Teese 

The queen of burlesque launched a stunning collection of retro underwear for Wonderbra in 2008.

At the time Dita, explained that the Wonderbra range was inspired by the glamour of the 1940s and 50s.

She said: 'I love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath.'

Dita added that her range was less of a 'Hello Boys' collection as it was designed for women to enjoy rather than something for their lover. 

She said: 'Lingerie shouldn't be something you just put on for your lover; you should do it for you.

'It's not about seducing men, it's about embracing womanhood.'

Miranda Kerr 

In March last year, the Australian model was revealed as the ambassador for the brand and has since shot some extremely racy shots as part of her ongoing contract.

In shots for her latest campaign, the brunette beauty is seen displaying her defined abs and lean legs in a tantalising bra-and-panties set, teamed with patent black heels. 

Naturally, as an ex-Victoria's Secret Angel, Miranda makes  a obvious choice for the brand.

At 5 ft 9 inches, Sølveig has walked the catwalk for Maybelline, Charlotte Ronson,  and Adam Selman
