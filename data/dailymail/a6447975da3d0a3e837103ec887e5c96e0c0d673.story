Caught: William Hasson, 55, stole a colleague's identity and took out credit cards in his name

A restaurant manager who stole personal information from one of his employee's files to set up credit cards and rack up thousands of dollars in charges has been sentenced to 10 months in jail.

William Hasson, 55, was sentenced in Washington D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty in March to stealing the identity of one of his employees, Samby Mutamba.

The former Checkers  manager, who stole the details from a Northeast Washington store, was caught after he posted pictures to Facebook showing the trips he had taken using the credit cards.

He was snapped enjoying a jazz concert at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland, on shopping trips in Illinois and tackling rides at Six Flags in Chicago.

'How did I let them talk me into this,' he wrote beneath an image of a rollecoaster at Six Flags. 'Oh well, here it goes.'

Other images on his Facebook page show him at jazz concerts and food fairs in Chicago, sipping margaritas, dinners of steak and shrimp and discussions about getting a new cell phone and car.

Investigators later matched up the dates of the trips on Facebook to the charges to the credit cards, the Washington Post reported. 

In total, he spent $4,600 on the cards, which he set up in Mutamba's name after taking his Social Security number and other details from the 26-year-old employee's file. 

Trips: He used the money to take trips and then posted about them on Facebook, which ultimately led to his arrest, according to reports. He shared this photo of Six Flags in Chicago in July 2012

He took the information to open up a credit card for himself, another for his niece and a Wal-Mart account, prosecutors said.

After a year of his spending, bill collectors began calling Mutamba to demand the money. Investigators quickly linked Hasson to the spending. 

Mutamba, who moved to the U.S. from Congo six years ago, said Hasson had opened 16 accounts in his name, the Washington Post reported.

'He messed up my credit, and I am still working on trying to clear everything up. I can't get an apartment. I can't buy a house, all because of him,' Mutamba said. 

At work: Hasson, who has a criminal record stretching decades, is pictured outside the D.C. Checkers

Records show that Hasson has a long criminal history, including arrests and charges in Illinois, Maryland and Virginia for crimes including theft and credit card fraud, forgery and misuse.

Most recently, he spent six years in prison for credit card theft and was released in 2010.

Despite his lengthy record, just 10 months after his release, Hasson was employed by Checkers as a regional training manager. On Facebook, he was pictured eating ice cream outside the Washington store.

In court, he explained that he had been struggling because of child support.

Prosecutors said they believe there could be another victim after an employee at the same Checkers reported there had been $16,000 of fraudulent credit card purchases in her name, but Hasson and his attorney said they had not heard of the allegations.
