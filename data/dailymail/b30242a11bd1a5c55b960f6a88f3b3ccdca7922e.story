A European project could soon offer anyone with €200,000 (£120,000) the opportunity to soar over 100 km into space.

Astrium has announced plans to test its prototype spaceplane at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 metres) over Singapore in May.

If successful, a second unpowered drop test from 100,000 feet (30,480 metres) should follow next year, according to officials.

For almost a decade Astrium has been working on a vehicle able to carry four passengers up to an altitude of 100km into space.

The business jet-sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines, according to a report in Space.com.

At an altitude of about 12km, the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude.

The rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane’s inertia carries it on to over 100km, enabling passengers to hover weightlessly.

Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo aircraft, designed for space tourism, completing its third rocket-powered test in January.

The test at Mojave Air and and Space Port in California was meant to simulate a flight into outer-space that will go into effect later this year. Virgin Galactic eventually wants to host commercial space tours.

Not only did Virgin Galactic have a successful third test of the aircraft but they reached an altitude of 71,000 feet. The flight prior to this test reached 69,000 feet.

Celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year. Katy Perry and Justin Bieber have already signed up. Tickets cost $250,000 (£150,500).

Chief executive Richard Branson has promised to take a seat on the ship's first flight.

The vehicle would then use a cold gas reaction control system jets to position itself for atmospheric re-entry.

After slowing down during descent, the jet engines will be restarted for a normal landing at the airfield. According to the company, the entire trip will last two hours.

Operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around €200,000 (£120,000).

Such a vehicle operating at altitudes between those of conventional aircraft (20km) and those of satellites (200km) could be used for various other applications.

The company claims it could be a precursor for rapid ‘point-to-point’ transport vehicles or quick access to space – opening up previously unexplored territory.

The model being tested in May is 15 feet (4.6 metres) long and only a quarter of the size of the actual space plane.

It will be dropped by a helicopter and remotely controlled for a sea landing east of Singapore in the South China Sea.

‘What we are looking for is to validate the spaceplane itself, and the spaceplane itself is in a gliding mode,’ Christophe Chavagnac, spaceplane programs manager told Space.com.

Engineers are currently fitting the avionics and flight control systems to the quarter-scale prototype ahead of the test.The company hasn't given an indication of when the spaceplane will be ready for flight.

Airbus isn't the only company working on a suborbital space plane. Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace, could be flying their own vehicles in the near future.
