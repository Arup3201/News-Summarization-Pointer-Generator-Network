Ryan Mason thinks Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino should take a great deal of credit for the role he played in helping him earn his 'dream' England call-up.

Mason was drafted into the England squad following the withdrawal of Adam Lallana and could make his debut in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or the friendly in Italy next Tuesday.

If selected, Mason would regard it as the proudest moment of his career.

The Spurs midfielder has been in superb form this season, prompting Roy Hodgson to select him

'It's every boy's dream to represent their country at any level, so hopefully I can get that and it would be a great achievement personally,' the 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder told TheFA.com

'It's the pinnacle of your career to represent your country.'

Mason's route to the top has been far from straightforward.

He signed for Tottenham's academy as a 16-year-old and just 12 months later he made his debut in a UEFA Cup match against NEC Nijmegen.

But he then had to wait another six years until he made his Premier League debut.

Former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp farmed Mason out to Yeovil, Millwall and Doncaster, where he had three loan spells.

Redknapp's successor Andre Villas-Boas then sent the player to French club Lorient but he returned without having made a first-team appearance.

Mason started last season on loan at League One Swindon and did not feature under Tim Sherwood at Spurs once Villas-Boas had been sacked.

Mason is grateful to Pochettino, therefore, for finally giving him a chance at White Hart Lane this season.

'I've always had confidence in my own ability, but it also comes from a manager who trusts you and is willing to back you. There is nothing like that as a footballer,' said Mason, who has played 29 times for the Argentinian this year.

'The fact that the call-up has come so early in my Premier League career is a great feeling. It's amazing and has been a bit of a whirlwind over the last few months

Mason thanked Mauricio Pochettino for the faith the Argentinian manager has shown in him this season

Last year Mason was on loan at Swindon in League One, but has made remarkable progress since returning

'It was unfortunate that I didn't kick on at a younger age, it took me a bit longer to establish myself.

'I had a lot of injuries and perhaps went out on loan at the wrong times.

'There were times when players were getting opportunities in the UEFA Cup and I was out on loan. It just never really worked. But now I've got a manager who trusts in me and believes in me, and he came in from day one and said that.

'To have a manager like that it gives me a great deal of confidence.

'Now I'm playing regularly I'm more than happy.'

Mason has been pinching himself this week after training alongside some of his heroes at St George's Park.

'I've been a football fan for so long, and the fact that I've been watching these players in the squad who I'm training with now is a great feeling,' he said.
