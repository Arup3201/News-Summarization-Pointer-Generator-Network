Jose Mourinho will reject any opening offer from Real Madrid for Ramires but the European champions are determined to sign the Brazilian.

Chelsea have interest in various Real Madrid players and they may be offered as makeweights in a bid to tempt Mourinho who remains a firm fan of the 27-year-old midfielder.Â 

Carlo Ancelotti has been keen to take Ramires to the Bernabeu since arriving at Madrid and made enquiries back in November. The Real boss has held talks with president Florentino Perez and they will press ahead with bids for the Chelsea man and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez.

Mourinho is bringing in Tiago from Atletico Madrid and remains in talks over Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona.

He has lost Frank Lampard and may listen to bids for John Obi Mikel but wants Ramires to stay. Mourinho likes Raphael Varane, Sami Khedira and Isco at Madrid but any deal will take some hard bargaining.

Meanwhile, Juventus are the latest club to express an interest in Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku.

The centre forward, who may miss the start of the World Cup after suffering an ankle strain during Belgium's 1-0 win over Tunisia in Brussels on Saturday, was a massive success on loan at Everton last season.
