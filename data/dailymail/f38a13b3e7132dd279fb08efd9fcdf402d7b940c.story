Alan Pardew expects more signings at Newcastle this summer and is backing Facundo Ferreyra to win a permanent stay after arriving on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.

The Argentinian made his debut for the Magpies in Sunday's impressive 3-1 victory over Schalke in Gelsenkirchen.

There is a deal in place to sign Ferreyra for around £6million at the end of the season and Pardew believes the 23-year-old – who top scored in his homeland with 17 goals for Velez Sarsfield in 2013 - will prove a hit in the Premier League.

'We think he is a player who will grow and we have the option to take him on a permanent basis,' said Pardew.

'We believe he will show the form from Argentina in the Premier League with us.

'(Fabricio) Coloccini is well aware of him and he had a big influence in Argentina. He went to Ukraine but didn't get many chances, he'll get more chances with us.'

Pardew, though, has not ruled out another entry into the transfer market and Sunderland's Connor Wickham could emerge as a target.

Big impression: Young winger Aarons, who scored one goal and made another, celebrates in Gelsenkirchen

The 21-year-old was given an ultimatum by boss Gus Poyet last week to sign a new contract or face being sold. However, Sportsmail can reveal that no deal has been put in front of Wickham and United are aware of the situation.

And Pardew added: 'We've always maintained that we will watch the window until the last hours.

'We've done some terrific business and I think it must be exciting for Newcastle fans that we've got some terrific, offensive players.

'I feel much more comfortable with the team and we can play a brand of football which is expected of us. 

'I think we could really trouble teams this season, which is something we didn't do in the second half of last season.'

Wait and see: No new deal has been put in front of Sunderland striker Connor Wickham, alerting Newcastle

The victory over Schalke included goals from Emmanuel Riviere, Rolando Aarons and France international Remy Cabella.

But it was 18-year-old Aarons – a Jamaican winger who also qualifies for England – who stole the show.

'The real highlight of pre-season has been Rolando and he was terrific again,' Pardew said.

'It's nice to see a young player really pushing and I thought he caused real problems for Schalke – long may that continue.'
