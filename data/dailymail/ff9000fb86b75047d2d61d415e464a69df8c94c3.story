For his part, the 51-year-old man seems undeterred, despite the fact he is outnumbered, and keeps punching back at the two younger guys.

But things take an even nastier turn, when one of the teenagers prises open the subway door and tries to drag the man towards them. 

The teenager appears to be calling for help to get the doors fully open, as onlookers shout at him to stop.

A girl is heard repeatedly shouting 'no' and calling for the teens to 'chill out'. The older man pulls back with his shirt ripped and the teen pushes the doors back closed again.

The fight then continues briefly before the train pulls into a subway station and the teenagers with their gang of friends gets off and walks away.
