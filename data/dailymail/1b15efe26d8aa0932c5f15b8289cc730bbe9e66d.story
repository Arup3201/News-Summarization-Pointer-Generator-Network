When Justin Quinnell decided to travel the world taking wacky photographs with his pinhole camera, he really got his teeth into the project. 

The 52-year-old photographer from Bristol placed a miniature camera in his mouth to take pictures  of everything from the Sydney Opera House to his own bath tub.

He placed the three-inch 110 cartridge film so that his back teeth could keep it stationary and then held his mouth wide open to take the unique photos.

'Louis - getting to know Dad': Mr Quinnell uses pinhole camera in his mouth to capture people and places from around the world, including his son Louis

'Bathtime': The Falmouth University lecturer said: 'I originally invented the camera for its indestructibility, throwing it off buildings and things like that'

'Cocktails': Mr Quinnell has been experimenting  with pinhole photography for 20 years, making 'indestructible' cameras that shoot from the inside of the mouth

The professional photographer and lecturer  at University College Falmouth, created the camera by placing aluminium foil over a tiny hole one fifth of a millimetre wide on the film cartridge.

Justin, from Portishead, has photographed his son Louis, a visit to the dentist, and even his evening meal, using a flash gun in some of the pictures for a quick snap.

Sometimes he had to hold his mouth open, standing still, in front of his target for up to a minute for the film to be properly exposed 

He said: 'I originally invented the camera for its indestructibility, throwing it off buildings and things like that. It was after a few months of using it this way I for some reason pushed it into my mouth.

'Brushing my teeth - with a dead spider': The 52-year-old has been teaching and practising pinhole photography for more than 20 years

'Three years of Degree level photographic theory rushed through my brain and mouthy imagery evolved.'

The father-of-two says that he loves to photograph anything that can make children laugh, including toes and spiders.

One of his favourite images is of the Lincoln Memorial as he remembers so many people around him looking puzzled and wondering if they should call security.

'I also attempted a photo of each of my kids in the process of them being born but neither came out which is a shame,' said the experienced photographer.

Mr Quinnell currently has an exhibition showing his brand new technique entitled 'Awfulogrammes' which has been on display in Bristol for the past few months and will be travelling around the UK.

Mr Quinnell has taken hundreds of pictures of his family, including his son Louis (left) as well as friends and interesting people that he comes across on his travels
