Mark Hughes bemoaned Chelsea's superior quality after a goal either side of half-time meant Stoke couldn't replicate their recent home heroics.

The Potters went down against the league leaders after John Terry and Cesc Fabregas kept Jose Mourinho's side marching on at the Premier League's summit.

And while Stoke embarrassed Arsenal at the Britannia Stadium earlier this month, Chelsea's resilience at the back and potency going forward saw that Hughes' men were stifled from the off.

Mark Hughes was disappointed that Stoke conceded to a John Terry header after just 90 seconds

'It was the worst possible start for us - the one thing you don't want to do is concede early to a top-quality side like Chelsea,' Hughes said after watching Terry score in just the second minute.

'But credit to us, I thought we stuck at it and kept probing.

'It was difficult, because Chelsea were happy to protect the initial lead - they are quite able to take the sting out of games, which comes from experience.

'We had to deal with that and be mindful of them threatening too, but they didn't have too many chances.

'Then we had a decent period second half, but in the end they had a little bit of quality enabling them to get the second goal. That took the game away from us.'
