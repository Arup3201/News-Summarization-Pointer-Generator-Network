Emre Can remained upbeat after Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United by claiming that there are many good years ahead for the Anfield club.

Liverpool have their work cut out to qualify for next season's Champions League after they were beaten by their biggest rivals on Sunday to leave them five points off the top four.

But the 21-year-old German believes the club are just at the beginning of a bright new era.

Emre Can believes Liverpool have many good years ahead and are at the start of a new era

The 21-year-old thinks the club have some exciting players, including Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson

He told Liverpool's official website: 'I definitely feel we're at the start of a new era. It's a very, very young team with Phillippe Coutinho, Jordan Henderson and Lazar Markovic.

'But I think the team needs to keep improving, and continue doing what we're doing at the moment to get to these years. But I believe there are good years ahead.'

Can joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer as a highly-rated youngster by his national team Germany. 

Philippe Coutinho has been in excellent form this season and recently signed a new contract

The midfielder has been deployed by manager Brendan Rodgers in a deeper role in Liverpool's back-line and been a big part of their upturn in fortunes since the first half of the season.

'I feel very good at the moment. I feel the trust of the manager and I feel I'm doing a good job, that's why I'm playing - so I'm happy,' said the Germany U21 international.
