These remarkable photographs show a testosterone-fuelled battle between two stags in Richmond Park.

Photographer Mark Bridger, 45, took the autumnal images over the last two weeks at the famous park in south west London.

The area, often called the Old Deer Park, is 147 hectares in size and is home to around 650 animals - 300 of which are red deer and 350 are of the fallow species.

October and early November are traditionally the months when stags lock antlers to compete for mating rights with the females - an act that has been captured in these stunning photographs, taken at the largest of London's Royal Parks.

Arriving at dawn, Mr Bridger caught some of the action on camera - watching a pair of fallow deer fight for over an hour.

In the background a herd of females can be seen watching the fight like a ringside boxing crowd to see which male will come out on top.
