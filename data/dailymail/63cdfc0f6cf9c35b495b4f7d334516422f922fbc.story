A California TV journalist doing a live report on a violent mugging in Temescal has been robbed while live on-air.

KTVU reporter Heather Holmes was reporting from outside the Oakland police headquarters on Monday about a young woman who was mugged nearby.

Unbeknownst to Holmes, as she reported on the woman's terrifying ordeal her own purse was being swiped from the news van, which was parked just feet away.

Brazen theft: As Heather Holmes reported on a violent daylight robbery, her own purse was stolen from the KTVU news crew's van

Spate of thefts: Holmes had been dispatched to report on the violent mugging of this young woman in the Temescal area

The van wasn't locked, reports SF Gate, because the crew had just arrived and it was close enough that they could keep an eye on it.

Holmes was reporting on the violent daylight mugging of a woman, who was seen, bloodied and bandaged, being loaded into an ambulance in the KTVU report.

The area has been plagued by burglaries and hold-ups recently, as residents explained to Holmes.

'Three to four times a day we're seeing people casing cars and breaking in,' an unnamed resident told Homes.

'We’re calling it in to the police every time and they are stretched very thin and so they often aren’t able to show up for at least half an hour.'

Indignant: Holmes tweeted about the incident that occurred as she filmed a live spot for KTVU

Precautions: Holmes tweeted that she had changed locks and canceled her credit cards, after one of her cards was used just 20 minutes after the theft

It wasn't until after she had finished her live cross that Holmes realized she'd been robbed.

'Oh the irony of it all...while reporting on violent mugging, my purse is stolen. Thieves used my bank card 20 mins after swiping my bag,' she tweeted.

She then had to undertake all the usual precautions, changing her locks and canceling her credit cards.

But Holmes used the misfortune to return attention to her story.

The area is experiencing a spate of burglaries, and residents say robbers are becoming ever-more confident - as evidenced by the theft of a TV reporter's belongings outside the police station

'While it's a bummer that my purse was stolen, it doesn't compare to what purse snatcher's [sic] did to this woman,' she tweeted. 'She was beaten about the face & head for her purse in #Temescal. @oaklandpoliceca responds & says it will increase patrols in the area.'

Holmes hasn't had a lot of luck while doing live reports. She became an inadvertant internet star after footage of her swallowing the results of her runny nose while live on-air went viral.

And she's not the first reporter to have been robbed while doing her job in the area.

In March, thieves stole KTVU camera equipment in Oakland's Fruitvale area, and The New York Times reported last year that every major Bay Area news station has been robbed while reporting from Oakland.
