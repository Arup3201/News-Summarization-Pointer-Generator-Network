Charlton Athletic are primed to dispense with manager Jose Riga and trade him in for fellow Belgian Bob Peeters.

The 56-year-old was only taken to the Valley by new owner Roland Duchatelet in March with the Addicks staring at relegation from the Championship.

Even though Riga won three of the last four matches to save Charlton, he is set to leave the club when his contract expires this summer.

Appointed: Ex-Millwall striker Bob Peeters has been confirmed as the new boss of Charlton Athletic

Gone: Jose Riga left Charlton with his contract due to expire this summer

Sportsmail understands that Peeters - who was a striker for Millwall for two years from 2005 - travelled to the club for talks on Wednesday.Â 

Peeters, 40, is currently in charge of Waasland-Beveren over in Belgium.

And his club appear resigned that their boss will be making the switch to London imminently, with a club spokesman telling BBC London 94.9: 'It looks very likely to happen.'

The swift change in management shouldn't come as a surprise under Duchatelet's stewardship, with the owner renowned for tinkering.

Chris Powell was sacked by the club two months ago, while captain Johnnie Jackson insistent that Riga should still be at the club next season.

'He has been good since he came in,' Jackson said earlier this month. 'You can see the way he wants to play and he understands the Championship. If he was given time to implement his methods, we would have the making of a good side.'
