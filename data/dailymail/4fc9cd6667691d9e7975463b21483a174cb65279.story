A New York City man imprisoned for nearly 20 years for murder before a judge declared he was innocent is getting $4.75 million from the state.

Fernando Bermudez told the New York Post   that 'the settlement will never erase the injustice.' 

The settlement was reached last month.

The settlement is the highest figure for a wrongful conviction  the state has seen, Michael Lamonsoff, Bermudez's attorney, told the Post.

Settlement: Fernando Bermudez was imprisoned for nearly 20 years for murder before a judge declared he was innocent and now he's getting $4.75 million from the state

Bermudez' conviction was thrown out in 2009, with a judge saying he had 'demonstrated his actual innocence.' The judge not only overturned the conviction, but dismissed the charges althogether. 

He'd been convicted in 1992 of shooting 16-year-old Raymond Blount outside a Manhattan nightspot the year before. 

The teen was gunned down near Union Square following a dispute with another teen inside the club. 

Several eyewitnesses identified him Bermudez as the gunman but later recanted. 

Injustice: Fernando said that the settlement will never erase the injustice he endured 

Five witnesses who identified Bermudez later said in sworn affidavits that police and prosecutors had coerced or manipulated them into the false claims, The New York Times reports. 

Friends of his testified he was miles away at the time of the crime.

In 2009, though Bermudez was declared innocent, he remained in jail for another 27 months because he pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office says he's 'committed to ensuring that those who are wrongfully convicted are compensated.'
