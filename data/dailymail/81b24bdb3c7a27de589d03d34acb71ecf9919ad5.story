Burt Reynolds' personal memorabilia, including the infamous Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am car, fetched more than $2.5 million at a Las Vegas auction. 

More than 600 items, including his 1998 Golden Globe for Boogie Nights and the canoe made for his movie Deliverance were up for sale. 

The 78-year-old star strongly denied speculation that he was selling the collection because he was bankrupt saying before the sale, 'I want everyone to know that contrary to what all the news outlets are saying, I am not broke.' 

Instead he said his house has become a shrine to himself.

Denial: Burt Reynolds has said that he is not in any financial difficulties and simply wanted to offload a lot of clutter he has collected during his career

The iconic Trans Am car from the Smokey and the Bandit movies fetched $450,000, the highest price paid at the auction

'I have been dealing with a business dispute for many years as well as a divorce settlement,' he said. 'I am simply selling some of my memorabilia that I have enjoyed for so many years but no have use nor room for them anymore.'

'Quite frankly, I am sick of so many picture of myself in my own home.'

The 78-year old actor was one of Hollywood's biggest and highest paid stars in the 1970s, something which helped drive prices up, according to auctioneer Darren Julien, who managed the sale. 

'Burt Reynolds is a legend who is loved all over the world,' he said in a statement. 'His collection which was full of iconic pieces of career memorabilia and personal items once again proves to be a solid investment with bidders who attended the auction from every corner of the globe this week.'  

The highest price tag was reserved for Reynold's Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am car that sold for an enormous $450,000.  

Reynolds has filed for bankruptcy in the past and has been fighting Bank of America since 2011 over the foreclosure of his 12,500 sq.ft. mansion in Jupiter, Florida.

The home was listed for sale at $15 million in 2006 and the bank sued the actor in 2011 when he fell behind on mortgage payments, claiming he hadn't made one since September, 2010.

Among the items for sale was the stagecoach that he and now ex-wife Loni Anderson rode in after their wedding on the Florida estate in 1998.

The auction at The Palms in Las Vegas also included a pair of cowboy boots he wore in the hit 1996 movie, Striptease, co-starring Demi Moore.

Reynolds, who underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in 2010, wrote in a forward to the auction catalogue: 'I've collected so many things that I truly adore but at this stage in my life I find it very difficult to manage them all.

'The fact of the matter is that it truly is the time to downsize and for these items that I have loved over the years find new homes where they can be cared for and appreciated.'

'I have been in the auction community for 25 years and I've never seen an opportunity like this,' Museum of Television president James Comisar recently told ET.

Reynolds is also plans to publish his memoirs next year where he will lift the lid on his love life, including rumored affairs with Dolly Parton and other Hollywood A-list stars.
