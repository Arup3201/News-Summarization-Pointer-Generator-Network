Savers locked into rip-off pensions and investments could be moved to better deals or allowed a free-exit, the City watchdog is due to say next week.

An inquiry will be launched this summer into 30 million policies sold by insurance companies between the 70s and the Millennium.

The review, by the Financial Conduct Authority, will include pensions, endowments, investment bonds and life insurance sold by doorstep salesmen.

An inquiry is to be launched this summer by the Financial Conduct Authority following concerns insurers are ¿exploiting¿ loyal policyholders who are ¿not given the same priority as new customers¿

The regulator is concerned that insurers are ‘exploiting’ loyal policyholders who are ‘not given the same priority as new customers’.

Clive Adamson, the director of supervision at the FCA, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We want to find out how closed-book products are being serviced by insurance companies, as we are concerned insurers are allocating an unfair amount of overheads to historic funds.

‘As firms cut prices and create new products, there is a danger that customers with older contracts are forgotten. We want to ensure they get a fair deal. As part of the review we will collect information to establish whether we need to intervene on exit charges.’

Many customers signed up to financial products at the prompting of doorstep salesman working on commission only to face steep exit penalties - sometimes more than 50 per cent of the total pension pot - if they later want to leave or switch to a better deal. 

The regulator is considering whether these obstructive ‘lock-in’ fees on policies – which can last until the customer reaches the policy’s retirement age - should be banned. The inquiry will be revealed in the annual FCA business plan for the next financial year, which will be published on Monday.

Banning unfair exit fees on old pension policies would be one the strongest actions the FCA could take, Mr Adamson said.

Alternatives include asking firms to move customers to a better product, providing clearer information, investing more in the management of old funds, offering a greater variety of investment options within the policy or cutting fees.

The FCA estimates that the policies under review are worth £150 billion. Many of the companies behind the products have since been subsumed into rival organisations through takeovers.

Mr Adamson added: ‘Consolidation and outsourcing within the insurance industry means that policies taken out 10, 15 or 20 years ago are unlikely to be managed by the same brand, and by people in the same building as they were at their outset.

‘We want to make sure that customers who have been ‘sold on’ are treated fairly. Some terms and conditions that were common 20 years ago are not what we would want to see now.’
