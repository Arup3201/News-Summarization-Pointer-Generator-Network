Vladimir Putin dropped in on one of Russia's old Cold War allies on Friday, as he began a six-day tour of Latin American with a state visit to Cuba.

The tour included a rare public appearance with the country's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, who has been seen in public since the start of the year.

Putin and the 87-year-old leader met to discuss international relations and the economy, as Moscow sought to strengthen ties with its old friend.

The Russian president was also pictured embracing Fidel Castro's younger brother Raul, who took over leadership in 2008.

The meetings have been seen by analysts as further 
attempts to snub the West over its Ukraine sanctions.

Cuba
 and the other countries Putin is due to visit on the trip have been 
sympathetic or not overly critical of Moscow over the Ukraine crisis.

In Cuba, the state-run papers have tended to portray it as a struggle against right-wing extremism that has been threatening ethnic Russians living in Ukraine.

Earlier
 this year, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez criticized U.S. and 
European Union sanctions imposed on Russians and pro-Russian 
Ukrainians.

'In
 the international arena, we agree with the current policy of strength 
and political intelligence that the Soviet Union - I mean Russia - is 
carrying out,' Castro said.

Before 
leaving for his Latin America tour, Putin also made remarks on 
cyber-espionage, saying: 'This is not just blatant hypocrisy in 
relations between allies and partners.

According to the Business Recorder Putin,
 whose country provided asylum to Ed Snowden, said: 'It is also direct 
infringement of a country's sovereignty and a breach of human rights, an
 invasion of privacy.'

His
 comments came as the CIA chief based in Berlin was asked to leave over 
allegations that the U.S. spied on Germany's Angela Merkel.

In Cuba, 
Castro and Putin strengthened their ties, using the official 
tour to sign about a dozen accords in energy, industry, health and 
disaster prevention.

Shortly
 before the visit, Moscow wrote off more than $35 billion of Cuba's 
Soviet-era debt.

Speaking about the debt agreement, which clears 90 percent of what Cuba owes, Raul Castro said it was 'another great, tangible generosity of the Russian people toward Cuba.'

In a 
further sign of Putin turning his back on the West, the Cuban government
 website announced that Russian companies are to take part in petroleum 
projects around Boca de Jaruco on Cuba's north coast, and that 
cooperation will extend to offshore oil deposits.

Another
 agreement covered infrastructure at a new port project that Cuba hopes 
will become a regional shipping center and attract much-needed foreign 
investment.

'We
 are talking about the possibility of creating in Cuba a grand 
transportation hub with a possible modernization of the maritime port of
 Mariel and the construction of a modern airport with its respective 
cargo terminal,' Putin said, according to an official Spanish 
translation of his remarks in Russian.

According to the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS, Putin spent about an hour with retired revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

The men are said to have discussed a range of topics including international affairs, the economy and Russian-Cuban relations.

The
 Cuba visit included official duties, in which Putin and Raul Casto took
 part in a ceremony at Havana's Memorial to the Soviet Internationalist 
Soldier.Â

Havana
 and Moscow have a shared history dating to the Cold War, when they were
 united by ideology and opposition to U.S. influence.

They
 drifted apart in the 1990s, however, as the collapse of the Soviet 
Union ended billions of dollars in trade and subsidies for Cuba.

After
 leaving Havana, Putin is due to travel to Argentina, whose President 
has accused the U.S. and Britain of having double standards.

In
 March, Cristina Fernandez rebuked the countries for criticizing a 
pro-Russian secession vote in Crimea while backing a status referendum in
 the Falkland Islands.

From Argentina, Putin will travel to 
Brazil, which was among several countries that opposed Russia being 
excluded from the G20 summit in Australia.

'We
 are grateful to South Americans for the support of our international 
initiatives, including outer space demilitarization, strengthening 
international information security and combating the glorification of 
Nazism,' Putin said in an interview before the trip.

Russia said in February that it was looking to expand its worldwide military presence, including asking permission for its navy ships to use ports in Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America.

A Russian intelligence-gathering vessel has docked in Havana on multiple occasions in recent months.

Putin plans to attend a presidential summit of the BRICS group of nations in Fortaleza, Brazil, in the coming days.

He is to be in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday for the World Cup final and ceremonial handover of host duties for soccer's marquee tournament, which next takes place in Russia in 2018.
