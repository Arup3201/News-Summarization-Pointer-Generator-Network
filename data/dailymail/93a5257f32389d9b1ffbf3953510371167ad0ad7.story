A clever computer nerd has been hailed as Britain's toughest IT worker after winning a string of world titles for bodybuilding.

By day Michael Perrin, 22, is a mild-mannered technical support worker used to dealing with PC troubles in an office.

But at night he hits the the gym and transforms into one of the world's top bodybuilders.

Michael's extreme physique mean that he rather shows up his colleagues in the John Lewis head office IT department

He is now capable of lifting more than 500lb - the equivalent to an adult polar bear.

Michael's extreme physique mean that he rather shows up his colleagues in the office as he taps away on a keyboard with his massive biceps bursting out of his work shirt.

Michael maintains his muscled physique by working out five nights a week and eating a huge eight meals a day - each one specially designed to feed his massive muscles.

He is is currently a Junior British and World Champion Powerlifter.

Michael said: 'I'm just a normal guy with a hobby, really. Most IT workers like playing computer games in their spare time, while I love going to the gym and working out.

'It's quite funny to see colleague's reaction when they call for IT support and I show up.

I think people expect us all to look like the guys from The IT Crowd.

'But you could say I am probably Britain's toughest IT geek.'

Gentle giant Michael, who still lives at home with his parents Karen and Tim and sister Kelly, in Sutton at Hone, Kent, works in the John Lewis head office IT department.

To maintain his muscles Michael trains for hours five days a week and has to eat eight meals a day

Some of the many trophies won by Michael during his short bodybuilding competitive career  

Last year the muscle man, who only took up competition bodybuilding aged 19, won the Junior World Bodybuilding Championship, held in Miami, Florida, and later this month he is returning to America to try to defend his title.

At the British Junior Powerlifting Championship Michael managed to deadlift an astonishing 507lbs (230kg).

He can also bench press 350lbs (158kg) and squat 430lbs (195kg) - despite weighing only 188lbs (13st 6lbs) at competition weight. 

He said: 'I couldn't do what I do without the help and support of my co-workers, and most importantly my family.

'My parents and sister are so supportive - I don't think I'd be strong enough to do it without them.

'My mum helps me prepare all my food, but she does get a bit annoyed sometimes because the fridge is always filled with my Tupperware.'

Proud mother Karen, 49, said: 'We've gone all over the world to support Michael.

'I'm so proud of him. The fact he's doing it naturally, with no performance-enhancing drugs, is all the more impressive.

Unsurprisingly Michael admits he gets an odd reaction when he arrives as IT support at work

'Steroids ruin lives, and I'm glad my son only enters competitions which have strict drug tests.'

Michael reckons a career in IT is perfect for him, because he's always been interested in computers.

He said: 'At school I was never really the best at maths, science or English, but computers really made sense to me.

'I was a big fan of IT, so once I got my A-levels, it seemed the perfect career for me.

'It's funny at work now, because people are so careful of what they say to me about their IT issues.

'Despite the fact I wouldn't hurt a fly, I think my size is quite intimidating.

'There's another guy at work who is small and slight, so people jokingly ask for the 'little one' if their problem is something quite simple to fix.'
