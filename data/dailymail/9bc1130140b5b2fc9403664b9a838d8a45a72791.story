She has long made blonde locks her signature look but Kate Moss has gone back to her hair and fashion roots with a new brunette look as she smoulders in Versace's Autumn/Winter 13 campaign.

The British supermodel, a long-time Versace favourite, was unveiled as the face of the brand last week and now a new set of sexy images have been unveiled.

With strikingly dark hair, the 
usually blonde mother-of-one, 39, stares open-mouthed at the camera in an array of tight-fitting dresses complete with this season's hottest embellishments: latex and studs.

Donatella Versace describes Versace's new Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign as 'stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and the models'.

She says there is 'no set, no distraction', and judging by Kate's scantily-clad look, there aren't many clothes either.

The campaign, which sees Kate in an array of revealing dresses, was shot by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggot, photography partners since 1995

Kate shows off her perfectly toned figure as she poses in a series of lunges in the new images.

Donning a pair of vibrant yellow-rimmed sunglasses, the model pulls off the 'sexy secretary' vibe to perfection.

In one shot, she showcases her pert derriere in a pair of tight leather trousers. 

Last week the Vogue favourite appeared in two images for the brand's new campaign - in one wearing just a fluffy yellow and black coat, and in another simply three colourful handbags, carefully positioned to cover her modesty.

With her new dark hair, she stares open-mouthed at the camera, 
clutching three Demetra bags from the Vanitas line, in black, yellow and
 red, valued at £1,505 each.

In another shot, Moss is enveloped in a fluffy yellow and black coat, 
with her newly-dyed brown hair tousled over her face, and wearing 
nothing beneath the coat.

The campaign was shot by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggot, photography partners since 1995 and, with several Miss Vogue cover shots in their portfolio, old friends of the British model.

The art director was Giovanni Bianco, best known for his work with Madonna, and stylists were Melanie Ward and David Bradshaw.

Versace said: 'Versace campaign for Autumn/Winter 2013 is stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and models.

'There's no set, no distraction, just the provocation, glamour and attitude of our fashion. Mert & Marcus genius transformed Kate and Saskia into these strong Versace characters.'

Moss, centre, is a long-time Versace favourite, and has worked with the fashion house on many campaigns, including this shoot seven years ago, age 32
