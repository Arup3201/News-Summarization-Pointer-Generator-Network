The menu features breadsticks,  ice-cream, chips, and handmade cheeses with apple and ginger chutney. So far, so ordinary.

But closer investigation reveals that all is not what it seems.

The breadsticks are made from ground almonds, the salted caramel ice-cream has coconut cream and honey instead of milk, chips are cut from carrots and those cheeses... well, there's not an ounce of dairy in there as they are made with nuts.

The UK's first Paleo restaurant, Pure Taste in Westbourne Grove, London, has an specialised menu catering to diners on a variety of diets including vegan, gluten-free and low-carbohydrate 

The future of healthy eating: Low-carbohydrate compliant duck with spiced clementines and cranberry sauce

Paleolithic diets mimic the types and quantities of foods our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. 

Pastured and wild meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, eggs, plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily. 

The basic premise of the Paleo diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics, which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years. 

It is said to be much better than the grains, dairy, and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution. 

While they may not be most conventional of ingredients to feature in kitchens, they are the most used items in the kitchens of the UK's first Paleo restaurant, Pure Taste.

Popularly referred to as the Caveman Diet, Paleo is the latest food trend to take the world by storm. 

Focusing on food groups generally consumed during the paleolithic era, Pure Taste restaurant in Westbourne Grove, London, has a menu that excludes dairy products, grains, legumes, processed oils or refined sugars, in favour of protein-rich and high-fibre options.

Each item on the carefully curated menu has a string of letters underneath it. 

As well as notations indicating gluten, and dairy-free items, together with the more conventional vegetarian and vegan indicators, these letters explain each menu item and what the  diet it is compliant with.

For example LC denotes low carbohydrates, with less than 20g net of carbs per portion. 

Another example would be SCD (Specific Carbohydrates Diet) meaning it is suitable for those following a SCD/GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) eating plan, and WAP means Weston A Price diet.  

Chicory, activated walnuts and rocket salad is one of the starters on offer at the restaurant

The restaurant originally launched as a pop-up in Sussex and nutritional therapist and head chef, Holly Redman has brought the eaterie to London.

Ms Redman said: 'The premise of Pure Taste is one that combines a passion for healthy living with high quality dining and premium flavours. 

'Our extensive menus are a testament of our commitment to providing exceptional food and exhibiting the benefits of paleo cooking.’  

Dr Caroline Orfila, Associate Professor of Nutrition at the University of Leeds, explained: ‘Nuts are essentially the seeds of nut trees – apart from peanuts, which are related to peas, not nuts.

‘When you soak seeds, including nuts, in water, two phenomena occur: leaching of protease inhibitors [molecules that inhibit digestion] into the water and activating of the germination process, so the amount of starch and fibre reduces, while the protein and vitamin content raise.

‘This is why germinating seeds and nuts are easier to digest than dry, raw nuts. However, most nuts bought at British supermarkets have been blanched [quickly cooked in boiling water] or roasted, which also inactivates the protease inhibitors.

‘Roasted nuts are not alive any more, so they will not activate.'

The restaurant was originally launched in Sussex  by nutritional therapist and head chef Holly Redman 

Menu highlights include fresh mussels in a Thai-spiced coconut broth, pan-seared breast of wild mallard duck, grass-fed rib eye steak with carrot chips and breast of wood pigeon with activated walnuts. 

The menu changes every eight weeks and features fresh, seasonal ingredients including free range fish and meat. Wines are  biodynamic and beers gluten-free.

Tapioca and almond flour as well as almond and coconut milk are used in all the dishes. 

'One of the biggest challenges in achieving optimal health is discovering what works best for you. We create dishes around the foods you can eat, rather than the foods you can’t,' Ms Redman said.  

LC: Low-carbohydrate diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption. They’re often chosen to assist weight loss, aid blood sugar management or for a specific medical reason. Foods high in easily digestible carbohydrates such as sugar, bread, pasta etc. are limited and replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of fats and protein.

WAP: Weston A Price diets eliminates all processed industrial foods and anything containing modern refined vegetable and seed oils and refined sugar.Meals are based around vegetables, traditional fat sources and high quality proteins from pastured or wild animals. The diet also includes  raw and fermented dairy, bone broth, fermented foods, and organ meats and is rich in natural fats and the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

SCD/GAPS: The Specific Carbohydrate Diet, or SCD, aims to eliminate foods that are hard to digest if you have a damaged intestine, for example, if you suffer from colitis. The Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet (GAPS), is a modified version of the SCD diet. The aim of the GAPS diet is to heal the gut in order to help those with conditions such as autism, ADHD and depression.
