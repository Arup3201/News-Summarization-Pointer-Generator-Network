Harper Collins announced on Tuesday that Harper Lee, pictured here in 2007 at the White House, is publishing a book she set aside almost 50 years ago

'To Kill a Mockingbird' will not be the reclusive author Harper Lee's only published book after all.

In an announcement that left millions both shocked and thrilled, publisher Harper announced Tuesday that 'Go Set a Watchman,' a completed novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author wrote in the 1950s then put aside unpublished, will hit store shelves in July.

The news instantly turned 88-year-old Lee's lost tome into one of the most eagerly anticipated novels in years.

It also leaves open for speculation what sort of massive book deal a living legend author who spent most of her life avoiding ever releasing more than a single, beloved novel might receive. 

Rediscovered last fall, 'Go Set a Watchman' is essentially a sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' although it was finished earlier. 

The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years.

The publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies.

'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called 'Go Set a Watchman,'' Lee said in a statement issued by Harper. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout.

'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. 

'After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.' 

According to publisher Harper, Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.' 

The new book is set in Lee's famed Maycomb, Alabama, during the mid-1950s, 20 years after 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and roughly contemporaneous with the time that Lee was writing the story. 

Harper Lee spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel To Kill a Mockingbird.

So, less than three months since the death of her sharp-as-a-tack lifelong confidante sister Alice, should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s?

According to Jezebel, such suspicion is warranted. 

Protector: Harper Lee's older sister Alice ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100, having remained all that time her sister's staunch defender and protector 

The 88-year-old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007, when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair-bound, nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own.

Lee is now represented by Tonja Carter, who succeeded Alice in the family firm. 

According to Gawker, 'Lee has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her, apparently sometimes with Carter's advice.'

Carter has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by Lee, even once going after a business owner in Lee's beloved hometown of Monroeville, Alabama who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel.

Alice Lee, who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight, died last year at the age of 103. 

With a new Harper Lee book being released just months after her attorney sister  (pictured) Alice's death, some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of Harper Lee--who's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair-bound in 2007--or of someone else

The civil rights movement was taking hold by the time she was working on 'Watchman.' 

The Supreme Court had ruled unanimously in 1953 that segregated schools were unconstitutional, and the arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 led to the yearlong Montgomery bus boycott. 

'Scout (Jean Louise Finch) has returned to Maycomb from New York to visit her father, Atticus,' the publisher's announcement reads. 'She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood.'

Lee herself is a Monroeville, Alabama native who lived in New York in the 1950s. She now lives in her hometown. 

According to the publisher, the book will be released as she first wrote it, with no revisions.

'To Kill a Mockingbird' is among the most beloved novels in history, with worldwide sales topping 40 million copies. It was released on July 11, 1960, won the Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a 1962 movie of the same name, starring Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning performance as the courageous attorney Atticus Finch. 

One of the most beloved novels in history, Lee's original novel has sold over 40 million copies. But it was written second

Although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes, the novel has become a standard for reading clubs and middle schools and high schools. The absence of a second book from Lee only seemed to enhance the appeal of 'Mockingbird.'

Lee's publisher said the author is unlike to do any publicity for the book. She has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s, when she told one reporter that she wanted to 'to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life.' Until now, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' had been the sole fulfillment of that goal.

'This is a remarkable literary event,' Harper publisher Jonathan Burnham said in a statement. 'The existence of 'Go Set a Watchman' was unknown until recently, and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' 

Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee's classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter's relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s.'

The new book also will be available in an electronic edition. Lee has openly started her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow 'Mockingbird' to be released as an e-book.

The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances. 

To Kill A Mockingbird, won the Pulitzer Prize, is translated into nearly 50 languages and was turned into the Oscar-winning 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. It has sold some 30 million copies and made Harper into a multi-millionairess.

It is the story of race and growing up in Depression-era Alabama, based loosely on Lee's own experiences.

It was published in 1960 shortly after the dawn of the U.S. civil rights movement and became required reading in many American schools.

In the tome, a principled lawyer named Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman and wins his family the scorn of many racist white residents of the fictional town of Maycomb.

Finch loses the case despite what would appear in today’s terms to have been an airtight case of his client Tom’s innocence. 

Tom is jailed then shot dead after escaping custody—a ‘mockingbird’ whose innocence and then life are taken away by the malevolence of a violently racist society.

To Kill A Mockingbird was made into a movie starring Gregory Peck and featuring Brock Peter as Tom Robinson, the black farmhand accused of raping a white woman in Depression-era Alabama

When Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune, last year wrote about being Lee's neighbor for year in, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, Lee disowned it.

'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said.

'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised.I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way.

'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.'

Older sister and lawyer Alice Lee died last November after fifty years helping to guard her sibling's privacy.

Harper Lee has not given an official interview since Mockingbird came out, but has intermittently released statements to media.

She even sued a museum in her south Alabama hometown over its sale of souvenirs featuring her name and the title of her book, and accepted a settlement.

She has been described as a 'delicious mystery', and while having started other books, one a non-fiction about an Alabama serial killer, she filed them away as unfinished.
