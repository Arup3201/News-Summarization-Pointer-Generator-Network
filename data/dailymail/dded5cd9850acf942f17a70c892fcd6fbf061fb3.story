The alleged exchanges between Malky Mackay and Iain Moody show a culture of racism, prejudice, homophobia and arrogance that I know to be the unfortunate true face of top-level professional football. So why should we care that two middle-aged white men have what seem to be entrenched views of others who are different from them?

These texts show a way of talking, behaving and thinking that I don’t particularly like, but why should football care?

We should care because this whole issue turns ugly when you realise how such views make people act. When you read the accusations of Ibrahim Farah (@ibby_farah) about a culture of racism at Cardiff City under Mackay, it starts to take a sinister turn.

People in positions of power affect careers and futures. People who exclude others who don’t fit into their little pockets of comfort and small-minded views of the world are dangerous.

The truth is, nothing in the alleged exchanges surprised me. This is how football talks in private, and more importantly, how it behaves in public. This is the reality and the gravity of the situation anyone outside the, male, white, old boy network exists in. Is it any wonder we have 92 professional clubs but no BME (black and minority ethnic) managers?

Many will leap to the defence of these two men. I am sure they gave regular playing time to one or two black players and probably had a few around for tea who may retain some loyalty to their ‘mates’. I am sure both are a riot in the pub on a Saturday night.

But make no mistake, the game will be straining at the leash to find a way back for both Moody and Mackay when the brief outcry simmers down. If they are struggling for work and play their cards right I’m sure there will be media work available to them.

Without meaningful changes to the structure of our game, from boardrooms to grass roots, football will continue to be run in a manner akin to the dialogue alleged here. There are many more where Moody and Mackay came from. Unfortunately for them, they are just the ones who got caught.

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
