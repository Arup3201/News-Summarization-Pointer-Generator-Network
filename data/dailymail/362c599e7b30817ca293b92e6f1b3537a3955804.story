Disgraced football star Todd Carney is appealing his sacking by Cronulla Sharks, says his agent David Riolo.

Riolo told Triple M on Friday that due process hadn't been followed by the Sharks when they cut ties with the star five-eighth on Sunday after an unsavoury photo of him was published on social media on Saturday.

Riolo reportedly wrote to the NRL claiming the Sharks didn't follow the correct protocol for dealing with disciplinary issues as agreed in the collective bargaining agreement between the NRL and the Rugby League Players' Association.

Disgraced football star Todd Carney is appealing his sacking by Cronulla Sharks, says his agent David Riolo

'Todd was on a long-term contract at the Sharks and he got fired by a phone call which ironically came after the press release had already been sent out,' Riolo said.

'Also, he still hasn't received any written notification five days later of a breach notice or even a termination.

Carney was dismissed by the club on Sunday after a photo of him urinating into his own mouth leaked onto social media on Saturday

'There are things within the NRL contract, a process that needs to be followed and it is clear as day what you have to do and that is send a breach notice.

'That then gives the player five days' notice to attend to that and appear before the board.

'None of this has been followed and he has just been treated with complete disrespect.

'Regardless of the issue I think everyone deserves a fair hearing.'

Carney was dismissed by the club on Sunday after a photo of him urinating into his own mouth leaked onto social media.

On Monday Carney spoke out about the shocking photo, explaining he didn't know it was 'out there' and hopes it doesn't end his football career.

'It’s just disappointing for something that I didn't know was out there, something that’s surfaced like this,' he told Nine News.

He explained he 'felt sick' when he found out the photo, which he said was just a 'prank', was being shared across the internet.

'To receive the message on Saturday night, it’s just gut-wrenching, it made me feel sick straight away,' he said on Monday.

Carney revealed he feels he's been 'betrayed' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain.
