It looks like a floating car seat - but Honda's robotic Uni-Cub unicycle lets ordinary people do what used to be the province of circus performers, and stay upright on just one wheel.

You simply lean to 'drive', and to steer - and in a demonstration in Tokyo this week, volunteers piloted it with ease.

When not in use, it can be folded up into a tiny carry case - although its top speed, 3.7mph, not far off walking speed, may mean it's not enormously popular with commuters. #

Honda unveiled the new device on Tuesday, which allows the rider to control its speed, up to 3.7mph per hour, and direction by shifting one's own weight

So far, there is no release date for the robot unicycle, which has a top speed of 3.7mph

The device was shown off by Honda this week - as yet, there are no plans for a release date.

The device is meant to be nimble enough that it can be used indoors.

As well as cars and motorcycles, Honda also has a long track record in robotics, with a humanoid robot, Asimo, that is a regular at its stage shows.

Swaying your body from side to side is all you need to do to turn, rotate full circle and zip around on the Uni-Cub. The Uni-Cub has one main wheel, while a tiny wheel at the back helps for circular moves. 

Reporters got a test ride on the machine Tuesday. It takes some getting used to but responds smoothly and quietly.

Lean forward to go straight, to the left to go left. If all fails to stop, just put your foot down. 

Uni-Cub will be on display at a Tokyo science museum. There are no plans yet for a commercial product.

The single
wheel on the U3-X is made
up of many tiny motor-controlled wheels, packed inside the bigger
wheel, allowing the device to swerve in any direction.

The U3-X weighs just under 22 pounds, runs
on a full charge for an hour, and has a lithium-ion battery. It is best suited to those over 5ft.

It may look a little precarious and 
uncomfortable to ride, but Honda believe their new 'personal mobility' 
device could one day be zipping up and down our streets.

The
vehicle looks like a very modern unicycle and to ride it you simply 
lean your weight in the direction you want to go, whether that's 
forward, backwards or even sideways. It maintains its own balance 
travelling up to 3.7MPH.

A slippery slope? Pixar film Wall-e predicted humans would become too obese to walk in the future after relying on technology

Segway (pictured with former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi,

Honda makes the Asimo walking child-shaped
robot and the U3-X uses some of the same technology.

Last year, Honda also unveiled a gadget that can
support a wearer's bodyweight, made of mechanical frames attached to a
pair of shoes.

Japanese
rival Toyota Motors has shown machines that help people get
around, including the Winglet, similar to the Segway, a scooter-like
device that people ride standing up.

Japan is one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world, and concerns are growing about helping the elderly get around.

'Honda
engineers are always thinking about people's dreams and wishes about
mobility. We will continue to work hard to be a leader in that area,' Mr
Ito said.
