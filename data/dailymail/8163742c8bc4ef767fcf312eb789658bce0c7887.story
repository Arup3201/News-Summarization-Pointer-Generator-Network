On a bright, spring morning in 1991, a young doctor made an emergency visit to a new patient on New York’s monied Upper East Side. He rode up to the eighth floor in a mahogany-panelled elevator with a uniformed doorman who admitted him to a murky 40ft hallway.

A single candle lit paintings by Renoir, Degas, Manet and Monet. In the gloom, Dr Singman came face-to-face with a frail and frightened woman in a soiled bathrobe. Untreated cancers had eaten away the left part of her lower lip and right cheek. Deep ulcers beneath her right eye exposed her orbital bone.

Cut off from the world: Huguette Clark chose to spend the last twenty years of her life in a hospital room

At 85, Huguette Clark had outlived her favourite doctors and hadn’t dared trust anybody new until she felt close to death. Dr Singman sent her straight to Manhattan’s Doctors Hospital.

And though she made an excellent recovery, she never returned to her regal quarters — or to her lavish mansions in Connecticut and California — preferring to spend the next 20 years and two months in a cell-like room overlooking the hospital’s industrial air-conditioning unit.

This fascinating biography by journalist Bill Dedman and Huguette’s nephew Paul Clark Newell Jr never really gets to the bottom of this exceptionally healthy and wealthy woman’s strange decision to spend her last two decades in minimalist medical seclusion.

But it tells a gripping rags-to-riches tale of the heady accumulation and weird dispersal of one of America’s greatest fortunes — allowing readers a good gawp through the gilded keyhole, before reassuring them that too much gold can turn life pretty cold.

Huguette Clark was the daughter of W. A. Clark: a red-whiskered entrepreneur who was born in a Pennsylvanian log-cabin. He turned his first significant profit in the 1860s, selling supplies to gold-rush prospectors, but made his big bucks in mining just as copper was becoming the essential conductor of modern life — used in the new telegraph cables, light bulbs and full metal jacket bullets.

By the early 1900s, he may well have been the wealthiest man in America, for while oilman John D. Rockefeller had more cash in the bank, the ‘Copper King’ had more assets under the ground.

The question this book poses is: did his vast wealth leave his family a poisonous legacy? While his contemporary Andrew Carnegie believed life should be divided into three stages, namely education, making money and giving it away, Clark never reached that third stage. When he died in 1925, he left an estate estimated at $100-$250 million ($3.4 billion, or £2 billion today) and only $600,000 to charity. The rest went to family, with one fifth going to his youngest child, 18-year-old Huguette.

The second daughter of Clark’s second marriage — to a 28-year-old French Canadian when he was 67 — Huguette (pronounced Ooo-get) was born in Paris but raised in the largest house in New York: 121 rooms for the family of four.

The little girls raced up and down the white marble staircase, played hide-and-seek among the marbled columns leading to the sculpture hall, sat beneath its 36ft octagonal dome and hurtled past the Borgias’ pottery collection (painted with brushes made of mouse whiskers) to the music of a cathedral-scale organ.

They were only forbidden to run in the Grand Salon, decorated with oak from Sherwood forest and a clock from Marie Antoinette’s boudoir.

Huguette’s older sister Andrée was the more outgoing of the two but died suddenly of meningitis just before her 17th birthday, leaving a diary that revealed she’d been unhappy in her gilded cage until she’d been allowed to join the Girl Scouts at 16. She wrote: ‘Scouting has been a hand in the dark to me. It has changed me from a moody, thoughtless girl, and has shown me what life may be.’

Bereft of her beloved sister, Huguette’s introversion increased. She never joined the Scouts, and flummoxed classmates — who couldn’t work out if she was arrogant or embarrassed by her father’s political scandals and social climbing. After his death, she stayed at home with her kind but reserved mother, talking in French so that friends and servants wouldn’t understand them.

Then, even her mother was shut out as Huguette’s passion for painting and dollhouses grew.

Although attractive, Huguette showed little interest in men. There might have been a crush on an art teacher — and she was married, at 22, to the son of her father’s accountant.

But the union, possibly arranged by her mother, lasted only nine months. Her family suspected she was unwilling to consummate her vows, while others speculated she was just too caught up in her art. As paintings sold at Christie’s last month reveal, Huguette was a talented artist, excelling with oils at a time when women were expected to stick to pastels.

Recluse: Huguette spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room, watching The Smurfs on TV

Whatever the truth of it, she continued to write to her ex-husband using the same polite-but-distant tone she used with almost everybody.

From Andrée’s death until her own, Huguette’s closest and most enduring attachments appear to have been with her dolls. She lavished all her time and money on them — commissioning $80,000 dollhouses and Dior doll dresses while ignoring pleas for funds from an orphanage founded by her father.

As she grew older, she treated her real houses like toys, insisting the table remained set for her at the Californian estate she did not visit in more than 50 years, and turning her New York bedroom into an exact replica of her mother’s.

Although this book makes a compassionate and psychologically subtle effort to rescue the heiress from the reductive clichés of reclusive eccentricity, her life still reads as sad and stunted.

Despite an incredible property portfolio and remarkable good health, a woman worth $300 million spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room, leafing through snapshots of her Barbie dolls and watching The Smurfs on TV.

She also doled out more than $31 million in gifts to a dedicated but arguably unethical nurse, while the family’s lawyers circled.

It is telling that Huguette’s favourite fairy tale was Rapunzel. She commissioned many dollhouses to act out the story. But with a lifelong suspicion that people were only after her money, the Copper King’s daughter spent her life building her own prison towers, and never dared let down her hair.
