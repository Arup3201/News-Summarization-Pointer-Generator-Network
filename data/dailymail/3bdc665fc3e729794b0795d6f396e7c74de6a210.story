Five elderly people died after  suffering a devastating catalogue of neglect at a care home rated ‘good’ by the official regulator.

Another 14 residents died of natural causes after suffering ‘sub-optimal’ care at the home, run by the Southern Cross chain.

A coroner yesterday said the Orchid View home was riddled with ‘institutional abuse’ yet the Care Quality Commission had failed to raise the alarm.

'Disgraceful: A five-week inquest has heard how residents were given the wrong medication and left soiled

She said staff – several of whom are still working in the care sector – should be ‘ashamed’ of their behaviour, some of which involved shredding medical records in an attempted cover-up.

A five-week inquest heard that residents were routinely given overdoses of medication, and were left soiled and in pain during two years of terrible mismanagement and staff shortages.

West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the regulator’s positive assessment of the £3,000-a-month home a year before it closed was ‘not fit for purpose’.

She ruled that abuse and neglect by staff contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John  Holmes, 85.

Mrs Halfpenny died after being given three times the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin, and had to be admitted to hospital for bleeding.

abuse'

Abuse: Wilfred Gardner, 85, who died at the home after being neglected. A coroner was scathing as sher delivered a verdict following a five-week inquest

Lisa Martin, a former administrator who left in disgust and became a whistleblower, said she was asked to shred Mrs Halfpenny’s medical records to cover up the blunder, and new ones were falsified. The inquest came on the day that Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt said the care of many elderly people in Britain is a ‘national disgrace’.

A million older people are forgotten and isolated because no relatives and friends visit them.

He promised new measures to beef up inspections of care homes after 112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by councils in England last year.

Whistleblower: Lisa Martin, former carer at Orchid View, who raised the alarm after 28 separate drugs failings on one night shift

Mr Hunt said ‘something is going badly wrong’ in a society where potentially so many instances are happening every single week.

It was revealed during the inquest that nurses shut doors on elderly people who called for help, an elderly woman was left in a toilet and forgotten, and parcel tape was used to secure a resident’s dressing.

Miss Martin said the final straw was when she was told by a nurse that they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called police who arrived the next day.

Orchid View was eventually closed down in late 2011 after another CQC probe found it had failed to meet eight of its essential standards of quality and safety.

Sussex police began an investigation and five people were arrested, some on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to Mrs Halfpenny’s death.

But there was judged to be insufficient evidence to prosecute. A serious case review will now take place into the deaths.

It is the latest scandal to hit the NHS watchdog, which is already under fire for failing to spot the scandal at Morecambe Bay hospital where up to 14 babies died from neglect, and then allegedly trying to cover it up.

The CQC was also accused of not doing more to stop the horrific abuse of disabled patients at Winterbourne View hospital in Bristol. Southern Cross was once Britain’s biggest care home operator, but collapsed with £1billion debts in 2011 after cost-cutting by a private equity firm, leaving 31,000 vulnerable residents stranded.

The inquest heard the multi-million-pound home in Copthorne, near Crawley, had a ‘five star’ feel when it opened in September 2009, and its appearance ‘seduced’ families into believing it was well-run.

But witnesses and former staff told how residents were treated with a lack of respect and dignity, and there were problems with medication and staffing levels. Miss Schofield said: ‘There was institutionalised abuse throughout the home and it started, in my view, at a very early stage, and nobody did anything about it.

‘This, to me, was from the top down. It was completely mismanaged and understaffed and failed to provide a safe environment for residents.

‘It’s a heart-breaking case.

‘We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives.’

She said it was ‘disgraceful’ that the home was allowed to be run in the way it was and given a ‘good’ rating by the CQC in 2010 – a year before it shut.

‘I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose,’ she said.

Linzi Collings, the daughter of Jean Halfpenny, said: ‘How such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled.’

Anger: Solicitor Ian Christian speaks on behalf of the families of the victims of 'institutionalised abuse' at Orchid View care home

This week the Government announced a 
package of proposals to prevent abuse and neglect in care homes, 
including hidden  cameras and ‘mystery shoppers’ reporting back on their
experience.

Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven of the families at the inquest, described the case as a ‘scandal’ which should not be allowed to happen again.

Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care, said the watchdog had to ‘learn lessons’ from the tragedy and a root-and-branch review had been launched.

She said: ‘This was completely unacceptable, and I extend my sympathies to the relatives of everyone who received poor care there.’
