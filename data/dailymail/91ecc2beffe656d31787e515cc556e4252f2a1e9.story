Megan Fletcher added to England's gold tally in the under-70kgs when she threw and then pinned down Moira de Villiers of New Zealand.

Scotland's Sally Conway, the world number five beaten in the semi final by Fletcher, won bronze after edging past India's Sunibala Bhuidrom on penalty scores following a scoreless contest.

Alix Arenaud-Roy won the other bronze for Canada after beating Australian Catherine Arscott.

Fletcher, a Geography teacher in Bristol, broke down as she paid an emotional tribute to her late former coach Don Werner, who passed away earlier this year from cancer.

She said: 'Pinewood was my original club, where my coach died earlier this year, he used to help me so much, and everything I still do now... sorry....

'Everything I do now, he taught me, so I will always be grateful to him, and hopefully he would be proud.'

The 24-year-old had been cheered on by younger brother Ben, whose knee injury robbed him of the chance of competing at the Games.

She added: 'I saw Ben after the semi-final and we had a little bit of an emotional moment with each other.

'It was so disappointing for us as a family to be so close to coming here and Ben could have won it here, but he is such a strong-minded person here that I know in the future he will be one to watch.'
