Brian Williams' six-month suspension from NBC may give him the time to pursue his real passion: comedy.

The Nightly News anchor, whose career crumbled this past week as veterans called him out for lying in a report about the Invasion of Iraq, allegedly wanted to give up the news desk years ago to host of the Tonight Show.

According to a former colleague quoted in New York magazine, Williams lobbied for the job when the network was looking to replace Jay Leno in 2013 when the veteran host announced his second retirement. 

Instead the job went to SNL veteran Jimmy Fallon.

Dream job: A former colleague of Brian Williams revealed that he wanted to give up the anchor desk at the Nightly News to take over the Tonight Show when the network was looking to replace Jay Leno when the veteran host announced his second retirement in 2013

'Brian wants to be a late-night comedian,' the former colleague said. 'He traded on being Nightly News anchorman-war-reporter to ingratiate himself with Jimmy [Fallon], Lorne Michaels, and Jon Stewart.'

Jay Leno hosted the Tonight Show from 1992 - 2009 and again from 2010 - 2014

On Friday, NBC News president Deborah Turness released a statement saying Williams would be placed on six month's leave without pay, after it was revealed he lied about a report from 2003.

During the U.S. Invasion of Iraq, Williams was embedded with a troop, and while flying in a Chinook helicopter, reported that the aircraft had been hit with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). 

However, soldiers who were on the helicopter with him said it wasn't their aircraft that was hit, but the one in front of them. 

The old report gained attention again when Williams repeated the story in a recent broadcast. 

Other reports by Williams have also come into question, such as his dispatches from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. 

Williams was staying at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the French Quarter during the disaster and reported that he saw a body face down, floating in the water outside the luxury hotel. 

However, the French Quarter received little flooding during Katrina, and hotel workers were skeptical of the report. 

NBC News continues to investigate Williams past reports, and they are also now looking into his expenses. Experts say the continued investigation may mean that Williams' unpaid leave will eventually end in his firing.

Meanwhile, back-up anchor Lester Holt has been filling in for Williams this past week, and network executives are said to be monitoring his ratings to see if he can make a full-time replacement.
