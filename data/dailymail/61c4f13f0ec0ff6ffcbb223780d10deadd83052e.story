I've being saying it for months that Robin van Persie needs to be shown the exit door at Manchester United.

He was woeful against Liverpool.

As soon as a player starts to kick up it spreads through the dressing room and sours the squad.

Exit: Stuttering striker Robin van Persie needs to be shown the door at Manchester United

Sour: His woeful performances are affecting the rest of the squad

Ineffective: Van Persie's heat map shows how little he was involved in the game

Van Persie is not pulling his weight and his comment last week that he wanted to end his career at Manchester United was a smoke screen.

He clearly wants out. David Moyes has a lot to sort out.

Juan Mata is not a wide player, he does not have the pace and athleticism to play on the left or right wing for United.

Jose Mourinho bombed him out of Chelsea because he can't run box-to-box.

He needs to be playing in the middle of the pitch, in the same position as Wayne Rooney, to be effective.

The balance is not right and the chemistry is simply not there. They lack pace, they lack unity and they lack team spirit.

Moyes needs a top draw holding central midfield player and two new young, mobile centre backs.

But first and foremost, top of his priorities, should be getting rid of RVP.

No wide boy: Juan Mata does not have the pace or athleticism to play on the wing

Thrashed: Liverpool were dominant at Old Trafford as United floundered at home again

Changes: David Moyes' squad overhaul should start with getting rid of Van Persie

Thirteen years ago I was watching a game between Stevenage reserves and Ford United reserves on a cold Tuesday night.

I spotted this skinny young boy, who looked like he was suffering from malnutrition, playing against some of Fordâ€™s tough, big men from Essex.

The boy had a great left foot and was striding up and down the wing with confidence.

Going down: George Boyd dived trying to win a penalty for Hull against Manchester City on Saturday

It was clear that night that the kid was one to watch. His name was George Boyd.

I
 do not know him personally, but I admire all players who have come into
 football fighting their way through the lower tiers to get to the top.

George
 has gone through clubs at the Conference, League Two, League One and 
the Championship to get where he is now.

Demonstrating
 that you can make the big steps up with hard work and dedication should
 make him a role model to all young players It can take you an awful 
long time.

Not that type of player: Boyd would not have deliberately spat at Joe Hart

Now 28 years old, he's been rejected, knocked back and kept going. He once had a medical at Nottingham Forest and was told he had a dodgy eye.

I don't believe for one moment a player with his personalty and characteristics would deliberately spit at Joe Hart.

He is a good Boyd.

What a pleasure it was to be a guest of talkSPORT radio at the Cheltenham Festival on Gold Cup day.

I was well looked after by Paddy Power - believe it or not there is actually a bloke called Paddy Power who owns the betting firm.

When I met the producer Mike outside with my ticket, I thought he was having a laugh as we made our way through the crowds to the corporate boxes down near the finishing line.

Well looked after: Mad Dog was at the Cheltenham Festival last week

When we made our way up the steps to our box I noticed just to the right was the Royal Box and inside I could see Princess Anne and Zara Phillips.

That's the closest I've come to the Royal family since one of them shook my hand on the pitch at Wembley before the game against Oxford in the 1986 Milk Cup final.

You should've seen the shocked look on my face.

I was mixing with the top punters who were whispering into their mobile phones to get their bets on.

Royalty: Zara Phillips (second left) was also at the Cheltenham Festival

I must say, I kept my betting slip secretly under wraps as my five pound win slips would've probably been quite embarrassing to the big-hitting professionals there that day.

I was getting tips left right and centre and, as always, every single one of them was straight from the horse's mouth.

My tip that afternoon on the Hawksbee and Jacobs show was for an Aston Villa victory against Chelsea.

When I said that Andy Jacobs, a Chelsea season ticket holder wearing his wonderful tweed Cheltenham suit, looked at me like I was mad.

Top tip: My tip for the Cheltenham festival... was for Aston Villa to beat Chelsea

But I knew there was a chance of a slip up, with the energy and athleticism of Paul Lambert's young team and the outstanding quality of Christian Benteke, coupled with a Champions League game just a few days away for Chelsea.

Lambert has never once criticised his players through some testing times this season and, mark my words, the players at Villa will be challenging next year towards the top end of the league, rather than worrying about the bottom.

Dejan Lovren has shown this season in the centre of Southampton's defence that he has got b***s. Well, after the weekend, he is certainly nursing them after a Norwich player accidentally stepped on one of his testicles.

It made me wince when I heard that it had swelled up.

Painful: Dejan Lovren suffered a nasty injury in the win against Norwich...

It reminds me of the second-most watched video clip in the Allen household - the one of Phil Babb trying to clear the ball off the line against Chelsea with an amazing sliding clearance, only to miss the ball and be skewered by the post between his legs.

It was in front of the live TV cameras and an Anfield stadium packed to the rafters.

It never fails to bring a tear to the eye.

Oh by the way, the most-watched video clip and voted unanimously as number one at my home was of the Luton Town supporters on YouTube chanting 'Martin Allen is a...' repeatedly at me for 10 minutes. I can't possibly repeat what they said in this column.

I was manager at Brentford at the time.

My sons thought it was amusing.

Quite often if I said they couldn't go out, or that it was time for their bed or that they had to do their homework, they would put the YouTube clip on inside the house at full volume!
