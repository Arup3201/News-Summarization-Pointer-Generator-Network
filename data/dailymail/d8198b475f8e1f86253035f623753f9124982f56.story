The indignity of mixed-sex hospital wards may at last be coming to an end after a startling fall in the number of patients put in them.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the Health Service had done a 'fantastic job' after it was revealed that numbers accommodated on such wards fell by 90 per cent in the space of a few months.

The news follows years of broken  promises by Labour and is a dramatic victory for the Daily Mail which has consistently fought to bring to an end the NHS practice of mixing men and women patients.

No longer the norm: Mixed sex wards are now in the minority

Backed by patients' groups, the Mail 
has argued that being forced to share wards with the opposite sex is 
undignified – and puts women at risk.

Figures show that last December more 
than 11,000 patients were forced to share wards with the opposite sex, 
when the monthly collection of mixed-sex accommodation data was first 
introduced.

Since then the number of reported 
breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has
fallen by 90 per cent.

Just 1,126 in England were made to sleep on mixed sex wards last month – a record low.

More than two thirds of hospitals reported zero cases, with the North-East becoming the first region to report none at all.

Of the 167 trusts that reported, 115 (69 per cent) had no breaches in July.

Shortly after the Coalition came to 
power, Mr Lansley announced tough new measures to stamp out the 
humiliation endured by thousands of patients having to share wards, 
toilets and bathrooms with the opposite sex.

In April he brought in fines of £250 
for each day a patient had to sleep in a mixed-sex ward, which appears 
to have galvanised NHS managers.

Previously, the levels of fines varied considerably and were inconsistently levied.

Fighting for dignity: How the Mail's campaign led the way

It is 15 years since Tony Blair first 
called for the abolition of mixed wards – a year before he became prime 
minister – saying it should not be 'beyond the collective wit of 
ministers' to achieve.

However, despite a pledge to ban them
in its 1997 and 2001 election manifestos, and a fining system, Labour 
eventually concluded it would be too expensive to get rid of them all.

It was agreed that in some cases men 
and women could share a ward if they were separated using partitioned 
bays. In recent years, a number of female patients have been assaulted 
by men on such wards.

When the Coalition came to power last
year, it promised to scrap mixed accommodation in all trusts from acute
hospitals to mental health units.

Only intensive care and A&E units have exemptions.

'Fantastic job': Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, hailed the NHS for 'getting to grips' with the problem

Mr Lansley said: 'The NHS has done a fantastic job getting to grips with this.'

He said any future capital investments
in NHS hospitals – whether brand new developments or refurbishments – 
should look to ensure a minimum of half their beds in single en-suite 
rooms.

He said: 'Single-sex accommodation is 
what people can now expect. By introducing greater transparency, this 
Government has driven down breaches by 90 per cent in eight months.' The
rules do allow wards to be segregated into distinct bays as long as 
they have separate facilities.

Katherine Murphy, director of the 
Patients Association, said; 'It's embarrassing that it took the threat 
of fines to get managers to respect the human rights of individual 
patients.

'Ideally the number of breaches should
be at zero everywhere. On occasions mixed-sex accommodation may be 
necessary, but it should be a rarity not the everyday occurrence it was 
in the past.'

The Daily Mail has been campaigning 
for 17 years to scrap mixed-sex wards – the use of which has continued 
despite a series of Labour pledges.

Distressing calls to the Patients 
Association helpline told of elderly women being forced to share 
toilets, bathrooms and sleeping areas with men, with only a curtain for 
privacy and safety.

Help the Aged backed the campaign, 
highlighting the humiliation felt by older men and women dressed only in
hospital gowns having to use unisex toilets.

In 1996, as leader of the Opposition, 
Tony Blair said abolishing mixed sex wards was 'not just a question of 
money, but a question of political will'.

Broken promise: Tony Blair vowed to get rid of the indignity of mixed-sex wards in 1996, when he was leader of the Labour party in Opposition

A year later Baroness Jay, his Health 
Minister, said authorities would be expected to get rid of mixed sex 
wards within the next two years.

Further promises that they would disappear followed – until Health Minister Lord Darzi changed tack in January 2008.

He said: 'The only way we're going to 
have single-sex wards within the NHS is to build the whole of the NHS 
into single rooms. That is an aspiration that cannot be met.'

But in January 2009 the then Health 
Secretary Alan Johnson admitted Labour had 'got it wrong'  and 
introduced fines for hospitals that breached a commitment to 'virtually 
eliminate' mixed wards.
