The Duchess of York faces 22 years in jail after a Turkish court pressed charges against her for secretly filming in an orphanage.

The charges relate to an undercover documentary Sarah Ferguson made with ITV in 2008 to expose 'appalling' conditions in state run institutions.

A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘The Duchess of York has fully co-operated with both the Turkish and British authorities at all times on this issue.

'British ministers refused to accede 
to the further requests for legal assistance from Turkey. From a UK 
perspective, the Duchess has been told by the Home Office that the case 
is closed.

The action today reported by the Turkish authorities is news to all.’

Yesterday a court accused Prince Andrew's former wife in absentia of 'going against the law in acquiring footage and violating privacy' of five children.

She faces a maximum term of 22 and-a-half years in prison if convicted. No trial date has been set.

'Anywhere else it would be the authorities running these homes who were in the dock,' a source close to the Duchess said.

'It was a humanitarian mission, there was no political aspect to it whatsoever. The Turkish Government has no jurisdiction here and the British Government has made clear that she cannot be extradited.'

'Sarah is saddened that the Turkish 
Government's actions are being allowed to overshadow a legitimate 
journalistic investigation into the appalling conditions in state-run 
orphanages in Turkey.'

During
 the Tonight documentary, Duchess and Daughters: Their Secret Mission, 
Sarah disguised herself with a black wig and a headscarf to visit an 
orphanage near Ankara.

Undercover
 footage appeared to show a number of disabled inmates had been tied to 
their beds by staff unable to cope with them. Others were fed lying down
 or confined to cots without proper care.

The
 day after the broadcast, however, the Turkish authorities accused the 
Duchess of taking part in a politically motivated campaign against their
 country and of deliberately trying to derail their bid to join the EU.

Nimet Cubukcu, Turkey's minister responsible for child protection, said: 'It was known that this Sarah was against Turkey's EU bid.'

Foreign minister Ali Babacan also criticised the use of hidden cameras, claiming it was 'a breach of privacy'.

The
 following year, acting at the behest of Turkish authorities, officers 
from Scotland Yard presented letters to the Duchess's lawyer and to two 
ITV journalists demanding they co-operate with their enquiries into the 
incident.

At the time a 
Home Office spokesman said: 'It is not our usual policy to comment on 
individual cases. However, the Home Office can confirm it has received a
 formal request for mutual legal assistance concerning Sarah, Duchess of
 York.'

Scotland Yard 
said letters had been sent to the three 'in order to organise for the 
collection of information sought by the Turkish authorities'.

Britain has an extradition deal with Turkey under the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition.

A suspect can be extradited if accused of an offence which is punishable in both Turkey and Britain by at least one year in prison.

But it is unlikely that any attempt to extradite the Duchess would succeed - encouraging news for her as Turkish jails are known for their harsh conditions.

Last night a Home Office source said: 'As it stands, she will not be extradited. The Turkish authorities have no power to do so.'

A spokesman for the department confirmed: 'A judge is required to refuse an extradition request if there is no equivalent offence in British law.'
