Real Madrid players appeared to be in high spirits as they put the finishing touches to their preparations for the potential La Liga title decider against Barcelona this weekend. 

The two clubs, who occupy the top two spots in Spain's top flight, are set to face each other at the Nou Camp on Sunday. 

Gareth Bale's brace in a 2-0 win over Levante last weekend arrested a run of three games without victory for Los Blancos, but the game against Barca will undoubtedly represent a far sterner test.

The Catalans come into El Clasico off the back of six consecutive wins, the last of which confirmed Premier League side Manchester City's exit from the Champions League. 

Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has been under intense pressure in recent weeks from the fans and board alike and the Italian will know that a victory against Barca would go along way towards assuaging those concerns. 

Meanwhile, world-record signing Bale, will be keen to carry on the form he showed against Levante, which marked his first two goals in nine games. The forward had also been on the receiving end of some stick from the crowd.
