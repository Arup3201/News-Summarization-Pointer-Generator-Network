Prime Minister David Cameron said he was determined to roll back the green levies which push up bills

David Cameron today signalled that green levies on energy bills will be cut within days, as the political row over living costs heated up.

The Prime Minister said he was determined to ‘roll back' costs which add to pressures on family finances, ahead of next week's Autumn Statement.

But Downing Street was forced to deny reports it had 'asked for a price freeze' in talks with energy firms in a bid to ensure gas and electricity charges did not rise ahead of the next election.

and was still working on ways to ease the pressure on family finances.

It was reported that ministers were urging the Big Six to hold prices until the
middle of 2015 if action is taken next week on curbing green levies which push
up costs.

Labour leader Ed Miliband seized on the claims, to accuse Mr Cameron of 'flailing' around in search of an energy policy.

'What we now know is that while David Cameron has in public been opposing an energy price freeze, in private he has been pleading with the energy companies to get him off the hook,' Mr Miliband said.

The Labour leader stepped up his calls for
the biggest overhaul of the energy market since the utilities were privatised.

Since he unveiled his promise to freeze gas and electricity
bills from 2015 to early 2017, the government has been scrambling to find a way
to offer help to families now.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use the
Autumn Statement on Thursday to announce that up to £50 will be cut from bills by removing levies
used to fund green and social policies. Instead they will be funded from general taxation.

Industry sources suggested last night that Energy Secretary Ed Davey had written to
the Big Six asking for a price freeze in return for the green levy cuts.

But a Number 10 source said: 'This story is utterly misleading. The Government has not asked for a price freeze. People should wait for us to announce our plans.'

Profits on the average bill have risen from £8 in 2009 to £53 in 2012, fuelled by a bitterly cold winter

Latest figures show the profits made from domestic bills has
risen by 75 per cent to £53.

The Big Six – British Gas, Npower, E.ON, EDF, SSE and
Scottish Power – are pushing up prices by up to 10 per cent this winter.

Speaking
 at a summit in Lithuania today, Mr Cameron said: 'I've said all along I
 want households and families to have sustainably low energy prices now 
the only way you can do that is by increasing competition and rolling 
back some of the costs of some of the levies.

'I've said that is what we are going to do and that is what we are going to do.

'That's a world away from saying you might do something in 20 months time with no ideas about how to do it. That is a con, we're talking about real policy.'

Energy watchdog Ofgem this week warned the Big Six that 'making a profit is not an entitlement' after reveal a sharp rise in the money they made in 2012.

But Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, today insisted the profits made by the companies were 'modest'.

'In the energy industry, we have got a lot of changes for customers coming through, but it also is very political,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'The energy situation is a lot more complicated than people often think. Only about 18 per cent of the bill comes from energy.

'The profits are pretty modest, not in the league of many other industries. Energy companies have to be profitable.’

Mr Miliband used a speech in Manchester today to set out more detail
of his plans to overhaul the energy market, which he would push through in the
20 months that a Labour government would freeze prices.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, in a speech at Manchester town hall, called for a two-year freeze to give time to overhaul the energy market

He pledged to end the energy ‘rip-off’ and call for a
tough new regulator, and an independent body to plan new infrastructure and
ensure the lights stay on.

He also promised action to boost competition among
suppliers, and simplify bills for customers.

The shake-up - described by Mr Miliband as the biggest
since privatisation in the 1980s - would be implemented during the 20 month
price freeze planned if Labour wins the general election.

‘In the past three years it has become clear to everyone
but this government that the energy market is broken,’ he said.

‘Prices are rising year on year without justification.
And Britain is not getting the investment in energy we need to secure supplies
for the future.’

An independent Energy Security Board would be created
modelled on the Office for Budget Responsibility, to help draw up and implement
a timetable for building energy capacity.

A new regulator will have powers to order firms to pass
on wholesale savings to customers, and intervene in the market to ensure
consumers will get good value in the future.

Other commitments in the green paper include preventing
power generation companies doing exclusive deals with their retail arms and ensuring
all environmental and policy levies on bills are delivering ‘value for money’.
