A Boston Market employee unwittingly ranted about his hatred of customers to a female co-worker, who ended up being a company exec working incognito on Undercover Boss.

A youthful looking employee named Ronnie, at the company's outpost in Duluth, Georgia, said he hated guests who came to the restaurant, calling them selfish and demanding.

The undercover executive became livid and ended up firing the man, the first time ever for someone to get the boot on the CBS reality show.

Sara Bittorf, Chief Brand Officer at Boston Market, was sent on a reconnaissance mission by the company's CEO to appear on the CBS show and find out what was actually going on, in the episode that aired on February 1.

Ms Bittorf posed as a waitress, Rachel Rand, who joined the Boston Market staff - saying she was appearing on a reality show to win a chance to open her own diner.

But she had no idea what was in store for her when she showed up as a trainee at a Boston Market in Duluth, Georgia.

She underwent training and learned the tricks of the trade but was appalled when her shift supervisor, Ronnie, spent much of his time mouthing off about the people being served.

'I literally hate customers more than anything in the entire world. I hate them so much,' he told Bittorf, knowing full well his words were being captured on camera for the so-called reality show.

'They're terrible. It's all about them all the time and they demand everything,' he continued, adding his disdain at having to 'suffer through' the day serving customers.

Oops: Ronnie was surprised to learn the girl in the kitchen was actually a big shot at Boston Market

Defensive: Ronnie didn't see what the big deal was about his comments, saying 'It's not wrong of me to hate people'

The secret exec excused herself from the kitchen to catch her breath because she became so incensed by Ronnie's comments.

'My job's on the line. Here I am a representative of this brand and this is what happens. It can't happen on my watch,' she said as she tried to cool off in the parking lot.

'I can't have someone who just told me that they hate customers more than anything in the world serving our guests. That's the complete antithesis of what we stand for.'

After collecting her thoughts, Bittorf decided the truth must be told.

She revealed her true identity to Ronnie and scolded him for his behavior.

'Without the guests in there, we don't have a business and you don't have a paycheck,' she informed him, sending him home for the day as his future hung in the balance.

Ronnie was shocked to learn the kitchen help was actually a bigwig at the company but even so, he failed to show remorse at his prior comments.

'I would tell them my attitude would change but I didn't think it was that terrible,' he said, out of earshot of Bittorf after the big reveal.

Shocked: The undercover exec was appalled that a shift supervisor openly shared how much he hated customers

'It's not wrong of me to hate people,' he said.

'They don't know I'm saying it so it's not that big a deal but now this giant lady of Boston Market knows what's going on, that's just not fair,' he said before he got into his car and drove home for the day.

After Ronnie got a dressing down from Bittorf, she revealed her true identity to the branch manager and advised that Ronnie be fired. 

The manager agreed and Ronnie was shown the door, a first for the CBS program that has been on the air since February 2010.
