The White House announced $254.6 million in new aid for Central American countries today.

The money will go toward returning unaccompanied minors who travel to the U.S. illegally to their families and fostering youth centered programs in their home countries, the White House said this afternoon.

The assistance to the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras announced today is in addition to the $130 million in aid the U.S. already provides those countries in economic assistance.

The U.S. has also decided to begin detaining families at the border instead of giving them court dates and releasing them.

The new aid package and the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S. border will be the subject of Vice President Joe Biden's meetings this afternoon in Guatemala with senior representatives of the Central American countries.

Misconceptions about the Obama administration's illegal immigration policies have caused mammoth numbers of Central American children to embark on the dangerous journey to the United States throughout the last two years.

The president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy initiative only applies to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. under the age of 16 before June 15, 2012 and had lived in the U.S. 
continuously for five years before that dates.

But teens and children from Central America have been flooding the United States guided by the belief that they too will receive amnesty.

Roughly 47,000 unaccompanied minors have made the trip from Mexico to Texas since 
October.

The Obama administration expects a total of 80,000 illegal immigrant children to come to the U.S. this year alone, according to a report in the Christian Science Monitor.

The White House says U.S. immigration officials repatriated 47,769 illegal immigrants from Guatemala, 37,049 from Honduras, and 21,602 from El Salvador last year.

That makes up approximately 29 percent of all U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency deportations. 

The White House did not say how many of the illegal immigrants being sent back to those countries were ages 17 and younger.

The White House sent Biden, left, to meet with Molina, right, and other regional leaders to warn against the perils of illegal immigration and announce that the U.S. will start detaining families at the border instead of releasing them on their own recognizance

The White House rushed to publicly address the issue this week after photos of children sleeping on floors in cramped quarters and reports of unhygienic conditions in the detention centers surfaced several weeks ago.

Today the White House announced that it would 
provide additional resources to the Department of Justice and DHS so that they can process removals of illegal immigrants more 
rapidly.

In a letter to President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner called on the president to go one step further and 'immediately deploy the National Guard.'

'The National Guard is uniquely qualified to respond to such humanitarian crises, 'Boehner said. 'They are able to help deal with both the needs of these children and families as well as relieve the border patrol to focus on their primary duty of securing our border.'

President Obama has not yet responded to Boehner's letter, but it divulged this afternoon that it would give Central American countries $9.6 million to expand their repatriation centers so that they can intake returned migrants more quickly.

The U.S. will give another $40 million to Guatemala, $25 million to El Salvador and $18.5 million to Honduras for at-risk youth services that are intended to slow the rate of gang growth and migration to America, in addition to the $161.5 million it is giving to the region for similar programs.

Last weekend the White House announced that Biden would tack on a trip to Guatemala to his Latin American trip to speak to leaders of Central American countries about the 'root causes' of the mass migrations and find out how the U.S. can help the countries 'try to make life better 
for these families and children in all of the countries of Central 
America.'

This afternoon Biden met with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and Guatemalan Vice President Roxanna Baldetti. Later he will meet with Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren.

'The surge of unaccompanied minors making
 the very perilous journey from Central America to the United State and 
often if not primarily in the hands of smuggling networks that engage in
 physical and sexual abuse of these children,' Biden said in a statement
 after his meeting with the Guatemalan government.

'This is a serious 
humanitarian issue standing alone all by itself, and … it is a 
fundamentally shared problem for the United States, Mexico, and this 
entire region.'

In his remarks, Biden acknowledge that 'the current situation is not sustainable.'

'It is unacceptable,' he said.

But it is important that Guatemala recognize and address the root reasons children are fleeing the country, Biden said.

'Especially poverty, insecurity and the lack of the rule of law, so the people can stay and thrive in their own communities,' Biden said, 'so a parent doesn’t feel so desperate that they put their child in the hands of a criminal network and say take him, and take her to the United States.'

Guatemala's president said in his own statement that he had asked the U.S. to give illegal immigrants from Central America a 'temporary protected status' that would allow them to stay in the United States because of how dangerous it has become to live in their home countries.

The U.S. has already denied to give Central Americans any sort of special immigration status and that is unlikely to change now.

Yesterday, President 
Barack Obama told Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto that 
unaccompanied minors illegally entering the U.S. through its border with
 Mexico will be sent back to their home countries.

During
 a phone call with Nieto on Thursday night Obama explained to his 
Mexican counterpart that neither his Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals policy nor his comprehensive immigration reform legislation 
that is stalled in the Senate would provide amnesty to the hundreds of 
children crossing the U.S. border each day.

Yesterday,
 Obama also talked with the Mexican president about a regional strategy 
that includes the governments of Central American countries to reduce 
the number of children coming to the United States illegally.

Obama
 also talked with Nieto about how the two countries can work together to
 shut down the criminal networks shuttling children from country to 
country.

The Vice 
President called Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández to 
discuss the regional strategy earlier today on the plane to Guatemala, 
the White House said.

He will meet in person with senior representatives from Honduras and Mexico this afternoon, as well.

The Obama administration's new strategy for 
handling immigration came just hours after Gallup released a poll 
showing that Obama's immigration approval rate had tanked to 31 percent 
it's recent poll - Obama's lowest ranking on the topic since 2011.
