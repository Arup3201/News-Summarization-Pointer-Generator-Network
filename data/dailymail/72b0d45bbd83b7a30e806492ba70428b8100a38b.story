Scammers are calling 10,000 Americans a week posing at IRS agents and have already stolen $15.5 million from 3,000 victims, say federal agents.

With the tax filing deadline just one month and a half away, Americans should stay wary of fraudsters trying to steal their money by imp.

Treasury Department deputy inspector general for investigations Tim Camus said that the hoax is the 'largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of the agency.'

Victim:  Al Cadenhead, pictured at a press conference on Friday,  lost $16,500 in an IRS phone scam in which an unidentified woman told him to transfer his money onto prepaid debit cards and give her the number 

At least 366,000 reported receiving a scam, phone call, with approximately one per cent falling for the scam. 

CBS reports that Al Cadenhead who works as a senior pastor at Providence Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina got such a phone call last fall.

'Don't disregard this message as delay in calling us back might end up in a legal matter for you,' the message said.

Caldenhead called the woman back immediately and she proceeded to give a false badge number and allegedly told Cadenhead the IRS was issuing a warrant for his address.

'This woman gave me her name and her badge number and said she was informing me that they were filing a warrant for my arrest,' Cadenhead said.

Part of the scam: The scammers instruct their victims to put their cash onto prepaid MoneyPak cards 

'For tax fraud; and she started listing all the things they were going to do.'

The women then allegedly threatened Cadenhead and said that is he didn't do what she told him to do she would freeze all of his accounts.

'My heart was racing. It was racing. I am very afraid at that point,' Cadenhead said.

Even though Cadenhead didn't think that he did anything wrong, he feared for his reputation and was under extreme pressure.

'I don't want to cause embarrassment to my family, to my church. I'm retiring in a few months. This is not how I want to be remembered, being arrested,' Cadenhead said.

Cadenhead recalls being on the phone for an entirety of 5 or 6 hours as he gave into their scheme.

As directed by the woman, Cadenhead took out money from his banks and bought several prepaid MoneyPak cards.

He then told her the pin number for the cards and they were able to steal $16,000, reports the Charlotte Observer. 

'They knew just one intimate detail after another,' Cadenhead said on Friday at a news conference. 

They scare you to death.'

'This scam impacts everybody. We've had very, very educated and intelligent people fall for it, ‘Tim Camus said.

Camus also received a phone call from the scammers but he was not fooled though he says it can happen to anyone.
