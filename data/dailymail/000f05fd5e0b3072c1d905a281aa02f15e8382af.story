It took only one ball of the first one-day international against Australia on Friday for England to be handed a rude reminder of the size of the task that awaits them here in the tri-series and the World Cup that follows.

Once Ian Bell, who made 187 just two days ago, was trapped lbw by a rapid Mitchell Starc at the Sydney Cricket Ground, much of the optimism England garnered from two near perfect warm-up performances began to evaporate.

When James Taylor followed two balls later and England then crashed to 33 for four it seemed as though this was simply a continuation of the Ashes tour from hell that reached its nadir on this same famous old ground a year ago.

Thank heavens then for Eoin Morgan who made a welcome return to form and once again appeared galvanised by high office as he single-handedly saved England from one of the total humiliations common place here last winter.

Yet a century from the new England one-day captain that augers well for the battles ahead was never going to be enough to stop Australia showing that they will be very much the team to beat in the World Cup that begins next month.

Once David Warner got in the groove that tormented England all too often during the 5-0 thrashing Australia’s domination was clear against an attack worryingly lacking in variation and incapable of defending a sub-standard 234.

As it was, Australia cruised to a win so comfortable they were able to gain a bonus point and demonstrated that they remain a formidable one-day machine even without injured captain Michael Clarke and the rested Mitchell Johnson.

Back to the drawing board? Not really, because England were always likely to be a one-day work in progress here with only a puncher’s chance of competing for a tri-series that also includes India and the premier 50-overs tournament.

Yet they will want to do much better than this, starting when they meet that other one-day powerhouse in India in Brisbane on Tuesday and then when they face Australia yet again in Hobart next Friday.

It was somehow inevitable that Bell would fail here after showing against a Prime Minister’s XI that he can produce the type of dynamic, substantial innings that has been beyond so many Englishmen in 50-over cricket.

England may have breathed a sigh of relief that they did not have to face Johnson here but instead came another left-arm bowler with the pace, hostility and skill to rip the heart out of their innings before it had barely begun.

Starc appears to have added the priceless ability to swing the ball back into right-handers to his armoury and here he was simply too quick for both Bell and Taylor as England made the worst possible start to their busiest ever year.

There was a suspicion that Bell may have got an inside edge onto his pad but the replays were inconclusive and not even the Decision Review System that will not be used in this tri-series at India’s insistence would have saved him.

By the time Morgan came to the crease England were in disarray – welcome to the captaincy, Eoin – but at least he was able to steady his ship and hit his first century since this time last year in Brisbane.

It was desperately needed. No-one else had an answer to Starc, the equally rapid Pat Cummins, the left-arm variations of James Faulkner and even the mediocre spinner in Xavier Doherty who England were unable to attack.

When Chris Jordan hung around with his captain long enough to add 56 for the eighth wicket England at least looked like they would reach the relative riches of 250 and give themselves something to bowl at.

But Starc returned to dismiss Morgan for 121 and last man Steven Finn in successive balls and England had wasted 13 deliveries after being bowled out within 50 overs for the 10th time in their last 13 one-day internationals.

Where Australia have plenty of bowling options Morgan had no choice other than to rely an attack lacking a left-armer of his own and even their main one-day spinner in James Tredwell, surprisingly left out on a worn SCG pitch.

Warner’s one-day record pales into insignificance compared to his Test and Twenty20 statistics but he loves being a thorn in England’s side and once he had negotiated the two new balls there was absolutely no shifting him.

England left out Jimmy Anderson to give him more time to recover from his knee problem but in his place Finn was again a shadow of the bowler who looked among the best one-day performers in the world in New Zealand in 2013.

Clearly the problems that led to Finn being sent home from the Ashes tour with his action in disarray have not totally been solved yet and Finn did well to escape injury when he clattered into the stumps after losing his footing.

The much improved Chris Woakes was quicker than Finn and provided encouragement with four wickets but the decision to keep Stuart Broad away from the new balls suggests he too has not fully recovered from knee surgery.

The end came with more than 10 overs to spare but only three wickets in hand after Warner, who could have been given out lbw to Moeen Ali on 51, had been dismissed for 127 within sight of the winning post. England will hope Australia prove just as difficult to beat when they face India in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving them to battle it out with MS Dhoni’s side for a place in the final.

Yes, this is a reality check but it was always expecting a lot for England to hit the ground running against Australia in this series. At least Morgan, who must have a good World Cup for England to have any chance, is back in business.
