Sparking a Twitter storm can help TV programmes boost their ratings figures, new research claims.

A spike in comments about a particular show translates into an increase in the number of viewers in almost a third of cases, a new study by media analysts Neilsen has revealed.

Looking at minute-by-minute trends, researchers found the volume of Tweets about a programme caused statistically significant 
changes among 29 percent of the 221 episodes analysed.

Flop: Ben Elton's sitcom The Wright Way was dropped after receiving a Twitter panning

Guilty pleasure: Tom Daley's show Splash! was the subject of Twitter jokes but went on to draw big audiences

Providing an instant, if sometimes vicious, platform for review, the 'Twitter reaction' has increasingly become a measure of a whether a show is deemed a success or not.

Last month, Ben Elton's sitcom for the BBC The Wright Way was dropped after been panned by critics on Twitter.

The show, set in the health and safety department of a local council, was described by one commentator as 'the worst sitcom ever'.

But perversely, a stream of negative comments is not always a bad thing.

Many took to Twitter to poke fun at last year's ITV Saturday night show Splash! which featured celebrities being taught to dive by Olympic star Tom Daley.

Variously described as 'a joke', 'embarrassing' and 'a new low for television' - the Twitter verdict was a resounding dive bomb.

But the influx of comments made sure that #Splash! began trending, and the conclusion appeared to be that it was so bad it was good.

The show was the most-watched on its Saturday debut, drawing more than 6million viewers.

Twitter meltdown: Farcical made-for-TV movie 'Sharknado' drew 5,000 Tweets a minute

Winner: Movie makers SyFy are in talks to make a sequel to Sharknado after its recent success

The phenomenon was recently repeated in the US when the B-movie Sharknado sent Twitter into overdrive.

The farcical horror about opportunistic sharks which are sucked into a tornado and then fall down onto Los Angeles killing everything in their wake garnered an estimated 5,000 Tweets a minute at its peak.

Even celebrities got in on the attack with Mia Farrow Tweeting: 'Omg omg omg #sharknado'

Makers of the film SyFy are already in talks to make a sequel.

Reaction: Sharknado prompted a wave of mentions on Twitter, with celebs including Mia Farrow joining in

Paul Donato, Chief Research Officer at Nielsen, says the research proves that a Twitter reaction and TV ratings are definitively linked. 

'This 
rigorous, research-based approach provides our clients and the media 
industry as a whole with a better understanding of the interplay between
Twitter and broadcast TV viewing,' he added.

Nielsen and Twitter are set to begin publishing a new 'Nielsen Twitter TV Rating' that will measure the volume of Twitter conversation about every programme.

'These results substantiate what many of our TV partners have been telling us anecdotally for years: namely, that Twitter drives tune-in, especially for live, linear television programming,' said Ali Rowghani, Twitter’s chief operating officer
