She was seeking her first LPGA major title and, after a faltness win at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, Lexi Thompson took a victors leap.

'It was everything I imagined,' the 19-year-old said of her cannonball into Poppie’s Pond, a tradition for tournament winners at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California.

The Florida teen played a near-flawless game on Sunday, obliterating what was meant to an epic desert duel between her and the biggest name in women's golf, Michelle Wie, who finished three shots behind in second, according to Golf Week.

'She played probably the best I’ve ever seen her play,' said Wie of her opponent.

'She hit the ball so well. She made everything.'

Thompson, the second youngest player to win a major behind Morgan Pressel, shot a Sunday best 4-under 68 for a 14-under 274 total and a three-stroke victory over Wie, who birdied the last.

The dive in the pond was almost overshadowed by Thompson's caddie, Benji Thompson - no relation - who somersaulted into the water.

He said Lexi took an aggressive game plan and it paid off.

'That’s her strength, so that’s what we try to use,' he said.

'No need to lay back to where everybody else is.'
