Poorer families are more likely to eat chicken nuggets and chips for dinner, while wealthier households consume more salad and rice, new research has revealed.

The latest figures from Roy Morgan  show that socioeconomic status and family income have a significant impact on foods consumed.

At the top end of the scale, children eat more salad and rice, but as income decreases more chips, wedges, chicken nuggets and noodles are consumed.

New research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads

In the wealthiest households, 62 per cent of kids aged 6-13 will eat rice every week, while 55 per cent will also have salad at some stage.

Less than half will eat hot chips, fries, or wedges, while just over a third will consume noodles. Around a quarter of these children will eat chicken nuggets during an average week. 

However at the other end of the spectrum childrens' eating habits change quite dramatically.

With each successive drop in socioeconomic status, children in the household are less likely to eat rice or salad, and more likely to eat noodles or chicken nuggets. 

Kids from wealthier families will see more salad on the table, with 55 per cent consuming the greens in an average week

At the lower end of the scale 60 per cent of children will consume chips, wedges or fries, but only 44 per cent will eat a salad during an average week. 

Noodles are on the menu for 55 per cent of these kids, chicken nuggets are eaten by 40 per cent, and just half of these children will see rice on their table.

'While the food that parents buy and give to their children is heavily influenced by the affordability of groceries, there may be many other issues at play such as the number of children (and parents) in the household, working hours, accessibility of fresh produce in the local area, as well as underlying attitudes and tastes,' Michele Levine, CEO, Roy Morgan Research said. 

The presence of rice at mealtimes has increased, and 62 per cent of kids at the higher end of the spectrum have it each week

'For example, price alone does not fully explain the inverse changes in popularity for rice and noodles among children across socio-economic quintiles.' 

The research also revealed that more parents are trying to make a conscious choice about purchasing additive-free food, which is up to 50 per cent from 45 last year.

However figures in this section also show that as socioeconomic status declines, so does the amount of parents making the decision to buy additive-free foods. 

Noodles and hot chips are eaten more frequently than salads in lower socioeconomic households

Despite this, increasing numbers of parents are paying closer attention to what they put on the table for their children. 

'More than five million Australians are parents with children under 16 in the home. Our research into health attitudes shows that over the last five years an increasing proportion of parents are mindful of their own calorie, fat, dairy, and red meat intake, but are slightly less likely to be trying to limit how much sugar their kids eat,' Michele Levine said.

'Our Single Source survey can connect parents' demographics and household status with their health attitudes, grocery shopping behaviours, exercise habits and food consumption rates to deliver a 360-degree view of the changing lifestyles of Australian families.'

Noodles are on the menu each week more often for children whose parents earn a lower income, over wealthier families
