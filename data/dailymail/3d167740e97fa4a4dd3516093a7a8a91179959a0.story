The district attorney in upscale Nassau County, New York, has unleashed civil strife by posting the names and pictures of 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting over the last six weeks.

'Operation Flush the Johns' on Long Island nabbed young men and old men, lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers, college professors and students.

All of them set up dates to meet with prostitutes at local a hotel using the classified ads site backpage.com.

District Attorney Kathleen Rice said police started a sting operation in April after receiving numerous complaints about prostitution at hotels across the county.

Wall of shame: District Attorney Kathleen Rice said she hopes that this poster of the 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting will put men on notice that they will be humiliated if they try to buy sex in Nassau County

It's unknown how many of the men arrested were married and whether any of their spouses had to wait until the public release of information today to learn of their infidelity.

Nassau divorce lawyer Bryan L. Salamone says he has had four women come 
to him seeking divorces because their husbands were charged with 
soliciting prostitutes.

About 20percent of marriages where a wife finds out her husband has been cheating - with a hooker or otherwise - will end in divorce. Such divorces are usually bitter.

'There’s much more feelings involved. The cases are often high-conflict cases involving a spouse that will now question the husband’s decision-making abilities and wish to limit his access to young children. She may not trust the husband so the spouse will want to freeze assetts and get up-front payment if the husband’s finances may be going to other woman,' Salamone told MailOnline.

The other 80percent of men will eventually be forgiven by their wives - often after marriage counseling and significant amounts of contrition.

'But, basically, four out of five guys get away with it,' Salamone says.

All walks of life: The arrested men ranged in age from 17 to 79. Several races and nationalities and religious backgrounds were also represented in the arrests of the alleged johns

Most of the suspects are professionals. Several lawyers were arrested. The suspects also include two doctors, two dentists, two engineers, two college professors, two college students, a teacher, a stockbroker and a car salesman.

Each man arrived at the hotel after agreeing to meet online with an undercover officer posing as a hooker in the escorts section of backpage.com.

The arrested men range in age from 17 to 79. The average age is 40. Most, 79, came from Nassau County and 25 traveled from out of town.

Most are professionals. Several lawyers were arrested. The suspects also include two doctors, two dentists, two engineers, two college professors, two college students, a teacher, a stockbroker and a car salesman.

Salamone says in his experience, busy professionals who aren't getting enough attention from their wives are more likely to look for extra-marital sex from prostitutes than from a mistress.

'These are people who don’t have the time to go out to court a woman or an affair. They can just hook up very easily and be done,' Salamone says. 'They don’t have to do three dinenr dates and two nights out and explain that to their families.'

But, he cautioned, wives often profit handsomely if that affair results in divorce.

'Equitable distribution of assets does not mean equal distribution. The wife doesn’t split everything 5/50, especially if she can prove special circumstances such as a humiliating arrest around the time of a bar mitzvah or graduation,' he said.

Prosecuted: Rice said each of the men pictured was arrested after agreeing to meet an undercover officer posing online as a prostitute and then handing over cash at a hotel room

Rice said she released the composite 'wall of shame' because she wanted to put the men who buy prostitutes in Nassau county on notice

Each man arrived at the hotel after agreeing to meet online with an undercover officer posing as a hooker in the escorts section of backpage.com.

When the would-be john handed over cash in exchange for sex, officers swooped in and promptly arrested the offender.

Each interaction was recorded by hidden cameras and microphones planted in the hotel room.

Rice said she released the composite 'wall of shame' because she wanted to put the men who buy prostitutes in Nassau county on notice.

'Not only do people have a right to know who their prosecutors and police are arresting and charging with crimes, but we know that the commission of this specific crime is dramatically affected by the perceived risk of getting caught,' she said.

'We are giving fair warning to johns that the risk is growing rapidly.'

But one Nassau County criminal defense lawyer who is representing men arrested in the sting is crying foul.

Elliot S. Schlissel told MailOnline that Rice' decided to publicly shame the men who are still legally innocent.

'These people could lose their jobs or marriages or have other problems and never be convicted of anything,' he said.

Nassau County District Attorney said that by publicly naming and picturing each of the men arrested, she hopes to made potential johns understand the the risk of being caught and publicly shamed is growing rapidly. Here are the 104 suspects, each charged with misdemeanor patronizing a prostitute:
