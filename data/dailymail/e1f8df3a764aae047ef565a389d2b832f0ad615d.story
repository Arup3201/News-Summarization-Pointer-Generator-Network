A teenage cyclist has suffered horrific injuries after being thrown from his bike when he hit a pothole during a charity race.

Ollie Pike, 15, swerved to miss a small crater in the road in Cirencester, Gloucestershire - only to steer into the path of another, which sent him flying over the handlebars.

Ollie was thrown 30ft down the road and suffered a broken collar bone, a possible fractured cheek bone and a number of deep cuts to his face and head.

Ollie was immediately rushed to hospital where he was left unable to move after doctors strapped him to a board amid fears he may have a serious back injury.

After 12 hours of tests, scans and X-rays, Ollie was finally discharged with his arm in a sling and six stitches to his face.

His mother Louise, 44, said: 'It was absolutely terrifying to get a phone call from Ollie’s friends to say he had fallen and paramedics were on the way.'

'Your mind goes into overdrive and you start thinking of every possible scenario... When your child hits their head like that it is pretty scary,' she added.

Mrs Pike said that she wasn't far away at the time of the accident, so was able to rush to the scene - with Ollie's friends keeping her updated during her journey.

Ollie said he couldn't remember much about the accident but recalls being surrounded by people shouting for an ambulance.

'I was going down this hill that I've cycled up hundreds of times before so I know where all the holes are... I moved out the way for a hole and I landed straight in another one,' he said.

'I remember feeling myself hit the hole and then I don't really remember a lot else, like flying through the air, but I must have done,' Ollie added.

Recovery: Ollie Pike doesn't remember much about his accident - although he did not lose consciousness

Ollie is a keen cyclist who rides at least 70 miles a week. He was wearing a helmet when he crashed

Describing the aftermath of the accident, Ollie said: 'I remember only being able to see out of one eye and people coming towards me shouting for an ambulance and I saw my blood running down the hill.'

'It's all a bit hazy really.... I wasn't really in a lot of pain until I got into hospital and the adrenaline had gone,' he added.

Describing her son's initial recollection of the accident, Mrs Pike added: 'He didn’t lose consciousness but I think his brain did shut down for a bit to avoid injury.'

Ollie, from Chedglow in Wiltshire, was taking part in an event sponsored by Cirencester Ride 24/7 Bike Club on March 9 when the accident happened.

The keen cyclist, who rides at least 70 miles a week and was wearing a helmet at the time, was immediately surrounded by friends following his crash, with onlookers providing blankets and pillows.

'Thankfully there was a mountain rescue cyclist behind him, and a fireman a little further back so they immediately knew what to do and attended to him before the paramedics arrived,' Mrs Pike said.

'Luckily Ollie was on a sponsored ride and there were no cars on the road, it doesn’t bear thinking about if there had been,' she added.

Ollie was rushed to Gloucester Royal 
Hospital’s paediatric unit where doctors treated his injuries and 
stitched a deep wound on his right eyebrow.

Hole: Mrs Pike said she is shocked that this small pothole could cause her son such bad injuries. The Pike family are now pursuing compensation from Gloucestershire County Council

The
 teenager, who is in the middle of his mock GCSEs, was off school for a 
week and it is thought his right arm will need to be in a sling for at 
least another four weeks until his collar bone fully heals.

Mrs Pike said that she and her husband had been chatting only days earlier about a local cyclist who died following a crash caused by a pothole.

'Ollie was so mature about the whole thing, he didn’t complain once, and apparently the first thing he asked when someone rushed to him was ‘how’s my bike?,' Mrs Pike said.

Mrs Pike said she is shocked that a pothole could have caused so damage - especially one so small.

The Pike family are now pursuing compensation from Gloucestershire County Council.

A
 spokesperson for the council said: 'We aren’t able to comment on 
individual cases, however we do respond to reported potholes and 
scheduled inspections of our roads.'

Describing her son's recovery, Mrs Pike said: 'He was very brave but it has affected him a lot, he gets very tired now and I think that is all part of the trauma affecting him.'

'I don’t think it will stop him getting back on his bike though,' she added.

Ollie agreed that the accident won't be slowing him down, saying: 'I want to get back on my bike as soon as I can... I really enjoy it, I love everything about it. I've been riding since I was about five, I just love it.'
