Google will turn down requests from MPs, celebrities and public figures to get embarrassing material about themselves removed from search results, it was claimed today.

Europe's top court ruled last month that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which led to the company being bombarded with requests.

Google has already had 50,000 requests to remove data and started to take down search results last week.

But it does not believe the European Court of Justice ruling covers public figures who want to have potentially damaging material removed, reported Jon Ungoed-Thomas of The Sunday Times.

Searches for people’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’.

This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched for, and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted.

Last month’s decision, which affects 500million people, requires search services to remove items deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - and failure to do so can result in fines.

A MailOnline investigation in May uncovered that a misbehaving politician seeking re-election was among a flood of people who contacted Google demanding their internet histories are deleted.

Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined.

In addition, it is believed that an actor has asked for details of an affair with a teenager to be removed. Both requests are expected to be refused, according to The Sunday Times.

Complaints over Google’s interpretation of the court ruling could be taken to the Information Commissioner’s Office, but lawyers believe famous people may not want to fight a high-profile case that will draw more attention to what they are trying to get taken down.

Larry Cohen, a London-cased partner at the legal firm Latham & Watkins, told The Sunday Times: ‘The ruling makes clear that public figures have a lower expectation of privacy.

‘This judgment will help certain people, but not when it concerns public figures or people in whom there is a genuine public interest.’

Legal experts have previously commented that the criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the EU court’s decision.

Google has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and earlier this month sent notifications to people who requested a removal, asking them to bear with the search engine.

It began removing the first results under the European data law last week, and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective.
