Cleared: Tony Discipline leaving Southwark Crown Court today with his real life girlfriend Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Lauren Branning in the soap

An EastEnders star walked out of court a free man today after he was cleared of an assault that left a clubber with a shattered jaw.

Tony Discipline, 23, who plays Tyler Moon in the BBC show, hit 21-year-old Hayden Deol so hard he needed two titanium plates fitted in his mouth after an incident at Merah in London's Belgravia.

Deol said he was punched after he and his cousin Sab Deol, also 21, made a joke about the actor’s clothing, but Discipline claimed he had acted in self-defence.

Discipline struck Hayden Deol at the Merah nightclub in London’s West End in the early hours of May 21, 2011. He was also said to have assaulted Sab Deol.

Prosecutors alleged Discipline had lashed out after Sab Deol poked fun at his t-shirt saying ‘Don’t you wear that t-shirt to work?’

He had been partying with fellow EastEnders cast members Bunmi Mojekwu, who played Mercy Olubunmi, and Shona McGarty, who plays Whitney Dean.

Today at Southwark Crown Court Judge Geoffrey Pegden QC halted the case midway on legal grounds and recorded a verdicts of not guilty against the star.

He said that the version of events 
inside the given by both Hayden and Sab Deol were so ‘markedly 
different’ it would be ‘unsafe’ to continue.

The judge told the jury: ‘I’ve come 
to the conclusion that, bearing in mind the markedly different accounts 
of these two young men inside the club, no jury properly directed in the
legal principles could safely and properly be sure that the assault, if
there indeed was one, was unlawful, in the sense that it was other than
lawful and reasonable self-defence.

'I’m going to ask that you please return unanimous verdicts of not guilty at my direction.’

As the jury returned its verdict 
Discipline smiled and nodded in the dock before embracing his mum and 
dad, after he was allowed out of the dock.

Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones told a jury at Southwark Crown Court today: ‘The prosecution case in a nutshell is that this defendant, Tony Discipline, went out for a night out with friends to a night club.

‘Whether they were celebrating or just out for a good night is unclear but, during the early hours of the morning, words were exchanged with someone in another group, Sab Deol.

‘As a result of what was said the defendant became angry and struck out at Sab Deol and his cousin Hayden Deol, punching them.

‘Although Sab Deol suffered little injury the defendant hit Hayden Deol which such force that he broke his jaw in two places with a single blow.

‘As a result Hayden Deol had to have surgery under general anaesthetic in order to have plates put into his jaw.’

As he walked from the courtroom he said ‘Yes’, but declined to comment further.

Discipline, who joined the soap in June to play Eddie’s youngest son, had not appeared on screen at the time of the attack. His first appearance was on June 27.

The actor of Belvedere, Kent, was found not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and common assault.
