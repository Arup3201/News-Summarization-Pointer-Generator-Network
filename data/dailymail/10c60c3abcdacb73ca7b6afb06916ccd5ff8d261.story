A food blogger has unveiled a new weird and wonderful donut hybrid made using fried ramen noodles.  

Josh Scherer's 'ramnut' follows in the footsteps of pastry chef Dominique Ansel's infamous Cronut - and Keizo Shimamoto's world-renowned Ramen Burger, taking the trend one step further in order to combine sweet and savory in one calorific treat. 

While some might not be too convinced by the bizarre blend flavors and textures, ramnut creator Josh, who runs foodie blog Culinary Bro-Down, insists that the custard- and jelly-stuffed delights 'tastes really good'.

Sweet or savory? According to food blogger Josh Scherer, his ramnuts taste just like rice pudding

That's one way to use your noodle! The ramnuts are made using instant ramen noodles that have been cooked in a special cinnamon-spiced milk and then molded into a traditional donut shape

'It had a flavor profile really similar to rice pudding, and a texture like kugel,' he told ABC News. 'I'd do some things differently to optimize the recipe - make them thinner to create more surface area, fry at a lower temperature to allow for more oil penetration,' Josh toldABC News. 

'If you really think about it, there's no reason this shouldn't taste good, it's just fried dough and sugar.'

Josh's ramnuts are made using instant ramen noodles that have been cooked in a special cinnamon-spiced milk and then molded into a traditional donut shape, before being stuffed and iced with more conventional sugary ingredients. 

The 21-year-old UCLA student admits that the idea might be off-putting to some, but insists that he 'really enjoyed' the end result. He even goes as far as to suggest that his iced delights can compete with pastry chef Dominique Ansel's world-famous Cronut - and kindly offers Mr Ansel the opportunity to work with him on any future Ramnut creations.

'My provisional copyright on the name “ramnut” is officially on sale,' Josh writes on his website. 'Looking for $50 and an Olive Garden gift card. Get at me, Dominique Ansel.'

Despite the early success of his noodle-based creation, the budding chef readily admits that its creation could have been a disaster.

Sweet treat showdown: Josh has offered Cronut creator Dominique Ansel the opportunity to get in on the ramnut action

'I don’t want to consume food culture, I want to produce it,' he explains. 

'By recycling the same Pinterest recipe for red velvet kit-kat cheesecake over and over, you’re complicit within cultural stagnation; you’re taking things from the conversation without adding anything new. I’m just trying to spark up a few lines of dialogue. 

'I want to do things that are unique, things that have never been done before, and whether they taste good or not is tertiary to the real goal of progress. 

'I’m going to shotgun method the foodie frontier until I hit a f*****g bullseye.' 

Try it at home: Josh was more than happy to share his ramnut recipe with the readers of his blog

Unlike Mr Ansel, who, until the recent launch of his new cookbook, kept his croissant donut recipe a closely-guarded secret, Josh has readily shared each and every step of the ramnut-making process on his blog.

Indeed, he encourages any curious food lovers to try out the recipe for themselves so that they can experience the unique taste sensation for themselves, but warns that the process took up '12 hours of my life'.

'They’re starchy, they’re crispy, they’re covered in frosting and stuffed with custard — that’s about all I can tell you,' he writes. 

'I enjoyed them in my mouth, I enjoyed them a lot, but as we just discussed, that information is pretty much useless. I urge you to make them yourself and figure it out.' 

INGREDIENTS 

6 packs instant ramen

3 whole eggs

64 oz prepared horchata (cinnamon-spiced milk)

Nonstick spray

Oil for frying

Various frostings, fillings, and toppings

INSTRUCTIONS 

1) Get that horchata boiling in a large sauce pot. Toss in all your ramen noodles and cook 3-4 minutes or until tender.

2) Strain ramen noodles in colander and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Whisk 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl then add in your cooled ramen noodles and mix thoroughly.

3) Spray down a 7"×11" baking pan with nonstick spray then dump in ramen egg mixture and spread evenly across surface. Add a layer of plastic wrap on top, press the ramen down hard with your hands, then throw it in the freezer for 3-4 hours. You want it to be relatively frozen but still workable.

4) Flip the semi-frozen ramen sheet onto your cutting board, and use something circular and a chef’s knife to shape them into donuts.

5) Heat your oil to 325 degrees and fry the ramen donuts for 4 or 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown on the outside and steamy on the inside.

6) Let the oil drain on a paper towel, then slather the donut in your favorite toppings.
