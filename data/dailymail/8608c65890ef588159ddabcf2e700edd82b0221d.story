The controversial banner which Manchester United supporters plan to fly over Old Trafford on Saturday has been pictured for the first time.

A group of United fans have chartered a private plane with the message: 'Wrong One: Moyes Out' printed in red lettering and aimed at embarrassing manager David Moyes.

They plan to fly the banner over the ground during the Barclays Premier League game with Aston Villa because of the poor results, lack of fight and the fact Moyes is not up to United’s standards.

United won the title last season in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final year in charge, but this season they are 17 points behind league leaders Chelsea and look highly unlikely to finish in the top four.

The group of fans have raised £840 to
 charter the plane and now they have confirmed they have received enough
 donations to pay for the flight.

The
 wording of the banner is a reference to the ‘Chosen One’ banner hanging
 from the balcony of the top tier of the Stretford End.

The group of fans issued a statement via the Red Issue forum outlining their reasons for their banner.

They
 claim their decision is 'borne out of acute frustration - frustration 
at the poor results, lack of fight on the pitch and the unavoidable 
signs the David Moyes isn’t up to the highest standards required to 
manage Manchester United Football Club.

A significant proportion of 
Manchester United fans have had enough and unequivocally want David 
Moyes sacked.’

The message 
is supposed to ‘directly counter’ the ‘Chosen One’ banner in the 
Stretford End which they regard as 'ludicrously premature'.

It
 continues: 'This isn’t a reaction because we aren’t getting our own way
 in terms of winning games. There is neither sufficient time or space to
 list the unwanted records set by the club this season under Moyes’ 
stewardship. We cannot have a manager who thinks it is acceptable to 
call our major rivals ‘favourites’ when they play us at Old Trafford.

'It
 is a betrayal of this club’s ethos, a betrayal of the players and a 
betrayal of the fans' support. We want a manager who understands and 
embraces our attacking traditions and has a vision of confidence for the
 future, not a manager who seems to be completely disassociated and 
visibly uncomfortable with the fact that he is Manchester United 
manager.'

The plane is due to fly over the stadium 10 minutes before kick-off and for the first five minutes of the game.

To whom it may concern,

The decision to fly a plane over Old Trafford bearing the slogan 'Wrong One: Moyes Out' is one borne out of acute frustration - frustration at the poor results, lack of fight on the pitch and the unavoidable signs that David Moyes isn't up to the highest standards required to manage Manchester United Football Club. A significant proportion of Manchester United fans have had enough and unequivocally want David Moyes sacked.

Further frustration has been created from the inaccurate perception that all Manchester United fans are behind David Moyes. A banner erected by Stretford End flags, that dubs David Moyes the 'Chosen One' (ludicrously prematurely into his career at United), suggests that all Manchester United fans are supportive of Moyes which isn't accurate. The plane and banner which will fly over the stadium this Saturday attempts to directly counter this very unpopular banner with the words 'Wrong One' and the 'Moyes Out' wording is our statement of what a significant group of Manchester United fans want to happen next at our club.

This isn't a reaction because we aren't getting our own way in terms of winning games. There is neither sufficient time or space to list the unwanted records set by the club this season under Moyes stewardship. We cannot have a manager who thinks it is acceptable to call our major rivals "favourites" when they play us at Old Trafford. It is a betrayal of the club's ethos, a betrayal of the players and a betrayal of the fan's support. We want a manager who understands and embraces our attacking traditions and has a vision of confidence for the future, not a manager who seems to be completely disassociated and visibly uncomfortable with the fact that he is the manager of Manchester United.

The plane is due to fly over the stadium 10 minutes prior to KO and for the first 5 minutes of the game.

Regards.
