David Cameron today recalled the 
heroism of Scottish and English soldiers who fought ‘under one flag’ as 
he appealed to Brits to ‘face the future together’.

The
Prime Minister used a key speech at the Scottish Conservative annual 
conference in Stirling to highlight centuries of ‘shared endeavour’.

He
singled out the sacrifice made by soldiers from across the UK on the 
beaches of Normandy in the D-Day landings - which took place 69 years 
ago yesterday.

David Cameron today called for Scotlanda to stay in the UK, as he visited Diageo's Cameronbridge Distillery, where he met Tanquerary Master Distiller Tom Nichol

Planning and practice for the landings
took place north of the Border and Scottish servicemen were among the 
first to land on Sword Beach.

Mr
Cameron also used a more modern example of the Union's strength by 
praising the performance of UK athletes at last year’s Olympic Games.

Plea: David Cameron used a speech in Stirling today to invoke the D-Day landings and the Olympics as he appealed for Brits to 'face the future together'

The Tory leader's intervention follows claims from Deputy SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon that Scotland and the rest of the UK could be the ‘closest of allies and the best of neighbours’ if there is a ‘yes’ vote in next year’s referendum.

In a speech at Edinburgh University last night, Miss Sturgeon said the model of the Nordic Council that brings Scandinavian countries together could be adopted post-independence.

Her suggestion is the latest attempt by the SNP to ease fears about separation, with the party previously announcing plans to keep the Queen as head of state and use the British pound. 

But a spokesman for the anti-independence Better Together campaign last night rejected the SNP’s vision and said: ‘The idea that separation actually means co-operation is like arguing that black is white.’

Mr Cameron also warned that ‘breaking-up Britain’ is not the answer to the country’s problems.

Tory activists gathered in Stirling
today, where Scottish leader Ruth Davidson faces pressure to
unite the party behind her.

Some MSPs are known to be concerned about 
her leadership approach, and a large number of members are worried about
her new-found support for further devolution.

But Mr Cameron praised Miss Davidson when he took to the stage.

Rally: The Prime Minister told Scottish Tories the Albert Halls that there was no future challenge which would could be met by breaking-up

Backing: Mr Cameron also gave his support to Ruth Davidson, to under-pressure leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland

Addressing
next year’s referendum, he said ‘Our United Kingdom has always 
been one of shared endeavour. Proud in our individual identities – but 
working together for a common good.

‘We saw it when our soldiers fought together under one flag on the beaches of Normandy.

‘We
saw it when our doctors came together to build our NHS. We saw it in 
the scientific breakthroughs that we made together, from the television 
to penicillin.

‘And we saw it last summer as athletes from around Britain – no matter where they were from – draped themselves in one flag.’

Mr Cameron said there is ‘still so much more to come’. ‘Why wouldn’t we want to face the future together?’ he asked.

‘There
is simply no challenge we face today where breaking-up Britain is the 
right answer. The future I see for Scotland is part of a dynamic, 
enterprising, prosperous, compassionate Britain.

‘A
Britain that isn’t just competing in the global race, but winning in 
the world. A country where we are pulling together, not pulling apart.’

But
Miss Sturgeon last night claimed that independence would create a 
‘healthier relationship’ between Scotland and the rest of the UK.

SNP
leader Mr Salmond added: ‘The people of Scotland want and deserve a 
quality debate on Scotland’s future – and Nicola Sturgeon’s positive 
speech about the relationship of equality we seek with our friends south
of the Border stands in stark contrast to the fears and smears that are
all we have heard from the No campaign so far.

‘It
is time for the No campaign to draw a line in the sand under their 
fears and smears about Scotland, and fulfil their pledge to pursue a 
positive campaign based on reality.’

Mr Cameron also invoked the Olympic success of Scots including Sir Chris Hoy and scientific breakthroughs, including Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, as proof that the United Kingdom has a history of shared endeavour

Mr Salmond also called for a head-to-head debate with the Prime Minister – something the ‘No’ campaign has rejected because Mr Cameron is ineligible to vote in the referendum. Instead, Better Together leader Alistair Darling has offered to debate with the First Minister.

Responding to Miss Sturgeon’s speech, a campaign spokesman said last night: ‘There already exists a strong vehicle for co-operation across our island. It’s called the UK and it works well.’

Scotland Office minister David Mundell added: ‘The Deputy First Minister’s speech ignores the fact that Scotland and the rest of the UK are already the closest of allies and best of neighbours. We are part of the same UK family and leaving it would end a successful 300-year partnership.’

Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond yesterday met outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King in Edinburgh.

The talks came amid an ongoing row over the currency options facing an independent Scotland, with senior Westminster figures warning that Mr Salmond’s bid to share the pound is ‘unlikely’. No details of yesterday’s meeting were released.
