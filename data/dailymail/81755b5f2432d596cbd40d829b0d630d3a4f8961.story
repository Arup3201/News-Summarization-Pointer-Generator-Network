Fears are growing that the UK is headed for an epidemic of monstrous rodents as pictures of giant rats continue to emerge.

One image, reportedly reportedly taken in Cornwall, shows a giant rat being held up by its tail -  and the man holding it is 6ft 1in, giving a sense of its horrifying scale.

It comes as a giant rat was caught in Liverpool, measuring two feet long from its nose to its tail.

Pest control experts today warned that similar rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and discard left-over fast food

Meanwhile a shocking photo of a massive rat in 
Gravesend, Kent, has also emerged.

The picture, showing the seemingly-dead 
vermin on a pink spade, appears to have been taken next to a river.

The pictures were tweeted by BBC Radio 2 during a discussion on the Jeremy Vine show about 'giant mutant rats'.

The menacing super rat in Liverpool was caught on an industrial estate by a pest controller from Whelan Services, one of the country's largest independent pest prevention companies.

 Services has offices in London, Liverpool and Hampshire and all 
locations report a rise in the number of super rats spotted.

Pest control experts today warned that 
similar rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more 
households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and 
discard left-over fast food.

Rob Simpson of pest control registry Basis Prompt said during the Easter break offices need to ensure they are protected from rat infestations which can cause millions of pounds worth of damage in buildings.

Once inside, with nobody about to stop them, they can start gnawing desks, furniture and coffee machines, building nests to set up colonies, he said.

'Rats are intelligent creatures able 
to adapt and replenish their numbers very quickly, and anywhere that 
offers a dry space with little human traffic is ideal,' he said.

'The
 potential for an infestation will increase over the holiday period when
 there are plenty of idle offices, factories and warehouses.

'Owners must do all they can to keep their premises pest-free while staff are away on holiday and the place is closed down.'

'Business premises are at particular risk over the Easter holiday period as most are not being used.

'If
 they manage to get in, the rats can cause a lot of damage to equipment 
and electrics as well as valuable stock and they also carry diseases.

Experts also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison.

Experts say the conventional blood-thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to.

Now
 pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its 
response to the monster-size vermin and asking the EU to approve 
stronger ‘third generation poison’ to kill them.

Merseyside
 pest controller Sean Whelan from Whelan Services told Mail Online: 
‘We’re seeing an upsurge in rat call-outs, it’s gone up significantly by
 about 15 per cent over the past year.

‘It’s
 been very good for us. But I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, it 
could be the weather, it’s been very cold and it’s been very wet.

‘They’re twice as large as they once were. It’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat.

‘The problem is that they’re feeding more than they used to. They’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away.

‘If there is vermin, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s our fault. We’re basically feeding them and they get used to it. So they keep coming around us to get more food,' he added.

Mr Whelan said: ‘The rats that we’re seeing in the city used to be the ones roaming round  the countryside, in agriculture, out on farms, but they’ve migrated to towns – now they live in the city.'

Growing problem: Cities throughout the UK are seeing more super rats as the rodents gorge on food left out in bins

Mr Whelan said the 'monster rats' are in every town throughout the country but there has been an increase in sightings in Liverpool, Birmingham and London.

During the 1960s onwards, rat poison 
was based on the blood-thinning agent warfarin. It worked by draining 
the blood from the rat and killing it.

Today, pest controllers use bromadiolone, but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin.

‘We find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison,' Mr Whelan said. 'We used to use warfarin when I first started out 23 years ago. It was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but doesn't do much now.

'We need new, stronger poisons as they've grown used to what we use.'

The pest controller explained that in an area between Winchester and Salisbury the poisons simply do not work at all, while rats in London have also developed a higher immunity.

Mr Whelan is calling on the government to create a 'rat tsar' to tackle the problem.

He
 also wants the EU to approve the third generation of rat poison to help
 tackle the problem, but plans for stronger poison face stiff opposition
 from campaigners amid fears that it could be harmful to humans.

Wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds.

However, pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops, restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats.

Rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the UK has seen plenty during the wettest year on record. Vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city.

The government’s austerity measures have been blamed for making the problem far worse – after cuts to the budget for pest control.

And rats can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans, including Weil’s disease, which has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure.

Across the country, councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported. Birmingham has the highest number of call-outs with 5,100 in the past year.

And the problem is not just confined to Britain.

Other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in Stockholm and Dublin, where one rat was trapped by 
pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin.

The Dublin-based 'monster vermin' had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home 
in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat.
