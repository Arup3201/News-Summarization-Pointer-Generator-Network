A woman whose husband of 16 years committed a serious sexual offence while he was married to her has spoken of the devastating impact of his crimes.

Maureen Johnson, from Reading, spoke of her husband's arrest, imprisonment and subsequent five-year run from the law on on ITV’s This Morning.

Maureen says that her life was 'ruined' when she discovered, in 2008, that her beloved partner was in fact a sexual predator.

Maureen Johnson was married to Nigel Burnell for 16 years and says she had no idea he was even capable of such a crime

Nigel was confronted in Portugal, where he was on the run, by criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas as part of ITV's documentary series On The Run

As amazing as it might seem, Maureen says she had 'no idea' Nigel even had the capacity to commit such an act.

‘You can spend 16 years of your life with someone and still not know them, it’s very strange,' she admitted.

Maureen told of the devastating aftermath: ‘For a long time it left me unable to trust anybody. I still don’t, I still can’t have a relationship and keep that relationship going. Damaged I think is the word.

‘The fact that the story is out on national television is giving me satisfaction and closure. It’s what I call karma.’

Nigel Burnell, 49, was convicted of a serious sexual offence in 2008 and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.

He was released after serving half his sentence, but breached the terms of his early release after going on the run to Portugal.

Staying off the radar in Portugal, at times living in a tent, Nigel was able to evade capture for four years.

Maureen was unable to get a divorce for the years her husband was missing, leaving her in limbo.

However, before his crimes came to light, the couple had been very happy. Speaking about their early whirlwind 
romance, Maureen says: ‘We met in May and we were engaged by November 
and married the following April.

‘He
was everybody’s friend, everybody loved Nigel. Everybody knew him as 
Taf, he was a very lovable guy. We got on really well and I really did 
love the guy.'

Maureen, who had moved from her home town of Reading to Wales with Nigel, says that Nigel’s actions destroyed her life.

‘I couldn’t afford the mortgage once he had been arrested and put in prison. It was a matter of my family saying "come back to Reading where you‘ll be loved and wanted"'.

The exact nature of Nigel’s crimes cannot be revealed for legal reasons.

After a dramatic confrontation with criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas as part of ITV’s documentary series On The Run, Nigel was eventually arrested by Portuguese police and brought back to the UK.

Criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas says that sex offenders are often masters of disguise: ‘These people are like you and I - they live among us.'

‘Their pretence is what enables them to get close to the people that they eventually offend against.

With Burnell, I spent quite a lot of time tracking him and trying to understand what this guy was about.

He’d created a new life in Portugal. He was convinced that he was not going to get caught and come back to the UK,' Mark explains.

Nigel is now serving an additional 15 months in a UK prison for violating his parole.

On The Run airs on ITV at 9pm this evening
