Manchester City players and staff held their Christmas party on Thursday night, but compared to the Arsenal squad's fancy dress antics at Chinawhite on Wednesday it went down like a lead balloon.

With a match at Craven Cottage on Saturday the squad kept their night out as lowkey as possible, booking the Hula Tiki Lounge in Stevenson Square, Manchester, for a private party on a wet and miserable night,

In fact, onlookers said the players only stayed and hour, drinking only soft drinks, as alcohol and a late night would've interfered with their preparation.

Some of the stars looked rather less than pleased with the party arrangements, arriving in a rush on their mobile phones.

One notable star missing from the line-up in Manchester city centre was Sergio Aguero. The Argentine striker, scorer of 19 goals already this season, is set to miss at least the next four weeks with a calf injury.

Two players who did appear, however, were James Milner and Aleksandar Kolarov who had earlier spent the day wrapping Christmas presents for children at a warehouse.
