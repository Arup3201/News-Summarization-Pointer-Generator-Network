It occurs shortly before Holy Communion in a Roman Catholic Mass when the priest invites the congregation to offer each other a sign of peace.

However, what began as a simple handshake has become in many churches an exuberant exchange of kisses or hugs and now the Vatican wants to stamp out the boisterous practice as it detracts from the solemnity of the service.

Cardinal Antonio Canizares Llovera, the leader of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, has written a letter to bishops around the world expressing the church’s concern.

In a move approved by Pope Francis, Cardinal Llovera has asked bishops to draw up strict new guidelines so that the gesture can be performed with more sobriety and less ‘excess’.

The Vatican said it would ‘offer some practical measures to better express the meaning of the sign of peace and to moderate excesses, which create confusion in the liturgical assembly just prior to Communion’.

The Vatican would also like priests not to leave the altar to greet parishioners and to refrain from offering congratulations or condolences during the sign of the peace at weddings or funerals

It would also like priests not to leave the altar to greet parishioners and to refrain from offering congratulations or condolences during the sign of the peace at weddings or funerals.

Father Jose Maria Gil Tamayo, the most senior Spanish bishop, wrote: ‘If the faithful do not understand and do not show, in their ritual gestures, the true significance of the rite of peace, they are weakened in the Christian concept of peace, and their fruitful participation in the Eucharist is negatively affected.’

The move is also supported by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI previously called for ‘greater restraint in this gesture, which can be exaggerated and cause a certain distraction in the assembly just before the reception of Communion.’
