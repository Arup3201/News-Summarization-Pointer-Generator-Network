A businessman who made about £500million from investing in mobile app Candy Crush has bought shares in Derby County to join the exclusively north-American ownership group.

Mel Morris, a club director between 2006 and 2007, has purchased a significant minority shareholding in Derby and will join the board.

The move strengthens Steve McClaren’s hand in the transfer market with the 58-year-old, who was born in the city, looking to ‘invest in and support the club’s promotion ambitions’.

Morris made his money through digital investments and earned a huge windfall in March when King Digital Entertainment, makers of the massively popular Candy Crush game, floated on the New York Stock Exchange.

His 11.5 per cent share was worth about £500m.

Morris, who left school at 16 to set up a hardwood flooring firm, was propelled to a similar wealth to Harry Potter author JK Rowling and Dragons’ Den investor Peter Jones.

He joins an ownership group which had been solely American and Canadian.

Morris paid tribute to McClaren and said: ‘It is evident to me that Derby County is a very well-run operation and I hope, by coming on board, I can further strengthen the incredibly positive position that the club enjoys both on and off the pitch.’

Derby narrowly missed out on returning to the Premier League after Bobby Zamora smashed a winner in stoppage time to make it 1-0 to 10-man QPR.
