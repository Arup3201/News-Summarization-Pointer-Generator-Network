A mother accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can today appeared in court as her lawyers asked a judge for more time to understand what happened.  

Alicia Marie Englert, 23, made her first appearance in court in Salt Lake City, Utah, where her attorneys said they need time to investigate the 23-year-old's mental condition.

Her family has said she has a learning disability and didn't understand what she did.

Englert, whose baby daughter miraculously survived the ordeal after she was found and flown to hospital in critical condition, will next appear in court again next month.

She is being held on $500,000 bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of attempted murder. 

In court: Alicia Englert, who is accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can, makes her initial appearance in court on Wednesday, where her lawyers asked for more time to investigate her condition

Prosecutors previously explained that she gave birth in a bathroom inside her family's home around midnight on August 24, before wrapping the baby in a towel and left it on the floor of the bathroom.

The next morning, she left for work, leaving the baby alone without feeding her or seeking medical care for her, prosecutors said. When she returned home, she again left her on the bathroom floor.

The following day, Englert allegedly put the baby in her neighbor's trash can just before 6am, hiding her beneath bags. Prosecutors say her lack of care shows she deliberately tried to kill the child.

A neighbor heard sounds of what she thought was a purring cat in her trash can and when she moved some of the bags, she spotted the baby.

When the baby was found, she was suffering from hypothermia and respiratory distress. She has since improved and is now in fair condition, Unified Police said.

'It's certainly a testament to how resilient these babies can be,' Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said. 'It's quite remarkable that the baby is doing well and is improving steadily.'

Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said.

Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. 

But her father, Robert Englert, said his daughter has only just recently started to realize what she had done. 

'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune last week. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'

He told the newspaper he didn't know who the baby's father was.

The woman's mother, Tammy Englert, told The Deseret News last week that her daughter didn't understand what had happened.

'We tried to explain it to her, and she didn't realize it was that bad what she had done,'she said.

She said her daughter had gained weight recently, but she had no idea Alicia Englert was pregnant.

'I'm not going to tell my daughter, "You're fat, and lose some weight,"' she told the newspaper. 'How do you do that?'

Gill said they had no evidence of any disability and that it was not a factor in his decision about charges. If Englert suffers from any condition, that issue will be dealt with as the case moves through the courts, he said.
