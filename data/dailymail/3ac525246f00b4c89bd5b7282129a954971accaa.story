A picture of U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden and his American girlfriend at a Moscow theatre has emerged - and the possibility of the pair marrying in Russia has been raised.

The former National Security Agency contractor is 'happy' that Lindsay Mills is with him in Moscow.

The pole dancer was recently shown with America's most wanted man cooking in his flat in a fly on the wall documentary.

'Edward Snowden is happy that his girlfriend Lindsay Mills came to Russia and that she is supporting him,' said lawyer Anatoly Kucherena.

'It's hard to predict if they are going to have a wedding in Russia.'

He spoke as the new picture was issued by state-owned news agency RIA Novosti of the couple on a night out at the theatre.

As usual no details were given about the location for security reasons, and Snowden had a hand partially covering his face.

Kucherena said he is ready to help U.S. citizen Mills get a Russian residency permit or temporary asylum.

Earlier reports indicated Miss Mills had deserted him after he betrayed the U.S. government and divulged secrets about America's mass surveillance programmes.

'She was not entirely pleased but at the same time it was... it was an incredible reunion because she understood me. That meant a lot to me,' he said at the weekend. '

Snowden also admitted in the webcam interview at the New Yorker Festival that he misses America - a place he may never return to, Politico reported.

'The question is what don't I miss, whether it's my family, whether it's my home, whether it's my friends, whether it's my work at the agency, I was fulfilled and happy,' he responded.

'Things as simple as having my old beat-up car, there's a lot to miss. It's a great country.'

Mills had remained silent and her whereabouts were largely unknown after Snowden's release of tens of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents in 2013.

Citizen Four, made by U.S. film maker Laura Poitras, premiered on Friday in New York, revealing Mills's location in the process.

It shows the couple cooking in their wood-paneled Moscow apartment, which is decorated with plants.

The dramatic shift from his seemingly idyllic life in Hawaii was far greater than Snowden had predicted, he said last night.

'It was about getting the information back to people so they could decide if they cared about it, and on that account … I could not have been more wrong in thinking that people wouldn't care,' he explained.

'NSA employees have used this surveillance power to spy on exes, to spy on lovers, and that’s a felony, however none of them were prosecuted because it was considered that the value of the programs was greater than the interests of justice.'
