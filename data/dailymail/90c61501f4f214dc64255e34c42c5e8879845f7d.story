Given the storm unleashed by her 'racist' tapes of NBA boss Donald Sterling, you couldn't blame Vanessa Stiviano for wanting to keep a low profile.

But someone should probably tell her that wearing a huge black visor to dinner and then playing with her pet turtle for the cameras isn't the best way.

The 31-year-old model, who taped the LA Clippers owner berating her for hanging around with black players, took her inimitable fashion sense to new heights at a dinner last night in West Hollywood.

Stiviano, who was brought up in San Antonio, Texas, wears the full-face reflective shield seemingly as a combined fashion accessory and a guard against paparazzi flashes.

Since the Sterling scandal broke she has taken it out rollerblading, to a car wash and into a nail salon.

She even left it on while giving a homeless man $40.

But although the model and self-styled philanthropist lives in a $1.8million condo near Beverly Hills, her fashion sense is available to all - as the garish shields cost just $12.50 on eBay.

Fashion sense: Stiviano was dressed all in black

She arrived with her entourage at Japanese restaurant KOI dressed all in black and with a Chanel tote bag.

Stiviano refers to herself only as V. Stiviano and says she was not Sterling's lover but his 'archivist'.

She made headlines worldwide after a tape allegedly of the LA Clippers owner was leaked to the media.

In the tape he is apparently heard attacking her for publicly befriending black NBA players like Magic Johnson.

'It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?' Sterling allegedly says.

'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people.

'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.'

Billionaire Sterling, 80, is battling prostate cancer and has already outlived the life expectancy given to him by doctors, ESPN and the New York Post reported today.

He is fighting the forced sale of his team after being banned from the NBA for life.

Yesterday a panel of 10 fellow NBA team owners or representatives unanimously agreed to proceed 'as expeditiously as possible,' the NBA said.

The decision was reached during a conference call of the association's advisory-finance committee.

On Tuesday Sterling was banned from the NBA for life and fined $2.5million - the league maximum.

Roll with it: Whatever people have said about the 31-year-old's fashion sense, it has certainly drawn attention
