In a major ruling on personal privacy that could see Australia’s privacy laws get an overhaul a Western Australian woman has won almost $50,000 in compensation from an ex-boyfriend who posted sexually explicit videos and photos of her on Facebook. 

Caroline Wilson took her ex-boyfriend and former co-worker Neil Ferguson to court over the 16 photos and two videos posted briefly on his Facebook page.

Ms Wilson is a fly-in, fly-out worker at Fortescue Metals Group's Cloudbreak mine in the Pilbara. Mr Ferguson allegedly posted the content in retaliation after Ms Wilson broke up with him via a text message.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that in the expletive-laden text messages to Ms Wilson, Mr Ferguson said the photos were 'out for everyone to see ... Can't wait to watch you fold as a human being'.

'By posting the photographs and videos on his Facebook page, the defendant made them available to his approximately 300 'Facebook friends', many of whom worked at Cloudbreak,' West Australian Supreme Court Justice Robert Mitchell said.

Ms Wilson was alerted to the posts by friends at about 5.20pm on August 5, 2013. They were deleted at about 7pm after she begged Mr Ferguson to remove them.

Barrie Goldsmith, Ms Wilson's lawyer, argued she was entitled to an injunction to restrain Mr Ferguson from re-posting the material, as well as compensation for distress and loss of wages.

9 News reported that West Australian Supreme Court Justice Robert Mitchell referred to a 2008 Victorian Court of Appeal decision in which a woman was compensated for emotional distress after her ex-partner distributed copies of sexually explicit video tapes of them both in 1996.

Justice Mitchell said that due to technological advancements, it had only become easier and faster to spread similar content.

He ruled Ms Wilson was entitled to an injunction and $48,404 in compensation, including $35,000 for emotional distress and $13,404 for loss of wages while on leave. 

Mr Ferguson was sacked by the mining company over the incident.

The Australian Law Reform Commission released a report in June setting out elements of a potential civil action for serious invasions of privacy which would allow compensation for emotional distress, but the Abbott government does not support the new law.

The latest ruling may mean Australia's personal privacy laws could face a huge shake-up in the future

However, media law expert at the University of Sydney Law School, Associate professor David Rolph, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the case 'indicates that breach of confidence might provide a remedy for addressing a lot of personal privacy concerns'.

'My own view is that if privacy is a value that's worth protecting it's worth protecting directly and we should think about that in a broader, more comprehensive way,' he said.
