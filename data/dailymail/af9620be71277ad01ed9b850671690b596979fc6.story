Peter Moores faces an uncertain future following England's humiliating exit from the 2015 Cricket World Cup as the coach remarkably said he would have to 'look at the data' to work out why.

England were beaten by 15 runs against Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval to make it four defeats against Test-playing nations with their win over Scotland scant consolation.

Moores, speaking after the loss on Monday, said: 'We thought 275 was chaseable. We'll have to look at the data.

'You just feel hollow if I'm being honest. Very, very disappointed. We haven't played well enough, we've got to accept that.

'You just feel like you've let people down, that would be the main emotion.

'I want to carry on desperately. It's certainly not my decision. I hope [to stay]. I'm here to try and make a difference. Certainly on a day like today you look at it and you know we have a lot of work to do in one-day cricket - there's no doubt about that.

'We haven't played well enough in this tournament all the way through. That's something we have to look at.

'It's a game we felt we should have won. We should have chased 275 and we didn't do it - we have to take that on the chin.' 

England must now play out a dead rubber against Afghanistan on Friday in a tournament that was summed up against Bangladesh by Eoin Morgan's fifth ODI duck in 12 innings.

Morgan replaced Alastair Cook as captain shortly before England left for their warm-ups in Australia, with the relatively untested Gary Ballance also drafted in at number three.

Moores continued: 'We haven't got a settled team. We've lost two key players at the top of our order (Cook and) Jonathan Trott was the number three, we've lost some players and we accept that, we don't make an excuse of it. We tried to find what we think are the best players to get into that team. 

'Gary is a very good one-day player, we felt that was the right decision. He didn't play well enough, Alex (Hales) got his go today.

'There was no obvious team to pick because they're young players, they haven't played a lot of cricket. We've got nine guys who haven't been to a World Cup before. 

'That's the reality of it. You make your choice, you pick the side you think is the best team, which we did, and we have to accept they didn't play well enough.' 

Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen were among those criticising England on Twitter after their early elimination in the group stages.

'England had the wrong team, the wrong style of play and everyone could see it. Tonight's result is not a shock, I feel for Morgan. Coach is in trouble,' Warne tweeted.

Pietersen added: 'I cannot believe this. I just cannot. But, well done Bangladesh! You deserved it!

'Do not say we haven't prioritised ODI cricket! We played a back-to-back Ashes to make sure England played six months of ODIs before this World Cup!' 

Gary Lineker, the former England striker, said: 'Bangladesh win! Congratulations to them. The good news is, England can't possibly get any worse.' 

And Piers Morgan wrote: 'What an absolute disgrace. [Paul] Downton and Moores have dragged English cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty, clueless incompetence.

'I want  Downton and Moores sacked today and Kevin Pietersen restored to the team. This farce just reached its true, hideous nadir.

'I wouldn't trust Downton and Moores to run a ****ing bath, let alone the England cricket team.'

England captain Morgan, however, defended their selection and tactics. 'We've picked guys who can play a brand of cricket that if we performed we could win this World Cup but ultimately we haven't performed,' he told Sky Sports.

'It's pretty poor, obviously to be knocked out of a World Cup this early is unbelievably disappointing. I'm gutted at the moment. We've struggled and fought away since we arrived here.

'One of our big things was to fight quite hard and to try and get through to the quarter-finals and then from there fight our way through the last three games but obviously that's not meant to be.' 

Morgan added: 'It ultimately comes down to performance and today was an example of where some of our guys performed but we didn't perform as a unit and we've done it for quite a while now.

'Since we've landed in Australia we've tried to address that problem but it hasn't worked. 

'Our expectations are a lot higher than the way we've performed so that's extremely disappointing. 

'There'll be an inquest over the next few weeks as to what happened and what went wrong and then we'll go from there.'
