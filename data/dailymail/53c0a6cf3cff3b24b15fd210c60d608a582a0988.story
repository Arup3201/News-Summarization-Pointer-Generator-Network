Author and advertising expert Jane Caro said she 'was making a historical analogy' when she compared housewives to prostitutes on Q&A last night.

The discussion on the ABC television program, which featured an all female panel, veered into a debate about sex work last night.

Off the back of recent stories about how journalist Amanda Goff became a sex worker, the panel was asked: 'What do you think of prostitution as a conscious career choice in a first world country?'

In remarks that have caused some controversy, Ms Caro replied: 'Well, I'm going to say something really dangerous now.'

She has since adamantly stood by her comments while trying to clarify that she was not saying people's 'grandmothers' are prostitutes

'I wasn't calling them prostitutes; I was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction,' she said

'When you have a society where women's main currency is really their sexual favours, their ability to reproduce, then a lot of what women do is a form of prostitution.'

'For example, I would argue that traditional marriage, which included conjugal rights, particularly when women were not able to go to work or fired when they first got married, were basically selling their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband.

'He bought them, by giving her room and board in return, was a form of prostitution.

'So I think we really have to discuss what we mean by prostitution.

'At least the women who choose it as a career choice, freely and uncoerced, that's very very important, only have to put up with him for about an hour.'

'Once upon a time it was a lifetime ladies, a lifetime.'

Fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman rejected Ms Caro's remarks as an 'an abstract comparison' as some sex workers have up to 15 buyers a day.

Ms Caro, who copped flak on social media for the remarks, told Daily Mail Australia she was referring to a time when women were fired from their jobs when they got married and unwanted sexual congress was not considered rape if they were married.

She said she was not talking about current housewives.

Ms Caro engaged in a back-and-forth over the matter with fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman

One of several tweets aimed at Jane Caro last night.

Another tweet aimed at Ms Caro. 'SAHM' is an acronym for 'Stay At Home Mum'.

'She was obliged to say yes (to sex). In return, she got room and board... It was a historical analogy.'

'I'm a bit annoyed I'm getting tweets saying you think stay at home housewives are common whores. No. I never said such a thing.'

'I'm not saying women chose to be this way. Everyone's misconstruing it saying "you're calling grandmother a prostitute."'

'Women were placed in a situation where they really didn't have a choice.'

As part of a panel which included Mexican journalist Lydia Cacho, editor Kay Hymowitz and authors Kajsa Ekis Ekman and Alissa Nutting, Ms Caro also implored young women to always say what they think.

'My advice is to be yourself. Do not allow anyone to mould your shape that doesn't feel anyone like you.'

'Be yourself, and always say what you think.'

Ms Caro said she would give precisely the same advice to young men.
