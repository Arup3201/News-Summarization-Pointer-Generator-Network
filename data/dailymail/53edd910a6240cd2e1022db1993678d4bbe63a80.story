Charged: Actor Jody Latham, seen here in The Fixer, will appear at court next week charged with producing cannabis

Former EastEnders and Shameless actor Jody Latham is to appear at court after allegedly running a cannabis farm.

The 30-year-old actor, who played Rob Grayson in the BBC soap, was arrested along with his girlfriend Sarah Melia, 31, after police swooped on his home in Bacup, Lancashire, in May last year.

They found 25 marijuana plants worth £15,000.

The couple will appear at Burnley Magistrates' Court next week charged with producing cannabis.

Mr Latham is best known for his role as Phillip 'Lip' Gallagher in Shameless.

He revealed he was facing bankruptcy earlier this year.

The actor's career took off at the age of 12 when his talent was spotted during performances at Burley Youth Theatre.

He
played the intelligent and outspoken eldest son of Frank Gallagher in 
Channel 4's acclaimed drama Shameless between 2004 and 2008.

He appeared as pimp Grayson in EastEnders between February and March last year.

But he has also starred in ITV’s The Fixer and had a stint as a trainee chef in Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen.
