A woman has been cured of anorexia thanks to pioneering surgery that 'rewired' her brain.

Kim Rollins, 36, was on the brink of death after suffering a heart attack, two strokes and broken bones since the onset of the eating disorder when she was 15.

By her early twenties she weighed less than a seven-year-old child and could barely face eating half an apple a day.

After all conventional treatment 
programmes failed, Ms Rollins, from Ontario, Canada, was approached by experts researching 
whether a technique called deep brain stimulation could be used to help patients such as her.

The principle behind the surgery is to block  the abnormal nerve signals which trigger anorexic thoughts.

Patients having DBS are fitted with a neurostimulator - a device similar to a heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes placed in certain parts of the brain.

The electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the person’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain.

When switched on, the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms.

The technique has also been successfully used to treat people with Parkinson's disease and chronic pain.

Patients having the deep brain 
stimulation surgery, as it is known, are fitted with a neurostimulator, a
device similar to a heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes 
placed in certain parts of the brain.

The electrical implant is connected 
to a small battery under the skin in the person’s chest or abdomen to 
generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain.

When the device is switched on, the abnormal nerve signals which trigger the symptoms of anorexia are blocked, reinforcing positive responses to food.

Ms
Rollins said: ‘My health had been deteriorating for years because of 
malnutrition and it got to the point where I was either going to die, or
give the surgery a shot. My family was terrified.

‘I was extremely scared going down to surgery, but I was more scared of dying from anorexia at that point.

‘In
the operating theatre, the surgeon put a divider on my forehead. I could
sense the neurosurgeons behind the plastic sheet working away 
positioning electrodes on my brain while a psychiatrist calmly chatted 
to me.

‘The
psychiatrist asked me a series of questions, some of them about food. 
When I responded in a positive way to a description of food, it 
indicated the electrodes were in the right place.

‘It
was weird having someone poke around in my head while I was awake, but I
knew I was in the hands of some of the world's best brain surgeons and 
so that took my mind off things.’

Once
the electrodes were correctly placed, Ms Rollins was sedated and 
underwent a shorter operation which installed the pacemaker-like power 
source into her chest.

Two weeks later, the doctors who supervised her surgery at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre in Toronto, Canada, turned on the current which stimulated the electrodes in her brain, rewiring her thoughts towards food.

She said: ‘When the pacemaker was 
switched on, it was surreal how my thoughts towards food just changed, 
as if someone had flicked a switch.

‘Suddenly the thought of eating a meal didn't fill me with anxiety or guilt.’

Ms Rollins experienced her first serious bout of anorexia at the age of 15.

The electrodes stimulate the part of the brain responsible for depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts

As
an adult she dropped to just five stone at her lowest points. Even 
extended treatment at a 'boot camp' clinic in the Arizona desert when 
she was 24 failed to change her attitude to food.

Earlier this year, with her weight 
stabilised at a healthy eight stone, a moment of triumph came when she 
ate a piece of birthday cake at her nephew's birthday party.

She
said: ‘For 20 years I'd sat at parties and watched everyone else eat 
cake, while I always passed on the offer. Everyone would look at me in a
sad way when I kindly said no.

‘It
may seem silly, but saying yes and being able to eat a piece of cake 
with the rest of my family was such an amazing feeling.’

She added: ‘Before, the thought alone of eating a chocolate and crisps made me ill. Now, I can eat these things without feeling guilty and I enjoy eating snacks.

When Ms Rollins was 24 she attended a boot camp anorexia treatment programme in Arizona

‘That's not to say I am turning into a chocoholic, and I'm careful about not overindulging, but having the freedom to have a chocolate treat or a bag of crisps is marvellous.'

As part of Ms Rollin’s on going recovery from the surgery, which was carried out in January 2012, she sees a therapist and dietician who monitor her success and guide her in getting her life back.

She said: ‘Being warped with anorexic thoughts made me lose touch of what to eat and what was good for me - it's almost like I had to learn how to eat again.’

Now Ms Rollins plans to make up for lost years and will soon begin studying for a Master’s degree in political science.

She said: ‘I missed out on what should have been the best years of my youth but I am now getting my life back together. I can hang out with friends and eat meals together with them.

‘When I suffered from anorexia, I hated my body image, so it put me off having any relationships with men, but this is something I feel more confident about now.

‘I have no immediate plans or desires, but the idea of having a partner and possibly family isn't off the cards, so who knows what will happen in the future?’

In a recent trial six women aged between 24 and 57, who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years, were given the treatment.

Researchers based at the Krembil 
Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada used 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify a specific area of the 
brain previously targeted in patients with depression.

The target area was given stimulation and three months later, five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight.

After
nine months, three patients were maintaining a higher weight than 
before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight 
gain any had achieved since their illness began.

Ms Rollins underwent pioneering surgery to attach electrodes to her brain

Around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

Researcher Dr Andres Lozano, a leading neurosurgeon in the field, said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness.

‘The finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking, in view of the well-known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies,’ he said.

There are around 90,000 Britons with eating disorders including anorexia, which often start in the early teens.

A record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011.
