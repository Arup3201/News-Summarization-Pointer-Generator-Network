Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have dropped in on the British Olympic team's official residence to wish them good luck and to admire the bronze medal won by swimmer Rebecca Adlington.

Yesterday's royal visit caught dozens of athletes by surprise.

Adlington, who has a passion for fashion, told the duchess she loved her navy wedges - and couldn't help gushing about them afterward.

'I just love her shoes. They're much nicer than the sports gear we're wearing this week,' said Adlington, who took bronze in the 400m freestyle.

Kate's cork-heeled £245 wedges were from high street brand Russell & Bromley, and earlier in the day the Duchess was spotted using the matching £245 clutch bag at cousin Zara's equestrian event.

Her patriotic neck scarf was a bit more of a bargain, just £10 from Next.

The red, white and blue accessory is an official Team GB scarf and all profits made are chanelled back into the team.

As an ambassador for Team GB Kate has
worn the scarf several times already in the run up to the games, and 
the Union Jack colour scheme complemented her nautical themed outfit 
perfectly.

William and Harry, both wearing white Olympics shirts, toured the quarters for the women's handball players.

Harry joked that his brother didn't know the rules, but William said he'd been reading up on the sport.

The royals were at the Games yesterday with the Princess Royal and the Duchess of Cornwall to see Zara Philips and her teammates in the equestrian eventing final.

The Queen’s granddaughter and her teammates narrowly lost out on the first British gold of the London Olympics and had to settle for silver.

Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, also talked to Rebecca Adlington and the other athletes
