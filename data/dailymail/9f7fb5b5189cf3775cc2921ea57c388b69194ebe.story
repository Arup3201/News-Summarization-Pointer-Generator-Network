Like many girls her age, Ellie, 12, from Lincolnshire, loves to attend a weekly drama group where she learns to dance and perform.

The classes give the young girl a rare opportunity to act her age - as the rest of the time she has to take on responsibilities beyond her years by helping look after her ailing mother, Suzanne.

Ellie explains: 'She can't walk without help, her hands 
don't work, her head is on a tilt. As she has became worse she has 
literally become a prisoner in her own bedroom. She hasn't seen the rest 
of the house in over three months because it's so hard for her to get 
down stairs.'

Emotional support: Ellie does everything she can for her beloved mother, Suzanne, who has the terminal condition Multiple Systems Atrophy

Suzanne suffers from the rare and terminal condition 
Multiple Systems Atrophy, a progressive neurological disorder.

She has deteriorated over the last five years and is increasingly unable to do basic things
 for herself such as washing and dressing.

Her daughter remembers her as an active mother who used to love gardening and going to craft fairs. But since she has become unwell, their lives have been vastly different.

Ellie said: 'I try and give her emotional support and make her feel nice about herself. Other girls my age do stuff with their mums like shopping and swimming but most of my time I spend going straight from my bed to her bed and spending most of my day there. It has become normal now.'

She added: 'She used to run around everywhere after me and my brother, Ben. Now she can't even leave her room.'

Obstacle: The stairs in Ellie's family home have made her mother a prisoner as it's too difficult for her to get up and down them

Ellie shares her story in a Channel 5 documentary which profiles three of the 250,000 children in the UK who care for a parent with a chronic illness or disability.

Through the use of video diaries shot by
 the children themselves, the programme gives a raw 
insight into the everyday lives of these extraordinary families.

The cameras follow Ellie as she auditions for a part in a musical to be staged by her drama club.

She said the classes give her a chance to escape - although she can never really forget about her home life.

'I feel guilty being away from mum,' Ellie admits. 'I like to be there to cheer her up but she enjoys hearing what I have been up to.'

Ellie reveals her father, William, also struggles with the turn their lives have taken.

'My dad never talks about how he feels he 
just bottles it up,' she said. 'Dad is under a lot of pressure, he hasn't got anyone
 to help in around the house and he has to deal with a lot of stuff with 
mum. I worry about him. They have been married for 20 years, I don't know 
if he'll survive and be ok in the end.'

The family have been trying to move to a bungalow so it will be easier for Suzanne to get around.

But they have to face the unbearable fact that she may not have long to live.

'She's not going to get better she's only going to get worse,' Ellie says through tears. 'There's no other way to put it, you can't sugar coat it.'

Childhood with responsibilities: Madison cares for her mother Jade alongside trying to be an archery champion

She added: 'I don't know how long 
she's got, it could be two months, it could be two years. I do 
everything I can to try and make her happy but it's just a horrid 
situation. It has taken all her dignity away, everybody has to do 
everything for her, she can't do much for herself.'

The programme also shares the story of Madison, a 13-year-old from Manchester who is a 
talented archer with ambitions to represent her country. She juggles her
 training with caring for her single mother, Jade, whose fibromyalgia means she is 
often exhausted and in pain.

Meanwhile, Jacob, is an 11-year-old boy
 from Kent who has been looking after his mother, Julia, who has chronic arthritis and was left 
virtually paralysed down one side after having an abscess removed from 
her brain.

Heartbreaking stories: Jacob, 11, also features in the documentary as he helps care for his mother, Julia, who has chronic arthritis

They reveal how much it hurts seeing their loved one in pain and feeling powerless to help.

'What did she do to deserve this? It's not like she's a criminal,' Ellie says of the unfairness of her mother's condition.

Like Madison and Jacob, her mother's ill health has led to her having to grow up fast and she already has a wise head on her young shoulders.

'Lots of people take their parents for granted but you have to think deeper than that,' she explains. 'Always be thankful for what you have got, never take anything for granted because one day it might be all gone.'
