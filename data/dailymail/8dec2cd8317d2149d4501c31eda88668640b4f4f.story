Hillary Clinton has earned $12 million since departing the State Department last year, according to an analysis of her finances released today.

Bloomberg estimates that Clinton has made $6 million from speaking fees and received at least a $6 million advance for her book Hard Choices, putting the former Secretary of State in the top one-hundredth of the 1 percent of earners in America.

Clinton's advance is not public and her spokesman did not respond to the news agency's response for a comment, but Bloomberg believes her advance to be close to that amount based on 'industry standards and public records.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the Starkey Hearing Foundation's 'So the World May Hear' Awards Gala on Sunday, in St. Paul, Minnesota. Clinton gave this speech on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, of which Starkey is a member

News outlets have previously placed the advance for Clinton's memoir as high as $15 million - the amount her husband Bill was paid for his 2004 autobiography My Life - and not lower than the $8 million she received for her 2003 memoir, Living History.

Bloomberg's review of the presumed presidential candidate's known speaking gigs and usual fee led the organization to determine that Clinton has received approximately $6 million for 27 appearances.

That amount includes money Clinton has been paid by eight universities but now claims went to the Clinton Foundation.

'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it 
to continue its life-changing and life-saving work,' Clinton told ABC News after coming under scrutiny last month by students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for charging the school $225,000 to have her speak.

'So it goes from a 
foundation at a university to another foundation,' she claimed.

Clinton has not offered evidence to support her claims but a copy of her $275,000 contract with the University of Buffalo for an October 23, 2013, speech that was obtained by the Washington Post last week specifically called for the 'net honorarium' to be directed to the Clinton Foundation.

Bill Clinton's has received approximately $106 million to give remarks in his post-presidency.

Together, the power couple has earned more than $160 million in the decade after Bill's second presidential term came to an end.

Hillary and Bill's finances have been the subject of speculation since Hillary claimed in June that the two were 'dead broke' when they left the White House because of legal fees, mortgages and their daughter Chelsea's schooling.

The Clintons have spent the summer trying to explain the comment away but have had little success.
