David Cameron has launched a strong defence of so-called Mickey Mouse degrees.

The Prime Minister attacked the ‘snobbery’ of those who denigrate qualifications such as golf course management and music studies.

He said that, in fact, these courses could lead to decent jobs - and were therefore just as valuable as many of the more academic subjects offered by colleges.

Aiming for the future: Prime Minister David Cameron with apprentices Natalie Murray and Luke Pearce at the Mini Plant Oxford where he told an audience that the nation needed more young people with vocational qualifications

Mr Cameron, who never used the term Mickey Mouse degrees, made his comments at an event celebrating apprenticeships in Oxfordshire.

He said that, too often in the past, Britain has pushed students into university when what the country needed was more people with vocational qualifications.

The Prime Minister praised Germany, which does much more to ensure that people get the type of education suitable for them.

Speaking at a Mini plant, he said: ‘For many years there’s been a snobbery in this country about some degrees.

Investment: Cameron argued that the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them

‘They were called music studies or golf course management and people thought there must be something wrong with these degrees.

‘Frankly we’re now going to find out which degrees really benefit people. It will get rid of that snobbery.’

Mr Cameron said the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them.

This means students weigh up which courses will benefit them in the long run - meaning that only the best will survive.

Courses such as golf course management could turn out to be the ones most likely to land people a good career, he said.

‘Because there are some students who make a bigger contribution on fees, I think quite rightly students are more fussy what it is they’re putting themselves in for,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘They’re saying before I sign up for this degree I want to know how many lectures I’m going to get, what quality teaching I’m going to receive, and whether this degree will help me get a good job.

‘That’s a very good thing. “Where does this leave me in terms of a qualification that will help me to get work?”.’
