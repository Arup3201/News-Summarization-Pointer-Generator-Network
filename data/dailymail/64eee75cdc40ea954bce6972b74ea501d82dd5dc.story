In court: Amanda Hutton denies the manslaughter of her four-year-old son Hamzah Khan

The mummified body of a four-year-old boy was found in his mother’s bedroom after a police community support officer (PCSO) noticed the 'vile smell of filth' coming from the house, a court has been told.

Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in his mother Amanda Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011. The little boy died on 14 December 2009.

PCSO Jodie Dunsmore told a jury today she knew 'something was definitely not right' at Hutton’s house when he visited in September 2011.

Mrs Dunsmore, now a police officer, said she was only on her second day as a full PCSO when she began investigating a neighbour’s complaint about the house.

The officer told the jury at Bradford Crown Court how she continually returned to the house over a number of days but got no reply.

Pc Dunsmore said she became even more suspicious when she noticed large quantities of flies on the window ledge and a terrible smell coming through the letter box.

She said that after at least five visits, she and a colleague threatened to kick in the door, despite having no such legal power to as PCSOs.

The officer said that at that point Hutton opened the door and looked 'deadful'.

She said: 'Her hair was all matted and she was looking very unkempt. She had a woollen jumper on and it appeared flies were coming off her jumper.'

'She looked like she was going to throw up. She had a look of fear on her face.”

The officer said Hutton would not let her in.

She continued: 'There was a vile smell of filth radiating from the door. I’d not even got to the end of the path before I’d rung social services. Something was definitely not right.'

The jury was then told how Hamzah Khan was found in a cot in Amanda Hutton’s bedroom later that day when police officers arrived. He had been dead for almost two years.

Prosecutors told the court that Hamzah died because he was starved to death

The court has heard Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011

Hutton, who told police he died of natural causes, denies manslaughter.

A retired police domestic violence 
officer who had frequent contact with Hutton because she claims she was 
abused by her long-term partner - Hamzah’s father, Aftab Khan - also 
spoke in court today.

Virginia Whittaker said
Hutton received the highest level response from the 
multi-agency domestic violence team, including attempts to rehouse her.

But
Ms Whittaker said Hutton was reluctant to engage with health visitors because 'she lost faith in the health service 
after her mum died'.

The former officer said her unit helped with fitting panic alarms and anti-arson letterboxes to Hutton’s house.

Maria
Hodgson - a friend of Hutton’s family who knew her for more than 20 
years - said the defendant changed after her mother died at the end of 
2005.

Mrs Hodgson was asked about a phone call lasting more than 30 minutes between her and Hutton on December 14 2009.

Paul
Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Mrs Hodgson whether the defendant 
mentioned anything about Hamzah being ill during that conversation.

Mrs Hodgson said she did not.

Hutton's neighbour said the woman was often drunk and tearful.

Christine Latz said she lived next door to Amanda Hutton and got to know her after she moved into her street in Bradford, in March 2009.

She said the defendant talked to her about the abusive relationship she had moved away from.

Asked
whether there was any 'common feature' she noticed about Hutton, Mrs 
Latz said: 'She just smelt of alcohol. She appeared to be drunk quite 
often, tearful.

'She told me she’d come out of an abusive relationship to make a fresh start down here.'

Hamzah Khan's father Aftab Khan was also in court today.

He told the court how he confronted Hutton about how she was looking after his son.

But he said she told him to mind his own business and banned him from the house less than a year before the little boy died.

Mr Khan told the court how he had separated from Hutton after he was charged with assaulting her.

He said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton due to a court order, but did start to go and see his son when they moved.

Mr Khan told the jury his former partner was not looking after Hamzah properly.

'I said "look at the state of him - you're not looking after him" and she told me to get out,' he told the jury.

The mechanic and taxi driver told the court that it was his concerns about his son that had led to the arguments resulting in his arrest in 2008 and eventual conviction for battery.

He said: 'She wasn't bathing him. She wasn't changing him.'

Mr Khan said he would only see Hutton feeding Hamzah milk. He said his former partner drank cider and vodka heavily, especially after the death of her mother.

'She'd be absolutely out of it,' he said.

Hutton today sat in the dock dressed in black, watching Mr Khan give his evidence.

Mr Khan told the jury he contacted social services once about the condition of Hamzah but said he was ignored.

A senior police officer told the court there was no record he ever made the call.

Yesterday, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Khan whether he did contact social services.

He said: 'I remember ringing social services up. They said it was a private matter.

Pressed by Mr Greaney, he said: 'I clearly remember. There's no record of it. They weren't bothered, they weren't interested. I'd given up at that time.'

Mr Greaney QC also asked Mr Khan about urging police to 'go and check' on Hamzah.

'Yes, so they could see the neglect for themselves,' he answered.

Mr Greaney asked Mr Khan about a text message he sent to Hutton which read: 
'Don't worry it's not me who's going to land you in the s***, you're 
going to do that yourself. You've turned into the biggest liar, stop 
drinking.'

The text also asked what Hamzah had 'had' and added: 'Think about what you're doing to everybody.'

Mr Greaney asked him: 'What do you mean by "had"?'

Mr Khan answered: 'I meant what food, had he been fed properly?'

Mr Khan rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer'.

Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, asked him: 'You were a wife batterer and she was a battered wife, cowed by your violence.'

Mr Khan said: 'If I was a wife batterer why am I not standing next to her (Hutton)?'

Mr Meadowcroft replied: 'Perhaps you ought to be.'

The
defence barrister put it to Mr Khan that he had been violent towards 
his client throughout their 20-year relationship, but he denied this.

'I've come here to answer questions about my child,' he said.

'Everyone knows what happened. You've got damning evidence against Miss Hutton but you're still trying to point the finger at me. I'm not having it.'

Mr Meadowcroft told him: 'You were the father of the family. You were there. Had you actually thought that (Hamzah's neglect)? What did you do about it?'

Mr Khan told the court: 'The police wouldn't believe me. No one would believe me.

'I know I made one phone call. If the police weren't going to believe me, who else is going to believe me? I gave up.

'The system failed my son. Did the school check up? Did social services check up? I lost my total confidence in the system.'

Mr Khan said he helped Hutton before the court case, giving her money to buy clothes for the trial.

'I've helped her a lot. If I was a violent man, I wouldn't have helped.'

Pc Maria Furness, of West Yorkshire Police, told the jury she attended Hutton's house to perform a welfare check but found Hamzah to be 'fed well, clean, healthy looking and there was an appropriate adult in the address'.

Pc Furness said she was at the house for about 30 to 45 minutes when she made the visit about eight months before Hamzah's death.

The case continues.
