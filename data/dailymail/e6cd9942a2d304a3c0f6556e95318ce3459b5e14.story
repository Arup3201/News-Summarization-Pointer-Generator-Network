When their two-year-old son was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor, Devon and Valerie Morse didn't think it could get much worse.

But just weeks later, Devon, who is a Marine, also began feeling sick and doctors revealed the unthinkable: that he, too, had a brain tumor.

Now the family, who live at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, are trying to come to terms with the news as they attend medical appointments across the state.

Fighting together: Devon Morse is pictured with his two-year-old son; both have a brain tumor

'If it were to come worse to worse for me, I would rather have myself go than my son,' Devon told WCTI12. 'I would rather him see that life that he deserves.'

The family's battle began in March when David began vomiting, suffering from nosebleeds and struggling with his balance. They took him to hospital, where he underwent a brain scan.

Doctors revealed that the toddler had a tumor the size of a tangerine in his brain - and that it was malignant.

'I stopped and I cried and I cried,' Valerie told WCTI. 'And my husband had to walk out of the room, just to take a breather real quick.

Fight: David was diagnosed with brain cancer in March and is now undergoing chemotherapy

Still smiling: The family say they have been touched by donations and kindness from the local community

'My son looked up at me, and said, "What's wrong, mommy?" And I just lost it.'

David underwent surgery and doctors were able to remove most of the tumor. He is now undergoing chemotherapy.

But then in April, Devon began suffering numbness in his body and doctors revealed that he also had a tumor in his head.

His was much smaller than his son's, and doctors deduced that it was more dangerous to try to remove it, so they left it and are treating him with medication instead.

Devon continues to undergo treatment, as well as regular hospital visits.

Hopeful: They are pictured with mom Valerie, who said she has found the diagnoses heartbreaking

The community has rallied around the young family, and the local fire and police stations have been collecting donations and toys for the Morses, who are feeling the financial strains.

On the family's Facebook page, they expressed their thanks to Cherry Point police for their kindness.

'Today you let David play in the squad car, and to see our baby boy laugh and smile like that made us cry inside... to know that there are people out there that care for and about him, and that do everything they can to keep him happy and smiling,' they wrote.
