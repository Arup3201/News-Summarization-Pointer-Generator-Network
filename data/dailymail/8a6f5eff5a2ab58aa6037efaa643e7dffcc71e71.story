With one of Britain’s biggest music festivals coming up this weekend, one supermarket has clearly worked out that revellers are more likely to want Fosters and vodka instead of fruit and vegetables.

These were the scenes at a Tesco store in Reading, Berkshire, ahead of the Reading music festival this weekend which features the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Blink-182 and Queens of the Stone Age.

Shelves at the Reading West store - which is a 15-minute walk away from the entrance to the festival site - were packed with Jägermeister and Strongbow, as well as more practical supplies such as tents.

Alcohol available: During the festival Tesco expects to see 35,000 people a day coming through the store

The store has set up a ‘festival shop’ area and is expected to sell more than 30 pallets of tents this weekend, along with other important items such as sandwiches, water and camping chairs.

A Tesco spokesman told The Reading Post: ‘During the festival we expect to see 35,000 people a day coming through the store, and yes, we expect some of them will want to buy alcohol.

‘This is the biggest weekend of the year for our Reading West store - bigger than Christmas.

‘We work really hard to make sure festival goers can get everything they need, including food, wellies and even tents. Believe it or not some people do come to the festival without a tent.’

One thing that festival-goers might want to stock up on is toilet roll, after officials decided not to supply toilet paper for the fans set to descend on the site this year.

As MailOnline reported last month, organisers of the three-day event - the oldest festival on the calendar - say there will no rolls in the toilets, so people will have to bring their own.

More than 70,000 fans camp out at the August Bank holiday weekend festival, which moved to Reading in 1971 from its original site at Richmond.
