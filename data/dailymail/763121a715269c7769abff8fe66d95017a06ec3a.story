Mark Duggan was clutching a mobile phone in his hand when he was shot dead by armed police, a witness has told an inquest

A witness has told an inquest how Mark Duggan was clutching a mobile phone in his hand when he was shot dead by armed police.

The man, referred to as Witness B to protect his anonymity, told the inquest into the 29-year-old's death how he saw Mr Duggan still holding the device as he collapsed after being shot by a police marksman stood 'five to seven steps away'.

The witness said he used his own mobile to film the aftermath of the fatal shooting in August 2011, which sparked riots across London and other parts of Britain.

More than 50 members of the public packed into an annexe of the courtroom at the Royal Courts of Justice to watch via a video-link as the footage was shown to the jury.

Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquest, asked the witness whether he heard a 'commotion' shortly after 6pm on August 4, 2011.

'I heard tyres screeching and then I heard shouting' he said. 'The shouting was either "put it down or get down".'

Witness B told the inquest he saw armed police wearing blue jackets close to the mini cab Mr Duggan was travelling in.

'When I saw him (Mr Duggan) he was on the sidewalk,' he said.

'He tried to run off towards Tottenham Hale but then there was a police officer standing there.'

The witness said he then saw Mr Duggan turn around to run towards Blackhorse Road.

'Could you see his hands?' Mr Underwood asked.

'Yes,' Witness B replied. 'It looked like a phone clutched in his hand. I’ve said that since day one.

'That was definitely a phone clutched in his hand.'

Asked where Mr Duggan was holding his hands at the time, the witness raised his own hands above his shoulders, the hearing was told.

The man told the jury he saw Mr Duggan collapse on the pavement after being shot twice.

'How did you know he had been shot?' Mr Underwood asked.

'I heard the shots,' he replied. 'The way he fell as well. He just collapsed.'

Asked how far away the police marksman was from Mr Duggan when the shots were fired, Witness B said: 'About a couple of steps. Five to seven steps.'

The BBC challenged an order by the coroner, Judge Keith Cutler, that the broadcaster should reveal the name of the eyewitness who filmed the aftermath of the shooting.

Witness B, who gave his footage to the BBC, admitted he had been reluctant to give evidence at the hearing and had moved out of London following the shooting.

'I took the video, I gave it to the BBC so they could put it out there,' he said. 'I had to move out of London because of it. I wanted to be left alone.'

'What were you worried about?' Mr Underwood asked.

'It’s not everyday you see someone get shot in London and dying,' Witness B said.

'It played on my mind a bit.'

The witness said he was also concerned after hearing about gang links in relation to the shooting.

Police
have told the inquest that Mr Duggan was being watched by officers 
involved in investigating a gang known to use firearms and violence.

Witness B said Mr Duggan looked 'baffled' as he stood on the pavement surrounded by armed police.

'His body language was a bit like: what was going on?' he said.

He told the jury Mr Duggan was holding
his hands up, with his palms facing towards the officers and a phone 
clutched in his right hand.

Leslie
Thomas, representing Mr Duggan’s family, asked Witness B: 'Are you 
saying that Mark Duggan was shot when it looked as if he was 
surrendering?'

'Yes,' he replied.

'Any doubt about that?' Mr Thomas asked.

'None whatsoever.'

Mr Thomas asked Witness B why he had not taken his video footage to the police.

'To be honest, I don’t really trust the police,' the witness replied.

'I just can’t relate to them really.'

The response prompted an outburst of applause from members of the public watching the inquest proceedings via videolink.

Questioned by Ian Stern QC, representing the Metropolitan Police’s firearm officers, Witness B confirmed he had been paid by the BBC after handing over the footage he recorded.

Notes made by a BBC interviewer during a meeting with Witness B in April 2012 were shown to the jury, in which the witness described Mr Duggan's death as 'an execution'.

Asked by his lawyer Jude Bunting whether he stood by the description, he replied: 'Yes.'

Mr Stern told the jury there was no reference in the transcript to shouts of 'get down', only that Witness B had heard 'put it down'.

The interviewer also recorded Witness B as stating he heard 'two shots, then phone went flying', and 'initially thought gun but read newspapers then thought it was a BlackBerry.'

'Did you initially think he had a gun in his hand?', Mr Stern asked.

'It was a phone,' Witness B said.

'How can you be sure from 150 metres away it was a BlackBerry?', the barrister asked.

'20/20 vision,' he replied.

Witness B told the hearing his girlfriend, referred to as Witness A, had negotiated with the BBC over the payment for the footage.

'It wasn't about the money,' he said.

'I just wanted it out there.'

The inquest was adjourned to tomorrow.
