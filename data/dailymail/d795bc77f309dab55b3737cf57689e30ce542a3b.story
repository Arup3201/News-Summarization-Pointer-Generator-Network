Twerking is the now famous dance performed by Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards in the summer.

The dance craze, started in the New 
Orleans 'bounce' music scene of the early 90s and has now become so mainstream it was even honoured with an official entry in the Oxford 
Dictionaries Online.

The top spot on Thursday night - worth £200 - was awarded to a 19-year-old from Tottenham, East London who goes by the stage name of Mizz Versatile.

She told MailOnline: 'I've been 
dancing for years. Twerking recently came up and I decided to learn.

Popular: The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd were cheering throughout the night

A 'jelly round' saw the girls standing still and shaking without moving their feet

'I 
tried different ways of moving my bum and practice whenever I have time.'

Mizz
Versatile, who has a daughter aged two-and-a-half, said the venue was 
packed and the crowd were extremely loud as they cheered on the 
competitors, who were selected from regional heats.

The
full-time dancer, who is a size 8 and 4ft 9in, said her success was 
down to her technique during the 30-second rounds which include 
freestyle and splits.

Covered: The 18 and 20-year-old sisters were covered with balaclavas as they danced on the small stage, but they denied it was because they were ashamed

Focus: The older sister said 'I felt it was an advantage because me and my sister wanted to be judged purely on our twerk skills, not our looks'

Crowd pleaser: The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd went crazy during the grand finale round where the girls twerked upside-down while being held up by a male audience member

'It's not about the size of your bum. People with large bums can not move to save their life,' she said.

She
said her friends and family were proud of her twerking success and 
dismissed people that criticise the raunchy dance move saying 'to be 
honest they probably just can't dance.'

The double's winner who scooped a £400 
prize were a pair of sisters who call themselves Shannon X2, from 
Harrow, in north-west London.

Sold-out: The final 10 competitors danced in front of a sold-out crowd in London's King's Cross on Thursday

Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes

To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward

To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone

Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section

For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out

Then up the tempo and shake the butt

The 18 and 20-year-old's faces were covered with balaclavas as they danced on the small stage, but they denied it was because they were ashamed.

The older sister, who wore a black balaclava and brightly-patterned leggings with a dark crop top told The Sun: 'I felt it was an advantage because me and my sister wanted to be judged purely on our twerk skills, not our looks.

'If our faces are covered they have to look at our a**** only.

'We combined balaclavas with crop tops and patterned leggings.

'You have to showcase more effort to see the jiggle through the fabric — so that's why we don't wear shorts.'

A 'jelly round' saw the girls standing still and shaking without moving their feet.

The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd went crazy during the grand finale round where the girls twerked upside-down while being held up by a male audience member.

Event organiser, Harry Anthony, from Jump Off TV, told MailOnline the event was sold out very quickly and he hopes the competition will become an annual event.

'The crowd had an incredible time. They never stopped making noise and we're getting requests about when the next event is. We are most definitely looking to make this an annual event and currently working on a UK tour to showcase the winners.'

Although twerking is currently in the media spotlight Mr Harry denied it was a recent phenomenon.

He said: 'Booty shaking or what its now more commonly known as twerking has been part of hip hip culture for decades and is only getting the media spotlight because of Miley Cyrus' attempts to try to twerk.'

The term 'twerk' was added to the Oxford Dictionary recently.

Katherine
Connor Martin, from Oxford Dictionaries Online, said 'twerk' was around
20 years old and seemed to have been coined as part of the 'bounce' 
hip-hop scene in the United States.

'By
last year, it had generated enough currency to be added to our new 
words watch list, and by this spring, we had enough evidence of usage 
frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our 
dictionaries of current English,' she said.

'There are many theories about the origin of this word, and since it arose in oral use, we may never know the answer for sure.

'We
think the most likely theory is that it is an alteration of work, 
because that word has a history of being used in similar ways, with 
dancers being encouraged to "work it". The "t" could be a result of 
blending with another word such as twist or twitch.

'The
current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how 
the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s, when it was first 
popularised by Chubby Checker’s song, the Twist.

'Only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public.'
