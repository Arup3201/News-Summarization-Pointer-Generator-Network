They ran across the desert with smoke bombs, got matching tattoos, shared a first dance in a back street alley - and were even married by a King.

These incredible photos capture the elopement of Australian couple Ainsley Hutchence and Sebastien Fougere to Las Vegas, Nevada in November 2013.

The pair, who 'fell in love at first sight' in an organic cafe in 2008, decided to have an unconventional wedding because they had both been married before.

Instead of a traditional ceremony, they opted to elope to downtown Las Vegas to be married by 'Elvis', deeming the notion 'funny' and 'adventurous'.

They brought along their friend, photographer Janneke Storm, to document their debauchery, while other loved ones stayed behind in Queensland.

'Initially, we couldn't be bothered [with a wedding], especially if it meant spending a s***-ton of money that we could use for a holiday instead,' Ainsley said.

'Then for some reason, Elvis came up and the more we looked into it, the better it sounded. [We thought] getting married by Elvis would be kind of funny.' 

The couple, who run the website Sticks and Stones Agency, said they were determined their nuptials in Las Vegas would involve 'no family and no rules'.

'For us this time round was an adventure with each other, Ainsley said. 'We needed to go somewhere far enough away to discourage any guests, somewhere where the rules could be bent, but most importantly a place where the real king still reigns...  Vegas baby!'

Five years after they moved in together, Ainsley and Sebastien flew to the world-famous city with Janneke. But on the day of their nuptials, the couple nearly missed the ceremony after getting caught up in the 'craziness' of taking photos and having fun.
