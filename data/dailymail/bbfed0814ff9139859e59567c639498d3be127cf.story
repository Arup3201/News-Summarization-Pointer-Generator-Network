Historic photos show child who are now in their 80s enjoying pony rides and Tilt-A-Whirls during the heyday of a forgotten Los Angeles theme park.

The amusement park historian Jay Jennings's Beverly Park: L.A.'s Kiddieland details the history of the attraction, which was open from 1945 to 1974 on the land that now houses the Beverly Center mall.

It was owned by Dave Bradley,  a ride inventor and amusement park innovator, who filled the location with a Little Dipper roller coaster, Boat Ride, Merry-Go-Round, Helicopter Ride, Ferris Wheel, and a Haunted Castle long before Disneyland.

The photos can also be seen on Retro Image Publishing.

Millions of children (pictured, in 1972) who grew up in Los Angeles have memories of riding the ponies at Beverly Park, which was open from 1945 to 1974. 

The children who enjoyed Kiddieland in their youth are now up to 70 years older and now likely have grandchildren who would like the park

Dave Bradley gave a personal touch to the rides at his park, using his own voice for a talking hippopotamus

'Millions of kids just like me thought Beverly Park was the greatest place on earth,' Mr Jennings told LAist.

Bradley bought the park, which had been a baseball field before it became an amusement park in 1943, and made it his own.

The man injected his own personal magic touch into childrens' experiences there, using his own voice as that of a blue hippopotamus who spoke to passersby. 

The site, which had free parking and was dubbed Kiddieland by parents, was also located next to Ponyland, where children could ride the small horses around a track.

Bradley and his relatives ran the park as a family, and Hollywood stars of the era such as Lana Turner, Carol Burnett, Errol Flynn and other luminaries of the age took their children there, according to KCET. 

The park in western Los Angeles was popular with the stars of Hollywood and their children during the 30 years it was open

Walt Disney used to visit the park with his children and talk to Bradley about the rides that he had brought in

The park, on La Cienega Boulevard, treated guests to cotton candy and hot dogs sold in a stand that looked like its product

Rides included a Little Dipper roller coaster, Boat Ride, Merry-Go-Round, Helicopter Ride, Ferris Wheel, and a Haunted Castle

It was particularly popular with divorced Beverly Hills fathers looking to spoil their kids.

Walt Disney, who opened his own park in 1955, was one of the early visitors to take his children to Kiddieland and talked to Bradley about the rides.

He later recruited the park owner to join his Disneyland operation.

The entrepreneur worked as a consultant for Disney at the same time as running the park, and would go to Europe to take pictures of interesting amusement park rides. 

'In the end, Disney utilized many of Dave Bradley's ideas for Disneyland, such as the concept of "themed photos ops" where certain parts of the park could be specifically designed for taking family photos,' Jennings said. 

A rising lease price for the land would ultimately lead Kiddieland to close, and the first mall was built at the location in 1982.

Bradley then concentrated on his carousel-molding business in Long Beach. 

Kiddieland was located next to the appropriately-named Ponyland, where children could ride ponies around a track

Bradley was recruited by Walt Disney to help with Disneyland, but continued running his own park at the same time

Beverly Park was particularly popular with divorced Beverly Hills dads who would spoil their kids with treats and fun

Kiddieland was closed in 1974 because of rising lease rates, and the place where it stood is now occupied by a mall called Beverly Center
