These photos show the terrifying moment a lemon shark opens it mouth to reveal the rows of razor sharp teeth it uses to devour its prey.

As wildlife photographer John Chapa, 41, swims just inches from the bait, the shark shoots towards him, its enormous jaw gaping as it prepares to snatch the meal straight from his assistant's hand.

Mr Chapa, pictured here in waters off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, takes groups of tourists on trips to see the formidable creatures - allowing brave holidaymakers the chance to get up close and personal during dinner time.

For a fee of $100, they can dive with the sharks and have their photo taken with it - just as it tears its meal to pieces.

His friend, diver Cameron Nimmo, 26, sets up the shots for him by holding out bait right in front of his camera.

Mr Chapa, from Miami, said: 'Timing is important - it's really fast. Their mouths are open and closed in a second. Cameron will release the bait just in time and the shark is pretty much right in my face.

'Usually I keep the shutter pressed, and I'll take five shots - the fourth one is the usually best and shows the shark's mouth completely open.

'The sharks are very careful and not clumsy at all - they know you're not the food and turn once they've got the bait.'

Mr Chapa has been on around 800 dives and spends an average of 50 minutes with the sharks each time.

He added: 'I had to psych myself up to do it the first time - you can't go down there and freak out, it's dangerous.

The sharks grow to around three metres long and have been known to weigh up to 180kg

Lemon sharks are so-called because their yellow-brown pitted skin can have the appearance of lemon

'A girl freaked out once and bolted for the surface but all the sharks followed he - she thought they were attacking her but in reality they were following her to see why she was freaking out.

'I've been surrounded by 30-40 lemon sharks at a time, they don't bite you - they come up and bump you but don't bite intentionally.

'They know you're not on the menu - they know the bait is food and then turn away once they have it.' 

Lemon sharks are so-called because their yellow-brown pitted skin can have the appearance of lemon.

This helps them to blend in against sandy sea floors where they can lay motionless.

Lemon sharks are bottom dwellers, preferring the tropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, bays and estuaries.

Shallow waters, such as the lagoon in Bimini, provide the protection from larger sharks the pups need, whilst also offering rich hunting grounds.

They are short-nosed and stocky sharks with a powerful bite. 

They have adapted to withstand different salinities in water and have been known to travel up rivers in freshwater. 

They can grow to around three metres in length and can weigh up to 180kg.
