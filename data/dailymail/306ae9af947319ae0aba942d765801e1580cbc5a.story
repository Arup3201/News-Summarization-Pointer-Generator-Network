Beko was warned by London Fire Brigade in June 2010 about some of its fridge freezers (file photo)

A firm which has household appliances in thousands of homes has been accused of making death trap machines responsible for at least 11 fatalities.

Beko makes fridge freezers and tumble driers under its own name, which have all been subject to safety recalls.

It is now under threat from a series of lawsuits over deaths caused by fires and carbon monoxide poisoning linked to some of its appliances.

Beko is at the centre of a £1.5million legal action by Jennifer Benjamin, a paediatrician, who lost her husband in a fire at their home in Wealdstone, north London.

The firm was warned by London Fire Brigade in a letter in June 2010 that some of its fridge freezers were a ‘potential threat to life’ after a series of fires.

However, the company allegedly failed to issue a swift public alert and Mrs Benjamin’s husband, Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, 36, died some five months later.

The Microsoft employee died from the effects of the fire and smoke inhalation in hospital a few days after helping to rescue the couple’s two young children.

The family’s lawyers served a letter before action on the company last week ahead of a preliminary inquest into his death.

Mrs Benjamin believes far more should have been done to alert the public to the dangers with the firm’s fridge freezers, which were known to overheat, so making them a fire risk.

‘It’s still very painful for us. These products are faulty and the public need to be made aware of it,’ she said.

However, this is not an isolated incident. Beko was warned in November 2008 of a potentially lethal flaw in some of its gas cookers after three deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning.

An advertising campaign was launched three months later, by which time three more people had died. Four other people are believed to have been killed by the cookers.

Customers whose faulty Beko tumble 
driers have apparently caused house fires say they received no alerts 
from the company, despite records of their purchases.

Jill
Paterson, a specialist product liability lawyer at Leigh Day, said she 
was alarmed at the significant number of serious incidents allegedly 
involving Beko products.

She claimed there were still tens of 
thousands of Beko appliances in people’s homes that were potential fire 
risks, while she said the company had failed to issue early alerts and 
make sure that customers were notified.

‘It is irresponsible that they appear to be dragging their feet over products which can cause injury and deaths,’ she said.

It is expected that other lawsuits will be launched against the company.

Internet forums are full of complaints
from customers who have had enormous difficulty in getting repairs 
needed to potentially lethal machines.

Beko is a brand of the Turkish 
appliance manufacturer, Arcelik and makes some one in five of all new 
white goods sold in the UK each year.

Its managing director, Ragip Balcioglu, insisted all its products are subject to rigorous European Union testing and standards.

‘We
will not rest until we have done everything in our power to track down 
any potentially affected products where an issue has been identified,’ 
he said.

The company said: 'Beko sincerely regrets any incident linked to any of our products. We would like to express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of affected customers.

'The company strongly rejects any accusations that we have not acted as timely or comprehensively as possible to initiate the three corrective action programs.

'Beko has always acted in accordance with regulatory guidance, co-operated with all relevant authorities and abided by all accepted standards of industry practice.

'Beko has mobilised every resource at its disposal to rectify and raise awareness of the three product issues.

'Activities include customer letters, outbound calling, national, regional and specialist media safety notice advertising, the ‘Be a Hero’ public information campaign, leafleting and door knocking campaigns as well as posting extensive safety information on our website.'

Customers with concerns are advised to visit its website www.beko.co.uk or call its care centre on free phone 0800 917 2018.
