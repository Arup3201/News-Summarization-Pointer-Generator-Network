Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, my mouth open as wide as it will go, I'm attempting to warble vowel sounds, like a singer warming up before a performance.

It's a good thing the door is locked - and not just because my tuneless caterwauling means I won't be appearing on The X Factor any time soon.

Rather it's because inside my mouth is a bizarre Japanese device that promises it will firm my face and reduce my wrinkles.

Miracle wrinkle exterminator? Clare with the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece

Normally, I'd welcome any chance to roll back the years. I'd love to erase the lines that have come with having two children and turning 40, and re-define a jawline that's starting to sag. And this device has been causing a buzz on the internet.

According to its manufacturers, the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece is all I require for a more youthful look.

'To get and maintain the perfect visage, you don't need the cosmetic surgeon's knife. All you need is the mouthpiece,' they claim in their blurb.

It's quite a promise. I am on tenterhooks as I wait for the parcel to arrive. But it's not just the cost of the mouthpiece - £49 - that gives me a shock.

This secret weapon in the battle against age is a malleable silicone rubber mould that fits in the mouth behind the teeth and which is attached to oversized sugar-pink lips. It looks as if it would be more at  home in a horror movie than in a family bathroom.

The makers blithely claim it's perfect for using 'in front of the mirror, in the bath or at any other convenient time every day'.

But while I'm happy to apply make-up and style my hair in my car as I wait at traffic lights, this is one aspect of my beauty routine that won't be put on public view. Never mind the ridicule, I'd be afraid of being arrested.

Winning smile? Clare enunciates the five vowel sounds as part of the Face Slimmer exercise regimen

The idea is that you put the mouthpiece in and then pull a series of facial expressions - the shapes you make when you enunciate the five vowel sounds.

By repeatedly doing this you supposedly exercise your facial muscles and so tone and de-stress the face, relaxing wrinkles and firming saggy skin.

The mouthpiece - which is hinged at the back like a pair of comedy false teeth - apparently provides extra resistance, making the exercises more effective.

The manufacturers claim three minutes of  exercising a day is all you need to reap the benefits.

It doesn't sound like much, but in a house with a five-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, privacy is hard to come by.

Given that I don't want to give my children nightmares by showing them my new 'look', it's surprisingly difficult to find a time when I wont be interrupted.

Eventually, I decide to do my exercises in  the evening once the children have gone to bed.

The online pictures of a woman demonstrating the anti-ageing exerciser show her making exaggerated mouth shapes, so that's what I do.

She also opens her eyes very wide - making her look as if she's being attacked by a pair of  giant lips - so again I follow her example.

There's no explanation as to why widening your eyes is beneficial, but perhaps it helps erase crows' feet.

Alternatively, it might just be an understandably natural reaction of horror when faced with having to wear the horrible-looking device.

Spot the difference? Maybe not

I find that to ensure I’m making the right expressions - smiling when I mouth the letter 'e', opening my mouth very wide for 'i' and pushing my chin forward for 'u' - it’s best if I sing the vowels loudly.

While it's not painful to wear, the device is uncomfortable because it distends my mouth.

Sometimes I find it makes me dribble unattractively. Doing my facial exercises does not become the favourite part of my day.

My husband, passing the bathroom one evening and hearing my warbling, asks if I'm feeling all right. I mumble 'I'm fine' as best as I can: there's no way I’m opening the door and showing him what I look like.

I soon get into the habit of doing my facial exercises before going to bed.

After a week I wonder if it's making a difference. I wouldn't exactly say that I am seeing the 'more youthful, vibrant' face as promised by the makers, but there is definitely a tightening sensation around my jawline.

More worryingly, I think I am developing an intolerance to the mouthpiece. The more I wear it, the more uncomfortable it becomes, catching the back of my throat and making me gag.

Still, as we all know when it comes to beauty, there's no gain without pain, so I battle on for a second week.

But I am having to take short breaks between making the various vowel sounds, rather than doing them all in one go.

Julia Anastasiou is a teacher of face yoga, which is a technique that combines acupressure, massage and facial exercises to give a more youthful look.

She's sceptical about the effectiveness of the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece. 'There are 57 muscles in the face. The technique I teach isolates them, so it's done in a controlled way, but I don't think that repeating vowel sounds would be targeted enough,' says Julia.

Dubious: The odd Japanese device

'And while I can understand the theory that resistance would help, I don't think this is going to make your face look slimmer or erase wrinkles.'

So, after two weeks of doing facial exercises with fake lips, what’s my final verdict? Am I looking any younger?

Friends say my face possibly looks a little plumper and more toned, though it has to be said the results are on the subtle side.

You never know. Perhaps if I can get over my aversion to the mouthpiece, I can keep it in for longer at a time and get more dramatic results.

It's either that or I’m back to pinning my hopes for eternal youth on anti-ageing creams and positive thinking.
