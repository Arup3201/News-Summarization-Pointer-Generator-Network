A Washington state couple who use medical marijuana and own a marijuana dispensary have been reunited with their five-year-old son after losing custody, with child protective services saying they were not fit parents because they were high all the time.

Jesse and Vicca Thompson, from Sedro-Wolley, where marijuana is legal, were also accused of feeding their second child, a 13-year-old son, a weed-laced cake product 'because he gets aggressive and is too mean sometimes'.

According to ABC's 20/20, the couple had their children taken from them in November, and their store, called the Grow Shop, was shut down shortly after following the allegations they were feeding edible products to minors.

'(Using marijuana) just means I have an elevated mood,' Vicca Thompson told the show.

Reunited: Jesse and Vicca Thompson - campaigners for recreational marijuana who own a small dispensary in Washington - lost custody of their five-year-old son, Jerry, last year, for being unfit parents. They posted this photo to Facebook after Jerry back, with his shirt saying marijuana is safer than Child Protective Services 

High all the time: Vicca and Jesse Thompson say their marijuana use - which is for medical purposes and legal - does not affect their ability to parent

'It doesn't mean I'm incapacitated or that I can't think straight.

'I'm pot right now, and I'm able to parent.' 

Jesse Thompson, a cancer survivor, has a marijuana prescription for pain, while his wife uses it for arthritis and a nervous condition.

He said their troubles started not from their parenting but from firing an employee at their store.

'About a month later, she ... called CPS (Child Protective Services),' Jesse said.

'She told them that we not only are feeding our children marijuana all the time, but that they have access to it in our home and in our business.'

That is when the Thompson's lost custody of their five-year-old, Jerry. 

A few days later child services called to interview Jerry's stepbrother, Sohani, 13, who is Vicca's son from a previous marriage.

The boy told authorities his mother had given him a 'goo ball', a peanut butter raisin ball medicated with psycho-active marijuana they sell in their shop.

'He gets aggressive and is too mean, sometimes ... and just needs to ... look inside and relax,' Vicca said.

Jerry was sent to live live with an aunt while Sohani was sent to stay with his biological father.

The Thompsons were only allowed to see Jerry at a CPS office.

'It’s destroying me,' Jesse said.

'I can’t not be with my son. He is all that matters.'

Vicca added: 'I felt like my heart might stop.'

The Thompsons lost one fight to get Jerry back.

Jerry tested positive for THC during a hair follicle exam.

CPS maintained the two are unfit parents and pose a risk to Jerry's well-being by feeding him marijuana.

The couple say they had never given their son marijuana.

However Vicca said she once rubbed a marijuana salve on Jerry's skin to treat a rash, but he would not have had any mind-altering effects.

Edibles: The Thompsons' older son told authorities his mother had fed a cake product that was laced with cannabis. Pictured here is some marijuana edibles Vicca Thompson posted to her Facebook

Earlier this month, a court commission said there was no evidence of THC in Jerry's body.

It was then determined the Thompsons posed no serious harm to their child.

Jerry was allowed to return home with his parents on January 7.  

However the commissioner set strict conditions.

If Jerry ever tests positive for THC he will be removed.  

'We’re going to hide the marijuana,' Vicca Thompson told 20/20.

'I definitely feel like I shouldn’t give it to children.'
