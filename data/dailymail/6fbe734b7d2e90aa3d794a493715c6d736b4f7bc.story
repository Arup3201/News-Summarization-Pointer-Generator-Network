If there was one thing that caught our attention in the new episode of Made In Chelsea – besides a new character with quite possibly the world’s poshest name (yes you, Miffy) – it was Binky Felstead’s svelte new figure.

As filming for season six of the E4 show loomed, the reality TV star decided it was time to shed the excess pounds she gained off-screen and pack herself off to bootcamp.

And now we can reveal that, following a week-long rigorous diet and exercise plan, 5ft 7in Binky has slimmed down from 10st 10lbs to 9st 10lb and has celebrated her new figure in a sizzling set of swimwear images shot in Ibiza.

New physique: Binky Felstead wanted to get in shape for the new series of Made In Chelsea so she hit bootcamp and lost a stone in a week

A resident of the notoriously hardcore No 1 Bootcamp in Ibiza, she was woken every morning at 6am by loud music, and set to work flipping tyres, doing circuits and beach workouts.

Then she would have a specially-prepared breakfast before embarking on two-and-a-half-hour  sessions of cross, circuit and high intensity interval training. 

Her calories at the camp were limited to just over a thousand per day and each meal was a blend of slow release carbs, lean protein and essential fats. 

Military-style hikes of between seven to eight miles filled the majority of the afternoon to maximise fat burning.

Before and after: Binky has slimmed down from 10st 10lbs to 9st 10lbs through a combination of a week of intense exercise and ditching boozy nights out and kebabs

Binky lost a stone and is so 
confident about her new size 10 body that she says she wouldn’t rule out any
 on-screen naked shower or bedroom scenes a la Louise Thompson.

As she was: Once a mainstay on the Chelsea party scene, Binky now only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda

Despite
 feeling at her best, Binky’s ultimate goal is to reach a size 8 and we 
can’t help but wonder if that’s got anything to do with the fact that 
she has a new boyfriend.

While she won’t confirm the identity of the lucky man (OK! magazine says she is rumoured to be dating co-star Alex Mytton), she blames her new relationship on eating more.

Speaking to OK! Magazine, who shot the swimwear images, Binky said: ‘Having a boyfriend means I eat a lot bigger portions.

'I get really jealous if he’s got a bigger portion to me and if I’ve eaten everything on my plate I’ll always stick my fork on his plate!’.

It seems that her past relationship, whereby her ex-boyfriend called her a ‘big whale’, has had a lasting effect.

She said: ‘With my ex-boyfriend I put on a lot of weight because we were going out way too much and eating a lot of takeaways, it was bad. He used to call me the big whale and I didn’t know why.

‘I actually saw him recently and he 
was like: ‘You look amazing, you’ve lost loads of weight!’ So I said to 
him: “You should’ve told me how fat I was!” He was like: “I did by 
calling you the big whale!” I always thought he was joking, but he 
bloody wasn’t!’

Once a mainstay on the Chelsea party scene, Binky only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda.

She also tries her best to avoid carbs and 2am drunken kebab pit-stops.

She has revealed that she curbs her cravings by taking diet pills, Forza Raspberry Ketones.

Love is in the air? Fran and Alex admit to having met up over the summer, and share a quick kiss at the pool party, but OK! magazine say Binky is now rumoured to be dating the handsome newcomer (R)

She's back! Made In Chelsea returned to our screens with a bang on Monday and saw Binky (R) orchestrating a chat between former lovers Spencer (centre) and Lucy (L)
