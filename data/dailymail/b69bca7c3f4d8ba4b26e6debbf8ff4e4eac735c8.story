Noxious: Emergency crews descended on a house in Leatherhead after fumes produced from cooking with chilli oil almost made neighbours sick

Nearly 20 firefighters with three engines, plus two ambulances and a hazardous area response team, swarmed to a Leatherhead street in Surrey after residents said they could smell noxious gas - only to find someone cooking with chilli oil. 

The emergency crews descended on a house in Clements Mead at around 8.50am on Friday morning and the property was evacuated as fire crews investigated the cause of the smell, while the HART ambulance team dealt with residents suffering with breathing difficulties. 

A crew member from Leatherhead fire station said 'We received a call from residents concerned that an unknown gas was giving them breathing difficulties. 

'We arrived on the scene on Clements Mead and evacuated the building and neighbouring properties. Colleagues from the HART team also attended. 

'It turned out somebody had been cooking with chilli oil which had evaporated into the air and produced a very strong smell, which neighbours then reported having breathing problems from. 

'We were on scene for about 40 minutes, so it turned out to be quite a big emergency response for chilli oil.' 

One resident, who asked not to be named, said 'When the lady who called the emergency services came out of her flat to go to work in the morning, she smelt fumes that were so bad that she started coughing and choking and was nearly sick.'
