Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has warned he may take action over large mortgages

Housebuyers could be banned from borrowing many times their salaries to cool the property market – as new figures suggest the price of the average home is rising by almost £10,000 a month.

The Governor of the Bank of England expressed concern about the return of large mortgages and suggested that the Government’s flagship scheme to make home loans cheaper will be reined in  within months.

Mark Carney said he was ready to take action on a number of fronts if Britain’s resurgent housing market begins to threaten the economy.

He expressed particular concern about the return of big mortgages – more than four and a half times a borrower’s salary – which were widespread before the financial crash of 2007 and now ‘creeping up’ again.

The Governor is thought to be worried that Help to Buy – by sending a message that houses can be bought with a deposit of as little as five per cent – might encourage other homebuyers to borrow than they should.

Startling figures published  by Rightmove show asking prices rose by 8.9 per cent in the year to May, meaning the average property is on sale at a record high of £272,003.

The annual rate crept closer to the 10.4 per cent seen in October 2007 while a month-on-month increase of 3.6 per cent, or £9,409, was the highest ever seen for the time of year.

The Daily Mail revealed earlier this month that discussions were underway in Whitehall and at the Bank on paring back Help to Buy following warnings of a risk of Britain’s housing market overheating.

Senior Tories dismiss claims of a bubble, pointing out prices remain a long way off their pre-crisis peak in most areas.

But yesterday Mr Carney said it was clear there were ‘deep, deep structural problems’ in the market and it represented the biggest risk to the economic recovery.

‘There are not sufficient houses built in the UK,’ the governor said.

Mr Carney suggested the Bank could adopt a range of measures  including a new ‘affordability test’ for borrowers and advising the Government to rein in Help to Buy

He told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. ‘We could limit amounts of certain types of mortgages that banks could undertake, we could provide advice ... on changing the terms of Help to Buy.’

The scheme guarantees £130billion of mortgages, and is available for loans of between 80 per cent and 95 per cent of the home value. 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg suggested the Government was ready to act, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘If [Carney] says we should pare back on some government schemes like Help to Buy then I think we should do that.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said the governor was ‘absolutely right when he says fundamentally we need to build more houses in Britain.’

He added: ‘Now we have reformed the planning system to simplify it, the building of houses is going up.'
