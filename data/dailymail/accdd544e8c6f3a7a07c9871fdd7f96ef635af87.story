Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has rapped for the first time on a live radio show despite being unable to work because she is depressed.

Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, performed a rap song for shocked listeners live on Free Radio. 

Recently it has been rumoured that the outspoken 44-year-old has been signed by a music label and dreams of becoming a rap star.

SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN TO WHITE DEE RAPPING LIVE ON RADIO

Dee rapped a song to the soundtrack of Eminem's The Real Slim Shady replacing the chorus lyrics with 'My name is not White Dee'.

Dee rapped: 'Yes I'm Dee from Benefits Street, I'm definitely not a benefit cheat.

'There's a rumour I'm going on Big Brother, but I can't confirm it so word to your mother.

'People say I'm a benefit scrounger, I want to spend the days just lying on a lounger.

'But that's not true.'

Dee then broke into laughter and failed to finish the lyrics - joining in with the final chorus before the song ended.

White Dee became the standout star of Benefits Street, the controversial Channel 4 series that came to an end last week.

The mum claims she could make millions from her new-found celebrity status but is determined to stay in the same terraced house.

The single mother-of-two says she is unable to work because she is 'depressed' - but that is not stopping her sizing up a string of lucrative offers.

Her new agent Barry Tomes - dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell' - said: 'She has had loads of offers and can't quite get her head round the figures involved.

'But that's TV - she's got the x-factor, innit.

'She is TV gold and we will make her a lot of money.'

Despite being signed off work sick, White Dee made two live television appearances last week and has also written an article for The Spectator magazine.

However, she said the pressure of being a celebrity has made her even more 'depressed'

She added that she has become such a celebrity that she is unable to walk down the street without being harassed.

The Benefits Street single mother has also had three marriage proposals since appearing on television.

Conservative MP Philip Davies accused White Dee of not being interested in finding a job.

‘If
 the people from Benefits Street are going to make these public 
appearances hopefully they are going to be paid for it so the taxpayer 
can get some of their money back,' he said.

‘I
 think every time people look at White Dee make an appearance hopefully 
it will serve as a reminder to people of the mess the benefits system is
 in and how badly Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms are needed.

Controversy: Critics have questioned whether White Dee is really unable to work. However, mental health charities have said that depression is not always obvious

Television appearance: White Dee was interviewed on This Morning by Eamonn Holes and Ruth Langsford - just two days after she appeared live on Channel 4

‘White Dee is bone idle and doesn’t want to work another day in her life and has no intention of finding a job. She expects the taxpayer to fund her life on benefits.

‘The only person who should be depressed is the taxpayer who has to pick up the bill.’

A spokesman from the Department of Work and Pensions: 'We hope people meet all the conditions of benefit claims and if anyone is concerned about people claiming benefits illegally they should call The National Benefit Fraud Hotline is 0800 854 440 or people can report suspect cases of fraud here: https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/benefitfraud/

The MailOnline has attempted to contact Dee's agent to see if she is still on benefits but he has been unavailable for comment.
