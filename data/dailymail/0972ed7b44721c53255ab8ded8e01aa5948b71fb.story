Angela Merkel has used her New Year's Eve speech to launch an open attack on the City of London as she attempts to win a third term as German Chancellor in 2013.

In a move that will be grasped by British Eurosceptics, Mrs Merkel told Germany that she will repress Europe's biggest financial markets and fight to strengthen the EU's grip on banking.

The Chancellor openly blames the financial collapse of the U.S. economy and light-touch regulation spearheaded by Britain for the Eurozone crisis.

Stand-off: In a direct attack on the City of London, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's largest markets needed to be controlled further to protect the Eurozone

Battle: Mrs Merkel is aiming to win a third term as Chancellor and she believes that Britain and the U.S. are to blame for Europe's financial markets

Throttling financial centres like London would allow her to work towards her dream of a European superstate with almost complete banking and economic union across the continent.

Speech: David Cameron will make a pledge this month to wrestle more powers back from Brussels

'The crisis is a long way from being beaten,' Mrs Merkel said on German television last night.

'Internationally, more needs to be done in order to exercise control 
over the financial markets. The world has not sufficiently learnt the 
lessons of the devastating 2008 financial crisis. Never again can we 
allow irresponsibility like back then to happen. In a social market 
economy, the state is the guardian of order â€” and that is something 
people should be able to count on.'

Germany will have a general election in September and Mrs Merkel wants to win a third term in the Bundeskanzleramt - the German chancellery.

Her relationship with David Cameron is fragile and the Prime Minister is preparing a keynote speech this month where he will demand that more powers are transferred from Brussels back to London.

Financial services, based mainly in the City, make up 10 per cent of the UK economy and Mr Cameron will fight tooth and nail to protect it.

But German has already signed up to a new banking transaction tax being touted by France, however, the UK can opt out.

Even though Merkel's conservative party holds a commanding 10-point lead in opinion polls over the Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left opposition SPD and their Greens allies have a chance of taking power because Merkel's coalition allies, the Free Democrats (FDP) have slumped badly and may not win seats.

The U.S. ambassador to NATO has called on the UK and Europe to up its defence spending as it cannot rely on America any longer.

Ivo Daalder says cash saved after 2014 when all NATO troops leave Afghanistan must be pumped back into military budgets.

He said that the U.S. will be focussing its money elsewhere - particularly in Asia and China.

'If we don't start soon in investing in those capabilities then the gap between the US and the rest is going to grow. If we have problems, they will be even worse,' he said.

The MoD in Britain is privately urging David Cameron to withdraw from Afghanistan early to save more money.

But America says NATO members should put the cash into arms.

But political analysts believe Merkel still has the most options to form a government after the vote.

She could lead a right-left grand coalition with the SPD as she did from 2005 to 2009 or a coalition with the pro-environment Greens party.

In what is viewed as a speech that will kick-start the election race, Merkel urged Germans to be more patient even though the euro zone crisis has already dragged on for three years. She drew a line linking German prosperity to a prosperous European Union.

'For our prosperity and our solidarity we need to strike the right balance,' Merkel said. 'The European sovereign debt crisis shows how important this balance is.

'The reforms that we've introduced are beginning to have an impact,' she said. 'Nevertheless we need to have further continued patience. The crisis is far from over.'

But in face of slowing economic growth, Merkel also warned that conditions could be more difficult in 2013 than in 2012.

'I know that many people are naturally concerned going into the new year,' she said. 'And the economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year. But we shouldn't let that get us down; rather it should spur us on.'
