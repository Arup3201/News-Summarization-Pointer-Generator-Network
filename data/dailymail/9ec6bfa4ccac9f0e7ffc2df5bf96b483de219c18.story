A mayor has been swindled by his own deputy in a cowboy building scam which left him with a £6,000 repair bill.

Civic leader Mike Kennedy, 60, had to pay another builder to fix his leaky roof after town hall colleague Paul Jones failed to complete the work during months of delays.

Father-of-five Jones, who made a string of excuses for delaying the job and then failed to finish it, has now been given years to repay the money he owes Mr Kennedy and another victim.

After Jones admitted fraud by false representation, magistrates ordered the compensation come out of his benefits at a rate of £5-a-week.

Mr Kennedy, mayor of Winsford, Cheshire, hired Jones to stop rainwater getting into his garage after the Labour councillor bragged about his successful construction firm.

But after Mr Kennedy handed over £1,600 towards the work, Jones gave his colleague and another disgruntled customer a string of excuses for delays.

Jones, 36, falsely claimed he was undergoing treatment for testicular cancer, had been been undergoing psychiatric treatment and had lost his building materials in a fire.

When trading standards were called in, it emerged Jones was a penniless bricklayer and did not employ anyone.

The disgraced official, who campaigned against dangerous dogs and fly tipping during his time in office, has since quit as deputy mayor and given up his council seat.

Jones, who has since stepped down from his civic role, was ordered to pay £7,000 to his two victims at a rate of £5-a-week

Mr Kennedy has hit out at the 'two years of lies' spun by Jones

Mr Kennedy, who will get a £4,250 share of the £7,000 compensation Jones was ordered to pay, said: 'I now firmly believe Jones only wanted to be the mayor of the town for his own kudos and self-esteem.

'I cannot believe how anyone on earth could fantasise to the extent he did. The lies he has told in the last two years have been unbelievable. In fact, so unbelievable they were believable.

'Once he came to the council he said he had a building company and had his own business cards and t-shirts. Our garage roof was leaking so I asked him to do it because I thought I could trust him.

'He seemed believable and told us what he would need to do.

'But over the next 18 months every excuse under the sun came out. He was phoning some fictitious person at Dover docks who had supposedly been in touch about rubber for the roof. It allegedly came from Holland.

'He even came to my house phoning someone called Gary who was supposed to be his foreman saying "oh right Gary, I want to make sure nobody gets the new vans filthy", but there weren't any. There was absolutely no work force.'

Jones was 
elected to Winsford Town Council in Cheshire in 2011 and urged 
colleagues and voters to address him as 'Councillor Jones' whenever they
 saw him.

He
 was elected as Deputy Mayor in May 2013 with his wife Kelly acting as 
Deputy Mayoress at the same time Mr Kennedy was elected mayor with his 
wife Hilary, 66, serving as Mayoress.

But
 trouble began when former furniture shop owner Mr Kennedy hired Jones 
in September 2011 and handed over a deposit of £1,400 in cash, with a 
further £200 for 'materials' and payments for his 'workers'.

Jones initially told the mayor he had to meet a man at Dover Docks to retrieve materials being sent from Holland.

He
 also claimed he had just bought two JCBs for his builder's yard so was 
short of money to purchase materials for the job and he was currently 
working on three barn conversions so had little time on his hands.

He
 also claimed he had lost building materials in a fire at the yard of 
his supposed company 'New Images Construction & Build'.

Later Jones placed tarpaulin in the leaking areas - forcing Mr Kennedy to leave buckets on the floor to collect the rainwater.

But Jones repeatedly delayed the work, citing a range of excuses which Mr Kennedy described as 'so unbelievable they were believable'

He
 eventually rang the Kennedys while they were holidaying in Torquay last
 September claiming the work was completed and 'brilliant' but, when they
 got back home, they discovered the roof had not been touched and contacted 
the authorities.

Chester magistrates heard Jones also accepted £730 from another householder, Margaret Kernick, after he promised to undertake guttering work on her home - only to never start the job.

Adam Simpson, prosecuting on behalf of Cheshire West and Chester Trading Standards said: 'Mrs Kernick approached the defendant as a builder and town councillor and asked for a quote and was quoted £730. She paid £300 up front and she believed he would be a trustworthy source.

'In the following weeks he said he had bought the materials and would start soon but made excuses about poor weather for not starting. He went to her house and said he was ill and undergoing tests for testicular cancer.

'He said he wouldn't be able to make money if he was going to hospital so she gave him money to assist. He then texted her saying he would return to start the work. But he did not honour the promise so she went to the town council.

Jones placed plastic sheeting over the leak, which had led to rainwater dripping down into the Kennedys' home

'He later said he was sorry he was messing her around and would come round with a full refund but did nothing.'

Jones, now of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, who is currently on Employment Support Allowance pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation. He resigned from the council citing 'personal reasons' in October last year.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Guy Dodd said his client suffered from depression, bipolar disorder and OCD.

He added: 'The victims approached him in both cases because they knew him in his capacity as a councillor at the time and knew he had previously worked in the building industry.

'He accepts he was never going to be in a fit state to carry out the work. He has been very seriously in debt. It is currently about £40,000 so he is effectively insolvent and considering the option of bankruptcy.'

Jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison, suspended for 12 month and given a 12 month community supervision order. He was made to pay £730 compensation to Mrs Kernick, £4,250 to Cllr Kennedy, £2,295 prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
