The sister of one of the pilots who died on September 11th said that it is outrageous that the military judge is allowing the terror suspects to wear camouflage clothing inside the courtroom.

‘This judge has to grow a backbone,’ Debra Burlingame told MailOnline.

The leeway that the judge granted the accused terrorists comes during the second day of the pretrial decisions in the case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the hijacked plane attacks and his four alleged al Qaeda conspirators.

The request for the different dress code comes as the men want to portray themselves as soldiers during the trial- a move that Ms Burlingame says shows that their intention is to promote their violent cause.

On trial: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed boycotted the pretrial hearings and the judge ruled that the defendants can wear camouflage gear if they want to during the formal trial

‘They are trying to use their situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts American troops in danger,’ she said.

‘If these defendants were members of 
the Klu Klux Klan and they were on trial for killing a black family, for
burning their house, would they be allowed to wear their Klan uniforms 
in court to show their solidarity with their fellow Klan members? 
Absolutely not!

‘These men are guilty of war crimes- you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause.’

The only stipulation that the judge, 
Army Col. James Pohl, made regarding the dress code for the five 
defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be U.S. 
military uniforms.

Hurt: Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the pilots whose plane was hijacked in the 9/11 attacks, calls the leniency on the dress code issue a way for the terror suspects to promote their cause

'I'm sympathetic because he’s under a 
microscope and he wants the proceedings  to be fair and to be perceived 
as fair and legitimate,’ explained Ms Burlingame, who is a former 
attorney,  ‘but he doesn’t have to take it when defence council and the 
defendants go over the line.’

‘It is the judge’s job to insure a 
fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist 
statements from inside an American military courtroom.

‘They are speaking to Islamists 
members of al Qaeda and those who would be ripe for recruitment for 
their cause. They want to portray themselves as soldiers of Allah.’

Mastermind: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has previously claimed responsibility for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that resulted in thousands of deaths

Prosecutors have asked the judge to 
approve what is known as a protective order intended to prevent the 
release of classified information during trial.

Colonel James L. Pohl is the lifetime soldier who is at the heart of the biggest terrorism trial since the September 11th attacks.

Mr Pohl attended Pepperdine University in California for law school, has been a soldier since the 1980s before making the switch to a more legal focus in the early 2000s.

While known to many as the man presiding over the court room in Guantanamo, this is far from his first time in a contentious situation.

Mr Pohl, 61, was appointed to lead the Guantanamo military commission, and first made headlines while serving over several of the cases involving American soldiers who were tried for their role in the Abu Ghraib torture scandal.

He butted heads with President George Bush over the issue of whether or not that prison should be destroyed, with Bush arguing that in favor and Mr Pohl deciding that it could not be razed because it is a crime scene.

From there, he went on to preside over the trial of the Fort Hood shooting in 2009.

Though it happened in 2000, Mr Pohl is still working on the case relating to the suicide attack that left 17 American soldiers dead on board the U.S.S. Cole.

Lawyers for the defendants say the 
rules, as proposed, will make it harder to mount a defense. The American
Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a separate challenge, says the 
restrictions are overly broad and would improperly keep the public from 
hearing the men speak about their captivity.

The U.S. government has acknowledged 
that the defendants were subjected to 'enhanced interrogation 
techniques' before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006, which in 
some cases included the simulated drowning method known as 
waterboarding.

Mohammed and his four co-defendants 
face charges that include terrorism, conspiracy and 2,976 counts of 
murder in violation of the law of war, one count for each known victim 
of the September 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed. They 
could get the death penalty if convicted.

Mohammed was not in court on Tuesday, 
opting to boycott the hearing after dismissing the military tribunal 
with scorn on Monday, saying 'I don't think there is any justice in this
court.'

The defendants who chose with Mohammed
to boycott the hearing were Saudi defendant Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi 
and Pakistani national Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, a nephew of Mohammed. 
Neither provided any reason for their absence but a lawyer for al-Aziz 
Ali had said on Monday that his client's father had recently died and he
was grieving for him.

Those who showed up in court were 
Walid bin Attash, a Yemeni who grew up in Saudi Arabia, and Ramzi 
Binalshibh, another Yemeni who was originally chosen to be one of the 
hijackers but couldn't get a U.S. visa to enter the country.

The judge presiding over the case, 
Army Col. James Pohl, ruled, over the objections of prosecutors, that 
the defendants have the right to be absent from a weeklong pretrial 
hearing in a case considered to be one of the most significant terrorism
cases in U.S. history.

Court: Monday's hearing was more peaceful than previous proceedings have been

The chief prosecutor, Army Brig. Gen. 
Mark Martins, had argued that the rules for the special war-time 
tribunals known as military commissions require the defendants to attend
all sessions of the court.

Prosecutors also said in court papers that their presence was required to ensure that the proceedings are viewed as legitimate.

But lawyers for the men disagreed, and
said the threat that they could be forcibly removed from their cells 
would be psychologically damaging for men who had been brutalized while 
held during their captivity by the CIA in secret overseas prisons, prior
to being taken to Guantanamo in September 2006.

The argument provoked groans from a 
small group of family members of September 11 victims who were chosen by
lottery to come to Guantanamo to view the proceedings. A few other 
families watched the proceedings on closed-circuit TV from U.S. military
bases in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.

In the end, the judge ruled that the 
defendants didn't have to attend the rest of the weeklong session, which
was called to hear arguments on 25 pretrial motions on preliminary 
legal issues. He reserved the right to require their attendance at 
future hearings and said they would have to attend the actual trial.
