Team news

Chelsea

Chelsea have no fresh injury problems ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League match against Leicester at Stamford Bridge.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could again be selected ahead of veteran Petr Cech.

Eye on a return: Didier Drogba is fit and available for Chelsea ahead of a second Stamford Bridge debut

Striker Didier Drogba shrugged of an ankle problem to make a late substitute appearance in the 3-1 win at Burnley on Monday night, and is in line to make his competitive return to the Bridge in Chelsea colours having rejoined the club in the summer.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar, Matic, Schurrle, Costa, Cech, Luis, Torres, Zouma, Drogba, Mikel, Willian.

Leicester

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson hopes Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton could be fit for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Chelsea.

Striker Vardy (thigh) and winger Albrighton (groin) may return for the Stamford Bridge clash, which will come too soon for Danny Drinkwater (hamstring) and Matty James (shin).

On the mend: Jamie Vardy could return from a thigh injury to make his Premier League debut at Chelsea 

Summer signing Matthew Upson (foot) is still a couple of weeks short of a return.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Chelsea won four Premier League games in a row against Leicester before the Foxes were relegated in 2004.

The Foxes have only ever won one of eight Premier League trips to Stamford Bridge (W1 D2 L5).

Chelsea are top of the Premier League after the first matchday. None of the previous three instances (1999, 2008, 2010) have seen them go on to win the title.

Chelsea have kept seven clean sheets in their last eight Premier League games at Stamford Bridge.

There was that one time... Stan Collymore scores past Chelsea keeper Carlo Cudicini during the Foxes' only Premier League win at Stamford Bridge in a 2-0 victory back in September 2000

But Chelsea won neither of their final two Premier League home games in 2013-14 (D1 L1).

Only once has Jose Mourinho gone three Premier League home games without a win (April-May 2007).

Cesc Fabregas has assisted 50 goals in his last 104 Premier League appearances.

Fabregas assisted only one goal and failed to score in six Premier League appearances at Stamford Bridge for Arsenal.

Leicester won 14 of their 23 away games in the Championship last season, three more than any other side.

The Foxes’ last away defeat in the league came last December v Brighton.
