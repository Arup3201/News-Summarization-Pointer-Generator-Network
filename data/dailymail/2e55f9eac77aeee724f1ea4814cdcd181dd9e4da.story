A young woman who said she couldn't find a space in her office car park left her £90,000 Maserati Granturismo in the middle of the road, causing a scene in the south western Chinese city of Chongqing.

When the 22-year-old graduate intern was told that her thoughtless parking had angered local people, she replied saying they must simply be envious of her car.

Xiao Xu told officers that she had parked there because the garage in her workplace was full, and said she'd copied several other cars which had been parked down the middle of the road, though she could not explain where they had gone to.

A recent graduate, she told the police she had left the car in the middle of the busy road while she went to work in an institution nearby.

Miss Xu, who said the Maserati was her grandmother's and she was just borrowing it, was given a ticket by traffic officers for flouting traffic regulations.

Local resident Xing Wao, 21, told sinopathic.com: 'The person who parked this car must come from a family of money and affluence and are used to getting their own way. Whatever rule or law won’t be acknowledged by them.'
