This profile photo on the Ryan Cochran Escort Service website reportedly matches the profile photograph on a LinkedIn account purporting to be Samuel See's

The mystery around a 34-year-old Yale University professor found dead in his prison cell has deepened, with claims he had profiles on at least four male escort websites.

Samuel See died on Sunday morning at the Union Avenue detention facility in Connecticut just hours after he was arrested following a domestic dispute with his estranged husband.

New Haven Independent reported See, who was on leave from Yale, did not hang himself and showed no signs of committing suicide.

Days after his tragic death, it has emerged that See's personal details were posted on various escort websites.

New Haven Register  reported website Ryan Cochran Escort Services includes See's phone number which was listed on an order of protection filed against him in September.

A profile photo on the same site allegedly also matches See's profile photograph on a LinkedIn account.

The website lists Cochran’s home city as New Haven.

A Facebook page with pictures resembling See and listed under the name Ryan Cochran includes See’s home address.

The website contains a cache of sexually explicit pictures.

News of See's death has rocked the tight-knit Ivy League university community, where See was considered a rising star.

Sudden death: The English professor was found unresponsive in a cell at the Union Avenue Detention Facility in New Haven in November last year

The educator was arrested at his home about 5pm Saturday 
after See's sister called police, NBC Connecticut reported. 

According
 to detectives, See's estranged husband, 32-year-old Sunder Ganglani, 
had dropped in to pick up his belongings and stayed there for 
more than two hours in violation of an order of protection.

When See asked police to remove his spouse from his residence, officers told him that Ganglani also had an order of protection against
 him.

Police said See then 'became enraged,' yelling that he should not be arrested because it was his house.

See allegedly put up a fight as the officers tried to handcuff him.

As
 he was being led to the police cruiser waiting outside, See allegedly screamed at one of the cops: 'I will kill you... I will destroy 
you.’

Ganglani was also arrested.

See was taken to a hospital to be treated for a cut above his eye.

He was taken to the Union Avenue facility about 9pm and charged with 
violating a protective order, interfering with police and threatening.

See was found dead about 5am the next morning.

The chief state medical examiner’s office has yet to determine the cause of death, New Haven Register reported.

The young educator had previously had run-ins with police.

On September 18, See and Ganglani - who married in May after meeting at Yale - were 
arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace and third-degree assault, 
in what court records indicate was a domestic dispute.

The two were 
issued orders of protection by the court, ordering the couple to avoid 
close contact.

See, who obtained his PhD from
 UCLA in 2009, was an assistant professor of English and American 
studies at Yale.  His work centered around themes of sexual orientation in modern literature.

‘The University community is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Samuel See. Our condolences go out to his family, faculty colleagues, and students, and his friends at Yale and elsewhere,’ the administration of Yale said in a statement.
