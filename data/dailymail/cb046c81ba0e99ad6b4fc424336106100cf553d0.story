Almost two years on from the horrific shooting that left her fighting for her life, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is moving back to Tuscon, Arizona in a new milestone in her recovery.

Her husband Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, announced on Twitter yesterday they were moving back to Tuscon, the city where the shooting occurred, after living in Houston, Texas for the past 18 months.

The former Arizona Democratic representative, 42, was shot in the head by gunman Jared Lee Loughner in January last year while meeting constituents at a Tucson shopping center. She survived but was forced to resign from her political career to focus on her recovery.

Moving back: Former US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is moving back to Tuscon with husband Mark Kelly 18 months after she was shot in the head by a crazed gunman

On Twitter, Mr Kelly wrote: ‘Moving back to Tucson today. Gabby has been waiting for this day for a long time.’

Loughner shot dead six people, including nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, and wounded 13 others at a Safeway supermarket, including Giffords.

Tweeted the news: Mr Kelly used the microblogging site to announce the couple's move back to Tuscon from Hudson, Texas on Sunday

Then and now: Giffords, left before the shooting, is still undergoing intensive treatment and still suffers a speech impairment after she was seriously injured, right after the incident in June last year

Giffords was released from a Houston hospital in June last year but remained in Houston where her husband was based at the Johnson Space Centre.

While she continues to have intensive therapy and her speech is impaired, Giffords has made several public appearances since the incident, most recently going overseas for the first time since she was shot in the head to go hiking in the French Alps.

Sentenced for shooting: Jared Lee Loughner will spend life behind bars for the shooting which killed six and wounded 13, including Giffords

Loughner was sentenced to life in prison
last Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to 19 counts, including attempted 
assassination of a member of Congress and murder and attempted murder of
federal employees.

The court heard that he had expressed
remorse and even cried after finding out a child had died in the 
massacre, his forensic psychologist Dr Christina Pietz said he was 
shocked when he found out Giffords had survived. 

He told her he was disappointed that he failed to kill her and said: 'Jared is a failure.'

Dr Pietz said he had showed 
understanding of his actions and felt guilty about what he had done 
after he had been taking medication for a time.

Judge Burns said: 'My personal observations of him leave no questions in my mind that Loughner knows what's going on today.'

First time overseas since shooting: Giffords went hiking with Mr Kelly near Mont-Blanc in Chamonix in July
