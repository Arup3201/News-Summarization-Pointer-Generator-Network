When it launched Apple Pay in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would rollout to other regions.

But now a job listing may have inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa. 

The listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement.

The job listing revealed Apple is looking to hire an Apple Pay Intern to help expand the service across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. However, a precise rollout schedule was not included. The listing has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or the firm wasn't ready to make the announcement

Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.  

Apple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September.

The service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country. 

Visa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given. 

This latest job listing bolster's Mr Sousa's comments Apple Pay may launch in the region within months.

Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers.

It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.

This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card.

All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.

If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service.

Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US.

Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK next year.  

According to the listing: 'Apple Pay is a new and exciting area that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. 

'The new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of this technology by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe.'

in particular, Apple is said to be looking for an intern to handle non-disclosure agreements and contracts with these partners.

There was a related listing, posted in China, for an Apple Pay Site Reliability Engineer.

However, the rollout may be a gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks.

The ministers recently recommended new rules for mobile payments.

EU legislators said that any payment service must have 'strong customer authentication', and licences may be required for individual states.

The rollout may also be brought forward following the news earlier this week that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. 

Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones.

Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely.

LoopPay calls itself a ‘wallet solution’ that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets ‘virtually everywhere’.

It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. 

The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. 

These can be used to pay for shopping in 90% of shops and banks in the US.

Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.

The sources revealed that Samsung is already in talks with the Massachusetts-based provider, and prototypes have been created, but there is no word on when the service will launch - if at all.

If the firms do partner up, LoopPay’s technology could be built into future models of Samsung devices, including phones, tablets and smartwatches.

Samsung has previously partnered with the likes of Barclaycard and China's UnionPay, among others, to offer NFC-enabled mobile payment services (Samsung graphic illustrated) to select customers. But its deal with LoopPay would make these services more widely available
