Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King has been seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant.

The little boy was pictured clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image shared by his older brother Naveed. 

He said his little brother was 'recuperating nicely' as he enters the final week of his proton beam therapy in Prague.

Ashya has already undergone several rounds of the treatment, with the thirtieth and last of the sessions set to take place on October 24.

He was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of July and after several operations was set to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital.

But his parents were concerned that this would leave him in a semi-vegetative state and fled the hospital with their son in September. Instead, the pair wanted to have the boy treated with proton beam therapy in Prague.

When the NHS said it would not fund the treatment, they fled to Spain where they planned to sell a house before travelling on to Prague.

However, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant after discovering the family had left hospital in the UK and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain.

Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him.

The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before international outcry - including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led to the order to release them.

Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and in an usual move the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26.

His 20-year-old brother revealed that Ashya, who has to be fed through a drip, had even managed to eat a small amount on his own while on the trip to the pizza restaurant. 

Jana Kulhankova, of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following his last round of proton beam therapy.

'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said.

He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added.

His father, Brett King, said the family are now considering the next step of his treatment which could see them head to Spain.

He said: 'Now Ashya has started his proton beam therapy, we need to be thinking about what comes next.

'He still cannot move on his own and he can't talk properly either so we need to think about physiotherapy and occupational therapy for him.

'We have got a doctor who works in Madrid coming to see us soon so he can assess Ashya and his condition. But he will definitely need ongoing treatment in a hospital so we won't be coming home for a while.' 

He added that Ashya still needs to be fed through a tube and they are still working out the best way to get him to the hospital in Spain.

'Once we meet the doctor, we will have a better idea of what lies ahead,' he said.

Last week it was revealed that the charity which received £50,000 in donations to fund specialist brain tumour treatment for the five-year-old has refused to hand over the cash.

Kids n Cancer collected donations of around £50,000 from people supporting the plight of Ashya. 

The charity says the money was donated for the  proton beam therapy to treat Ashya's tumour. However it said as the NHS had now decided to fund the therapy, the cash will be spent on other children who need treatment.

Ashya's older brother Naveed claimed Kids n Cancer have labelled his family 'greedy', and said the charity had never given them money and was refusing to help them cover legal costs. 

The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims. It said Kids n Cancer exists to fund proton beam therapy to help children and their families, and insisted it had not suggested that legal costs would or could be covered by donations.
