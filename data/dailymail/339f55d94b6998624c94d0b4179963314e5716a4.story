Stoke City are poised to sign Chelsea winger Victor Moses on a season-long loan.

The deal looks set to finish Stoke's summer-long interest in Liverpool's Oussama Assaidi and the pursuit of Norwich's Nathan Redmond.

Moses is to undergo medical to complete the formalities of his move to Stoke but won't be available for Saturday's game against Aston Villa.

Pot luck: Victor Moses is headed for another loan spell, this time with Stoke City

In the Red: Nigeria international spent an unsuccessful loan with Liverpool last season

The 23 year-old Nigerian, who will be Stoke's sixth summer signing, had an inauspicious spell on loan at Liverpool last season and has fallen down the pecking order at Chelsea since Jose Mourinho returned last summer.

Meanwhile, Stoke midfielder Steve Sidwell has backed Bojan Krkic to light up the Premier League this season. 

The 23-year-old, widely regarded just a few years ago as one of the most exciting prospects in European football, signed for Stoke this summer from Barcelona in a £1million deal.

Rejuvenated? Bojan Krkic has been tipped to take the Premier League by storm, claims Steve Sidwell

Sidwell told Talksport: 'Bojan has looked very impressive and very sharp during pre-season, and he’s scored some goals as well.

'But it’s what you expect when you look at the teams he has played for, especially his education at Barcelona.

'He’s a great prospect for us, he’s an exciting player and I’m looking forward to seeing him in action when the season begins.'
