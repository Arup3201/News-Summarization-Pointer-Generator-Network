Deer hunters have stumbled across three skeletons in the remote mountains of eastern Oklahoma that are believed to be the remains of a family that has been missing since 2009.

Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison vanished four years ago with their 6-year-old daughter Madyson while looking to buy mountain property in Latimer County, Oklahoma.

After their disappearance in October 2009, a family pastor said the Jamisons had been involved in witchcraft. The Latimer County sheriff said he suspected they could have gotten into the drug trade. 

The remains were discovered Saturday in a hard-to-reach part of the Sansbois Mountains near Kinta, Oklahoma - about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City, the Oklahoman newspaper reports.

Mystery: Sherilyn Jamison and daughter Madyson, 6, (pictured) vanished, along with father Bobby Jamison in October 2009

Strange behavior: Friends and family members noticed a change in Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison's behavior before they vanished. They lost weight and were seen wandering around their home as if in a trance

Mystery: This is the Jamisons' pickup truck, which was found abandoned in the mountains eight days after the family was last seen

Medical examiners have not confirmed the identities of the victims, though the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation believes the remains likely belong to the Jamison family.

The discovery was made not far from where the family's pickup truck was found in 2009 - eight days after they were last seen alive.

Investigators found Mrs Jamison's purse, Mr Jamison's wallet, a cell phone, a GPS unit, a bank bag stuffed with $32,000 cash and the family dog - barely alive - in the cab of the truck at the time.

The State Bureau of Investigation has not said whether there is any apparent trauma to the remains that would indicate what killed the family.

The Jamison's disappearance unearthed a raft of strange behavior that friends and neighbors had teen the family exhibit.

Remote: The skeletons were found in a remote area of the mountains in rural Oklahoma, about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City

Missing: Authorities at the time were especially fearful for little Madyson's safety - prompting a massive search effort with hundreds of volunteers. The family was never found

They lived in Eufaula, but had been looking to buy property 35 miles away in the mountains.

At their home, investigators found a shipping container that had bizarre messages scrawled across it, including '3 cats killed to date buy people in this area … Witches don’t like there black cat killed' (sic).

Their pastor, Gary Brandon, told detectives that the family had been involved in 'spiritual warfare.' Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had told him they had seen spirits at their Eufaula home.

Mrs Jamison said the spirits of a long-dead family lived with them and that their daughter Madyson spoke with the youngest spirit.

At one point, Mr Jamison asked his pastor whether he could obtain 'special bullets' to shoot the spirits.

He later said he had consulted the 'satanic Bible' to find a cure to the spirits.

Witchcraft: Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had talked about seeing 'spirits' at their home prior to their disappearance

Friends reported that the family had begun acting strangely and that both Mr and Mrs Jamison had lost a large amount of weight before they disappeared.

The sheriff at the time concluded that the family had likely become involved in drugs - though no evidence of this was ever found.

After they disappeared, a massive search effort was mobilized that included hundreds of volunteers, troopers from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol and agents from both the FBI and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

Searchers combed the area on foot, on ATV and on horseback, but found nothing.

Sixteen teams of dogs fanned out, but found nothing.

Current Sheriff Jesse James said that the location of the skeletons could have been missed by rescuers are the family's bodies could have been covered in leaves that had fallen from the tree.
