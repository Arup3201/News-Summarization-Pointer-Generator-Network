Paula Deen's sons may have done more harm than good this morning when they said that the racial slur scandal against their celebrity chef mom 'began as extortion and it has become character assassination'.

Now former employee Lisa Jackson, who was suing Paula for discrimination and sexual harassment, is now adding another lawsuit to the mix by threatening to sue Bobby Deen for slander.

'What Bobby said was slanderous and libelous because he has accused Lisa of a crime,' a source close to Jackson told Radar.

'It also constitutes retaliation against someone who has filed an an employment discrimination lawsuit, under the Supreme Court’s Section 1981.

'Her recourse is to now sue Bobby personally.'

Sticking by mom: Jamie (left) and Bobby Deen (right) spoke out in support of their famous mother

Bobby and Jamie Deen, both of whom are
TV chefs in their own right, spoke out about how their mother is being 
falsely portrayed as a racist after she admitted during a discrimination
lawsuit that she has repeatedly used the n-word.

'Our
mother was under oath asked in a deposition to pour over her entire 
life and to admit whether or not she had ever heard or used this word 
and it broke her heart to have to answer truthfully and say, yes that 
she had,' Bobby Deen said during an interview with CNN.

The joint appearance was the first formal statement made by any member of the family this week following the two video statements that Deen released on Friday.

She was initially scheduled to be interviewed on The Today Show but failed to show up, and now she is expected to appear tomorrow morning.

She has apologized about the claims that she used the n-word and wanted to hire an all-black waitstaff for her brother's wedding but feared the PR-repercussions.

'The important thing here is for people to know that that is not her heart, it is certainly not the home that we were raised in,' Bobby Deen said on CNN.

'We were raised in a family with love and
of faith and a house where God lived. And neither one of our parents 
ever taught us to be bigoted towards any other person for any reason and
this is so saddening to me because our mother is one of the most 
compassionate, good hearted, empathetic people that you’d ever meet. And
these accusations are very hurtful to her and it’s very sad.'

His older brother Jamie also leapt to her defense.

'This is ridiculous. It’s completely absurd to think there is an environment of racism in our business and it's really disrespectful to the people we work with,' he said Tuesday morning. 

'We have strong educated men and women of character that have been with us for 5, 10, 15, 20 years. To think they would allow themselves to be in this position is simply baloney. It's ridiculous.'

'It was a different time when my mother was growing up. There's been leaps and bounds generationally that has helped, you know, the chasm that we have of racism in this country.'

Their appearance comes just hours after the latest sponsor- Smithfield, a meat producer- cancelled their partnership with Paula Deen.

Explaining her side: Deen was supposed to appear on the Today Show on Friday (seen here at a different appearance in January) but she did not show up and rescheduled for Wednesday

'Bobby and I are here today not to stem the tide for endorsements or any of those things. We're here to speak out for our mother's character and to say that our mother is a truly wonderful people that is inclusive of all people and spends a lot of her time and energies to help those people that are challenged,' Jamie said on the morning show.

He went on to say that the millions that the Deen empire has raked has helped them to donate to non-profits and ‘to do good things in our life and the power we've been given through our media career’.

Their mother is scheduled to make an appearance on The Today Show Wednesday morning, after she failed to show up for her original appearance on Friday.
