Death by firing squad for a British grandmother now seems certain after Indonesia today revealed two Australian men will be among the next group of death row inmates to be executed. 

Lindsay Sandiford, 57, from Cheltenham, has been languishing on death row in Bali since being convicted of attempting to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine through the island's airport in 2012.

She maintains she was forced to transport the drugs to protect her children, whose safety was at stake.

Death by firing squad for British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57, (pictured) now seems inevitable 

Ms Sandiford has been languishing on death row since being convicted of drugs smuggling in 2012

She has written a desperate letter to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who will visit Indonesia this month

Since her arrest, she has been holed up in the squalid Kerobokan prison in Bali. 

She claims to have received little or no help from the Foreign Office since then and fears the Indonesian authorities might construe that as a lack of commitment by the government to her cause.

Revelations of an affair between fellow inmate Julian Ponder - nicknamed Bali's Mr Big - and Alys Harahap, Britain's top diplomat in Bali have also handicapped her efforts to evade the firing squad. 

Ms Harahap stopped her visits to Kerobokan prison after the affair was exposed, meaning Ms Sandiford may have been denied the full diplomatic support to which she is entitled. 

Ms Sandiford has now written a desperate letter to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is due to visit Indonesia this month. 

She has pleaded for funding to pay for a lawyer in the hope of escaping the firing squad - but today's grim news that two Australians will be among the next to die has dramatically weakened her hopes.

Indonesia's Attorney-General H.H.Prasetyo confirmed today that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, condemned ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling group, will die with other condemned prisoners soon. 

It was not clear when exactly the executions will take place. Appeals for clemency have already been rejected.

The pair will face execution together for their plot to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin in to Australia.  

Mr Prasetyo told a press conference today: 'We have heard that many Australians support the execution and it is one of the things that pushes us to feel we are not making a mistake.'

Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran, who have been on death row since 2006, have filed an application for a second judicial review. 

Mr Prasetyo said he had heard this focused on the men's rehabilitation in prison, but said this did not constitute new evidence. 

If the execution goes ahead, Sandiford would be transferred to a maximum security jail on Nusa Kambangan

There are seven prisons located on Bali's execution island, which is situated off Java Island

The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia

If her execution goes ahead, Sandiford would be transferred from Bali to a maximum security jail on Nusa Kambangan, off Java Island, for up 72 hours before facing the firing squad. 

The island is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.

The last round of executions took place shortly after midnight.

Executions are carried out by 12-man firing squads – only a proportion of whom are given live bullets.

In their last 72 hours, prisoners are granted final requests and allowed to spend time with family and friends as they see out their last hours in isolation cells.

Prisoners are offered blindfolds to wear and are given the choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from between five and 10 metres.

The Foreign Office said it stood 'ready to provide support at this difficult time, if requested'.  

It said it had consistently provided and offered consular support to Ms Sandiford, which she currently declined to accept.

'We are closely following Lindsay Sandiford's case in Indonesia. We stand ready to provide support at this difficult time, if it is requested,' said a spokesman in the British embassy in the Indonesian capital Jakarta.

'The UK strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances without exception. We have made representations about the death penalty to the Indonesian government, and we will continue to do so.'  

Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world. It ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013.

Last month, Indonesia executed convicts from Malawi, Nigeria, Vietnam, Brazil and the Netherlands as well as one from Indonesia.
