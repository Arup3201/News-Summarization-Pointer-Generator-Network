Security firm G4S repeatedly assured ministers that they would 'overshoot' their targets for recruiting Olympics security staff, the Home Secretary said today.

Theresa May said the under-fire firm continually assured ministers that they would be able to recruit enough private security guards for the Games.

But she added they had not 'deliberately deceived' the Government, telling MPs that the firm made clear that the problem with 'workforce supply and scheduling' only emerged 'over the last couple of weeks'.

G4S only admitted they would fall short last week, when an extra 3,500 troops were called in. Officers from nine forces will now join them to fill the shortfall.

Assurances: Theresa May tells MPs  that G4S repeatedly told ministers that they would 'overshoot' their recruitment targets

Attack: Mrs May was forced to answer an urgent question submitted by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper

Labour’s former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said the decision to send in the troops was taken 'ludicrously last minute' and Tory MP Julian Lewis said G4S should have recruited more veterans to police the Olympics in the first place.

The Home Secretary was being grilled in the Commons after Speaker John Bercow approved the request for an urgent question by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, following claims that the Home Office was warned about security problems at the Olympics ten months ago.

Mrs May told MPs: 'G4S repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their target.

'G4S only told the Government that they would be unable to meet their contractual arrangements last Wednesday and we took immediate action.'

G4S, which has seen its shares dive by as much as 10 per cent following the Games security debacle, said venue security was being tightened 'before the full complement of accredited staff have been assigned'.

'This situation is being rectified over the coming days, which should lead to the withdrawal of police officers from those roles assigned to private security,' a G4S spokesman said.

Today's Commons question came after a 
report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary highlighted a 
number of issues that needed to be addressed.

But
 it was only last week that the Home Secretary told Parliament that 
3,500 extra troops were being drafted in because private security firm 
G4S could not deliver the promised number of guards.

As
 the row escalated, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt defended G4S and the 
company’s boss said he may have to quit over the fiasco.

Call up: Extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in Olympics security caused by blundering private firm G4S

Mr Hunt insisted it was ‘completely 
normal’ for contractors to fail to meet their commitments on major 
projects such as the Olympics.

He insisted the firm had been ‘quite honourable’ and dismissed the problem as a ‘hitch’ which has now been dealt with.

There are now claims that a further 2,400 troops - the equivalent of three battalions - will have to be drafted in to secure the Games which open in just under a fortnight.

It emerged today that the extra police will also have to be called on.

Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison,
 the National Olympic Security Co-ordinator, said: 'Nine venue forces 
have now deployed police officers to support security regimes at venues 
in their areas.'

The forces involved are Dorset, 
Surrey, Hertfordshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Strathclyde, West 
Midlands, Thames Valley and Greater Manchester.

Mr Allison went on: 'Whilst some of 
the activity police officers are undertaking was not anticipated, plans 
were put in place to allow us to do this.

'Forces are making sure they make the
 best use of their resources locally to do all they can to minimise the 
impact on local policing.'

Shambolic: G4S Nick Buckles (above) was also under intense pressure to explain why he only learned 'eight or nine days ago' that his company was struggling to find the 10,000 staff it was contracted to provide for the Olympic Games

But West Midlands Police Federation chairman Ian Edwards said it was 'chaos, absolute chaos'.

The force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in Warwickshire where footballers are staying, he said.

'The worst-case scenario is that we 
end up having to find another 200 officers for the security at the City 
of Coventry stadium, and we've yet to find out what the shortfall is in 
Birmingham. It's chaos, absolute chaos.

'You shouldn't lose your local police
 officer because of the Olympics. Communities are suffering because a 
private company has failed to deliver on a contract.'

Mr Hunt refused to rule out the 
prospect and told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘G4S have been quite 
honourable. They have put their hands up.

‘The chief executive has said they got
 it wrong, they have apologised, they are going to cover all the costs, 
he has apologised to the troops who are going to be drafted in at the 
last moment.

‘I think it is completely normal that 
you are going to find some contractors on a project of this size who 
aren’t able to deliver what they promised.’

Mr Hunt denied that ministers had 
failed to supervise the contract properly, insisting they had received 
repeated assurances from G4S that it was on course to meet its 
commitment to provide 10,000 guards for the Games.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe also said security would not be compromised by G4S.

He told the BBC: ‘This actually wasn’t about supply, they [G4S] have been interviewing about 100,000 people.

‘The reality is, and I cannot put this
 any more simply, when they expected people to materialise they simply 
didn’t. That is why we moved quickly to stem that gap.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government had been monitoring potential Olympic problems since it took power.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
added: 'It is being sorted out, it will be sorted out and we will 
deliver a secure Olympic Games.'

Olympics minister Hugh Robertson 
said: 'In terms of the security numbers, I am as confident as I can be 
at this stage that the problems identified last week and the plans 
brought forward very quickly to deal with it will result in the delivery
 of secure and safe Games.'

A confidential report by HM 
Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) warned about concerns over security 
10 months ago, leading Games organisers Locog to increase the number of 
security guards to be supplied by G4S from 2,000 to 10,400 while the 
value of the contract more than trebled from £86 million to £284 
million.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
appeared to reject calls for soldiers to receive a £500 bonus for 
helping during the Games, in line with those to London bus and tube 
staff.

He said: ‘The Armed Forces is a 
contingent organisation. People who join it expect to be asked at short 
notice to do tasks that they have not necessarily envisaged doing.’

Mr Hammond was confronted with the 
comments of an anonymous commanding officer on Radio 4’s The World This 
Weekend who said he was angry that he had to tell his men they would be 
deployed at the Games, just months after having to tell them that many 
of them could be made redundant.

The officer said: ‘They will be in 
camps without proper washing facilities. Will we ever see a real 
strategy for the Armed Forces, rather than cost-cutting dressed up as 
strategy?

‘Our people deserve more than hollow platitudes.

Mr Hammond will also be responding to
 scheduled MPs' questions this afternoon, when he is expected to deal 
with some of the implications for the troops involved - such as the 
potential for awarding them a special medal and ensuring they do not 
lose out on leave.

Asked about reports that personnel who
 had not taken out holiday insurance could lose out financially, the 
spokesman said: 'We are very keen to ensure that absolutely no-one loses
 out as a result of this.

'G4S have made clear that they will meet the costs associated with that extra deployment of troops.'

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman claimed ministers had been ‘dangerously incompetent’ over Games security.

G4S’s £830,000-a-year boss Nick 
Buckles admitted he may be forced to quit in the wake of the fiasco 
which could cost the company up to £50million.

He said: ‘It’s a big setback for us, we are really disappointed with how this has turned out.’
