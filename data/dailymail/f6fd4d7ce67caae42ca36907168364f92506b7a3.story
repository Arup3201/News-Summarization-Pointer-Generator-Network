It isn't often that you hear the words boutique and bargain in the same sentence, however one high street store is determined to make the two work together. 

Boohoo, the budget high street clothing retailer have just launched their latest Boutique Collection promising to provide the latest fashion without the lucrative price tag. 

Returning for its eighth season, the Boutique collection from boohoo for AW14 is the ultimate in 1970s nostalgia. 

Fast fashion: Boohoo Boutique returns for its eighth season offering high fashion for a low price

Taking inspiration from folklore, the line presents a feminine yet relaxed silhouette. The tailored pieces with embellishment aim to tie together day and night time dressing so that women can cut out the middle man and head straight from the office to dinner. 

Paisley prints and jewel tones give the collection an autumnal feel and maxi dresses can be dressed up with a leather jacket to make them practical enough for the colder season.

Folksy: This season has a festival vibe taking inspiration from folklore

From desk to dancefloor: The collection features silk feel pieces and sequin embellishment making it perfect to go from day to night

The festival feel continues right across the collection with soft kimonos and pyjama coordinates creating a refreshing alternative to party wear.

Despite the low price of the pieces, the line includes several show-stopping pieces such as beaded flapper dresses, faux fur stoles and wide leg silk feel trousers. 

You won't be scrimping to afford the collection and yet Boohoo have not scrimped on details either. 

There's a surprising attention to detail with scalloped edging and sequins giving the range an expensive feel.

Mature style: Boohoo says that the collection is for the grown-up customer 

As well as exciting party pieces, the collection will include some wardrobe staples that we can't go without such as tuxedos, with cape jackets and culottes adding a bohemian feel to work wear.

A spokesperson from the brand says that this collection promises to be as wearable and accessible as their previous seven seasons but this time it has a more mature feel.

'An ultimately bohemian take on autumn, the range continues in the same vein as our previous offerings, with exclusive product, luxe fabrics and high quality finishes. 

'With prices starting from £20, it is ideal for the boohoo girl grown-up.'

The collection launches on site from 29 September on Boohoo.com.
