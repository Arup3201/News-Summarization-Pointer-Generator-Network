WNBA legend Chamique Holdsclaw - one of the greatest female basketball players ever - has been arrested after allegedly getting involved in a car chase with her ex-girfriend and then bashing her former lover's vehicle with a baseball bat before shooting it.

Holdsclaw, 35, who won Olympic gold in 2000 has been charged with aggravated assault, criminal damage to property and reckless conduct for her aggressive attack on 29-year-old Jennifer Lacy's Range Rover after handing herself in to Atlanta police this afternoon.

The retired basketball legend is currently being held on $10,000 bail for the assault and police have said that they believe Holdsclaw may have poured gasoline into the car before the attack and was trying to shoot into the car to start a bigger fire.

'She's mentally unstable,' said unidentified friend of Lacy in a 911 call. 'She did this in front of us and she's been threatening me and my best friend and I don't know why'

Lacy, who told police that she was Holdsclaw's former girlfriend said that she was working out at a church on Atlanta's Ponce de Leon Avenue on Tuesday when Holdsclaw came up to her and said she wanted to return some items.

According to the incident report obtained by Channel 2 Action News, it was when Lacy drove away from the church that she noticed the smell of gasoline inside her car and realised that Holdsclaw was following her.

'Well, after she used the baseball bat, the victim stated that she then pulled the firearm out and pointed the gun inside the car and fired a round,' Lt. Jeff Cantin of the Atlanta Police Department said. to WSBTV.Com

In her autobiography, 'Breaking Through: Beating The Odds Shot After Shot', Holdsclaw describes growing up in poverty in Queens, New York and her battle with depression early in her career.

After her grandmother and caretaker June died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 2002, Holdsclaw entered therapy but her depression continued to be a problem, even leading her to a suicide attempt.

She currently acts as a spokesman for Active Minds, an organisation 'dedicated to empowering students to speak openly about mental health in order to educate others and increase help seeking,' according to the group's website.
