John Anthony Fox was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to his bull dog. He claimed he was 'play fighting' with the dog

A yob ferociously punched his pet bulldog in the head before kicking the animal in the stomach claiming he was 'play fighting'.

John Anthony Fox, of Gorton, claims the RSPCA wants to 'get at him' by taking his 'special dogs'  Diego and Kiara away from him.

The 31-year-old was found guilty in his absence of causing unnecessary suffering to one dog while failing to meet the needs of another, at Manchester Magistrates' Court today.

When Fox visited the housing offices of Eastland Homes in Openshaw, staff witnessed him punching and kicking his American bulldog in an 'aggressive and ferocious manner'.

Anna McDonald, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said a Staffie puppy also owned by Fox, was later found to be suffering from an untreated skin condition.

She told the court Fox took Diego, an adult bulldog and Kiara, a Staffie puppy to the offices.

When Diego began sniffing Kiara, Fox punched him on the head and shouted at him to move away, causing the dog to cower from him.

Fox then punched the side of Diego's head again, while complaining he 'could not control him'.

He was asked by staff to take the dogs outside, where he hit Diego in the stomach and kicked his back end as he left, leaving the 'shocked and sickened' staff to call the RSPCA.

On a visit to Fox's house, RSPCA officer Vicki McDonald found the two dogs and took them to be examined.

A vet found Diego to be in good condition but puppy Kiara had a skin condition on her back legs and tail which had not been treated.

He said it had probably been there a number of weeks. He found Diego to be of a nice temperament.

In interview, Fox denied punching and kicking his dogs.

He was found guilty in his absence of 
causing unnecessary suffering to a white American bulldog and failing 
to meet the needs of a white female Staffordshire bull terrier.

Speaking at his Gorton home after the 
hearing, Fox said he didn't know he had been found guilty, hadn't 
received the summons to court, and said he couldn't read.

He said: 'I love my dogs. I would never hurt them. It was just play fighting with that dog, I've done nothing wrong.

'This isn't right. I was using medicine on the rash on Kiara and she was getting better.

'I have fish too and I keep my tanks in impeccable condition."

He said he had paid £2,500 for Diego, who was imported from America, while Kiara was given to him.

He added: 'People are just jealous because these are special dogs.

'That's why they want them to be taken off me, to get at me - they are just trying to get at me.

'They need to spend a week with me and see how I treat my dogs. I want them back.'

The case was adjourned and Fox will be sentenced at a later date.
