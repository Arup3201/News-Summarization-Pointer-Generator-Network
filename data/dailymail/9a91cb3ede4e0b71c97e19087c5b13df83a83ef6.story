Google is rumoured to be working on a way to help people shop without ever leaving the search engine. 

Reports in the Wall Street Journal claim a Google 'Buy' button would work in a similar way to Amazon's 1-Click ordering service.

The tech giant wouldn't be responsible for selling or shipping the items directly, though. Instead, it is likely to work with manufacturers to simply offer a faster payment option.

At the moment, Google's search results and Shopping tab find items for sale and then send the customer to that merchant's website to complete the purchase. 

Under the rumoured plans, if a customer wants to buy an item without looking at it on the merchant's site first, they can pay for it in one click of the Buy button.

The exact details of the scheme have not been announced, and reports claim the plans are still in the very early stages.

On Amazon, when a customer places their first order and enters a payment method and delivery address, 1-Click ordering is automatically enabled. 

Earlier this year, Twitter introduced a ‘Buy’ button that lets users make purchases directly through tweets.

The button, which is currently only available to a small percentage of US users, appears at the bottom right of partner tweets in the Twitter apps on iOS and Android.

To make a purchase, users tap the button, review product details and enter their shipping and payment information when prompted. 

Once complete, Twitter sends an order confirmation.

‘An an entire purchase can be completed in just a few taps,’ the company boasted in a blog post introducing the feature.  

To take advantage of the faster payment option, customers click 'Buy now with 1-Click' on any product page. 

The order is then charged to the default payment method on the account and delivered to the default address.

It is thought Google's system would work in a similar way and either charge to a card linked to a Google account through Google Wallet, or via a secure payment partnership with the website. 

MailOnline has contacted Google for a comment on these reports.

Twitter partnered with social shopping platform, Fancy, ecommerce companies Gumroad and Musictoday, and mobile payment startup, Stripe to develop the functionality, and has rolled out the service with a number of notable brands, nonprofits and music artists.

Current participants include Burberry, The Home Depot, Demi Lovato, Pharrell, Paramore and (RED), with more to come.

The company also stressed the measures it’s taken to ensure security of user information.

‘Your payment and shipping information is encrypted and safely stored after your first transaction, so you can easily buy on Twitter in the future without having to re-enter all of your information,’ Tarun Jain, Group Product Manager explained. 

It is likely Google will offer similar security assurances if it introduces a Buy button of its own.
