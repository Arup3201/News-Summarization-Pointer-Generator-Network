The world's most expensive terraced property went on sale yesterday for a staggering £100m.

No
expense spared: The house boasts a mixture of classic and contemporary 
features from marble and limestone-lined halls to iPad-controlled 
lighting

It is being marketed by Savills with 
an asking price of £100m - £4,651 per sq/ft - making it one of 
the most expensive houses ever put up for sale in England.

At this mega price, the buyer would have to pay £7 million in stamp duty alone.

But
they would also pay just £1,369-a-year in council tax - the same as a 
£320,000 property with Westminster Council - the second cheapest borough
in London.

Cornwall 
Terrace was originally designed and built in the 1820s by renowned 
architect Decimus Burton with the project overseen by the acclaimed John
Nash.

John Nash (1752-1835) was the son of a millwright but became an architect. He designed much of the layout of Regency London under George IV.

He was also a pioneer in the use of the Picturesque in the design of buildings and their layout which can be seen in Ravensworth Castle, County Durham, Cronk-hill, Shropshire, or Regent's Park.

His most famous designs are the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, and Buckingham Palace - although the facade to the mall is not Nash's work.

He trained under Sir Robert Taylor and his marriage to a mistress of the future George IV introduced him to court circles which meant he could benefit from royal patronage.

It was his close friendship with the Regent that meant he was awarded two of his most important commissions - Buckingham Palace and the Royal Pavilion, Brighton.

He had a notorious indifference to detail and relied heavily on assistants, but his strength was in composition.

It became 
the official London residence of the New Zealand High Commissioner from 
1955 until the 1970s, playing home to lavish parties frequented by 
royalty and other members of high society.

Savills
refused to discuss the end-of-terrace property, but the lavish brochure
gives an incredible insight into the home's level of luxury.

Described
as 'one of the most important private residences in London', the 
four-storey home has had a no expense spared makeover to be transformed 
into one of the capital's premier 'trophy homes'.

It boasts a mixture of classic and contemporary features from marble and limestone-lined halls to iPad-controlled lighting.

There
is also a sports complex which includes a gym and swimming pool and the
high-tech gates have an automatic number plate recognition system.

Outside,
the mansion has a beautiful 40-metre long landscaped garden and a grand
double staircase which connects the terrace and landscaped areas.

And
if that isn't enough, the home is located on the Outer Circle Road 
around Regent's Park - which has 410 acres of gardens and leisure 
facilities.

Cornwall Terrace is named after King George IV, who also known as the Duke of Cornwall.

The properties were used as grand residential homes for ambassadors, generals and nobility for 150-years.

It shares the same price-tag as Heath Hall, a 14-bedroom detached mega-mansion on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead.

£1,369-a-year in council tax - the same as a £320,000 property with 
Westminster Council - the second cheapest borough in London
