A nun who intervened to stop Billy the Kid murdering four doctors could be made a saint to honor her work in setting up hospitals and schools in New Mexico.

Italian-born Sister Blandina Segale was dedicated to helping the sick and immigrants, but her encounters with Western outlaw Kid became the stuff of legend.

The Archdiocese of Santa Fe is now making moves to grant a sainthood for Sister Blandina, who was known as The Fastest Nun In the West after her life inspired a TV show.

This undated photo provided by the Palace of the Governors shows Sister Blandina Segale, who co-founded the first hospitals and schools in New Mexico and reportedly challenged Billy the Kid.

Archbishop
 Michael Sheehan has received permission from the Vatican to pursue the possibility of the nun, who also worked in Ohio and Colorado, being made a saint. Â 

It
 is the first time in New Mexico's 400-year history with the Roman 
Catholic Church that a decree opening the cause of beatification and 
canonization has been declared, church officials said.

'There are other holy people who have worked here,' said Allen Sanchez, president for CHI St Joseph's Children in Albuquerque, a social service agency Segale founded.

'But this would be a saint [who]started institutions in New Mexico that are still in operation.'

Segale, a nun with the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, came to Trinidad, Colorado, in 1877 to teach poor children and was later transferred to Santa Fe, where she co-founded public and Catholic schools.

Miracle: Billy the Kid had several encounters with Sister Blandina, who stopped him killing four doctors and prevented him from robbing a wagon

During her time in New Mexico, she 
worked with the poor, the sick and immigrants. She also advocated on 
behalf of Hispanics and Native Americans who were losing their land.

Her encounters with Old West outlaws later became the stuff of legend and were the subject of an episode of the CBS series Death Valley Days.

The episode, called The Fastest Nun in the West, focused on Sister Blandina's efforts to save a man from a lynch mob.

But her encounters with Billy the Kid remain among her most popular and well-known Western frontier adventures.

According to one story, she received a tip that The Kid was coming to her town to scalp four doctors who had refused to treat his friend's gunshot wound.

Sister Blandina nursed the friend back to health and when Billy came to Trinidad, Colorado, to thank her, she asked him to abandon his violent plan. He agreed.

Another story claimed that when The Kid spotted Sister Blandina during an attempt to rob a covered wagon he called off the attack.

'He just tipped his hat and left,' Archbishop Sheehan said.

Many of the tales were recorded in letters that the nun wrote to her sister, which were later published in the book, At the End of the Santa Fe Trail.

Still relevant: Archbishop Michael Sheehan says Sister Blandina's work with poverty and immigration are still important issues today

'She was just amazing. It's tough to live up to her example,' Victoria Marie Forde, of the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, said.

The nun found St Joseph's Hospital in Albuquerque before returning to Cincinnati in 1897 to start Santa Maria Institute, which served recent immigrants.

Sister Blandina died in 1941 at the age of 91, but her work still resonates today, with poverty, immigration and child care still high-profile issues, Sanchez said.

Officials said it could take years - possibly a century - before Sister Blandina becomes a saint. The Vatican has to investigate her work and monitor for miracles.

Those miracles could come in the form of healings, assistance to recent Central American immigrant children detained at the U.S. border or some other unexplained occurrences after devotees pray to her, Sanchez said.

'She's going to have to keep working. She's not done,' Sanchez said.
