Prince Harry has been telling friends that Kate and William are expecting a boy, it was reported today.

He is so happy about becoming an uncle he couldn't keep the secret of the baby's sex to himself.

The bookies are offering odds of 1/3 favourite on the Duchess of Cambridge having a girl and 5/2 for a boy, even though couple have made no official announcement about the baby due in mid-July.

But those odds may change after a source close to the Prince said: 'Harry has been telling everyone Wills and Kate are having a boy and how thrilled he is at the prospect of having a little nephew.

Speculation: Harry was spotted with this blue bear which was a gift from a little girl in a crowd in Nottingham who asked him to pass it on to Kate and William's baby

'He said the whole family were excited about it. Apparently Kate has always wanted a boy. They’re really working hard on baby names now and think they have it sorted.'

Princess Eugenie, Prince William’s cousin,  has also been telling friends the baby is a boy, according to another royal insider quoted by the Sunday People.

The source said: 'They won’t reveal anything to ­anyone – not even Harry. Of course, Harry’s been making up crazy suggestions and winding them up too.

'The close inner circle all know that it’s a boy and they’re busily buying gifts with a boy theme. There will be an awful lot if blue in their house.'

Although the couple have kept mum about the baby's name, Kate, 31, has accidentally dropped a couple of hints about the sex of the child in recent months.

In March she appeared to suggest a girl was on the way when she given a teddy by a well-wisher during a walkabout in Grimsby.

Bookies Ladbrokes are offering odds of 1/3 on Kate having a baby girl and 5/2 for a boy. On names the favourite is Elizabeth at 5/1 shared with Alexandra and Diana.

The odds: Alexandra, Elizabeth, Diana 5/1, Victoria 6/1, Frances 8/1, Mary 10/1, Anne, Alice 12/1, George, Charles 14/1, Catherine, Grace 16/1, John, James, Phillip, Edward, Jessica, Phillipa 20/1, Richard, Louis, Carole, Caroline, Charlotte 25/1.

She said: 'I will take that for my d..' –
and then stopped herself. A nearby listener said: 'You were going to 
say daughter, weren’t you? Kate replied: 'No, we don’t know.'

A few days later Kate appeared to drop another clue as she revealed she had bought a Bugaboo pram in light blue which could indicate the newborn would be a boy.

The pram’s colour came to light when Kate chatted to a group of Army wives at a reception on St Patrick’s Day.

Then Prince Harry was seen holding a 
blue teddy bear as he walked to Kensington Palace, the home he shares 
with Kate and William in London.

But there was a simple explanation:The
bear had been given to him by a little girl while he toured 
Nottingham. She asked him to give it to Kate's baby and he delivered it 
in person.

But another insider added: “Even though there’s a lot of gossip doing the rounds, there’s no way anyone can confirm it at the moment.'

The paper claims that no decision has 
been made where Kate will have the baby, but the choice has been 
narrowed down to two hospitals.
