Barack Obama is embraced by his wife Michelle after his victory speech

A deeply divided America faced up to another four years of political acrimony yesterday despite Barack Obama’s victory promise that ‘the best is yet to come’.

After his triumph over Mitt Romney, Mr Obama joined his rival in calling for an end to the bitter partisan divide that has engulfed not only Washington but the wider country.

For all the brave talk after this ‘status quo election’, Mr Obama returns to Washington to find the same divided Congress, with defiant Republicans still in control of the House of Representatives.

And despite a convincing victory in the Electoral College – in which he has so far won at least 303 votes to Mr Romney’s 206 – the president will have trouble claiming a sweeping mandate after he secured only a 2 per cent lead in the popular vote.

Last night the stock markets reflected these fears as Wall Street slumped, with some £60billion wiped off share prices.

And hours after a triumphant Mr Obama told an ecstatic crowd in Chicago he was ‘more determined and inspired than ever’, senior Republicans were already warning that they will keep fighting for lower taxes and deep spending cuts to spur economic growth and cut America’s debt.

‘The voters have not endorsed the failures or excesses of the president’s first term,’ said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell icily.

The US could be plunged back into recession as soon as January if politicians fail to come together to address the ‘fiscal cliff’ of scheduled huge spending cuts and tax increases of almost £1trillion.

Unlike four years ago when Mr Obama became the first black president, this election is historic for a rather less inspiring reason. 

No White House incumbent since Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression has won re-election with unemployment – at 7.9 percent – so high.

Much of Mr Obama’s success is being laid on the failure of Mr Romney to capitalise on 12.3million jobless Americans.

In the event, after a 17-month campaign that was the most expensive in US history at £3billion, very little has changed.

The political map of the US remains almost exactly how it was in 2008, as Mr Romney failed to oust the Democrats in the crucial swing states which the president dramatically won in 2008.

Mr Romney, whose political career is effectively over after two White House bids, urged American unity in a gracious concession speech in the early hours of Wednesday.

He told a hushed 2,000-strong crowd that America had to put ‘people before politics’, adding: ‘At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing.’

Half an hour later, as Democrats celebrated with relief rather than the breathless jubilation of 2008, Mr Obama gave his own speech.

Rediscovering some of the soaring rhetoric missing during much of his campaign, Mr Obama insisted the battle against Mr Romney had made him a better president.

Joined on stage by wife Michelle and their children, he echoed Mr Romney’s call to find consensus with opponents – a pledge he also made in 2008 with little success – but admitted fierce political disagreement would continue.

Such arguments were ‘a mark of our liberty’ denied to millions, he said, adding: ‘Despite all the frustrations of Washington I have never been more hopeful about our future.’

Preliminary figures suggest a  drop in voter turnout.

More than 118million are known to have cast their vote and that will rise as counting continues – but it is predicted the total will fall far short of the 131million in 2008, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Wall Street went into freefall last night as investors woke up to the reality that Barack Obama’s victory had done nothing to resolve America’s huge budget problems.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 300 points – or £60billion – its biggest decline in 2012 and the largest setback since November 2011 when US financiers feared that the US recovery could be snuffed out by the crisis in the eurozone.

The adverse reaction of Wall Street to the outcome of the elections, that leave the President and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives at loggerheads over America’s huge deficit and debt, spread across the Atlantic wiping 93.27 points, or 1.58 per cent, off the FTSE100 share index in London.

Tension on the markets increased after investment bankers Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for US growth next year from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent.

The credit ratings agency Fitch warned that unless the President speedily secures an agreement to overcome the ‘fiscal cliff’ – that would automatically take $600billion out of the economy through budget cuts and tax increases – it would lower its credit rating from its top ‘AAA’ status.

‘It’s not as simple as Mitt Romney lost so the stock market falls,’ said the Wall Street firm BMO Capital Markets.

‘Right now it is back to business in America and that’s tied up to the fiscal cliff and taxes.’ In contrast, however, the dollar strengthened against the pound and the euro in reaction to a sharp fall in Spanish industrial production and reports of a slowdown in Germany. 

There has been a realisation on Wall Street that the election has not changed America’s budgetary crisis at all and despite all the talk of bipartisanship, Congress and the White House are as bitterly divided as ever.

If a compromise cannot be reached, existing legislation would require the White House to slash spending and increase taxes by almost £400billion in a punishing move that could wipe out up to 3 per cent of growth and push the United States and much of the world – including Britain – back into recession.

Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, has already signalled his post-election departure

Mr Obama’s task is not made any easier by uncertainty over the future shape of his economic team.

The current Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, has already signalled his post-election departure. In choosing his replacement, many believe he should appoint a high-profile figure from the financial community.

The name of Roger Altman, a Clinton-era deputy Treasury secretary and co-founder of the investment firm Evercore has been mentioned. So has that of Larry Fink, who runs the world’s biggest investor Black Rock.

If Mr Obama goes for a Washington insider, then it is thought that Jack Lew, the current White House chief of staff, would be in the frame.

President Clinton’s former head of staff Erksine Bowles, with a record of dealing with Capitol Hill, is also seen as a favoured candidate.
