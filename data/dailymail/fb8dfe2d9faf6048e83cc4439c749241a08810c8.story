Europe Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley couldn’t help but squirm watching Dublin’s Gaelic football team lose a recent match to Donegal the Irish world and his wife thought they would win.

For a start, Dublin are his team. He played for their junior sides until a knee injury ended his hopes of progress. But you can also imagine the uncomfortable analogy running through his head since the bookmakers and vast parts of America appear to have given up on the visitors making even a decent fist of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next week.

‘The only worry I’ve got regarding the Ryder Cup is that it’s sport at the highest level and we all know anything can happen,’ he said.

McGinley caught the fear after seeing Dublin’s Gaelic football team lose a recent match to lowly Donegal

‘That Dublin match brought home the point. They were odds of 1/10 to win. I know the Dublin manager, Jim Gavin, very well and he will have prepared his side as well as you could possibly prepare them, and yet they still lost. But that’s sport at the pinnacle. There are no guarantees.’

American pessimism is focused on the absence of star players Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, plus their best two on current form — Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk.

McGinley, however, is adamant there will be no complacency. ‘If we don’t win I can assure you it will not be because of that,’ he said. ‘We know how strongly motivated they are going to be. We will be absolutely ready for this.’ McGinley is at the Wales Open, where he had dinner on Tuesday night with four of his Ryder Cup team — Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher, Thomas Bjorn and Lee Westwood — who are competing here at Celtic Manor.

Westwood and Donaldson have been ‘drawn’ together for the first two rounds — don’t be surprised if that proves a pairings rehearsal for next week — as have Bjorn and Gallacher.

As for the other two who were expected to play — Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson — McGinley allayed any fears regarding their absence.

‘I know Graeme was very keen to play here,’ said McGinley. ‘But he’s just become a dad and it’s fair to say family reasons came into play and explain his absence.

‘I’m sure he will enlighten you himself but I’ve no worries. I know how motivated he is to do well next week. He’s going home to Northern Ireland for the weekend and he will be refreshed and ready to go at Gleneagles.’ And the enigmatic Frenchman?

‘Victor is Victor,’ said McGinley, smiling. ‘He decided at a very late stage he would be better staying in France. The players themselves obviously know what’s best for them in terms of preparation.

‘The thing that makes me happy about his preparation is that his record shows he’s a guy who disappears and then all of a sudden comes out of nowhere and plays well.’

Graeme McDowell decided to sit out of the Wales Open after recently becoming a father

Westwood is the only one of the quartet present who was here for the Ryder Cup, and couldn’t help but wryly note the differences, with the sun shining and everyone in shirt sleeves.

‘The ball is rolling, which makes a change, and I seem to remember there were rather more people on the bank at the 16th and 18th holes,’ he said.

Westwood hasn’t been seen for three weeks and has clearly been using the time well. In all he has lost 23lb since starting a diet at the beginning of August, and has been working out twice daily in the gym.

Donaldson hasn’t played since clinching his place with a stirring victory in the Czech Open three tournaments ago and could hardly ask for a better tune-up than competing on home soil.

Asked about being a 38-year-old rookie, he gave a thoughtful response. ‘You just never know when your time to play well will be, do you?’ he said.

‘I know at 25 or 26 I was miles away from being ready to play. But my time is now. I’m ready to play, and I’m ready to keep trying to improve in the future.’

Stephen Gallacher is thankful to escape the clamour for Ryder Cup tickets back home in Scotland

Gallacher lives a 30-minute drive from Gleneagles and has played a couple of practice rounds, but he’s one home-based Scot who’s happy being south of the border .

‘I’m glad to be back at work because it’s all got a bit manic up the road,’ he said, more a reference to the clamour for Ryder Cup tickets and the demands on his time media-wise than other matters presently concerning his nation.

As for McGinley, he was only too happy to express an opinion on the other vote going on in Scotland today, at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club.

‘I’m like most people, I think ladies should be members, and hopefully it is pushed through,’ he said.
