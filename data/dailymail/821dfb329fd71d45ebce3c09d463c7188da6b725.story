Romelu Lukaku is reluctant to sign a new contract at Chelsea and wants crunch talks with Jose Mourinho after the World Cup.

The Belgium international has two years left on his current Blues deal, but the Stamford Bridge club are keen to safeguard his value by offering him a new deal this summer.

However, Lukaku wants assurances over his first-team opportunities at Chelsea before considering extending his deal.

Planning for the future: Romelu Lukaku wants to talk with Jose Mourinho about his future

Despite his impact on loan at West Brom and Everton over the past two seasons, Lukaku fears Mourinho does not view him as a key member of his future plans.

Lukaku knows his future will pose Chelsea a problem in the coming months, and is unwilling to relinquish his growing position of strength by penning fresh terms.

With just two years left to run on his current deal, Lukaku knows Chelsea will have to cash in on him in the next two transfer windows before the prospect of losing the striker on a free transfer in 2016 becomes a real possibility.

Season to remember: Lukaku had an excellent season for Everton last season scoring 16 goals

Signing a new contract would eliminate any immediate rush for Chelsea to make a decision on Lukaku’s future.

And the 21-year-old wants to meet with Mourinho to find out if signing a new deal would see him fully re-integrated in to the first-team set-up at Chelsea or simply be made available for loan again.

As Sportsmail revealed earlier this week Lukaku is a target for Atletico Madrid as they look to replace Chelsea-bound Diego Costa.

The prospect of including Lukaku in the deal for Costa has been explored, but third-party ownership issues in relation to the Spain international would provide a major obstacle in a deal structured that way.

If Chelsea do decide to sell Lukaku this summer then they will want to recoup at least the £17million they paid for him three years ago.

In addition to Atletico, there is interest from Tottenham while Everton manager Roberto Martinez is keen on signing Lukaku on a permanent basis following his successful loan spell.
