Who better to promote the range? Alexa Chung has been unveiled as the new face of Nails Inc's Nail Kale range, which sees her reclining on a bed of the leafy superfood

Along with twerking and selfie, kale is undeniably one of this year's buzzwords.

Health aficionados, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Miranda Kerr, can't stop raving about the health benefits of the leafy green, which contains 206per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin A,
 134 per cent of vitamin C, and a staggering 684 per cent of vitamin K.

And now, it seems that the beauty world is catching onto the power of the dark green vegetable, which is infiltrating our favourite beautifying products one by one.

Nails Inc has caught onto the rising trend
 by introducing the appropriately named Nailkale, the first nail care 
range formulated with kale - and super lithe Alexa Chung is the star of 
the new campaign.

Alexa,
 30, is promoting the new range of six nail polishes (a superfood base 
coat, an illuminator and four colours), which is supercharged with kale 
extract, which the brand says stimulates advanced keratin production, 
hydrates and nourishes as it's absorbed by the nail. 

Nails
 are primarily made of keratin and kale's powerful anti-oxidant 
qualities apparently maximise the function of keratin activation as it 
protects these vitamins, resulting in nail growth and strength.

Queen of cool Alexa was unveiled as the new face of Nails Inc in May, when she replaced newyled pal, Poppy Delevingne.

Always
 one to throw her all into a collaboration, as the AW14 face, IT girl 
Alexa has given the nail polish brand a high fashion makeover.

The 30-year-old has posed for the brand's fashion-led campaign, shot by industry heavyweight Rankin, will act as a brand ambassador and has even created a range of fabric inspired polishes, which will launch in August 2014. Prepare for a stampede.

Thea Green, founder and MD of Nails inc said: 'Fashion is at the heart of Nails inc and we're well known for colour, innovation and amazing fashion effects for nails.

'Our Leather effect polish, as worn by Alexa Chung to the 2012 British Fashion Awards was a sell-out with a wait list of more than 3,000.

'There's a real synergy with our brand and Alexa collaborating was a natural evolution of our relationship with her.'

Speaking about her new job, Alexa said: 'It was Nails Inc's array of bold, fresh colours that first caught my eye. Then I wore Nails inc's black leather polish a few years ago and I fell in love with the brand.

'When Thea asked me to collaborate I was so excited - not only am I the face of the brand but we've created an amazing collection of fabric inspired polishes. I've been playing with textures and innovative effects to create the perfect collection that girls can use to revitalise an outfit. This collection is a party for your hands.'

Remember when? Alexa Chung was pictured wearing Nails Inc.'s leather effect nail polish at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 before it had been released to the public and it went on to sell out

Lady in red: Alexa has created a range of £15 polishes starting with a classic lace effect red called Alexa Lace In Red, which will pre-launch online in June for £12

Goodbye, Poppy! The newlywed has been replaced by her good friend Alexa as the face of the brand

Fashion's darling: Her style is so well respected that Mulberry named a bag after her, the much sought-after Alexa, which sold out

Alexa kickstarted her career at 16 when 
she was signed to Storm models, the agency that has Kate Moss and Cara 
Delevingne on its books. She moved into TV in 2006, presenting the music
 show Popworld in 2006 with Alex Zane, before becoming a staple of the 
now-defunct T4.

It wasn't 
long before Alexa's tomboyish style earned her some serious fashion 
stripes and she was seated front row at every major fashion show, 
featured on countless fashion magazine covers and landed modelling 
campaigns for New Look, Pepe Jeans and Superga.

Mulberry named a bag after her, the much sought-after Alexa, which sold out. She is now contributing editor at Vogue UK, for which she recently 
interviewed cover star Kate Upton, and has her own eye make-up range for Eyeko.
