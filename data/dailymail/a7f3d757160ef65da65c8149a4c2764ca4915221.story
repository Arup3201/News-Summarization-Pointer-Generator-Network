Former minister David Mellor was taped calling a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***' but his rant at two foreign security guards was deemed not to be racist.

The millionaire Tory was alleged to have  launched into an expletive-laden tirade at a Polish guard protecting his home at St Katherine Docks in Wapping, East London.

He was accused of having wagged his finger in the face of the security worker and suggested 'people like him' should not be working there, according to The Sun on Sunday. The newspaper later accepted that Mr Mellor was not racist towards guards. 

Former minister David Mellor was quizzed by police

The story emerged hours after he issued a grovelling apology for his foul-mouthed rant at a taxi driver, saying he would stick to water at 'celebratory lunches' from now on.

 

The former Secretary of State for National Heritage was questioned under caution on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence on March 26 last year.

He was not arrested and after Crown Prosecution Service advice, no charges were brought.

Mellor issued a grovelling apology for his foul-mouthed rant at a taxi driver after he left Buckingham Palace following his partner Lady Cobham being awarded a CBE (together above)

The millionaire Tory allegedly launched into an expletive-laden tirade at a Polish guard protecting his luxury home at St Katherine docks in Wapping, East London.

A spokesman for the Met said: 'A 64-year-old man from Tower Hamlets was interviewed under caution by police under  suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence on 26 March 2013.

'He attended an East London police station by appointment on May 23. He was not arrested and after Crown Prosecution Service advice, no charges were brought.'

Last week, Mr Mellor was secretly recorded berating a cab driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace with his partner Lady Cobham, who had just been awarded a CBE.

The 65-year-old barrister and radio presenter could be heard asking the taxi driver: 'Who are you to question me?' before yelling: 'I don't want to hear from you, shut the f*** up. Smart-a**** little b******.'

He said: 'I've been in the Cabinet, I'm an award-winning broadcaster, I'm a Queen's Counsel — you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?' 

Mr Mellor's career as a minister was ended by scandal including an affair, reported in the Mail in 1992

But  Mr Mellor, who was forced to abandon his ministerial career after an affair in 1992, made an on-air apology.

'I can't think what possessed me to lose it with that cabbie the way I did,' he said.

'OK, I had a case but I threw it away by the way I spoke and I'm really, really sorry about that and I especially want to apologise to you, our listeners for trying your patience and risking my own credibility with you by speaking the way I did. 

'Anyway, it's water for me at the next celebratory lunch, I've definitely made that decision.

'Ironically, I'm one of London taxis' best customers and I thank a lot of them for speaking up for me, like Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association who said and I quote 'I've picked him up myself. He's actually a very nice guy.

'Despite everything he's said, he's not a bad guy. Unfortunately for him he got recorded.'

'Well there's a career in broadcasting awaiting you, Steve, because I couldn't have put it in a more succinct way myself, so I thank you for that.  

'I would like to show my appreciation for the London cabbies that I have used for 40 years by making a substantial donation to their Christmas appeal for underprivileged kids.' 

The former politician has previously flown  into rages at chefs and a border guard.

On one occasion he told a terrified chef he should 'do his £10-an-hour job somewhere else' during a foul-mouthed outburst at staff of a restaurant near his home, it is claimed.

He is said to have launched the rant - during which he called the chef a 'fat b******' - at workers in the establishment just a stone's throw from his plush riverside home.

Mr Mellor, who was known as the Minister for Fun, was famously caught cavorting with mistress Antonia de Sancha in 1992.

He now lives in a 19th century listed building in exclusive St Katharine's Dock, London, with his partner Penelope, Viscountess Cobham. 

Servoca, the firm which looked after security at the flats at the time of the incident was not available for a comment. 

David Mellor has not commented on the incident.
