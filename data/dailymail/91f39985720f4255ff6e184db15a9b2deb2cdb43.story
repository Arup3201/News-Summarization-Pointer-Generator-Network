For diners with a really wild side, there is now a way to put a beastly spin on mealtimes.

A Dutch crockery designer has created a range of quirky, animal-themed, white ceramic tableware pieces, including a hippo that dispenses oil and a pair of elephant salt and pepper pots.

Interior designer Emilie Kroner founded her company Piselli Projects in January, and White Animal Life is their first project.

Two by two: The rhino and hippo pair who dispense oil and vinegar and cost 340 Euro (£277) for the pair

Kroner says: 'White Animal Life, aka WAL, was inspired by the 17th and 18th century animals that were used as decoration on tureens, but were also in existence because of their great conversational value.

'Piselli tries to reinvent the function of these objects. In this case the animals overrule function. For once function is inferior to it's decoration.'

Based in Amsterdam, Kroner launched Piselli Projects after 12 years as an interior designer when she 'felt more and more the urge to create something she could really call her own'.

She added: 'WAL and all future projects shall convey humor, beauty, happiness, conscious awareness and a bit of absurdism.'

White goods: The elephant pair dispense salt and pepper and cost 320 Euro (£261) as a pair

The pieces include two different leopard napkin holders (140 Euro, £114 each); two different salt or pepper-dispensing elephants (150/180 Euro, £122/147); a hippo oil-dispenser (170 Euro, £139); a rhino vinegar-dispenser (180 Euro, £147); a crocodile sweet dish (600 Euro, £490); and a flamingo carafe (525 Euro, £428).

The models include free shipping within Europe, and cost 40 Euro shipping outside Europe.

Meanwhile, an American company is selling an extensive collection of colourful, handpainted ceramic  mugs with 150 different hidden animal figures inside.

Animugs - designed and handcrafted at the Spademan Pottery Studio of Cambridge, Massachusetts - even focus on specific breeds of dog.

Westies, Corgis and Schnauzers are glued to the bottom of the colourful mugs ($28, £17), and only appear when the user has drunk enough tea from the cup.
