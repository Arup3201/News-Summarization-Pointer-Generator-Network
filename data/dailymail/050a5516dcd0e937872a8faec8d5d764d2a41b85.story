She's the former TV journalist turned Queen of Spain with a wardrobe that gives the Duchess of Cambridge a run for her money.

And today, for her third royal engagement as Queen, Letizia showcased her good taste once again as she joined her husband, King Felipe VI of Spain, to attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association at El Pardo Palace in Madrid.

Wearing tailored navy trousers and a tweed blue jacket, the newly appointed Queen proved that she can still look stylish at a smart event.

Suited and booted: King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain both look smart as they attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association at El Pardo Palace in Madrid earlier this week

Her husband also opted for a blue suit to attend the event at the Palace today.

The Queen has been keeping busy, attending two events in two days already this week.

Yesterday, she showcased her elegant style once again in a floral Hugo Boss dress as she attended the opening of El Greco y La Pintura Moderna exhibition at El Prado museum in Madrid, Spain.

The 41-year-old teamed the pastel dress with nude courts, a notable favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge, with whom she's been compared on numerous occasions, as well as a matching waist belt and clutch bag.

Isn't she lovely? Queen Letizia of Spain looks summery in Hugo Boss as she attends the opening of 'El Greco y La Pintura Moderna' exhibition at El Prado museum in Madrid, Spain

She added some bling to her minimalistic outfit with the help of a pair of dazzling diamond earrings and wore her hair in its trademark sleek style.

The exhibition, which runs until October, marks the IV Centenary of the death of artist El Greco.

It will exhibit 26 pieces of his work and aims to highlight the Cretan painter's work in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

This is the second of Queen Letizia's official royal engagements. On Saturday, she and her husband King Felipe VI of Spain joined Spain's Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz to pay their respects during a minute of silence for the victims of terrorism on their first official event since the King's official coronation ceremony last week.

On June 19, Felipe was formally proclaimed 
monarch and swore an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament. It was a no-frills event, though the 18th-century 
Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter were on display.

After
 a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia took a
drive through some of Madrid's most emblematic 
streets and monuments - such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles 
fountain.

The palace 
acknowledged that the customary pomp had been eliminated 'in keeping 
with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend.'

Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north
west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at 
Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The
 couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain. Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
