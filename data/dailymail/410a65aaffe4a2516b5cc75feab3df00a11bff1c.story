An Iranian man carrying grenades blew off his own legs and wounded four civilians in a series of blasts that rattled Thailand's capital, Bangkok, on Tuesday.

The explosions came a day after an Israeli diplomat car was bombed in India, an attack Israel blamed on Iran.

Thailand authorities said it's unclear whether Tuesday's Bangkok explosions were linked to the New Delhi attack, but Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak accused Iran of being behind the series of blasts in Bangkok.

'The attempted attack in Bangkok proves once again that Iran and its proxies are continuing to act in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that,' said Barak, who is currently in Singapore but had spent several hours in the Thai capital on Sunday.

'Iran and Hezbollah are uninhibited sources of terror, they are a danger to the stability of the region and a danger to the stability of the world,' he said, in remarks released by his Tel Aviv office.

Thai security forces found more explosives in a house where the Iranian man was staying in Bangkok, but it was not known what targets they might have been meant for, police Gen. Pansiri Prapawat said.

Pansiri said a passport found at the scene of one of the blasts in Bangkok indicated the assailant was Saeid Moradi from Iran.

Authorities in Tehran could not immediately be reached for comment.

Tuesday's violence began in the afternoon when a stash of explosives apparently detonated by accident in Moradi's house.

Police said two foreigners quickly left the residence, followed by a wounded Moradi.

'He tried to wave down a taxi, but he was covered in blood, and the driver refused to take him,' Pansiri said.

A taxi was destroyed by a hand grenade thrown by an Iranian man who was believed to have been part of a bomb making ring operating out of a house in central Bangkok

He then threw an explosive at the taxi and began running. Police, who had been called to the area, then tried to apprehend Moradi, who hurled a grenade to defend himself.

'But somehow it bounced back and blew off his legs,' Pansiri said.

Photos of the wounded Iranian showed him covered in dark soot on a sidewalk strewn with broken glass. He lay in front of a Thai primary and secondary school. No students were reported wounded.

A dark satchel nearby was investigated by a bomb disposal unit.

Pansiri said police found Iranian currency, US dollars and Thai money in the bag.

Another Iranian was detained on Tuesday night at Bangkok's international airport as he attempted to leave for neighbouring Malaysia, police commander Winai Thongsong said.

Authorities were interrogating the man, but it was not yet known whether he was involved in Tuesday's blasts.

Last month, a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah militants was detained by the Thai police.

He
led authorities to a warehouse filled with more than 4,000 kg of urea 
fertilizer and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate. Immigration 
police are trying to trace Moradi's movements, but initial reports 
indicated he flew into Thailand from Seoul, South Korea on February 8.

He landed at the Thai resort town of Phuket and stayed in a hotel in Chonburi.

Thailand
has rarely been a target for foreign terrorists, though a domestic 
Muslim insurgency in the country's south has involved bombings of 
civilian targets.
