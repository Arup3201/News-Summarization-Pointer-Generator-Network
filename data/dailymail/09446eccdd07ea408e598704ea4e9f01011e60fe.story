Gap: Women's pensions are an average of £7,500 lower than those of men, figures show

Women's pensions are an average of £7,500 lower than those of men, figures show.

Having children, living longer and flexible working have all cut the female pension pot to less than two-thirds of male colleagues, says a report by Prudential.

Scotland has the biggest retirement gender gap of anywhere but the south east of England.

Women retiring this year north of the Border expect to take home £10,029 a year.

But their male colleagues will pocket £17,539 a year – more than 40 per cent extra.

Fiona
Tait, a pensions expert for Scottish Life, said: ‘Women are generally 
paid less and they tend to save less over a shorter working life than 
men because they are more likely to take career breaks when having a 
family. So long as this continues, lower pensions are an inevitable 
result.’

Age Scotland has warned that the gap could grow even wider in years to come.

A spokesman said: ‘Gender income 
differences could increase hugely in the future, with more than 
three-quarters of women aged 85 and older expected to live alone by 
2033, compared with just over a third of men.’

Nearly
half (49 per cent) of women surveyed believe they will not have enough 
income for a comfortable retirement, compared with 40 per cent of men.

Vince
Smith-Hughes, Prudential's retirement income expert, said: "The pension
gender gap appears to be narrowing, but there is still a long way to 
go.

'Not only does the gap 
remain stubbornly wide, but anticipated retirement incomes have this 
year hit a five-year low for both men and women.

'The
practical steps that women can take to improve their retirement income 
prospects include maintaining pension contributions during career breaks
and, if possible, making voluntary National Insurance contributions 
after returning to work.'

The
retirement gender gap was found to be widest in the South East, where 
women retiring this year expect to have £7,878 less income a year on 
average than men at £12,259 compared with £20,137.

It
is narrowest in the North West, with women in the region having an 
income of around £13,087 a year, compared with £15,632 for men, a gap of
£2,545.
