Authorities believe a Utah mother shot and killed her two young daughters before turning the gun on herself in a tragic murder-suicide Tuesday evening in Syracuse, Utah.

The untimely deaths of 32-year-old Kyler Ann Ramsdell-Oliva and her daughters Kenadee Oliva, 13, and Isabella Oliva, 7, come just one day after police supervised the mother's ex-boyfriend and former fiance moving out of the house.

When police responded to 911 calls at the address around 7pm, they found the ex-boyfriend outside having shown up to gather up a few things he left at the home.

Neighbor Joe Peterson came home just as police were showing up and told the Standard-Examiner that the ex-boyfriend looked distraught. He kept asking 'Why [did she] do that?'

Mr Peterson's wife Karlene called police to report the gunshots.

But after interviewing Ramsdell-Oliva's former fiance, witnesses and other family members, Syracuse Police ruled out the ex-boyfriend from any involvement in the deaths.

Other than to supervise the move-out on Monday, police say they were never called to the residence before.

However, neighbors told the Standard-Examiner that there were 'frequent' domestic issues at the address.

They reported that Ramsdell-Oliva, her boyfriend and the girls had moved into the home within the last three months.

An official cause of death is pending an autopsy but police said that all three females suffered from gun shot wounds.

Police worked through the night on Tuesday investigating the crime scene and were wrapping things up Wednesday morning about 8am.

Davis School District spokesman Christopher Williams said grief counselors were summoned to Syracuse Junior High and Junior Elementary where the two girls had registered for school on January 6. The eldest was an eighth-grader and the younger was a first-grade
