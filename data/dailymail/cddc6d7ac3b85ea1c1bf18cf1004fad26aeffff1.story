Manchester City are willing to battle Liverpool for Burnley striker Danny Ings.

They want the 22-year-old to boost their homegrown quota and have made contact with his representatives.

City have signed Wilfried Bony but have interest from Juventus in Stevan Jovetic, while Wolfsburg are keen on Edin Dzeko.

Although they hope to persuade James Milner to stay, his possible departure and that of Frank Lampard to New York City would leave them short of home talent. 

Ings is out of contract this summer but will still command a compensation fee of around £6million should he stay in England, while a move abroad would only net Burnley around £300,000.

Liverpool were heavily linked with a move for the England Under 21 striker in the winter window but his reluctance to leave Burnley coupled with the club's desire to hold on to him for the rest of the season put paid to a January move materialising.

Brendan Rodgers is expected to move in the summer for the forward when he becomes a free agent but City's interest may prove an obstacle for the Merseysiders.
