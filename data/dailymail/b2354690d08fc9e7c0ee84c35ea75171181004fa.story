This is the moment a university  student disguised in a Muslim veil stalks her friend before throwing acid in her face, a court heard yesterday.

Mary Konye, 21, was captured on CCTV using the niqab to hide her identity as she followed her victim home, before allegedly attacking her because she was jealous of her good looks, the jury heard.

Her victim Naomi Oni, also 21, gave evidence about her ordeal yesterday, describing her shock when she was attacked late at night on a London street.

Mary Konye is accused of being the woman in the niqab creeping up of Naomi Oni at Barking station

It is alleged that Mary Konye is the woman in the niqab and followed Naomi Oni before attacking her with acid

She said that after she saw the damage done by the attack, she thought to herself: ‘I’m ugly, no one’s going to marry me now.’

Yesterday, she described how, on her 
way home from work at a Victoria’s Secret lingerie store, she got off at
 her bus stop in Dagenham, East London, and felt a ‘presence’ before 
turning to see someone in a niqab.

She
 then felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, scarring 
her for life and disfiguring her face, dissolving her hair and 
eyelashes and burning her tongue as she screamed.

Describing how she 
felt after the attack, she said: ‘Am I a bad person? Why has this 
happened to me? I work hard ... No one’s going to marry me now.’

Stalking: The prosecution say the woman circled is Mary Konye, who followed her friend on the Tube before dousing her in acid

Attack: Naomi Oni (pictured) had sulphuric acid 
thrown in her face by a jealous friend who then changed  profile picture
 to Freddie Krueger, a court heard today

Miss
 Oni also revealed that when she told her alleged attacker what had 
happened, her friend texted back: ‘OMG. Can’t believe it.’

She also cried down the phone to Konye, who offered her support, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Giving evidence: Miss Oni, pictured outside court today, is appearing as a witness at the trial

She
 said: ‘I just had my bandages removed and it was the first time I saw 
my  face after surgery and I broke down and I had spoken to Mary that 
night  and I was crying on the phone to her and she was on the phone to 
me telling me, “don’t worry, you’ll be OK”.’

Giving
 evidence yesterday, Miss Oni described how she felt a ‘presence’ behind
 her as she walked home.

She said: ‘I was still on the phone to my 
boyfriend and I felt a presence. I turned to my left and I saw someone 
and a black abaya [cloak] or a black niqab.

‘I remember it facing me, staring. A presence directly looking at me. All I could see was eyes.’

She
 then said she felt the splash as the acid was thrown in her face and 
ran home shouting ‘acid, acid’.

She said: ‘I immediately felt that 
someone was trying to kill me and so my instinct was to run as fast as I
 could to get home.

‘I 
felt, it wasn’t burning, it was a dissolving type of sensation. It was 
on my face and I remember,  as I had my mouth open screaming, it burnt 
my tongue.’

The court heard that the pair had a ‘rocky relationship’ and
 had stopped speaking from April to September 2011 after a row over 
Konye  sending text messages to Miss Oni’s boyfriend.

Miss Oni said: ‘I
 remember asking her why she wanted to do that and I said she’s a 
monster or something like that. 

'I said you are a monster, you are  an 
ugly monster. I remember us insulting each other’s looks. 

'She also told
 me she was so angry she wanted to throw acid at me, but she was 
advised not  to by her friend.

'Her friend said, “That’s stupid, you 
could go to jail for that”.’

Asked what she thought at the time about 
the threat, Miss Oni said: ‘I thought  it was quite bizarre, I felt 
insulted again.

'But she seemed like she wasn’t serious. I thought she 
was trying to frighten me a little bit.’

She
 also said that Katie Piper – the model who had acid thrown in her face 
by an accomplice of her ex-boyfriend – was her inspiration, adding: ‘I 
remember being deeply moved by her story and me and Mary discussed it.’

Attack: Jurors heard Ms Oni (pictured) was oblivious to the fact she was being closely followed by Konye wearing a full niqab, a hooded black coat, gloves and a grey bag

Inspiration? The attack on Ms Oni mirrored an acid assault on Katie Piper (pictured), Snaresbrook Crown Court heard yesterday

Konye,
 of Canning Town, East London, denies throwing or casting a corrosive 
fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure, disable or do grievous 
bodily harm.

She admits following Miss Oni and to being the person wearing the niqab.

The case continues.

Mary Konye posted a picture of horror film villain Freddy Krueger online and wrote, ‘She better not mess with me or I’ll make her face look like this’ before the attack, the court heard yesterday.

The university student then posted a second picture of the disfigured character from the Nightmare On Elm Street films after the attack on Naomi Oni, it is alleged.

That post carried the message ‘Who looks like Wrong Turn now?’ – a reference to a film featuring disfigured characters.

She also allegedly confessed to a friend that she wanted to throw acid in Miss Oni’s face so she would know ‘how it feels’ to be unhappy with her appearance.

The court heard she admired Miss Oni ‘to the point of obsession’ and was insecure about her own looks.

After a row, Konye allegedly quizzed another friend, who was studying chemistry at school, whether there was any acid stored in the lab.
