A Florida man who recently wore a shirt that read 'f*** the police' to a court squabble with state troopers somehow managed to walk out a winner.

Michael Burns of Broward County complained to the judge that he'd been unfairly targeted by officers who were angry that he'd been recording them on video as they broke up a roadside gathering.

Despite making no attempt to get in the  judge's good graces and even with his vulgar t-shirt display, video someone took in the courtroom clearly shows Burns getting out of a ticket.

Burns writes on LiveLeak.com that he routinely records police. He was doing just that while police were kicking some citizens off a Florida roadside. 

'It was public property and I was told they were only being kicked out to "ruin their fun,"' Burns wrote on LiveLeak. 

After there was nothing left to record, Burns drove off. Police then followed him, he says, with six police cars pulling behind him when he was stopped. 

Burns says an officer forced him to remove a Fraternal Order of Police sticker, which the cop claimed was obstructing the numbers of his license plate.

'I refused to answer any of his questioned [sic] and advised him I would see him in court to fight it when he told me I had to take it off,' writes Burns.

The quality of audio in the court video footage makes it difficult to hear exactly what the judge rules, but Burns says he won.

'I went to court wearing a shirt that said "F*** the Police,"' he writes. 'I somehow still manage to win.'

Police claimed a sticker was blocking the numbers on Burns' license plate. Burns said he was pulled over as retaliation for having recorded police in an earlier incident. Burns won
