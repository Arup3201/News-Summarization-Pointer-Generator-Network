Jean Paul Gaultier, who has been celebrated in the fashion industry for 40 years, will unveil an exclusive retrospective of work at an internationally renowned charity gala event in May

Proving his worth as one of the industry's most esteemed designers, the 62-year-old joins a hallowed hall of famed designers who have exhibited there, including  John Galliano and Julien Macdonald.

With gold as this year’s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul.

In true opulent style, Jean's catwalk will be inspired by the Vienna Secession building.

The glitzy ball is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS. The iconic French designer has been extremely active in the continued fight against HIV and AIDS for many years and was notably given amfAR’s Award of Courage in 2010.

Known for being inspired by strong female muses, including Dita Von Teese, who was one his show's muses, Gaultier says he set out to change the image of women as passive, subservient characters

Speaking about the event, Life Ball founder and activist Gery Keszler said: ‘It is phenomenal to have Jean Paul on board for this year’s catwalk show. 

'The fashion show has become one of the lasting images of the Life Ball opening ceremony and it is fantastic to have such an icon help us with Life Ball 23. 

'Jean Paul has long been an activist in our ongoing fight against HIV AIDs, it is always wonderful to have active supporters who truly wish to change the face of modern day AIDs as part of the Life Ball. 

'This year’s event is certain to be bigger than ever with unbelievable attendees and performers and incredible projects that we are working with.' 

Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project.

Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world’s largest AIDS event.

The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. 

Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation.

Jean Paul has previously spoken about how his love of fashion first began. At school, while the other boys played football, he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights.

He said: 'My teacher made me put my hand out and hit me, she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade around the class. She wanted to humiliate me. But in the end, all the boys were saying "can you do a sketch for me!".

'It showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and people could love me. So I went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and then made clothes.'

His schoolboy dream led him to become a catwalk pioneer, introducing latex and S&M to the world of high fashion. 

Known for being inspired by strong female muses, including Madonna and Beth Ditto, Gaultier says he set out to change the image of women as passive, subservient characters.

He said: 'I always found it strange that models were told to be beautiful and shut up. I find that very scandalous. I like girls to speak during the show, not to be a robot, to express themselves.'
