Private James Bell was a driver before being relieved of his duty and sent home

The touching story of how a young father was reunited with his family in the midst of the First World War has been uncovered.

In a series of events that seemingly echoes the plot of Stephen Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, army chiefs gave permission for James Bell to leave his post and return to his wife and two young children in Australia.

The decision of the War Office was prompted by an impassioned plea from Pvt Bell's sister, Annie, who wrote a letter explaining how James' four brothers had already given their lives for Queen and country and asked for him to be released from duty.

Although James and his youngest brother Laurie emigrated to Australia in 1913, while the other three sons stayed in their hometown of Keighly, West Yorkshire, upon the outbreak of war, all five felt the need to volunteer.

Tragically though, in one bloody 18 month period, these five brothers-in-arms were reduced to one.

On December 1, 1915, Laurie, the first to lose his life, died as part of the Australian forces at Gallipoli, aged only 22.

Just weeks later, on December 27, in the fields of Flanders, John, 30, took a bullet to the head.

Then, the oldest brother, Joseph, 42, was killed on June 23, 1917, by a falling bomb in Flanders.

The fate of one brother, Herbert, is almost entirely unknown. His records mark down that he died in a prisoner of war camp but both when are where remain a mystery to this day.

It was in August, two months after Joseph's death, that James arrived in France as a driver, ferrying soldiers to and from hospital.

It was a job he carried out for five months until, in January 1918, he was allowed to leave his post to return to England and then, in March, to Australia and his waiting family.

He owed it all to Annie's letter, which moved officials enough for them to grant her wish.

It read simply: 'I am writing to you to appeal for your assistance to ask you to send my brother No.1126 Driver James Bell 4th Australian Ammunition Sub. Park A.I.F., France back to Australia.

'He has been in the firing line three years and has a wife and two children in England receiving no separation allowance.

'He has had three brothers killed. Another has been missing two years last September. He is the only one left out of five brothers.

'Hoping to solicit your help.'

Andy Wade, founder of the Keighly local history group Men of Worth, which researches soldiers from the area, said: 'The story of the Bell brothers is truly incredible.

'Jamesâ€™ sister made an impassioned plea to bring him home after the death of four brothers.

'She knew that if he had died in battle all five bothers from one family would be lost, and another wife would be widowed and children left fatherless.'

The story remained a secret until it was brought forward by Jayne Pickard, great-granddaughter of Joseph Bell, whose father had researched the family.

Jayne, 54, who still lives just doors away from where the brothers had their childhood home, said: 'It's an important part of my history, it feel strange to walk past the houses and know they lived there, I wish I knew more about it all. It's such a sad story but I am very proud of them.'

James died many years later in Australia from natural causes.
