The birth of the forthcoming royal baby, due in April, will be marked with a special £5 coin

A £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child.

The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin.

The Queen - the baby's great-grandmother - approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19.

Thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days.

The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each. Both featured the prince's namesake St George.

Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies.

When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin. 

His christening was also marked with a coin.

The coin to mark the new child's birth will be similar to the silver crown-sized piece that marked Prince George's first birthday on July 22, 2014
