An outbreak of tree-killing beetles from China is threatening to wipe out thousands of acres of woodland, the Government has warned.

Officials said Asian longhorn beetles have been spotted across the south of England – posing a ‘serious threat’ to trees and shrubs.

It was thought the bugs were accidentally shipped to Britain in wood used to package goods imported from China.

Conservationists have warned that thousands of plants – including under-threat ash and elm trees – will be at risk if the situation is not brought under control.

The spotted black and white beetle, which has antennae twice the length of its body, infects trees during its breeding season in August and September. 

Officials fear thousands of the bugs could thrive in Britain’s mild, wet climate.

Dr John Morgan, from the Forestry Commission’s Plant Health Service, said: ‘There are strict controls in place to protect the UK against these pests, but we need to back these up with reporting of suspected cases.

‘These beetles could threaten a wide range of our trees, and the public have a vital role to play in protecting them.’

The public was being urged to report sightings of the beetles.

Martin Ward, the UK Government’s Chief Plant Health Officer, said: 'Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem.

'The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species.'

The bugs, which are capable of flying for more than a mile at a time, were first spotted in Kent last year - leading to the felling of 2,116 trees in the county.

The Government thought it had brought the problem under control until researchers recently discovered the bugs in neighbouring Sussex and in Hampshire.

The Asian Longhorn and its cousin, the Citrus Longhorn, are native of China and the Korean peninsula.

The Forestry Commission said outbreaks have caused extensive damage to trees in the USA and Italy since being accidentally introduced there in recent years.

'It is suspected that the original beetles might have emerged from wood packaging material which had been used to import slate from China to a site next to where the Kent outbreak was located,' a spokesman said.

He added: 'Untreated wood packing is a known pathway for Asian Longhorn beetles, and all wood packaging material imported into the EU should be marked to show that it has been treated to reduce the risk of carrying quarantine pests.

'It is illegal to import wood into the UK which shows signs of the beetle.'

Dr John Morgan, Head of the Forestry Commission’s Plant Health Service, backed calls for the public to report sightings of the beetles.

He said: 'There are strict controls in place to protect the UK against accidental introductions of these pests, but we need to back these up with constant vigilance and reporting of suspected cases.

'These beetles could threaten a wide range of ornamental, fruit and woodland trees, and the public and trade have a vital role to play in protecting our trees.'

The Forestry Commission called on people who see the beetles to 'isolate' them - preferably by putting them in a glass jar - and call 01904 465625 immediately.
