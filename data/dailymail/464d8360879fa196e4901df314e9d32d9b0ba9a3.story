U.S. actor Randy Quaid is in a heated dispute with immigration authorities in Canada who have denied his request for permanent residency nearly two years after the one-time Oscar nominee said he and his wife had won a legal fight to remain in the country.

Canada’s federal Refugee Protection Division has also refused to let Quaid reinstate a claim in which he said he and his wife, Evi, were the targets of Hollywood ‘star-whackers,’ organized criminals out to get them.

The couple have now appealed to Canada’s Federal Court system as they maintain that their lives are still in danger, CBC News reports.

On the run: The Quaids relocated north of the U.S. border in Ovtober 2010, jumping bail and skipping court dates in Santa Barbara, California, where they face felony and misdemeanor counts in connection with vandalizing a home they once owned

‘Organized crime and its victims are serious issues and can not be tossed off until the claim is heard,’ the Quaids wrote in an application for judicial review obtained by the Canadian news outlet this week.

‘The refugee claims should remain intact as should Evi and Randy Quaid's heads remain attached to their necks and it is their firm belief that their lives are at stake and being racketeered on,’ their bizarre statement read.

The couple applied for refugee status in Canada in October 2010, saying they were being persecuted by a group of devious lawyers and agents bent on killing famous actors.

The pair relocated north of the U.S. border at the time, jumping bail and skipping court dates in Santa Barbara, California, where they face felony and misdemeanor counts in connection with vandalizing a home they once owned.

$500,000 bench warrants are still in effect for the couple in Santa Barbara.

The Quaids told authorities that their friends including Heath Ledger and David Carradine had died under ‘mysterious circumstances.’

The father of Evi Quaid, was born in Canada, giving her Canadian citizenship and the facility to sponsor her husband as a resident of the county.

But in the application for judicial review Quaid filed in the country’s Federal Court last week, he claimed an immigration officer had denied his application for permanent residence last month for unknown reasons.

Quaid’s lawyer, Lorne Waldman, told CBC News that the officer mentioned in the document ignored evidence that Qauid and his wife were in danger.

Quaid withdrew his refugee claim last summer and immigration authorities have since denied his resubmittal.

The frantic actor initially requested a guarantee that he could stay in Canada before abandoning his original claim, according to documents filed in a separate Federal Court file.

Quaid completed a notice of withdrawal in August 2012. He said he didn't know what he was doing at the time.

‘He never intended to withdraw his refugee claim,’ legal documents state. ‘His wife suffers from dyslexia and post-traumatic stress disorder and she reacted out of fear when she completed the withdrawal form.’

The Quaids now say their lives are in danger again.
