Incredible footage reveals the moment a woman in Haiku City, China, was grabbed by her boyfriend and stuffed down a manhole - umbrella and all -  where she remained stuck for 60 hours until her cries for help alerted passers-by.

Rescued wearing only her underwear, the woman was swollen and pale from her prolonged soaking and exhausted from spending nearly three days struggling to keep from drowning down the 10-foot hole.

Plucked from the her watery tomb by pedestrians who heard her desperate screams for help, the woman had constructed a 'cloth ladder' to reach the manhole lid over the previous two days- only to find she was not strong enough to lift it up.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Set-up: The man is seen here positioning the cardboard over the open manhole ready for his assault on the woman (right) who was walking down the street in the rain

Violent: The man rushes the terrified woman over to the concealed manhole entrance and then proceeds to literally stuff her down it - umbrella and all

Shocking: The man takes only seconds to overpower the woman and make sure she falls down the 10-foot deep manhole

Entombed: The man calmly replaces the manhole lid- encasing the woman 3m down in the depths - covered in water, where she will stay for the next 60 hours

She had cried out for help on multiple occasions down the lonely street but on her rescue told police of her horrific ordeal.

'I did not sleep at all the first night I fell in the manhole. I could see the darkness around me. I thought that I would not be choked to death if I looked up,' she said.

The woman, known only as Guo, revealed that she had been set upon during the night of December 12 by her boyfriend who owed her 100,000 yuan or around $16,500.

The man, who also had the surname Guo, has been arrested by police for attempted murder. 

Almost three days later: The woman's cries for help are eventually heard and passers-by convene to help her to safety

Freedom: The woman is plucked from what she thought would be her watery grave - swollen from the water and pale from her ordeal

Recovery: The woman was taken to hospital where she was given treatment for her horrifying experience down the manhole

The woman, known only as Guo, said she tore her clothes into pieces and made a cloth ladder to get to the manhole lid.

He was captured on surveillance camera at the scene previously lifting the manhole cover off and placing a piece of cardboard over the top.

He then grabs the lady and in the rain and is runs her to the camouflaged hole and shoves her down it.

The man told police he intended to kill the woman as he had an affair with her, but later confessed he tried to kill her because of the debt.

Police said the suspect was a gambling addict.
