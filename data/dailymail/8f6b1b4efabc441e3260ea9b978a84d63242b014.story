Disturbing: Kevin Robinson, 29, exposed himself to women while wearing scarves and balaclavas over his face

A serial flasher wore a pink suspender belt and black lacy bra and exposed himself to women in a tiny village.

Kevin Robinson, 29, was jailed for 18 months yesterday after a judge at Ipswich Crown Court said he had 'grave concerns' about the risk the pervert posed.

One women said he opened a trenchcoat while wearing a blonde wig, revealing his lingerie to her through a shop window in Blundeston, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

She said the sex pest gave her a 'chilling stare' before flashing at her from the darkened street as she browsed the store.

Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, told the court the flasher's face had been masked with a black scarf.

Another terrified target was walking her dog at night when the sex pest jumped out in front of her, while another said he approached her while wearing tights with nothing underneath.

On a separate occasion, Robinson leapt out in front of a car while dressed in black and wearing a balaclava, before exposing his genitals.

Robinson, of Lowestoft, admitted two offences of exposing himself to women in Blundeston on September 6 and October 18. He also asked for five other offences to be considered.

Robinson was jailed in 2007 for four 
years for false imprisonment, sex assault and unlawfully detaining a 
child, the court heard.

Recorder Christopher Morgan told him he had caused his victims 'real fear and distress'.

As well as jailing him for 18 months, the judge ordered Robinson to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely.

Mr Morgan also made him the subject of a sexual offences prevention order.

Robinson must tell police of the make and registration of any vehicle he drives.

Christopher Paxton, defending, said the defendant was aware that he had a problem. Mr Paxton said Robinson felt genuine remorse and branded him 'confused and complex'.
