Stateside: Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was 'unacceptable' that British black actors have to go to the USA to find success

The portrayal of black Britons on 
screen suggests they can only be successful in sport, music or 
entertainment – and not in business or the law, a senior Labour 
frontbencher claimed yesterday.

Chuka Umunna, the party’s business 
spokesman condemned the ‘lazy stereotypes’ that mean too many strong 
black role models are ‘ignored’.

Mr Umunna also said it was 
‘unacceptable’ that British black actors could not achieve mainstream 
success in the UK without first breaking America.

In a speech to mark Black History 
Month, Mr Umunna criticised the lack of black role models across the 
professions.

He said: ‘If young black people can’t see people who look 
like them editing our newspapers, sitting on the Supreme Court or 
running our great British companies, how can we give them the hope that 
if they work hard, they can make it too?

‘You see, shining a light on our role models is crucial because too many of them are ignored.’

And he said one of the reasons for 
this was that ‘the broadcast and film media have a tendency to 
stereotype black people: to present an image of black British people 
that suggests we can succeed in sport, entertainment and music, but not 
necessarily in other fields’.

Mr Umunna, seen as a rising Labour 
star, also raised the issue of many black British actors having  to 
leave the UK for the US to get better roles.

He said: ‘Too many in the British film
and television industries simply don’t cast black British actors in 
certain roles that fall outside those stereotypes.

‘It’s often only after they’ve made it
big in the States that black British actors get more – and more varied –
roles here.

'That is unacceptable and has got to change. As a society, 
we cannot allow people to default to lazy stereotypes.’

His comments come after National 
Theatre performer David Harewood encouraged ‘young Black British actors 
to get to America if they have ambition’. He said it was a fact that 
aspiring actors would have to follow the lead of Adrian Lester, Idris 
Elba and himself by crossing the Atlantic in search of success.

Mr Elba, from Hackney in East London, 
landed the lead in BBC drama Luther only after establishing himself by 
playing a drugs baron in US TV series The Wire.

Mr Harewood secured a role in Homeland
after sending producers an audition tape, while Mr Lester – who starred
in Hustle – has expressed his frustration with the process of securing 
lead roles.

In his speech, Mr Umunna said: ‘As a 
non-white person in Britain today, you’re twice as likely to be 
unemployed as a white person. If you are a young black graduate, you’ll 
earn on average only three quarters of what a white graduate earns.

‘If you have an African-sounding 
surname, you need to send about twice as many job applications as those 
with traditional English names – not even to get a job – but just to get
an interview.’

He added: ‘And I’m being generous 
here. I haven’t gone into the over-representation of black people in the
criminal justice and mental health systems – or the disproportionate 
numbers of young black Caribbean boys, say, being excluded in our 
schools.’
