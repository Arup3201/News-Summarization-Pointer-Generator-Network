A visitor to Wales was beaten so badly that he had to have part of his skull removed - and he believes he was the victim of an 'anti-English' attack.

Paul Meehan, 27, has released horrific pictures which reveal how a huge five-inch section of his skull was removed following the assault which left him fighting for his life in hospital.

Doctors had to perform extensive surgery to release the pressure on his swollen brain and then wrote 'no bone' on the tape around his head.

Paul Meehan, pictured recovering in hospital after five inches of his skull had to be removed, claims the assault was prompted when his attackers heard his Birmingham accent

Electrician Paul, from London, was enjoying a night out on October 28 with his family in the Welsh capital Cardiff when he was attacked.

He claims six thugs heard him speaking with an English accent and launched a brutal assault, punching and kicking him in the head before they left him lying in the street.

He was taken to hospital where doctors treated him for concussion and whiplash, but three weeks later, after he had fell ill, he returned to hospital where tests revealed he had several skull fractures.

They had to remove a five-inch lump of bone to try and stop an infection spreading to his brain.

Paul, who is now only able to talk about his ordeal, said: 'They had to take a big section of skull away so I'm left with a squidgy bit on the side of my head.

Paul, who spent part of his childhood in Wales, was assaulted at a taxi 
rank after a night out with his fiancee Laura Landeg and his relatives. He sustained a serious head injury, resulting in brain surgery

'Whoever did this has ruined my life - I'm not going being to be able to go back to being my old self.

'The people who did this probably haven't thought about it since - they probably don't know how far it's gone.'

Paul grew up in Cardiff and had a slight Welsh accent when he was younger.

But he moved to Birmingham in his late teens where he picked up the region's accent which his attackers heard.

Paul was assaulted at a taxi rank after a night out with his fiance Laura Landeg, 22, and relatives in the Welsh capital.

He said: 'It was an unprovoked attack - they heard my accent, it was nothing more than that.

'I've always had a good time in Cardiff but I've been out before when this sort of thing has happened to other people.

'It could have turned into a murder case quite easily which is scary to think about.'

Paul Meehan was initially treated for concussion and whiplash, but later tests revealed that he had several skull fractures

Paul suffered several skull fractures and bleeding in a vessel next to his brain.

'He also contracted an eye infection which spread throughout his blood stream.

Paul will no have to wait six months before a metal plate is inserted in his head to replace the missing section of skull.

Until then he is unable to work and is having regular neuro-rehabilitation treatment at a Birmingham hospital.

South Wales Police are investigating the attack and have studied CCTV from Cardiff city centre in a bid to identify the gang.

A spokesman said: 'Cardiff is a cosmopolitan multi-cultural city where people of different cultures and religions live side by side and have done for many, many years.

'The city has a successful and proud history of welcoming thousands of visitors from across the UK and the world to events such as the rugby Six Nations, the Olympics, and high-profile football games including the FA Cup while the new Wembley Stadium was built.

'The victim in this case has provided officers with an account of what happened but makes no reference to anti-English comments being made by those responsible.

'This matter is being treated as a priority and officers will speak with the victim regarding his concerns expressed to the media that this was racially-motivated.

'While it happened sometime ago during the early hours of Sunday, October 28, it is hoped that witnesses may remember seeing the assault particularly as the offender used a belt as a weapon.

'We are appealing for witnesses or anyone who has any information to contact South Wales Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

'Assaults such as this will not be tolerated in Cardiff and are always fully investigated.'
