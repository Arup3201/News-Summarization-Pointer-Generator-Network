An armed robbery of  an 18-wheeler truck transporting bars of gold from Florida to Massachusetts was most likely an inside job, according to police.

The $4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards  said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over.

But Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip from Bridgewater, Massachusetts on I-95.

Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of heist

Suspects: Woodard shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger - there are three suspects altogether

White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate

In the latest account of events, one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and this is why the driver pulled over.

However, in an earlier description the guards,  employed by Miami-based company, TransValue Inc. said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop.

The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground.

They then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold.  

Woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations.

'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,' a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC.

'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added. 

Search: Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $4million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Above, deputies investigate a wooded area near the road

Location: The men 'ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs gold'

Cone: This photo is of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back

'It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. 

'The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.'

Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case.

Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger.

Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. 

The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC.   

Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police.

He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck.
