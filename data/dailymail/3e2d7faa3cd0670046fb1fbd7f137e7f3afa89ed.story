Anyone not clear of the genesis of Bayern Munich moving for Xabi Alonso should probably be directed to the 31st minute of last season’s German Cup Final. Pep Guardiola’s team had just been mauled, torn to shreds, by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final — a performance that the Catalan calls the worst mistake of his entire career.

Everyone around the club was shattered by the 5-0 aggregate humiliation but the rallying call had been sounded for the domestic final against Borussia Dortmund (The Bayern executives are driven by a ferocious strategic wish to subjugate the northerners).

Key role: Xabi Alonso has been at the heart of the very football which Bayern want to replicate

Not only is Dortmund’s eccentric, electric coach Jürgen Klopp fond of comparing the Bavarians to a James Bond super-villain, this tie was already the football equivalent of the umpteen Spanish Clásicos which helped define Guardiola’s reign at Barcelona as one of the all-time-great managerial innings. 

It was the ninth meeting between the Bundesliga’s two dominant forces in two seasons and the fourth in 10 months since the Catalan had taken over at Bayern.

In the previous three games Guardiola’s side had won once, away, but lost the Supercup 4-2 and been thumped 3-0 at the Allianz Arena. 

Risk: Bayern have pledged to pay £16m over two years for a player about to turn 33

Two defeats, seven goals conceded and now reeling from the five-goal thumping from Madrid. Crisis time. For this moment of huge significance Guardiola planned to flood the centre of the pitch but to ask huge amounts, tactically and physically, from Philipp Lahm as the central, organising midfielder next to Toni Kroos.

After half an hour Lahm had to come off, injured and in danger of missing the World Cup if he continued. Guardiola looked around and found he needed to choose the out-of-form Franck Ribéry, who had been fighting injury himself, to go on as Lahm’s replacement and play out of position in organising central midfield. 

One of the club’s most quixotic and effective wingers ever, playing Guardiola’s almost ‘sacred’ pivote position for the first time in his life to take over from a converted full-back. At one of the most powerful and wealthy clubs in the world. Just after they had won the treble. Crazy.

Match up: James Bond and super-villain Raoul Silva in Skyfall

It was a moment emblematic of the Catalan’s first season in charge. Over the year he had used up to seven players in that position: the one which he himself played for Johan Cruyff’s ‘Dream Team’ and which is, without question, the mega-powerful microprocessor through which all team commands, all intelligent positional play and all the passing movements to restart play from the back must flow.

Javi Martínez, Thiago Silva, Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Pierre Hojbjerg and Mario Götze had all been asked to interpret that cerebral role — with varying degrees of success. Partly that had been to do with Guardiola’s fanatical drive to keep re-touching his playing scheme, to keep re-inventing and outmanoeuvring his opponents. 

Mostly it had to do with the incessant injury crisis at the club — Guardiola didn’t have a fully-fit, injury-free squad until March and then that nirvana lasted about 10 days. The Final? Yes, Bayern won after extra-time and after still more tactical tinkering and Ribéry going off with the injury which cost him, not Lahm, World Cup participation. So, to Alonso. Already this season Guardiola has lost one fulcrum player in Javi Martínez, whose knee-ligament damage means he is out for several months.

Thiago has played only 25 times in a year and is currently taking longer to recover from his third major injury at the club since joining.

Rivalry: Bayern Munich takes on Borussia Dortmund in last season's German Cup final

The news that Schweinsteiger will also be out for weeks, added to the fact that Bayern’s directors and sporting director Matthias Sammer couldn’t find a way to incentivise Kroos — now at Madrid — to stay, means that Guardiola was bound to act. And decisively, too. Bayern was once the Euro-elite club with the strictest transfer market and wage policy. But they’ve just bought a man on the verge of turning 33 for what may well amount to £8million and to whom they’ll pay a minimum of £8m in wages over two seasons. It’s a risk. And couldn’t they have used that much money to persuade Kroos to stay? Or was there another reason for his exit?

It’s a huge demonstration of faith in Guardiola, who specified that Alonso was what was needed, and a declaration of further ambition to dominate both Germany and Europe.

Guardiola called Alonso ‘a great professional with a strong personality and, above all, an intelligent footballer’.

The Basque midfielder has been at the heart of the very football — Spain’s world domination — which Bayern want to replicate. They value his brain, his precision, his dedication, his ruthlessness and his experience.

Real deal: Bayern could not persuade Toni Kroos to reject move to Madrid

As for Alonso? He renewed his Madrid contract last December on being informed by them that a proposed freedom-of-contract move to Bayern wasn’t going to happen.

His frankness, now, is admirable. ‘Having won La Decima (Madrid’s 10th European Cup) I had the instinct that my time here was coming to an end.

‘I need certain incentives and they probably take the form of a new challenge, different ambitions. I saw a new cycle starting around me at Madrid and to be at the highest level I thought I needed to test myself somewhere new. Nobody at the club wanted me out, this was my decision.’

Like Guardiola, he will handle the language and the fact he speaks English will help, while there’s a good smattering of Spanish at the club, too. While Guardiola’s teams are always athletic and one of his maxims is that

they must ‘run and run and run’, it’s Alonso’s positional intelligence and precision of passing which will matter more than the fact that his legs and lungs ended last season at a low ebb.

In the Bundesliga he’ll find, compared to Spain, some of what he misses from English football: fuller, noisier stadia, 90-minute sporting aggression — lots of Davids tilting at Goliath.

And he calculates that he’ll win his third Champions League with a third different club.

Guardiola and Alonso — once fierce and unforgiving rivals across the Clásico divide. Now united. Watch out everyone else.
