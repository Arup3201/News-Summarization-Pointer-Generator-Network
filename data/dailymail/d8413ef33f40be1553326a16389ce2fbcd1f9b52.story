Dane said he suffered second-degree burns to his face, neck and hand, while the fire ignited the hair of other students and burned papers.

‘I was on fire,’ Dane told the Star Tribune. ‘People were screaming, and everyone just ran out. The whole thing was confusion.

‘I felt the heat of the fire on my face. It must have been a pretty big explosion. It was terrible. It was chaos. It was scary.’

At first he was in shock, but as he waited for the ambulance unbearable pain took over and it felt like he didn't have lips, he told the Star Tribune.

Fire: The explosion occurred when a flame did not stay in a bottle and consume the flammable methanol substance as was supposed to happen

The teacher, 61-year-old Matthew Achor, apologised to Dane and his father said he wants to see safety issues addressed by the school.

‘I'm sure he feels bad, he's obviously a teacher - he likes kids,’ Gus Neuberger told the Star Tribune. ‘We're not looking for blood from him.’

A school district spokesman said the burns were not life-threatening and the students went to Hennepin County Medical Center for treatment.

Three of the four were released from hospital after the incident which happened around 9:45am on Thursday in a class of 30 students.

The spokesman said a ‘fire coat’ was used to extinguish the flames on the students and the classroom was evacuated as a precaution.

Hospital surgeons are hopeful Dane's burns will heal normally over the next two weeks and this should then ensure minimal scarring.

The school district has not yet stated its position on Mr Achor, but 
students and parents have been generally supportive of their teacher.

Before the accident: At first Dane was in shock, but as he waited for the ambulance unbearable pain took over and it felt like he didn't have lips, he said

This was the second science experiment to go wrong in a school classroom in 24 hours:

'Mr Achor was my ninth grade science teacher 20 years ago, and was one 
of the most influential teachers I had,' one user posted on CBS 
Minnesota.

'There aren’t a lot of teachers who can make make science interesting to a bunch of 13-year-olds, but Mr Achor is one of them.'

A current student also posted: 'He is my favorite teacher in the building. I am always looking forward to go to his class every day.'

Others said Mr Achor was a 'really good teacher', 'very influential' and 'one of the best'. He has not yet responded to a comment request from MailOnline on Friday.
