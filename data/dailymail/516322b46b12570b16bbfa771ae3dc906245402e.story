The winery which produced the sleep-inducing bottle of wine that made Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fall asleep during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address is cashing in on its new fame.

Ginsburg, who said she wasn't '100 per cent sober' when she nodded off during President Obama's speech last month, blamed her nap on a bottle of 'very fine California' wine that her colleague Anthony Kennedy brought to dinner. 

The judge, 81, told attendees of a Smithsonian Associates event in Washington, D.C. the wine Kennedy brought to dinner was 'an Opus something or other'.

The wine that put Justice Ginsburg to sleep was from Opus One Winery in Oakville, California 

The bottle was from Opus One Winery in Oakville, California, according to ABC. 

Christopher Barefoot, vice president of public relations at Opus, said the winery was 'overjoyed' to find out Ginsburg enjoyed their wine.

He said: 'We were delighted to learn we were included in such an important meal. It's a great feeling.

'It seems like she enjoyed the wine, and we're glad she liked.

'I'm sure we've been served at many, many, many, many prominent dinners.'

The character of Opus One Winery's vintage expresses time and place, according to its website 

Even though she passed out, President Barack Obama still gave Justice Ginsburg a hug after his annual speech

The wine from Opus One exemplifies 'the balance of power and finesse, structure and texture'

Ginsburg indulged in a glass or two of the Opus despite her vow to stick with sparkling water and 'stay away from the wine'.

'The audience – for the most part – is awake because they're bobbing up and down all the time and we sit there stone-faced, sober judges,' Ginsburg said, according to CBS.

'At least I wasn't 100 per cent sober because before we went to the State of the Union we had dinner.

'The dinner was so delicious, it needed wine to accompany it.' 

The character of the winery's vintage expresses time and place, according to its website. 

'Through the minds and hands of the vineyard workers we capture time and the essence of the season – coaxing concentration and tempering abundance.

'Place is best expressed in the mouthfeel of Opus One; it is the balance of power and finesse, structure and texture.

'Complementing both time and place is the essential human element: the attitude, will and soulful attention embodied in the team of individuals who prune, harvest, cellar and embrace the vision of our founding partners.'
