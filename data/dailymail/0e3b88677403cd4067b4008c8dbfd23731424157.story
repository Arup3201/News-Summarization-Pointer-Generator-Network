It may look innocuous, but this tiny lead ball is thought to have triggered a rebellion that saw millions of Russians die and gave rise to the world's first communist state.

When the ball of shot narrowly missed hitting Tsar Nicholas II after it was fired from a cannon in 1905 in St Petersburg, it is believed to have set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the Russian Revolution.

Now its unique place in history is expected to see the grapeshot ball - which has been privately owned for almost a century - fetch up to half a million pounds at auction.

The lead shot missed the Russian Tsar by three feet when it was fired during a ceremonial salute outside the Winter Palace in January 1905.

Russia was a country on the brink of mass political and social unrest at the time of the so-called assassination attempt on Tsar Nicholas II in St Petersburg in January 1905.

On January 22, days after Russia's last emperor believed he had survived an attempt on his life, soldiers of the Imperial Guard shot unarmed striking workers as they made their way to the Winter Palace in a peaceful demonstration.

Up to 100 people died on what came to be known as Bloody Sunday, a day that would prove to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It is widely regarded as one of the key events that sparked the eventual Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the dismantling of the country's Tsarist autocracy.

The series of rebellions saw Tsar Nicholas II forced to abdicate in February of that year, and ultimately paved the way for the creation of the USSR in 1922.

In October 1917 the Bolsheviks overthrew the shaky provisional government established after the abdication, and Nicholas and his family were eventually held in a prison in Yekaterinburg.

In July 1918, as anti-Bolsheviks approached the city, the family was executed. They are thought to have been killed on the orders of Bolshevik leader Lenin.

Although an investigation later found the shot had been fired by accident, Nicholas II is said to have been convinced he had been the target of an assassination attempt.

Three days later, the Russian Imperial Guard opened fire on a crowd of striking workers and their families during a peaceful demonstration, killing almost 100.

This incident earned the Tsar the title 'Nicholas the Bloody' and led to a decade of civil unrest that culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1917.

The rebellion dismantled the Tsarist autocracy in Russia and paved the way for the creation of the USSR, led by communist revolutionary Lenin.

Tsar Nicholas II and his family were executed in 1918.

The shot was recovered from scene of the 1905 'shooting' by a Russian duke who had been standing next to the Tsar at the time.

He took it to famed goldsmiths Faberge 
where the shot, which measures 1.5ins in diameter, was mounted on a gold
seal that was later given to Nicholas II as a present.

A member of the royal court took it with him when he fled Russia at the outbreak of the revolution.

It
has been in private ownership ever since but has now gone on general 
sale for the first time through London antiques dealer Wartski.

The item could sell for up to Â£500,000 given its 'exceptional' provenance and Faberge seal, experts said.

Wartski's managing director Geoffrey 
Munn, who has appeared on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow, said: 'This is a 
truly historic piece and an extraordinary treasure.

'The provenance is quite exceptional and from a time that now seems so remote yet was in an age of the motorcar and electricity.

'The will to revolution was born from this ball and the events that followed it being fired.'

Nicholas II's grandfather had been assassinated by revolutionary terrorists in 1881, and when he became Tsar in 1894, he used severe measures to subdue resistance movements.

But by 1905 he was seen as a weak leader, and on January 19 that year he concluded the grapeshot fired from a cannon was at attempt on his life.

This
grapeshot ball is said to have missed him by three feet while another 
shattered a window, showering the Tsar's mother, the Dowager Empress, 
with splinters of glass.
