An amateur photographer who has spent more than 50 years photographing the Royal Family has released his remarkably intimate images for the first time.

Ardent royalist Colin Edwards, 73, from Ruthin, North Wales, has spent five decades following the family, spending thousands of pounds and clocking up countless miles on his quest.

His one-man mission is now being recognised in a book which will for the first time reveal his amazing images of the The Queen, Queen Mother and Diana Princess of Wales, among others.

The photographer's pictures speak of an intimacy and trust between he and his royal subjects.

A
 smiling Queen, the breathtaking beauty of a young Diana and the 
stalwart last days of the Queen Mother are all captured in his work.

So
 too, is a sense the Royal Family seem to recognise perhaps their 
biggest fan: often the smiles and glances appear to be for the benefit 
of Colin’s lens.

Indeed letters from the Palace to Colin show that the Windsors warmed him over the years.

The Queen Mother, pictured here, was also photographed by Colin on many 
occasions. He often waited hours for just the briefest glimpse of the 
Royal family

All smiles! The Queen has been photographed hundreds of times over the past 50 years by ardent royalist Colin Edwards

The Queen has clearly warmed to amateur photographer and self-confessed 
Royalist, Colin Edwards, who took these pictures of her. The palace have
 written to Colin to thank him for his continued support of the family

In one 
letter dated April 21, 1992, the Queen’s Deputy Private Secretary 
Kenneth Scott writes: 'No Royal visit would be complete without a 
selection of splendid Edwards photographs, and the Queen was delighted 
to see you in Chester and to receive those lovely photographs of 
Wakefield.'

The
 incredible record will now be available for the first time in the 
upcoming book A Personal Portrait of The Royal Family, released by Candy
 Jar Books on April 10.

Colin said his passion for the Royal’s began when he was aged just 12 on June 2, 1953, with Queen Elizabeth’s coronation.

He said: 'My family was one of the first in the street to own a television, so our lounge was filled with friends and neighbours for the event.

'The atmosphere was fantastic, and I’m proud to say that I’ve been a royalist ever since.'

Since that momentous day, he has spent much of his life touring the UK to attend royal events, often waiting hours for a brief glimpse of the Queen.

Colin’s first-ever photograph of her Majesty - he has now taken more than 1,000 - was captured in 1977, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's Silver Jubilee year.

Colin Edwards' home is full of Royal memorabilia he has collected over the past 50 years. His love for the Royal family started aged 12, when he watched the Queen's coronation

Colin says: 'I get such a buzz from it - I'm always on cloud nine after meeting Her Majesty'

'I get such a buzz from it,' he says. 'I’m always on "cloud nine" after meeting Her Majesty.

It is the 
anticipation of this euphoria which keeps me going, no matter how long I
 have to wait or how cold it gets. Everyone is there for the same 
reason.'

His style is a far cry from typical paparazzi snapshots, as he captures a natural, softer side of the Royal Family.

The pictures are interspersed with delightful anecdotes in which he recalls his personal experiences with the Royal family.

These moments include the first time Diana, Princess of Wales, addressed him by name, and his delight at the Queen Mother attending one of his photography exhibitions.

Colin, a former civil servant, from Ruthin, North Wales, said his passion for the royals began when he was aged just 12, on June 2, 1953, with Queen Elizabeth's coronation

Colin has 
never kept a diary but said he has been blessed with a fantastic memory 
and, with the aid of his photographs, he has been able to record his 
royal memoirs.

He said: 'I never expected that my experiences would be turned into a book, so it never occurred to me to write anything down.

'I just want people, royalists like myself, to enjoy it.'

A Personal Portrait of The Royal Family is out now and also contains selected images of Prince Charles, Prince Harry, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. It can be ordered from the Candy Jar Books website: www.candyjarbooks.co.uk

Despite not working for a newspaper or paying the bills with his pictures, Colin's quest to capture the Royals in pictures gained a remarkable trust from his subjects such as Diana, left, and the Queen, right
