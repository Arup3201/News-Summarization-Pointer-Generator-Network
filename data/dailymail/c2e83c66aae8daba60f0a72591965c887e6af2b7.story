Tens of thousands of comic book fans decked out in fancy dress gathered in London today for one of the UK's biggest celebration of animated culture.

The London Super Comic Book Convention, which kicked off last today, saw fans donning elaborate and often skimpy costumes in homage to their comic book favourites.

Comic super-fan and television presenter Jonathan Ross was among the celebrity guests for day one alongside Storage Wars' Sean Kelly and John Romita Junior- son of comic book legend by the same name- who draws for DC comics.

There were a number of tributes to Guardians of the Galaxy's tree-like character Groot and characters from the Lego Movie.

Among the best-dressed were also a trio who posed as Batman and his nemeses the Joker and Harley Quinn.

A total of 25,000 fans are expected to pay the Excel Centre, in east London, a visit over the course of the event, which lasts until tomorrow.

The annual event, now in its four year, is the biggest comic book themed event in the UK, and the third for pop culture.

One of the event organisers, Gary Morris, said: 'It's been an incredible first day. The atmosphere has been amazing and the level of costumes has been out of this world.

'People have really brought their A-game this year.

'The market for these sort of events is definitely growing. Just look at the films which are in the box office at the moment- they're all based on comic books. We like to look at the heritage that led to that.'
