Edward Snowden was caught last night in a 6,175 mile Catch-22 as Venezuela looked ready to formally offer him political asylum this week.

The NSA whistleblower may receive a temporary travel document to fly to Caracas but then face the logistical nightmare of having no route into exile that is beyond the reach American's long arm of justice.

Russia is keen for Venezuela to offer him asylum, and bid farewell to a man who has been holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport for two weeks.

Around the world: Sources say Snowden won't be allowed on the most direct flight from Moscow to Caracas. He may have to fly 14,000 miles clear across the Pacific to avoid American and EU airspaceUntitled-3.jpg

Still stuck: Edward Snowden made one of the biggest US intelligence leaks in history. His pleas for asylum have finally been accepted in Venezuela, but leaving Moscow is proving problematic

'He needs to choose a place to go,' insisted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov.

But
 sources say Snowden will not be allowed to board the only Aeroflot 
plane that offers direct connections to Caracas, a regular service to 
Cuban capital Havana.

The 
routing overflies both the EU and the US and there are fears the plane 
will be denied rights to Western airspace, and forced to land, leading 
to Snowden's arrest.

The direct distance from Moscow to Caracas is 6,175 miles but last night it appeared too far for Snowden.

Indeed, unless Russian secret services
 actively connive with his escape by a clandestine route, it is looking 
hard to see how he can flee Russia.

'Venezuela
 is waiting for an answer from Snowden. This, perhaps, is his last 
chance to receive political asylum,' said Russian MP Alexei Pushkov, 
seen as close to the Kremlin.

Otherwise his only option would be to remain in Russia and accept glamorous spy Anna Chapman's offer to marry him, he joked.

Venezuela
 president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to  grant asylum to Snowden, to 
protect him 'from the global persecution of the empire', meaning the US. 

Sticky situation: Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to grant Snowden asylum, but getting to Caracas involves a logistical and political nightmare that the Obama administration is trying to make even more difficult

With
 Russia getting publicly impatient with the US whistleblower's presence 
in its transit zone, his escape route is a logistical nightmare.

'Instead
 of going west to Venezuela, his obvious option is east to Vladivostok 
and then across the Pacific to Caracas,' said one source.

It would mean Russia allowing him to formally enter its territory, which so far it has refused to do, unwilling to upset the US.

Denied: An Aeroflot Airbus A330 plane heading to the Cuban capital Havana takes off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport July 6, 2013. Sources say Snowden won't be allowed onto the only direct flight to Caracas, via Havana, Cuba

Roundabout: Russia's Sheremetyevo airport outside Moscow where Snowden remains in flux. With a western flight blocked, he may have to fly 14,000 miles across the Pacific to reach Caracas

This
 would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring 
him close to the US state of Hawaii posing a risk to any private plane 
willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services.

'The
 only solution is to smuggle him on board a military or diplomatic 
plane, but even then the US last week managed to ground the president of
 Bolivia's plane when they thought Snowden was on board,' said another 
source.

President Evo Morales was subject to an humiliating delay at Vienna after his jet was refused permission to overfly the airspace of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain.

The Bolivian leader has since offered Snowden asylum as has Nicaragua.

That's about enough: Russian MP Alexei Pushkov has expressed the country's growing annoyance, and unwillingness to tolerate, Snowden's presence

Halted: Bolivia's Evo Morales said he would grant asylum to Snowden. Morales and other Latin American leaders expressed outrage over the recent grounding of the president's plane, which the U.S. believed carried Snowden

Fighting the power: Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega confirmed his country received an asylum request from Edward Snowden and said he would grant it if 'the circumstances allowed it'
