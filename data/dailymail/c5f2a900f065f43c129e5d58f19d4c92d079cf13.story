A storm forecast to be one of the worst on record in Alaska is lashing lashed the state's western coastline, tearing roofs off buildings and pushing water and debris into communities, authorities said.

The storm, which began hitting Alaska late on Tuesday after building over the North Pacific Ocean, brought winds measured at up to 89 miles (143 km) per hour and flooded parts of some Native villages along the coastline.

There were no reports of deaths or injuries as of Wednesday evening, and damage tallied so far was caused largely by wind and included reports of tin roofs flying off and power lines down, authorities said.

'This is a storm of epic proportions,
as it's being described,' said Jeff Osiensky, a meteorologist and 
regional warning coordinator for the National Weather Service. 'This is 
kind of ratcheted up to a level much higher than we've been accustomed 
to.'

'I think this would probably be about
a Category 3-type hurricane if we were to do some sort of a similar 
comparison,' he said. 'It's on the line of a pretty destructive 
hurricane.'

Category 3 hurricanes on the 
Saffir-Simpson scale, which have sustained winds exceeding 111 miles 
(178 km) per hour, can cause devastating damage to homes, buildings and 
utilities.

Osiensky said that by Wednesday 
evening wind speeds were diminishing but water levels would remain high 
and new surges of floodwaters were expected.

Most of western Alaska is at high 
risk, from the Yupik Eskimo community of Bethel in the Yukon-Kuskowim 
delta to the Inupiat Eskimo village of Wainwright on the North Slope, 
according to the National Weather Service.

But one of the hardest-hit areas so 
far has been Nome, a former Gold Rush boomtown famous as the end of the 
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and surrounding villages.

There, the storm tossed debris onto 
roads, making driving dangerous, city officials reported. Waves have 
launched 'fist-sized rocks' and logs up to two feet in diameter onto the
roadway, officials said.

'These objects would cause injury to any person that was struck,' the city's emergency managers said in a written statement.

Evacuations have been ordered in 
low-lying parts of Nome and other sites, with residents housed in 
schools and other public buildings. But large-scale evacuations out of 
the region are not considered feasible because weather conditions make 
flying hazardous, a state official said Tuesday.

Nome, with 3,600 residents, is one of
the largest cities in western Alaska. The communities spread along the 
coastline are mostly traditional Native settlements, with a few hundred 
to a few thousand inhabitants, and no roads linking communities.

The Alaska Division of Homeland 
Security and Emergency Management set up an incident command to respond 
to the storm. The U.S. Coast Guard has stationed helicopters and cutters
in the region to aid mariners involved in the crab fishery.

The Alaska National Guard activated an operations center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.

Powerful storms of this magnitude are
common at this time of year in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, but 
this storm is unusual because of its northward trajectory and the lack 
of sea ice in near-shore areas like Norton Sound off Nome, National 
Weather Service and other agency officials said.

'Forty years ago, a big storm like 
this would come through and the sea ice would act as sort of a buffer,' 
said Mark Serreze, director of the Snow and Ice Data Center.

'The Bering Sea has and always will 
have these strong storms. What is different now is their potential 
destructiveness as you lose the sea ice cover,' he added.

'It's barely beginning to wind down 
along the coast,' Stephen Kearney, a meteorologist for the Weather 
Service in Fairbanks, said late Wednesday.

'The sea level will remain steady 
into the early morning hours and then start to come down tomorrow 
morning,' he told the Anchorage Daily News.

The weather service said 'a potent 
upper level disturbance' rotating around the Bering Sea storm is 
expected to bring 3 to 8 inches (7 to 20 centimeters) of snowfall to the
Anchorage area by Thursday afternoon.

The service issued a winter weather advisory for Anchorage in effect until noon Thursday.

The last time the communities saw something similar was in November 1974, when a storm created a sea surge that measured more than 13 feet. The surge pushed beach driftwood above the level of the previous storm of its type in 1913.
