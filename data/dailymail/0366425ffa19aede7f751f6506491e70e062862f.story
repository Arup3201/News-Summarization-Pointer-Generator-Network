When a Memphis Grizzlies intern had his car stolen, the team decided they couldn't let Christmas go by without making it up to him.

Identified as Brandon on the team's Facebook page, the intern was waiting with veteran guard Vince Carter in the parking garage when the team surprised him.  

'My man had a tough time, he lost his car, somebody stole it,' Carter said before surprising Brandon. 'Everybody chipped in for him for Christmas, you know, it's the holiday season of giving. That's what we wanted to do.' 

The New York Daily News reports that the team then surprised him with a brand new Nissan bearing a bow. 

The Commercial Appeal reports that Henderson, an intern in basketball operations, had had his 1993 Chrysler New Yorker stolen while out listening to musicians at an art gallery. 

That was one day before Thanksgiving, just before the team went on a six-day trip. It was Henderson's only means of transportation.  

Griz players teamed up and purchased a new Nissan Altima, surprising the 24-year-old Henderson with the red-bow-covered car Friday morning before their loss to the Chicago Bulls.

Forward Quincy Pondexter had been blocking Brandon's view before stepping aside to reveal the new car.

'He's trying to hold back the tears right now, but, hey, he should cry,' Carter says. 

Also present are players Courtney Lee, Nick Calathahes, Tony Allen and Mike Conley.

Brandon hugs the teammates in gratitude as they egg him on to get behind the wheel of his new ride. 

'I don’t know how the guys found out,' Henderson told reporters. 'I kept it like that because I try to keep stuff that happens at home away from work. It didn’t seem real. It seemed like a dream. It’s like stuff you see on TV. They didn’t have to do it, but it’s a blessing.'
