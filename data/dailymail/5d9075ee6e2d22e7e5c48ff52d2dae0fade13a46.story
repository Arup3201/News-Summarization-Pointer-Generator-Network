An artist intends to sue the organisers of the London Olympics because he believes director Danny Boyle used his design for the opening ceremony set.

Lee Sendall, from Hull, entered drawings of a spiral mound in the middle of the countryside into an arts competition held by Olympic chiefs.

After not winning, he thought no more of it until he saw the Slumdog Millionaire director's memorable opening ceremony in July this year.

low-lying clouds and giant spiral-shaped mound as the centrepiece, with a

'Isles of Wonder': Director Danny Boyle's set for the spectacular £27million opening ceremony has a very similar design

Mr Sendall noticed that the spiral-shaped, verdant hill that formed the centrepiece of the spectacular event looked remarkably similar to the one he had entered into the 2009 competition.

The 42-year-old has now taken legal advice with a view to suing the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) for breach of copyright.

Mr Sendall and his friend Dominic Heffer entered their ‘Large Spiral Mound’ design as part of an Arts Council competition held in conjunction with London 2012.

The idea was for artists to come up with a project, such as a sculpture, that was associated with English regions.

Mr Sendall decided to build a grassy, spiral mound in East Yorkshire and created a series of postcards depicting the concept.

His design also included a small lake, low-lying clouds and a man running up the mound with the Olympic torch - all of which also featured in Boyle's ceremony.

The competition’s aim was not to find ideas for the opening ceremony, but Mr Sendall claims the organisers based the final product on his design.

Mr Sendall said: 'I entered the competition in the Yorkshire heat and did a brief proposal about building a spiral mound in East Yorkshire.

'I was lucky enough to be short-listed but wasn’t selected as the eventual winner.

'I moved on and put the idea on the shelf. There was still a possibility of doing it in the future.

'About two weeks before the Olympics, I saw an article in a newspaper which set out the design for the opening ceremony and there was a picture of a model by Danny Boyle.

'I was gobsmacked. The model had so many similarities to so much of our work.

'Our version was the mounds through the ages and the 2012 model looked like what ended up in the opening ceremony.

'I didn’t invent spiral mounds. The notion isn’t original but there were just too many similarities for it to be a coincidence, given that we had entered an Olympic competition.'

The ‘Isles of Wonder’ opening ceremony was seen by 26.9million people across the country.

It had the largest average audience for any broadcast since 1996 and was one of the top 20 most-watched UK television broadcasts of all time.

Mr Kendall has consulted lawyers about taking legal action but says the cost involved could force him to abandon his plans.

He said: 'I’m not angry, it’s more like a feeling of bemusement. Did I give away a concept that was used as the centrepiece of a £27million event?

'People were getting in touch with me on the night asking if Danny Boyle had got our permission to use our idea.

'If they were in any way inspired by our idea then Dominic and I should have had some form of recognition.

'Somebody like Danny Boyle saying these artists from Hull came up with this idea, that would obviously be very nice.'

A London 2012 spokeswoman denied the organisers had used Mr Sendall’s idea and said their set had been inspired by Glastonbury Tor.

He said: 'Danny Boyle was not involved in the Taking the Lead programme, which was funded by the Arts Council, and would not have seen any of the submissions.

'Danny Boyle’s vision for the opening set for the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony was inspired by the very well known Glastonbury Tor landmark and British history.'
