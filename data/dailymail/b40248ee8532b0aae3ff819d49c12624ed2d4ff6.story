A hotel has been forced to cover up a building site hoarding after complaints that it is sexist.

Malmaison, in Manchester, had put up a risque 7ft image of a scantily clad woman holding a power tool to hide ongoing construction work.

But author and Manchester University Professor Jeanette Winterson likened the image to 'soft porn'.

She said: 'Plenty of women on business stay at the Malmaison.

'To get to their hotel room at the end of a long day they must take in, or blank out, the message that women at work are really soft-porn babes.

'The hard-hat babes send out a message that aligns with male fantasy not female reality.

'And that's a problem.

'Suppose you are a girl who wants to go into the manual trades. Does the image of a skinny model in a strapless frock, pouting with a drill, do anything for your self-confidence and ambition?'

In response, the hotel placed a tongue-in-cheek banner over the image saying 'we've been asked to cover up'

She added: 'The joke is that as Britain falls down the equality ladder behind Rwanda and Nicaragua, and Victoria Beckham is named entrepreneur of the year for dressing us all in size zero - the nearest most women will get to being on the board is a strapless dress and a hard hat outside Malmaison.'

Kate Lloyd, of the Construction Industry Training Board, said the billboard was 'shocking, depressing and highly insulting'.

In response, the hotel has placed a tongue-in-cheek banner over the image reading: 'We've been asked to cover up while we're changing.'
