After years of battling depression, Fern Britton is now clearly feeling very comfortable in her own skin. Since leaving This Morning, the 57-year-old has carved out a successful career as a novelist alongside her TV work and as she sparkles as this month's Good Housekeeping cover girl.

In the interview, Fern talks about how she's over worrying about the signs of ageing: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life!'

She adds: 'I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’m either going to look odd, or I’m going to look old, and I’d prefer to be the woman I should be. I’m 57, and I look like a 57 year-old, and I’m happy.'

Touching on the depression that has affected her in the past the presenter admits to feeling angry about it, but says that she's starting to understand it more.

She says: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. 

'Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' 

The 57-year-old, who has just written her fifth novel, says that she is over worrying about ageing

Fern and husband TV chef Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary in May. She says: 'Phil and I have a really, really good relationship – every day we tell each other we love each other – and there are also times when we would cheerfully bash each other as well!

'He’s been a very good father, stepfather and partner to me. He’s the only person who’s ever always been right in my corner. On the day we married he told me, in the car, I will never let you down. That was a vow. And he never has. We’ve had our moments – it wouldn’t be normal if we hadn’t – but we’re very solid.'

But life's not always glamorous in the Britton-Vickery household. Fern says: 'I rarely have make-up on when I’m at home. I’m at the Co-op, I’m on the school run, or walking in the woods with Phil and the dog – that’s real life. Phil is a very handsome man, but at home, he walks around mostly just in his pants, without having shaved for a few days! I’m not in the club of people who care about these things – I just don’t care.

Fern and Phil, 53, have one daughter, Winnie, 13, and Phil is a stepfather to Fern's other children, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18..

With three children flying the nest it's time for Fern to focus on new challenges and she jokes about a surprise career change, saying: 'I might retrain to be a midwife. I’d love that…'
