Adam Hammill has been bailed following allegation of assault. Above, in action for Huddersfield Town

A former England under-21 footballer has been arrested over claims he attacked a female paramedic called out to a 999 emergency outside a late night vodka bar.

Adam Hammill, 24, was detained after allegations one of the ambulance crew was manhandled after being called out to treat another man in the street at 3.30am.

The former Liverpool Academy star was kept in custody for over 15 hours and was questioned on suspicion of common assault before being freed on police bail.

If charged and convicted of common assault he could face up to six months in prison.

The incident occurred after pub closing time in the early hours of Sunday when Hammill, presently on loan to Championship team Huddersfield Town from Wolverhampton Wanderers, was out at the Revolution Bar in Liverpool city centre.

Paramedics had been called out after another man had required treatment after falling ill outside the bar which had closed 90 minutes earlier.

But as the female paramedic tried to help him it was claimed she was 'assaulted'.

Dave Kitchin, from the North West Ambulance Service, said: 'The Trust can confirm that an ambulance crew attended an incident on Temple Court in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Sunday morning and one of our staff was the victim of an assault.

'Our ambulance crews work tirelessly 
in all weathers, day and night, to come to the aid of people who need 
our help and should be able to do so without fear of assault either 
physical or verbal.

'We understand that the man has been released on police bail and we will do all we can to support their enquiry.

'Despite my many years working for 
the ambulance service, I still find it difficult to comprehend why an 
individual would set out to injure someone who is there to help and 
treat them.'

A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said: 'A 24-year-old man from Bootle was arrested on suspicion of common assault in the early hours of Sunday, October 7.

'The man was released on police bail on Sunday night pending further enquiries.'

Winger Hammill formed part of Liverpool’s 2006 FA Youth Cup winning side but failed to make a league appearance for the club at senior level.

He had loan spells at Dunfermline, Southampton and Blackpool before being sold to Barnsley in 2009 for a six-figure sum. He joined Wolves in 2011 and Huddersfield Town last August on a loan deal until 13 January 2013.

He has represented England U21’s and was capped at the U19 level. He now qualifies to play for the Republic of Ireland at international level due to his late grandfather being Irish.

Nigel Clibbens, chief executive of Huddersfield Town FC, said: 'We have been made aware of an incident which has taken place in Merseyside involving Adam Hammill.'
