Having earned a reputation as one of football’s most charmingly and free-thinking unique individuals, it came as something of a surprise on Monday to hear Jurgen Klinsmann fall in to the tiresome trap of asking questions of the referee’s impartiality ahead of Tuesday's last 16 clash with Belgium.

Asked by an American journalist if he had an issue with the fact that Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi will be able to speak French to the Belgian players at Arena Fonte Nova on Tuesday night, the USA coach remarkably claimed that he had.

'We hope it’s not a concern,' said Klinsmann. 'He did two games already and did them well. I hope he continues to referee in the perfect way he has so far.'

Upset: USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann is unhappy at the appointment of Djamel Haimoudi for their Belgium tie

Weary: Klinsmann is concerned that Haimoudi's native French language may sway decisions in Belgium favour

International pedigree: Haimoudi has refereed two World Cup matches so far including England vs Costa Rica

Strong words: Klinsmann added that he would give Haimoudi's appointment the benefit of doubt

Out of reach? USA are looking to go one better than at the 2010 World Cup when they lost in the last 16

'But is it a good feeling? No, because
 Algeria came from same group as Belgium and he speaks French like their
 players. He will be able to speak to their players and not to us.

'It is also the same country we beat in the last second at the last World Cup, but it is what it is.

'I know it’s tricky for FIFA to select the right referee for the right games.

'We respect the decision and hope that everything goes well. We will give him the benefit of the doubt.'

To
 suggest that there should be any doubt about Haimoudi’s partiality was a
 dubious tactic from Klinsmann. Were he to say such a thing before game 
in the Barclays Premier League, for example, the former Tottenham 
forward would be charged by the FA.

Here
 in Brazil, though, it seems that anything goes and it was left to 
Belgium coach Marc Wilmotts to defend the integrity of the referee and, 
to some extent, the competition.

Here's how Sportsmail expects Belgium and USA to line-up against each other in Tuesday's last 16 clash.

'I don't think the referee is there to talk, he is there to referee,' said Wilmots. 'Three times we were in the last 16 and decisions didn't go our way. I think it's finding excuses before the game.

I
 looked at the English referee Howard Webb and he disallowed the goal 
for the hosts Brazil. It's up to the referee to make the right 
decision.'

Having advanced 
from a tough group containing his own country Germany, Ghana and 
Portugal, it is a shame that Klinsmann has attempted to colour the build
 up to this game with such peculiar comments.

Apart
 perhaps from Costa Rica, the USA are the surprise package of this World
 Cup and facing a Belgian team that hasn’t been convincing in the group 
stages and may be without injured Manchester City captain Vincent 
Kompany, Klinsmann’s team has a sporting chance on Tuesday evening.

At home in the United States, Klinsmann believes support is growing.

'Advancing
 in the knock out stage means the world to me,' he said. 'You start a 
process, which I started a few years ago, and we see things developing 
on many fronts.

Unfazed: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots says Haimoudi's appointment won't damage the last 16 tie's integrity

The last time Belgium made it past the last 16 at a World Cup they reached the semi-finals - that was at Mexico 86.

There
 they were beaten 2-0 by Argentina thanks to two goals from Diego 
Maradona... and if they make it past the USA they will face Argentina in
 the quarters.

'But you have benchmarks and you get judged by the World Cup. This is huge, it only comes along every four years.

'You don’t’ want to wait four more years, you want to do it now. The sky is the limit. You want to clear one hurdle after another, but this is a big hurdle, make no mistake.

'We made it through a difficult group, but we now want more, we are hungry. We have a lot of respect for Belgium, but no fear at all.

'The support back home means a lot to us. We get it communicated from back home.

'The energy that comes from the US, with the thousands of fans in Brazil, you can see where the game is going. You can’t stop it anymore, it’s breaking through.

Hopes of a nation: Klinsmann has been delighted at the support of the USA national team at the World Cup

'It
 is coming through at every level, there are kids playing it everywhere,
 but the recruiting office is the national team, in every country

'But when the game starts, you have to prove it and get the message through,

'The enthusiasm is incredible. Our fans in Recife were the loudest, even though we lost to Germany.

'They
 will be here and the loudest again in Salvador. In San Francisco, New 
York and Jacksonville, we had packed crowds and a great send off.

'It’s a cool moment right now and we have to take advantage of it.'
