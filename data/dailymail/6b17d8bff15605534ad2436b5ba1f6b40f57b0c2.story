Fifteen people died in a plane crash after it tried to land near a treacherous high-altitude mountain airport in Nepal's northern Himalayas.

The plane, which was carrying 21 people, crashed into the side of a steep hill as it tried to land at Jomsom Airport, a gateway to a popular tourist and trekking destination about 125 miles north west of the capital Kathmandu.

Four survivors in a critical condition were flown by helicopter to the nearby city of Pokhara for treatment, said Laxmi Raj Sharma, chief government administrator in the area.

Six people survived in total, including a Nepalese air hostess.

Earlier today government officials said that rescuers recovered at least nine bodies from the wreckage site. It has now been confirmed that 15 have died in the tragedy.

The plane was carrying two pilots and a 
flight attendant - all Nepalese - along with 16 Indians and two Danish 
citizens, both of whom survived, officials said.

Television footage showed the Danes 
being taken inside a hospital in the nearby city of Pokhara, the man 
being led on foot and the woman crying in pain as she was carried on a 
stretcher.

The plane was turning to land at 
Jomsom Airport when it crashed, said Laxmi Raj Sharma, chief government 
administrator in the area.

It broke into pieces but did not 
catch fire. Sharma said an initial investigation indicated the Dornier 
aircraft, which belonged to the local Agni Air company, might have had 
technical problems.

Rescue was swift because the plane crashed just few yards from an army camp at Jomsom.

The
injured were taken to a local hospital, said Mr Aryal, who is based at 
Jomsom town. The airport is about 125 miles north west of the capital 
Katmandu.

Police spokesman Binod Singh revealed the Agni Air plane plunged into a hill close to Jomsom near the Annapurna mountain range.

He said: 'The plane was about to land
at Jomsom airport. It hit a muddy slope and the plane is now buried in 
the side of the hill.

'Fifteen people have been killed. Thirteen of them were Indian tourists and the other two were Nepali pilots.'

The Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet said
it spoke to the Danish passengers by phone at the hospital and 
identified them as Emilie Joergensen and Andreas Rasch.

'We were thrown around. The seats were unfastened and we were squeezed between seats and bodies'

It quoted Joergensen as saying: 'We were thrown around. The seats were unfastened and we were squeezed between seats and bodies.'

She said they had to climb over 'hands and arms' to get out of the plane.

'I think it was easy for us to get out because we sat in the back and were closest to the exit,' Joergensen said.

She said they were on their way to Jomsom where they planned to go trekking.

Rajendra Singh Bhandari, Nepal police regional spokesman, said the passengers
had chartered the flight to take them from the central tourist hub of 
Pokhara to Muktinath, a sacred place for Hindus and Buddhists at the 
foot of the Thorong La Himalayan mountain pass.

He added: 'A Nepal army barracks was near the accident site which made the rescue of survivors easier.'.

The Jomsom airport is a gateway to a 
popular destination for trekkers and for Hindu pilgrims on their way to 
the revered Muktinath temple. It is about 125 miles - or 200 kilometers -
northwest of Katmandu.

Nepalese Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai expressed his condolences over the deaths.

The crash was the second deadly air accident for Agni Air in less than two years.

In August 2010 one of the private carrier's Everest-bound planes crashed in bad weather near Kathmandu, killing all 14 people on board, including four Americans, a Japanese and a British national.

The craft had been returning to Kathmandu after poor visibility prevented it from landing at Lukla, its intended destination in a popular trekking spot in eastern Nepal.

Air travel is popular in Nepal, which has only a very limited road network. Many communities, particularly in the mountains and hills, are accessible only on foot or by air.

Aviation accidents are relatively common, particularly during the summer monsoon, when visibility is usually at its worst.

A small Buddha Air plane taking tourists on a sightseeing trip around Mount Everest crashed in September last year, killing all 19 people on board.
