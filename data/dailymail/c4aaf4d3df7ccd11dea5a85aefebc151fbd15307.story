rushing to get their last Christmas gifts.

He told MailOnline: 'One lady did come in to ask where the nearest cash point is.

'I
 told her Barclays but she told me the bank was surrounded by police. I 
didn't think too much at the time, I guess I thought they might be 
unloading cash.

Eye-witness Genevieve Robson took to Twitter to find out what had happened as hundreds of shoppers rushed about to get the last of their Christmas shopping

'But an armed robbery, I can't believe it. On Christmas Eve, it is surprising, there are so many people about.'

Another eye-witness, who worked at the nearby drycleaners Clean and Press, said she and her colleagues saw blue lights.

'It
 was a surprise,' she said. 'They were very quiet, but one of the girls 
was smoking a cigarette and noticed all the police cars around the 
bank.'
