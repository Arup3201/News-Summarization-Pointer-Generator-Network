Arms outstretched in a gesture of helplessness, a Tube worker races alongside a runaway train that was to come within seconds of causing a major disaster deep beneath the streets of London.

The 39-tonne maintenance wagon ran for 16miles over four miles on the busy Northern Line, while ahead of it a packed commuter train tried to accelerate out of its path – the driver skipping stations and ordering terrified passengers to move into the front carriages.

The 66-foot long wagon careered through seven stations on the London Underground as control staff watched it slowly accelerating towards the centre of the capital.

A ‘terrible tragedy’ was only averted 
when they diverted the passenger train on to another branch of the line 
while the maintenance wagon gradually ran out of steam on an incline.

One Tube worker at the time said the 
two trains had come ‘bloody close’ while a report claimed they were just
40 seconds from a major disaster.

Awful: A court heard yesterday how the runaway train came within 2,000ft of causing a 'terrible tragedy' after tearing along four miles of track

The Old Bailey heard this week how two
maintenance workers leapt from the wagon near Highgate station, North 
London, after it broke free from a train towing it at 6.30am on August 
13, 2010. Three Tube companies were in the dock for health and safety 
breaches.

Video footage which emerged after the 
case shows one of the workers running down the platform alongside the 
train before he places his hands on his head in despair.

Ahead of it, a train was collecting 
passengers at Archway and control room staff told the driver to close 
his doors, accelerate away and not stop at stations. He told passengers 
to move to the front of the train.

Shortly after the incident, passenger 
Tom Redfern, who had boarded at Archway, said: ‘As soon as we pulled 
away the driver came on the tannoy and said “There is an emergency, will
everyone move towards the front of the train”.

‘There was a ripple of panic. I went 
from half asleep to a big adrenaline rush. We knew the situation was 
dangerous because we were going fast.

'Even by the driver’s voice, we 
could tell it was serious.’ Other video footage shows bemused commuters 
waiting on a packed platform at Archway station as the wagon rumbles 
past them at speed, bearing down on the train that has just departed.

Attempts were made to derail the 
runaway unit by switching the points against it at Camden Town and 
Mornington Crescent stations, but the measure had no effect.

The two trains came within 2,000ft of 
each other before the passenger train was diverted on to the line’s Bank
branch, with the runaway wagon continuing on the Charing Cross branch, 
finally coming to rest when it reached an upward slope near Warren 
Street station.

Jonathan Ashley-Norman, prosecuting 
for the Office of Rail Regulation, said there could have been a 
‘terrible tragedy’ had it not been for the ‘prompt and skilful actions’ 
of control room staff.

The court was told a coupler which had
been attached to the broken-down track maintenance wagon broke, 
allowing it to slip away from the train pulling it. Two workers on the 
wagon jumped clear, realising that, without any power, the brakes on it 
would not work.

Judge Richard Hone said the 16 minutes
the train was out of control must have ‘seemed like an extremely 
frightening eternity’ to those involved.

‘Staff and passengers were put at high risk of injury or death.’

London Underground, maintenance 
provider Tube Lines and the German operator of the unit Schweerbau 
admitted health and safety breaches. They were each fined £100,000.
