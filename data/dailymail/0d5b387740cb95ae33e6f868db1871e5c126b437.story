A carer has been jailed after she helped a prolific burglar steal from the homes of her vulnerable patients.

Janet Kaye, 55, claimed she was pressured into helping Craig Armitage take valuable property from homes in Brighouse and Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

With her help, he stole hundreds of pounds in cash and antiques, including candlesticks worth £500 from a 94-year-old woman who was in hospital after a fall. 

Kaye, from Meltham in West Yorkshire, was jailed for three years. She admitted involvement in one burglary and was found guilty of involvement in a second following a trial.

Armitage, 41, from Huddersfield, was jailed for three years and five months after admitting to two charges of burglary and one charge of burglary with intent. 

Bradford Crown Court heard Kaye was seen acting suspiciously near the flat of a 94-year-old woman who had been taken into hospital in Brighouse last October.

A neighbour reported her concerns and when the flat was checked, it was found that valuable candlesticks, paintings and ornaments had been stolen.

Kaye had been employed as a carer for the victim and was suspected of involvement in the crime as there was no sign of a forced entry.

Prosecutor Ben Crosland said during the police inquiry officers seized a mobile phone belonging to Armitage and found the number of an antiques shop.

When police officers visited the premises the owner said he had bought items from the couple, who were then living in Longwood, Huddersfield.

Although some of the stolen items were recovered, Mr Crosland said the candlesticks had not been found.

A few days later, Armitage used information from Kaye to burgle the home of two more vulnerable clients who lived in Huddersfield.

About £300 in cash was stolen while the two women were asleep in their beds.

The court head that Armitage's fingerprint was later found on one of the cash boxes.

Around two weeks later, Armitage tried to break into another house in Bradford, during the day, but eventually left empty-handed.  

Barrister Joanne Shepherd, for Kaye, said she had long-standing health problems and was the primary carer for her own mother.

Miss Shepherd said Kaye felt under pressure at the time of the offences due to Armitage's drug addiction.

She submitted that Kaye had learned her lesson and urged Judge John Potter to impose a suspended prison term.

But the judge said the offences against Kaye's clients were 'particularly mean' and involved the targeting of vulnerable victims for the defendants' own selfish and greedy needs.

The court also heard that Armitage's previous convictions, dating back to 1989, included offences of house burglary and robbery.

Judge Potter said his career of offending had 'spread misery in our community'.
