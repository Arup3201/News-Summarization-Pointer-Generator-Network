When Steven Gerrard was in a really bad mood he would go home to his wife Alex and bite her head off.

Then it would be the turn of the kids - Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes - to hear their dad grumbling about his career-threatening groin injury in 2010.

On Tuesday, Gerrard spoke of being a better man after private sessions with psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters.

Changed: England's Steven Gerrard praised the appointment of psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to the team staff

‘I had one-on-one meetings with him,’ revealed Gerrard ahead of Wednesday night’s clash with Denmark at Wembley.

‘I understand the different parts of the brain, how they work, when they function and why you think certain things, why you bite your children’s heads off from time to time, blame Alex for everything - blah, blah, blah.’

There will be scepticism  about Peters’ appointment for the World Cup, but this is a smart move.

Endorsement: Gerrard had one-on-one meetings with Peters when going through a groin injury

Desperate: Luke Shaw is keen to make an impression on Roy Hodgson

Neat touch: Wayne Rooney juggles the ball during the training session at Enfield on Monday

Gerrard was brave enough to confront 
his demons at a time when he wondered whether he would ever play for 
Liverpool or England again.

‘I
 had a groin avulsion and it’s a career-threatening injury,’ he said. 
‘I’d seen three or four  surgeons and they weren’t really convincing me 
that I could play again so I turned to him.

'He helps you with 
positivity, the power of thought and staying upbeat, that sort of 
stuff.  Without being a drama queen it was a very important stage in my 
career.

‘I think it was one
 of the  physios at Liverpool who suggested I might need a bit of help 
from a psychologist so I said, “Who’s the best?”

‘I was told he was the best.’

Heads up: Jack Wilshere keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against Denmark

Something old, something new: It's routine for Wayne Rooney but Luke Shaw is preparing for his England debut

Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge praised Dr Peters in an interview last October as he hit top form for his club.

'Steve had helped a lot in terms of mindset,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'He's all about self-belief: don't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something, just let it happen.'

Dr Peters made Sturridge give himself a mark out of 10 for his Liverpool performances so far.

'Steve told me to say high but I've never been one to be comfortable. I'm uncomfortable getting comfortable. I
 think, for my capacity as a footballer, I'd sat a seven out of 10. 
Probably even six - I'm being kind to myself saying a seven. I can do a 
lot better than I'm doing now.'

Peters,
 who has worked with Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, was nicknamed
 ‘head coach’ when he worked with British Cycling and his book Taming 
the Chimp was referred to several times by Gerrard.

‘He just simplifies what’s going on,’ added England’s captain. ‘If you read the book you’ll understand an awful lot more.’

Peters
 is employed by Liverpool and has been seconded by the national team for
 the World Cup.

He will join them before they head to Miami to begin 
their tournament preparations at the end of May.

Part
 of his task will be to help England’s players settle into a new 
environment as they spend weeks away from families, friends and the 
WAGS.

Simplify: Gerrard refers to Peters' book Taming the Chimp when explaining how his techniques worked for him

World beaters: Dr Peters has helped snooker's Ronnie O'Sullivan and cycling Sir Bradley Wiggins to victory

Manager Roy Hodgson 
is convinced his squad will benefit. 

‘I don’t heap too much pressure 
on him and suggest we will now be better at a World Cup and suddenly we 
will never miss a penalty or no player will ever get sent off or lose 
his temper,’ said Hodgson.

‘I
 have made it clear that every player doesn’t have to go to individual 
meetings with Steve. But we hope having his expertise is going to 
encourage the players and that he can provide a tool they can benefit 
from.’

Still got it: Hodgson gets involved while on the pitch in Enfield

WHO IS DR STEVE PETERS?A consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate industries.WHO HAS HE HELPED?Peters's clients include Team GB cyclists such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Liverpool and England’s 2007 Rugby World Cup squad.WHAT ARE HIS METHODS?Peters works to a principle called ‘The Chimp Paradox’, which says the brain is split into three parts: the rational ‘human’ section, the illogical ‘chimp’ section and a computer for storing information.

The way athletes control their ‘chimp’ dictates how well they perform. Put simply, athletes need to control their surges of emotion. HOW DOES IT WORK IN PRACTICE?Peters gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition. For each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it.

Peters also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control. For example, footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve.

However, he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there. 

THE CLIENT LISTSir Bradley Wiggins, Sir Chris Hoy, Chris Froome, Victoria Pendleton, Team Sky, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Steven Gerrard, Liverpool FC, Craig Bellamy, England 2007 World Cup rugby squad, Head of UK Athletics’ psychology team, Dylan Hartley, Lizzie Simmonds, Nicole Cooke, Sarah Stevenson, Karina Bryant, Georgia Harland
