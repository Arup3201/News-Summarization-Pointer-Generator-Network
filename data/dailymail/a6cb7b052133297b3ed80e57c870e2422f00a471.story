A naked homeowner tackled a burglar in his own home and pinned him down until police arrived, a court heard.

Householder Tom Best, 22, was asleep in bed at his home in Middlesbrough when he heard a disturbance in the early hours of the morning and went to investigate.

The bar manager discovered burglar Delroy Daley, 34, but instead of fleeing, Mr Best rugby tackled him to the ground while still completely naked.

Mr Best pinned Daley down and detained him with the help of a neighbour until police arrived at the scene.

Daley - who has 77 offences on his record which includes a string of burglaries - was yesterday jailed for four years at Teesside Crown Court.

The court heard how Mr Best's girlfriend - who was five-and-a-half months pregnant - and her two nieces were in the flat at the time of the raid on July 28.

Mr Best was woken at 2am when sensor 
lights in the hall came on and the intruder clumsily made a noise when 
he tripped over some steps.

A neighbour joined Mr Best after hearing the screams of the girls and his frantic 31-year-old partner Nicola McNaughton.

Christopher Knox, defending, told the court that Daley did not intend to harm anyone and breaking in was a spur of the moment thing.

He said after getting inside, Daley saw one of the young girls asleep on a sofa in the lounge and was leaving when he was tackled.

Daley later told police that he froze when the home-owner ran at him, and said: 'Before I knew it, I was covered in blood.'

Mr Knox told Judge Simon Bourne-Arton: 'In the struggle that took place, the reality is he came off worse.

'He accepts there was a struggle with the householder and accepts he would have been terrified, confronting someone in his home at night.'

Daley, from Middlesbrough, who admitted burglary, was told by the judge: 'This is a bad case and you know it is bad.

'It was a burglary committed at night when the occupants were asleep, they were disturbed and a struggle ensued.

'Although you may not have got the better of that struggle, you were quite prepared to get into it. You have a very, very bad record.

'You were full of drugs. There was no thought process, no thought of the impact or misery you cause to those whose home you went into.'

Miss McNaughton told of her fears for 
the unborn baby, and described it as 'the singularly most terrifying 
incident I've been involved in'.

Mr Best added: 'I was concerned with my 
girlfriend being five-and-a-half months pregnant and that the kids were
in the living room.

'I'm just glad it all ended OK and the 
family weren't hurt or anything apart from being shaken up by it all.'
