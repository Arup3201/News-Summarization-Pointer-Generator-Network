A week is a long time not only in politics but also in football.

Just as governments can be brought down in seven days, so the world game can be changed irrevocably in that brief time span.

The carnival which has kicked off Brazil 2014, in all its multi-coloured spectacle and dazzling excitement, has altered long-held perceptions about football in the minds of millions.

Carnival: The first week of the World Cup has altered the perception of football in the minds of millions

Suddenly the Champions League is no longer the zenith, nor the Premier League or La Liga the blinkered obsession.

Something far more profound and enchanting is happening here. Something which is capturing the hearts of the world’s population.

It can be seen on the faces of the fans in the stadia  as they exude a passion for their national teams which transcends the tribal support for club football.

It is inspiring a a fraternity between peoples of nations who, eager though they are to win, are finding a bond with rival supporters which is rooted in their fascination with the game.

Quite simply, it means more.

Also to the players, many of whom are surpassing themselves as they respond to the hopes and exhortations of their public.

There is nothing wrong with patriotism providing it is married to mutual respect.

So even as many of the physical challenges have bordered on the brutal, still sportsmanship flourishes.

The most vivid example of that came when Thiago Silva, the Brazilian who is probably the best centre-back in the world, lunged into a desperate assault on Mexico’s Chicharito.

Silva knew in his heart he had done wrong. He shook the hand of the referee who booked him, in contrition not irony. Then he helped his victim back to his feet and could clearly be lip-read repeating to him ‘desculpa.’ Forgive me.

Which Chicharito did, with an embrace.

That exchange was as important in its way as the goal rush which has hall-marked a World Cup imbued with the ambition to win, not crippled by fear of defeat.

How pleasing it is to include England in that recognition.

As Roy Hodgson’s team launch us into week two of this tournament they do so admired by all, even though they lost game one to Italy.

Given a manager deeply schooled in international football, England have caught the spirit of Brazil. Hodgson sent them out to attack the Italians even though he was conscious of the risks and they were winners in the estimation of most who watched them despite being narrowly defeated.

When Jose Mourinho, the arch pragmatist, commends you for the manner of your losing then you must have done an awful lot right.

Now, in Sao Paolo against the Uruguay of Luis Suarez, England have a wonderful opportunity to justify all the praise. 

These South Americans, with Suarez watching from the bench in the last phase of his recovery from injury, were truly awful in their defeat by Costa Rica. This Is England’s chance to begin that rare process in World Cups, qualifying after losing the opening match.

That does not mean, however, that they should simply carry on where they left off against Italy.

Hodgson needs to make adjustments which can take maximum advantage of Uruguay’s weaknesses in defence and midfield. He must also tighten up his own rear-guard against Suarez and Edison Cavani.

There was a slight but critical imbalance in the team edged out by Italy.

With Wayne Rooney played out of position on the left to help accommodate that trio of young forwards – Sterling, Sturridge and Welbeck – Andrea Pirlo was able to control the game.

That also exposed space behind attack-minded left back Leighton Baines which Pirlo and Co cleverly exploited.

Shoring up the defence is not merely a matter of changing personnel in the back four, even though of the two Phils I personally would prefer Jones to Jagielka.  They need better protection by the midfield and one way of doing that would be to define captain Steve Gerrard as purely the anchor there and bring back Frank Lampard to play in front of him, there to offer his experience to Sterling and Barkley.

With Rooney and Sturridge up front, something like this 4-1-3-2 team would be more like it: Hart – Johnson, Jones, Cahill, Baines – Gerrard – Sterling, Lampard, Barkley – Sturridge, Rooney.

Hodgson can find now the template for a run at least as far as the quarter finals.

And if that surprises many, well this World Cup is full of surprises. Most of them pleasant, including Van Persie and Robben leading the Dutch demolition of Spanish tiki-taka, the one surge of genius with which Lionel Messi dragged himself out of a trough and Argentina to much-need victory over Bosnia Herzegovina, the brush strokes from Neymar which suggests Brazil are still just about favourites,  Muller’s clinical finishing which raises the prospect that Germany might become the first European winners of a World Cup in the Americas… and all those goals.

None of this happened in South Africa four years ago.  It needed football to come back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game. 

All the doubts about  that decision by FIFA have been swept away on a tidal wave of brilliance, with hardly a dull moment.

A week a long time in politics? The football has also given the Brazilian government a respite from the social unrest fuelled by poverty, deprivation and economic inequality.

That first match of week one, played by Brazil and Croatia in Sao Paolo last Thursday to a sound-track of protesters battling riot police in the streets, seems a very long time ago.
