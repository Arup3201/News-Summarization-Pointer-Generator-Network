A Nigerian resident faces charges that he set up an online dating profile using a photo of Montana's attorney general and falsified stories about overseas business problems to scam several women.

Felony charges against Kazeem Owonla, 44, were filed in Indiana, where one woman reported sending more than $100,000 to a man who represented himself as an electrical engineer who was working in Egypt.

A Kosciusko County deputy found bank transfers from the woman were ending up in an account owned by Owonla, who was in the U.S. on a visitor's visa last year.

Owonla is alleged to have used the name 'John Tony Hagan' as his alias name, while using the picture of Montana Attorney General Tim Fox. 

Federal agents contacted officers in Georgia early Wednesday while Owonla was on a flight to the United States. He was arrested at the Atlanta airport.

Owonla will be returned to Indiana, where prosecutors say his bond is set at $150,000 cash.
