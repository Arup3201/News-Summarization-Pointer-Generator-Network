Former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown's elder daughter Ayla married her longtime love this weekend at their home in Nashville, Tennessee.

The country music singer, 26, got engaged to boyfriend Keith Weiser, 29, on New Year's Eve after he popped the question while she was performing onstage in Massachusetts.

And the couple looked happy as ever as they tied the knot on Saturday in front of 150 guests, with Ayla wearing cowboy boots under her strapless bridal gown to add some country flare.

Wedding bells: Ayla Brown, 26,  the elder daughter of former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, married her longtime love Keith Weiser this weekend at their home in Nashville, Tennessee

The theme of the ceremony was 
'southern backyard BBQ,' according to Ayla's official website, with a 
hearty menu of ribs, barbecue chicken, filet mignon, corn, mashed 
potatoes and house salad.

Ayla,
 who was a contestant on American Idol in 2006, wore her wavy tresses in
 a chic chignon, accessorizing the look with a simple pear strand 
necklace and white headband.

Meanwhile,
 her groom looked dapper in a light grey suit and pink tie to match her 
bouquet. Each had five friends in their respective wedding parties.

And in a sweet family shot, the blushing bride smiles alongside her mother, TV reporter Gail Huff, and her younger sister Arianna, who wore a pink gown.

This summer has been a busy one for 
the Brown family; in July, Arianna tied the knot with fiance Jim Hendry -
 one of her father's ex-staffers - in New Hampshire.

The
 24-year-old, who is training to become a veterinarian, wore her 
mother's wedding dress during the ceremony, which took place at Flag 
Hill Winery in Lee.

Arianna and Ayla first launched into the public eye after their father infamously described them as 'available' during his 2010 acceptance speech.

And back in January, he revealed to the Inside Track that he was involved in Keith's surprise proposal to his eldest.

The look of love: A thrilled Ayla posted on her Facebook page after the proposal: 'Thank you to Keith Weiser for making my dreams come true'

'He’s
 had the ring for a while, he had it specially made for her,' said the political commentator.

'He flew up here under the guise of spending New Year’s with us and 
during her second set, the encore, he asked her onstage in front of a 
few thousand people, he explained, adding: 'We're very happy.'

A thrilled Ayla took to social media to share the big news, posting photos of herself with her future husband wearing her diamond engagement band.

'Thank you to Keith Weiser for making my 
dreams come true,' she wrote on Facebook.

'I didn't think 2013 could be any better 
until this happened at my show last night,' she wrote. 'I love you Keith and I can’t 
wait to spend the rest of my life with you!'

Keith, from Hamilton, Ohio, is a former minor league baseball 
player who retired from the sport after eight years last June. He is now focused on teaching and runs training camps in the area where he grew up.
