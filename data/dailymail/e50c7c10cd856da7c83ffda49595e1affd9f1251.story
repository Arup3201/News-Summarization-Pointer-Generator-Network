Matlock’s mother’s boyfriend, Nicholas Barbee, 21, was arrested on a charge of second degree manslaughter. 

Paducah police said Barbee admitted to accidentally shooting Matlock. Barbee could be seen on WPSD Local 6 news crying uncontrollably as police questioned him.

Matlock's grandmother, Kathy-Marie Lopez, told the local news channel that Barbee had recently bought the gun because of a rise in recent break-ins in the neighborhood.

‘The gun was brought to protect those children due to the area deteriorating where they lived,’ Lopez said as her voice trembled. ‘He stepped up to the plate and took over.’

Lopez said that Barbee was taking the gun out of a cabinet when the safety lock on it failed and Braydion was struck in the head.

‘Braydion we love you.  We miss you. We know you are smiling now because you never stop smiling,’ Lopez said. ‘He's just the best child you would ever want to have and the best grandchild.’

Lopez said she believes that the tragic incident was an accident and called Barbee a great guy.

‘He's hurting,’ she said.  ‘I talked to him last night and all he could say was he was so sorry.’

Lopez told WPSD that her grandson is in a better place now and that she knows she will see him again.

Barbee is being held in a local county jail on a $10,000 cash bond.

Paducah's Chick-Fil-A hosted a fundraiser for Matlock's family on Monday.

The company said that a portion of the sales will go to the family to help cover funeral costs.

Beloved: 'Braydion we love you. We miss you. We know you are smiling now because you never stop smiling,' his grandmother said. 'He's just the best child you would ever want to have and the best grandchild'
