Many years may have passed since they last met, but the bonds of friendship among these women have clearly stood the test of time.

But this is a reunion that, until recently, seemed impossible because three of these former schoolfriends have spent the past 30-plus years thinking one of their old gang was dead.

They found out they were wrong when Christine Greenslade, now 66, decided to trace the chums she grew up with in Penzance, Cornwall.

Mistaken: The three schoolfriends were stunned to hear Christine Greenslade was alive after believing she had died 30 years ago

When she got in touch, they were stunned to hear she was alive after reading of her ‘untimely’ death in a newspaper obituary in 1980. 

The mix-up happened when Mrs Greenslade’s mother, Pamela, died of cancer and her daughter wanted to let her former community know.

The family had moved to Ipswich and Mrs Greenslade phoned the local newspaper in their native Cornwall to place an obituary.

But the paper confused the women’s names and told readers that Christine had died aged 34.

Mrs Greenslade, a painter who now lives in France, discovered the bungle after revisiting her first home and phoning friends from St Gertrude’s Convent.

Four of the gang have now met up 50 years on from when they were last pictured together – in the same pub. 

The original photo showed Mrs Greenslade alongside Audrey Upton, Viv Albright, Jane Woodall (now Johnson) and Linda Turney. 

They met again at the Admiral Benbow pub after Mrs Greenslade invited them for a drink.

Mrs Greenslade said: ‘It is obviously fantastic to see everyone.

'When I got in touch with Viv Albright she sounded very odd.

She rang me back and said, “I’m terribly sorry, but we all thought you were dead”.’

Mrs Johnson, 66, from Ironbridge, Shropshire, said: ‘Chris is one of my oldest friends and to have lost her all those years because of a silly mix-up was terrible.’

The only one missing from the original line-up was Mrs Upton.

Mrs Greenslade said: ‘We’d absolutely love to hear from her.’
