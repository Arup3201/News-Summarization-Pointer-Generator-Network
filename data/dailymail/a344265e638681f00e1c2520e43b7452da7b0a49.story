It's already had a claim to fame, with cups of the smoky-tasting tea being served at state dinners in Kensington Palace and Balmoral Castle.

And now Dalreoch smoked white tea's status has been lifted even higher after the pricey brew - which costs £35 for 15g - was named as the best tea in the world.

Grown by The Wee Tea Company, Scotland's first tea company in Perthshire, came up trumps at the Salon de The awards in Paris.

Flawless tea: The award-winning tea say benefits from the mountain air and fresh spring water

The business is the brainchild of trio Jamie Russell, 36, Derek Walker, 39, and Tam O'Brann, 44.  

Scientist Tam O'Braan, 44, said he was honoured to receive the award, after his business had been brewing steadily for four and a half years.

The father-of-two, who runs the Wee Tea Plantation on Dalreoch Farm estate in Amulree, Perthshire, said: 'I suppose you could call me Mr Tea after winning such a major award.

'I'm proud to say our tea is the best in the world.

'This has been only our second season selling our tea so to get the highest honour in the whole world of tea is brilliant.

'I'm surprised that it has taken this long for someone in Scotland to grow tea. We have a great climate for it.

'I used to work for The World Food Programme and help out in several places where crops struggle to grow properly.

'My work for them took me to Wuhan which has an ancient tradition of growing tea 750 metres above sea level - which is the same height as our estate.

'This is ideal for tea because the clouds are quite low down which gives it good protection from any sunlight and the frequent rain helps as well.'

A 15 gram tin of the prize-winning tea will set punters back £35 from Fortnum & Mason.

 Along with lawyer wife Gracie, 29, Tam gave up a globe-trotting lifestyle to finally settle on the Perthshire estate.

They arrived in Scotland with experience of food research across five continents and joined up with old friends who had been running a high quality tea shop in Edinburgh.

In October last year, their Big Country Brew was valued at £2,300 per kilogram - more than twenty times the price of ordinary tea.

Tam added: 'Scotland has such an incredible connection to the tea industry.

'For example, all of the original Darjeeling tea gardens were first planted by Scots and a Scot initially brought tea to Japan.

'We're very well located here in Perthshire as the soil in the ground can give the tea a nice, smoky flavour similar to many local whiskies.'
