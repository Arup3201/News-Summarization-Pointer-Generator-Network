Some things never go out of fashion: case in point, the trusty rain mac. Thanks to our unpredictable weather, the raincoat will always be a British wardrobe staple.

But now Burberry — the company behind the most iconic mac design of all time — reports sales are soaring again and are up by 10 per cent. But that doesn’t mean you can just buy any old one, pull it on any old how, and still look great — the same classic trench can flatter one woman and swamp the next.

Kate Battersby looks at six styles to suit six different shapes...

Tall women can capitalise on their height with a midi-length: you never need to worry about looking dumpy. This grown-up look is universally stylish and bang on-trend at any age.

But only the really giraffe-like should opt for a belted design.

BUSTY

With busty ladies, it’s easy to create the unwitting effect of a shelf across the body — so avoid double-breasted designs. It also helps if the mac is not fully done up. Leave it open to create a V, drawing the eye to the waist.

Lots of detail on the top half or breast pockets are a big no.

PEAR

Mac, £165, frenchconnection.com

Trousers, £120, reiss.com

Shoes, £195, lkbennett.com

PearS are bottom-heavy, so draw the eye upwards and outwards to balance out your shape. The buttons on this mac form a V from the waist, broadening the shoulders to create an hourglass form.

Avoid fussy design below the waist, and anything too long.

PETITE

Mac, £69, johnlewis.com

Blouse, £125, reiss.com

Dotty jeans, £85, hobbs.co.uk

Shoes, £25.99, zara.com

Here, it’s best to choose a shorter length to avoid being drowned by swathes of fabric. Anything below the knee is a guaranteed disaster.

It’s important to be able to see your legs, so they look as long as possible. A belt will nip in the waist, helping to emphasise your legs. Heels are a must to finish the look.

BOYISH

Mac, £175, lkbennett.com

Cashmere jumper, £79, marksandspencer.com

Skirt, £110, jigsaw-online.com

Shoes, £129, reiss.com

The trick is to add shape without hiding your slim frame. Adding detail to your top half — via epaulettes or padded shoulders — will work beautifully.

A flare will add shape to narrow hips, or leave the mac unbuttoned but belted to add a curve. Fitted clothing beneath leaves no doubt you’re slim.
