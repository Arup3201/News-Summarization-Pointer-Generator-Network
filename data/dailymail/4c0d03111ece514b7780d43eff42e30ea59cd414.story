The Dyson Air Multiplier fan which is the 'near silent' update to its bladeless fan that it claims is quieter than a buzzing mosquito

Dyson experts have launched a new bladeless fan that is 75per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that equates to the irritating mosquito hum.

However the sound of silence does not come cheaply, for the designer fan ranges in price from £219.99 to £299.99 depending on the size and style.

The company has spent some £40million on developing its Air Multiplier bladeless fans, which come from laboratories that employ 1,500 scientists and engineers.

The new design Dyson Cool fans includes an innovation called a Helmholtz cavity, which effectively dissipates some of the sound waves caused by the fan.

The engineers identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear, which is equivalent to a mosquito’s beating wind, and have managed to kill this.

They have also smoothed the airflow through the fan, which reduces turbulence and so further reduces noise.

The combined effect of the changes has also made the fans some 40per cent more energy efficient, so reducing the running costs. 

The design has been called an 'innovation' that helps to dissipate sound waves, and Smoother airflow also helps the fan in noise reduction
