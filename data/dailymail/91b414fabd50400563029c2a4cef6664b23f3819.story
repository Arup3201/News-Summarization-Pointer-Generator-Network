North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has today set foot on the slopes of the country's first ski resort... but he appears to have forgotten his skis.

Kim took a test ride on one of the new lifts at Masik Pass Ski Resort but as he sat surveying the resort his legs dangled free.

The leader was said to note 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable' and gave instructions to serve people well to ensure visitors may 'keenly feel the loving care of the party', local media reported.

Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, told officials to hold the opening ceremony at the resort at the earliest opportunity, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.

The ski resort was described as KCNA as a 'great monumental structure in the era of Songun', referring to the nation's 'military first' policy. The military played a leading role in the project.

Kim was accompanied by top military leaders and, Pak Myong-Choi, a top sports official known to be associated with Kim's uncle who was executed this month.

Jang Song-Thaek, Kim's powerful political mentor, was put to death in a shock purge on charges including corruption and plotting to overthrow the state.

The purge was the biggest political upheaval since Kim, aged around 30, took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong-Il, in December 2011.Â

The Masik Pass Ski Resort made headlines in August when Switzerland blocked a $7.6 million sale of ski lifts to Pyongyang, calling it a 'propaganda project' for the impoverished Stalinist regime.

Featuring 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level ski runs, a hotel, heliport and cable cars, the resort has been heavily promoted since Kim visited it in June and called for construction to be completed by the end of the year.

The young leader has shown a fondness for expensive, high-profile leisure projects in and around the showpiece capital Pyongyang including a massive new water park, an amusement park and a luxury horseback riding club.

The Munsu Water Park in Pyongyang opened in October to much fanfare, with the 109,000-square metre venue sporting dozens of indoor and outdoor pools, water slides and saunas.

Kim in September also watched films at a new '4D' movie theatre built in the newly-renovated Rungna People's amusement park, state media reported earlier.

He was photographed riding a roller coaster in the Rungna amusement park in Pyongyang when it reopened in July 2012 after renovations ordered by Kim.
