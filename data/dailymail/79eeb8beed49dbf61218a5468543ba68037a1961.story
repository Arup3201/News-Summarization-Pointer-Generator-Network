Roger Bainbridge, 67, went missing after travelling to the tiny island of Antipaxos three days ago

The family of a British pensioner who has gone missing after visiting a tiny Greek island may have to pay for their own helicopter search, it has emerged.

Roger Bainbridge, 67, was last seen three days ago travelling alone to Antipaxos which is just two square miles.

His family from Kendal, Cumbria, could be forced to pay for the search as there are only two police officers on neighboring island, Paxos.

Mr Bainbridge, a retired electricity board worker was on holiday with his sister Maggie Cooper who lives on the island when he disappeared.

The father-of-two decided to go walking on Antipaxos alone, and was last seen boarding a boat to the island that lies just off the coast of Corfu. 

He was expected to return to his sister's house for a barbeque later in the day but never showed up.

Mr Bainbridge went abroad for the first time just five years ago, and has been visiting his sister in Paxos every year since. 

His son, Iain Bainbridge, 39, said his father's disappearance was a huge shock that has sparked fear throughout his whole family.

He said: 'Dad goes to my Auntie Maggie's house on the island every year - he loves the hot weather and enjoys swimming there.

'He's still a very fit person, he doesn't drink or smoke, and wanted to visit the other island, which is just a short boat trip away.

'My auntie was cooking a barbecue on Thursday night and my dad didn't make it home.

There are only two police officers on the island of Paxos, and none on Antipaxos which has a population of just 64

'It's not like him to miss any event - especially when there's hot meat on the table.'

As police presence on the island is so small, the family is becoming increasingly anxious.

Estate
agent Iain added: 'There's only two police officers on Paxos, so I'm 
not even sure if they regularly go over to the smaller island.

'The police over there could be out of their depth and it could mean we as a family paying for a helicopter.

'I've been racking my brains about what could have happened since Dad went missing.

'It just doesn't make sense - every possible explanation we've suggested as a family just doesn't stand up.

Mr Bainbridge was visiting his sister in Greece when he took a boat to the island of Antipaxos (pictured) alone to go walking

'If he was attacked, surely someone would have found his possessions or would have seen something.

'And if he got on the wrong boat heading back from Antipaxos, I'm certain he would have found someone who speaks English.

'It's a total mystery and it's becoming more worrying by the minute.'

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'I can confirm a British national is missing on an island near Corfu and we are providing consular assistance.'
