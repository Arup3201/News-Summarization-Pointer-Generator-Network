Toronto Mayor Rob Ford may have offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers to buy back a video that appears to show him smoking crack, court documents suggest.

In police wiretaps of alleged gang members one is heard telling another that he rejected the offer for the tape and planned to meet the mayor and ask for '150,' meaning $150,000.

Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs.

Embattled: Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford is mobbed by reporters in this October 31 file photo. Tapes that suggest he tried to buy back the video showing him smoking the drug were played in court

On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and that he would post a picture on Instagram.

On another wiretap, one man says he has many pictures of Ford 'doing the hezza,' which police say is known to be slang for heroin.

Another man suggests those pictures would be worth a lot, the document says.

The mayor addressed the issue during an appearance today on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks on WJFK-FM. 

'Number
 one that's an outright lie and number two you can talk to my lawyers 
about it, but I'm here to talk about football guys,' Ford said.

Since the news broke in the Toronto Star and U.S. news website Gawker he has actually enjoyed a boost in popularity with the electorate.

He acknowledged last month that he smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' about a year ago. The admission came only after he previously denied the existence of the video.

Ford has refused to resign as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city and financial capital, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents that have embarrassed his constituents, from public drunkenness to appearing in another video that showed him threatening 'murder' in an incoherent rant.

In response, the city's council has stripped him of most of his powers.

Ford admitted that he smoked crack cocaine after police said they had obtained a video during an investigation into his friend Alexander Lisi that appears to show him puffing on a crack pipe.

The newly released court documents say police heard on the wiretaps that Ford had his phone stolen or lost it at a home they believe to be a crack house and that Lisi was trying to get it back.

Police say they overheard that Lisi threatened to 'put the heat on' the gang if he didn't get Ford's phone back and that the alleged gang members said they would not tolerate Lisi's threats because they had a picture of Ford 'on a pipe,' which police believed meant a crack pipe. Police say Lisi gave the men marijuana in exchange for the return of the mayor's phone.

Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer, said the wiretaps are snippets of alleged gangsters who are talking among themselves.

'It's very dangerous to put any weight into any of this,' Mr Morris told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to address.'

City councilor Joe Mihevc said police need to examine the allegations that Ford tried to obtain the tape.

'The mayor can't come out and say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"' said Mr Mihevc. 'This man needs help. He needs a lot of help.'

Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair declined to comment on the newly released documents. The wiretaps are evidence in the case against Lisi, who faces trial on drug and extortion charges.

The mayor has not been charged.

'All of the evidence that was gathered in that case has been reviewed by investigators and with the Crown prosecutors in this case, and where reasonable and probable grounds to lay a charge exists, charges have been laid,' said Mr Blair.

Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack

Police were in the midst of a drug and weapons investigation involving alleged members of the Dixon Bloods gang when the mayor's name surfaced on wiretaps in March and April.

Police didn't open an investigation into Ford and Lisi until May, when U.S. website Gawker and the Toronto Star reported that alleged drug dealers were shopping around the crack video.

Ford says he has quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle. And he's not avoiding the spotlight. He's agreed to appear on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks.

Councillor Janet Davis said the image of Ford laughing at the newest revelations demonstrates his arrogance and lack of judgment.

'If he laughed today, and thousands and thousands of people of the city of Toronto saw that he was laughing at what was revealed today, it will just simply deepen the anger toward this man,' said Mr Davis.
