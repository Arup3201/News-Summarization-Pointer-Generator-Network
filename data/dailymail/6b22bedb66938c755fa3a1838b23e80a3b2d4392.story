Prison officers went on a takeaway run to 'avoid upsetting' inmates unhappy with what was on offer in the canteen.

Three prisoners at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire protested when caterers ran out of fried chicken, leaving only chicken Kiev available.

One inmate is said to have threatened to harm himself until officers travelled three miles to a chip shop to pick up a £4.75 chicken and chip meal for all three of the prisoners.

Takeaway run: Staff at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire fetched takeaway fried chicken for three inmates last week

The duty director at Rye Hill, a Category B facility in Willoughby, near Rugby, approved the trip last week after deciding it was the best way to 'avoid upsetting' the prisoners, according to a report in the Sun.

'It was disgusting they were so pampered,' a relative of another Rye Hill prisoner told the newspaper, adding that other staff on duty had been unhappy with the 'special treatment'.

Security firm G4S, which runs the prison, has confirmed the incident did take place, but said taxpayers would not be covering the £14.25 cost of the takeaway.

'Due to Wednesday’s evening meal service being a little short, a decision was taken to source from a local outlet,' a G4S spokesman said.

'This isn’t what should have happened and steps are being taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.'

The privately-run prison, which houses 664 inmates, seeks to 'normalise prison conditions as far as possible and reflect life in the outside community', according to the G4S website.
