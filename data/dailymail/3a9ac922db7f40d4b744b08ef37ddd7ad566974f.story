A young Paralympic hopeful has been able to wrap presents and pull Christmas crackers for the first time – thanks to a new bionic hand.

Lyndon Longhorne, 19, lost both his legs, his right arm and the fingers on his left hand after suffering meningitis as a baby.

Previously, the teenager said pulling crackers, cutting up turkey and playing board games were a struggle, but this year his Christmas has been transformed by having the gadget fitted.

Last September Dragon's Den star Duncan Ballantyne accompanied Mr Longhorne to have new prosthetic  legs and a new knee joint  fitted.

Lyndon Longhorne, 19, has been fitted with a bionic hand which has allowed him to pull crackers, cut up turkey and play board games for the first time. The hand can sense signals from the muscles in his arm

Mr Longhorne lost both his legs, his right arm and the fingers on his left hand after suffering meningitis as a baby. He was fitted with prosthetic legs (pictured) and a new knee joint on his right leg last September. This has allowed him to walk unaided and pass his driving test

This meant he was able to manoeuvre his knee without having to physically use his hand to turn it right or left.

Since then, Mr Longhorne has learned to walk unaided, passed his driving test.

He is also an avid swimmer, and is currently training six days a week, hoping to swim for England in the 2016 Paralympics in Rio.

Mr Longhorne, of Crook, County Durham, says the bionic hand has changed his life. 

He said: 'I am able to open and close my hand with ease and even to different degrees using the bionic hand.

 'It means I can grasp objects using the muscles in my arms and it has made a huge difference to my life.' 

The hand has two sensors inside which are able to read the signals sent from the muscles in his arm; one muscle tells the hand to close and the other to open. 

 Made by prosthetics company RSLSteeper and called the 'Bebionic' hand, it is attached to his stump by suction.

Mr Longhorne added: 'I am still learning to use it, it is controlled by electro-magnetic sensors which are attached to the muscles in my arm.

'I can now easily lift things and walk around holding them, which is a huge novelty for me.

'I wear it the majority of the time and I've found that I'm actually alright at wrapping presents.

Mr Longhorne had a Bebionic bionic hand fitted, attached to his stump using suction.

It's socket is fitted with two electrodes which are able to read the signals sent from his muscles. 

It's manufacturers say it has 14 different grip patterns, allowing amputees to carry out a wide range of basic tasks.

It automatically senses when a gripped item is slipping and adjusts the grip to secure it, i's manufacturers claim.

'The hand has really helped me a lot over Christmas.'

Mr Longhorne, who is studying business management and sport at the University of Salford, explained that he had to try three hands before making his final decision.

He said: 'I wore each of the hands for about six weeks and kept a diary of each of them and then the consultant and I made a decision together to go for this one, it's easy to operate and it's very light.

'I'm still getting used to it I haven't even had it a month yet, but I can do things now that I couldn't before, like getting books off higher shelves in the library and carrying those around.

'Cutting food is easier as well. It's basic things, but they make a difference.'

The hand follows on from a knee joint called the VGK ('Very Good Knee'), which meant he no longer had to manually turn his knee with his hand.

He is currently trialling another knee called the C-Leg, which he was fitted with several weeks ago. 

As a result he has even greater flexibility of movement, and says he finds it easier to climb the stairs. 

As he lost his right leg above the knee, and his left below,  he only needs one bionic joint on his right. 

Mr Longhorne  added he has had a 'good year', after passing his driving test in May and moving away to university.

He said: 'It was scary learning to drive at first.

The hand's manufacturers claim it has 14 grip patterns giving amputees a wide range of movements. 'I can do things now that I couldn't before, like getting books off higher shelves in the library and carrying those around. Cutting food is easier as well,' Mr Longhorne said

The instructor said there was no reason I couldn't learn to drive using my legs, so I had about ten lessons and went in for my test and passed with one minor.

'It's given me so much freedom, I don't have to rely on anyone to take me places I can just get in the car and go wherever I want.

'I've had a lot of support from Duncan Bannatyne and I'm really grateful for that. He came to all of my appointments with me to get my legs and he's been great.

'I wouldn't be driving now without him.'

He now in training six days a week for the 2016 Paralympics in Rio, which includes swimming and gym sessions.

'I just want to continue with university, get a good degree and see where life takes me,' he said.

'If I go to Rio then that's a bonus.'
