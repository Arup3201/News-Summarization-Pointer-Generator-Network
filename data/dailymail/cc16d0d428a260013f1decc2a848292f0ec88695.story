An Australian businesswoman has been released from a Chinese jail seven years after she was arrested for embezzlement.

Friends and family from Sydney eagerly waited outside Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre in South China as Charlotte Chou was released on Saturday morning, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

When the Chinese-born entrepreneur returns to Sydney, she'll be able to see her seven-year-old son Lincoln for the first time since she was arrested in 2008. The last time she held him was when he was one-year-old.

When Ms Chou walked free from the detention centre, she was greeted by her 19-year-old son Cleon, who's attending university in Beijing, and Sydney-based 21-year-old daughter Chloe and Ms Chou's sister Fiona Zou.

In 2008 she was taken away by police while her one-year-old son Lincoln was asleep in their  home in Guangzhou, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

He is now seven-years-old and is in the care of Ms Chou's parents in Sydney's north shore, according to the Australian Financial Review.

Ms Chou was accused of stealing about 29 million yuan, which is $5.3 million, from a private university which she helped establish.

As a result she was sentenced a year and a half in jail on bribery charges in 2008 but was rearrested upon her released in December 2009.

After numerous trials, in 2012 she was found guilt of embezzlement and was sentenced to eight years behind bars.

During an appeal last year, her sentence was reduced to three years.
