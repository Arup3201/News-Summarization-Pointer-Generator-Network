Michael Le Vell, pictured with girlfriend Louise Gibbons, shocked Coronation Street co-stars by admitting he likes watching porn, it was claimed

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell shocked fellow cast members by openly confessing that he watches porn, it was reported today.

The actor, 50, was on set when he revealed that he is a fan of porn website RedTube, it has been claimed.

Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is said to have brought up the topic during a gap in filming, telling co-stars that the X-rated site is one of his 'favourites'.

The actor - who has been dating girlfriend Louise Gibbons, 38, for a year - reportedly dismissed comments from surprised colleagues, saying: 'Oh God! I've been single for a long time you know.'

A female co-worker is said to have replied: 'But you're not single now!'

Le Vell responded: 'I know - but you still have the odd look at RedTube. I delete my search history.'

The 'confession' was revealed to The Sun by an insider, who said: 'Everyone was so shocked that Michael was so open about his porn habits. There were lots of people around who heard him.

'It was a light-hearted conversation, and he clearly thought it was funny.

'But there were some people who felt his comments were a bit inappropriate.' 

The explicit website, which contains thousands of pornographic videos, says it offers 'hot sex straight to your browser window'.

Le Vell returned to Coronation Street last July after being found not guilty of a number of alleged sex offences.

Before returning to the ITV show, the star also underwent rehab and is now teetotal.
