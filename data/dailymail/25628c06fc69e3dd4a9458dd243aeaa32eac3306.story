Meet Louisa Bull - the UK's youngest female sumo wrestler who takes on women more than twice her size. 

Fifteen-year-old Louisa is already the British female 80 kilos (12.5st) champion weighing in at 11st.

And the 5ft 9in teen is so fearless she takes boys - and 25st female sumos in competition.

Louisa, from Derby, said: 'People don't believe me at first when I tell them I'm a sumo wrestler because they think sumos have to be massive and extremely strong.'

Daddy's girl: Louisa learned sumo from her father and the two share a passion for the sport, although neither will give an inch

Normal: When Louisa isn't wrestling, she likes to do all the things the average teenage girl does

'And when I first started sumo I had a lot of boys saying I wasn't going to get anywhere because I was a girl.

'But I took them on in the sumo ring and sometimes I beat them - so they're not as sure of themselves any more.

She added: 'I think a lot of people think sumo is just about two fat guys pushing each other out of the ring.

'My friends and the boys at school also used to think it was weird and they'd make a few jokes about it but now they think it's great and I even teach them moves.'

She admits she's come away from some fights with twisted ankles and even a bloody nose but the GSCE student says she's just like any other girl.

She added: 'I like to wear make-up and lots of bright and pretty clothes - even though I like to beat people up, I still like to look good.

'If I've not got my training clothes on I'm just a normal girl with a bit of an edge.'

Record: Schoolgirl Louisa is the UK's youngest ever sumo wrestler, although that hasn't stopped her winning

Tough: Louisa's coach says she's stronger than most of the boys she goes head to head with

Travel: Louisa would like to go to Japan to meet the country's professional wrestlers

Like other forms of wrestling, winning a Sumo bout requires one wrestler (rikishi) to force another out of a circular ring (dohyō) or to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet.

The sport originated in Japan, which remains the only country where sumo has a professional body and fighters can be paid for their efforts.

Louisa, the eldest of five children, had her first taste of fighting sports at just six years old after watching dad, Martin, 35, who is a keen boxer as well as a sumo wrestler.

By the age of 13 she had started at a local sumo gym, run by Steve Pateman, founder of the British Sumo Federation.

Now she trains there three times a week for competitions and has to eat a strict 2,000 calorie diet with plenty of protein.

She can lift up to 50 kilo weights and has even started fighting Martin, a project management consultant, in practice contests.

She said: 'It doesn't frighten me when I'm up against someone who's bigger. I tell myself that I can do it and if I just go in there and try my best, I might be able to win.'

Louisa become so strong she can lift her dad, who competes in the 70 kilos category, above her head.

But Martin has taken it all on the chin and says he and his wife, Victoria, 34, are proud of their daughter's achievements.

He said: 'I think it's good that women should learn a martial art or a self-defense so they can keep fit and look after themselves.

'Louisa makes a good sumo wrestler because she's very stubborn and she's extremely strong for her age. She also likes the challenge of it.'

Winner: So good is Louisa, she regularly trounces wrestlers who weigh more than twice what she does

Full-time mum Victoria, 34, added: 'I think any mother would be worried about their daughter wrestling.

'She broke her nose once and I went in to panic. It's heartbreaking when she gets hurt but I'm always there to support her. I'm on hand to bandage her up and mend the injuries.

'It is nerve racking but she's got good supportive people around her who we trust.'

Louisa travelled to Barcis, Italy, for the European Sumo Championships last year - where competed in an open-weight category.

She faced a 25-stone competitor but, incredibly, that didn't faze her and she's returning this year.

Coach Steve even has hopes that she will eventually travel to the home of Sumo in Tokyo, Japan.

He said: 'Louisa is actually stronger than most of the boys. When she fought them and won I knew she'd be a champion. She's getting stronger each week.'

Louisa added: 'Sumo wrestling is such a different sport and it's so enjoyable. Those who say girls can't be sumo wrestlers are talking rubbish.

'At the moment, there's hardly any girls in sumo wrestling but it would be awesome if more would join and I hope that I can inspire more to do it.'
