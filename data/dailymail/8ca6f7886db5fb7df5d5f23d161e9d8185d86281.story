Stuart Hogg has whipped up a storm ahead of Saturday’s Twickenham clash by insisting England have ‘no respect’ for Scottish rugby and are ‘all about themselves’.

The Scotland and Lions full-back believes his country are very much perceived as second-class competition south of the border - and his thoughts echo those of skipper Greig Laidlaw who claims ‘England don’t rate Scotland very much’.

Both players are bottling up their frustrations for the Calcutta Cup clash, with Hogg hoping to silence the critics with Scotland’s first victory of this year’s RBS Six Nations following defeats to France, Wales and Italy.

‘The English are a fantastic team but they’re pretty much all about themselves at times,’ Hogg told Sportsmail. ‘They don’t really respect us and we find that pretty frustrating. There will be a certain number of people that do respect us but, no matter how good our performance is, on the whole they don’t.

‘We’re not really in a position to make them respect us when we’re zero wins from three, so for that to happen we need to go down there and shut them up with a great performance and a big win.’

Hogg revealed that his frustrations were exacerbated during Glasgow Warriors’ European Champions Cup ties with Bath earlier this season when the Pro12 side won 37-10 in the first leg at Scotstoun before narrowly losing 20-15 in the reverse fixture at The Rec.

Asked to explain his comments about the lack of respect, the 22-year-old Borderer said: ‘There are loads of different things. Take Bath, for instance, in the European games. We pummelled them at home in Glasgow and almost beat them down there, yet their coach never once mentioned us after the games.

‘After they went through, they said they had a tough pool with Toulouse and Montpellier, but never once mentioned us. That kind of sums it up for me and, with the way the lads go on with Greig Laidlaw down at Gloucester, it’s quite clear that they don’t respect us.’

Meanwhile, England centre Brad Barritt is a doubt for Saturday after injuring his ankle in Saracens’ 26-17 win at Wasps on Sunday.

Barritt seemed destined for a recall against Scotland, with Luther Burrell unable to train last week, but the 28-year-old limped away from the Ricoh Arena after Wasps fly-half Andy Goode landed heavily on his right leg.

Saracens’ director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘It seems to be his ankle. The knee seems to be okay. I’m sure he’ll be close to selection for England next weekend, so fingers crossed it’s not as bad as it looked.’

If Barritt is fit to play, he is set to rejoin the back line along with Harlequins full-back Mike Brown. Up front, Northampton’s Courtney Lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of George Kruis.
