Scores of homes have been destroyed and at least three people killed after heavy overnight rainfall sparked flash flooding across Colorado in the early hours this morning.

Flooding was reported from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, more than 100 miles south. Boulder County, including the city of Boulder, was one of the hardest hit areas, with as much as six inches falling in just 12 hours overnight into this morning causing rock and mudslides. 

Four more inches are expected to fall today, prompting local officials to call in the National Guard and FEMA.

Affected areas: Mandatory evacuation ordered have been issued for parts of Jamestown and Fourmile in Boulder County, Colarado, while parts of northwest Jefferson County have also seen flash floods

Officials have already reported three 
deaths connected to the flooding. Two were found in Boulder County. One 
of the bodies was found in a building that collapsed in Jamestown.

The third body was found in Colorado Springs by emergency crews on flood-watch patrol.

Sheriff Pelle said it was possible that the death toll would rise throughout the day.

'This event is not over. It’s far from over. It’s continuing to build,’ Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.

The National Weather Service warned there would be an ‘extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation’ in the region.

They warned residents: ‘Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life.’

Several emergency shelters have been set up within the area. One shelter has been set up at Lyons Elementary School where 200 evacuees were being brought blankets and supplies by the National Guard.

Michael Aisner, who lives in the Pinebrook area, says his entire neighborhood was evacuated.

He was at the hospital visiting a friend when his area was evacuated, so his roommates left by car and drove up to a saddle road for safety.

They heard a friend's parents were trapped in a nearby home where boulders were smashing into the house and the home was sliding due to the heavy mud.

They rescued the elderly couple who proceeded to hike over a mountain and hitchhike to a local hotel for shelter.

Aisner just got word that his house is still in tact and plans to spend another night at the hospital.

Boulder Police dispatchers have been receiving calls of flooding basements and homes and of flooded streets and submerged cars.

Authorities said the flooding has made many Boulder streets impassable.

Emergency
Management Director Mike Chard said people should avoid creeks and 
waterways, and not attempt to cross flooded intersections in their cars.

A
spokeswoman for Boulder Police and Fire Department told NBC News that 
water levels have reached first-floor windows in some parts of the city 
with people trapped inside their homes or vehicles.

She said: 'There was one woman that was on top of a vehicle and the vehicle was actually on its side.'

Another office of Emergency Management spokesman said that the conditions were 'extremely dangerous'.

There is water everywhere,' said spokesman Andrew Barth. 'We've had several structural collapses, there's mud and mulch and debris everywhere. Cars are stranded all over the place.

Hundred have been evacuated from their homes in parts of Jamestown and Fourmile in Boulder, while over 400 students at the University of Colorado were being evacuated from their first floor dorms.

The university is reported that 40 buildings have been damaged by water – 25 per cent of the campus. 

A university spokesman said it could be two to three weeks before certain students can return to their residence halls.

The flooding happened so fast that many people were trapped in their homes and cars when water started to surround them.

Emergency crews in Lafayette County rescued one man trapped in his overturned car. Others have been rescued sitting on top of their cars and still in their homes.

The flood waters have turned the town of Lyons into an island since it has wiped out all of the surrounding roads.

The overflowing creeks have been so strong in some parts that they have ripped right through roads and taken cars in with them.

Dillon Road in Broomfield, Colorado was washed out, causing three cars to crash into the raging creek below.

This is not your ordinary day. It is not your ordinary disaster,’ said Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. ‘We’ve lost roads, we’ve lost bridges, we’ve lost homes, cars. And we’re only just now assessing the damage.’

Kari Bowen of the Weather Service agrees: ‘These constants rainstorms we typically don’t see (in eastern Colorado).’

Since the flooding has made transport impossible in most parts of Boulder, there have been widespread school and highway closures.

In Lyons, Colorado, the water has overflowed a sewage plant and the residents have been ordered to drink only boiled or bottled water.
