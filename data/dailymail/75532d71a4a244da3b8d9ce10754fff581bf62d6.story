A North Carolina bartender had a spell of bad luck turned around after a tipper left a $1,000 on a $14 bar bill.

Chrisi Kemp was behind the bar at One Whirled Cafe in Wake Forest last Thursday evening when a local walked in and ordered some drinks.

Kemp already had a lot on her mind. Bills for her daughter's medical care had been adding up and her washing machine had broken down.

Good luck: Just when things seemed at their worst, bartender Chrisi Kemp received a $1000 tip that helped cover the family's medical bills and repair costs

While the man lingered over a vodka tonic and later a kamikaze, the two discussed her garden and his vacation home in Belize.

'It was just a very odd conversation,' Kemp said. She didn't talk about the problems she was dealing with back home.

Still her luck was due to change. The man, a retiree who asked her not to share his name, put a $1,000 tip on his credit card. With just a $14.01 bill, that's more than 7000% gratuity. 

She and the management checked to see if there was some mistake, but the man told them to go ahead and charge the gratuity.

Kemp made sure to share the generosity, dividing up some of tip with staff at One Whirled Cafe.

'As much as I might have needed the money, you still pay it forward,' she said. 'You don't let greed come into it.' 

Gratuitous: A local's tip blew away the suggested gratuity amounts, and Kemp made sure to share her windfall with the rest of the staff

One Whirled Cafe has only been open  three months and serves a rotating offering of international-inspired plates.

'It's slow,' said Kemp about business. 'It's going to be this way until we build a clientele.'

But being the recipient of a fortuitous tip has already piqued interest in the area, and one customer said he learned about the restaurant from the flurry of news.
