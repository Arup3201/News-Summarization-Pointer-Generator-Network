The NFL’s free agency began and blurred the boundaries between fantasy football and reality with a breathtaking first five minutes.

Jimmy Graham is now a Seahawk. Haloti Ngata left the Ravens for Detroit and Nick Foles heads to the Rams with Sam Bradford heading the other way.

Seattle gave up a first-round and a fourth-round pick from this year’s draft - and center Max Unger - to give Russell Wilson a red zone target in the shape of 28-year-old Graham.

With 4,752 receiving yards and 51 touchdowns since entering the NFL in 2010, Graham’s move is an admission by New Orleans that they mismanaged their cap.

Meanwhile, Seattle welcome a player to their ranks once called ‘soft’ and ‘the most overrated player in the NFL’ by defensive end Michael Bennett.

Ngata's move possibly signals the introduction of a 3-4 in the wake of Ndamokung Suh’s imminent departure to Miami.

The Ravens reckoned that the nose tackle was too expensive going into the final year of his current deal. Detroit gain a 31-year-old run-stuffer capable of anchoring a defense and with experience of working with defensive co-ordinator Teryl Austin.

Baltimore acquire fourth, fifth and seventh-round picks as part of the deal, ESPN report.

Arguably Bradford is the happier of the two following the quarterback trade. He joins Chip Kelly’s fast-paced offense where his accuracy will put up the big numbers. That’s if he stays fit.

After missing the entire 2014 season after tearing his ACL - his second such injury in as many years - injury concerns will plague Bradford for the rest of his career. But if he stays fit, the opportunity is there.

It is tough to say the same for Foles, who started 18 games for Kelly and won 14 of them. But after breaking his collarbone, he was jettisoned to St Louis, joining the likes of LeSean McCoy and Jeremy Maclin out of Philadelphia, who also re-signed quarterback Mark Sanchez on a $9m, two-year deal on Sunday.

Elsewhere, the future of serial free agent and now Super Bowl-winner Darrelle Revis is uncertain and Percy Harvin is visiting the Buffalo Bills since his release by the New York Jets.

Verstile tight end Julius Thomas heads to Jacksonville after agreeing a deal worth around $9m a season.

Torrey Smith follows thew path successfully trodden by Anquan Boldin by joining the 49ers from the Ravens after agreeing a five-year, $40m deal.

Frank Gore joined the Colts after ten bruising years in San Francisco. The bulldozing running back had looked to join the Eagles, but will be in the backfield behind Andrew Luck.

Five-time All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the game in a further blow to Jim Tomsula’s new-look franchise.

And Jake Locker decided to call it a day at the tender age of 26. After four seasons with the Tennessee Titans, the quarterback says he no longer has ‘the burning desire’ to play in the NFL.
