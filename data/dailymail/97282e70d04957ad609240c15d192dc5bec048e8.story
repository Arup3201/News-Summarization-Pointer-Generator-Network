A 21-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant was killed on Sunday in a drive-by shooting in Miami, but doctors still managed to deliver her baby before she passed away.

The child, a little boy, remains in a critical condition.

Police have identified the victim as Quelecia James, of Miami Gardens, who was a passenger in a car that was travelling northbound on Northwest 32nd Avenue about 2pm.

A second car drove up alongside the vehicle that was carrying James - who has a four-year-old daughter - and its passenger began shooting, according to CBS Miami.

The driver, who was not injured and whose name has not been released, quickly pulled into the driveway of a nearby home at 18131 NW 32nd Ave.

'We need our neighbors to come together and start actually piecing the puzzle together. It’s a very sad situation.'

Mr James said he feels confident the person responsible will be caught.

'All I got to say to the people who done this: Run forever and a day, you will get caught,' he said.

'My advice for [the shooter’s] family is to turn them in. Somebody got to pay for this. She didn’t ask for this.'
