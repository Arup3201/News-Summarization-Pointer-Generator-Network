It’s been a bad few weeks all round for Wall Street’s top bosses, but things must be extra tense in the Blankfein household right now.

That's because Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has lost an eye-watering $52million of his personal wealth this month, leaving him with shares worth 'just' $232million.

Five top bank chiefs have seen their combined shareholding value fall by almost $100million on paper in the last two weeks, reported Bloomberg.

Tricky month: Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has already lost an eye-watering $52million of his personal wealth in August

Heads of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley saw the plunge occur from July 29 to August 10.

That includes a $40million drop just on Wednesday. Mr Blankfein’s $52million is greater than the combined losses of all four other men.

‘My entire net worth is in this company,’ Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, 51, told Bloomberg earlier this week. ‘We believe in the stock.’

The value of his 486,000 shares dropped from $4.7million on July 29 to $3.3million on Wednesday as the company’s stock price fell to $6.77.

Drops: Vikram Pandit of Citigroup, left, and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, right, have watched the value of their shares fall as stock markets plummeted

Stock markets have had a topsy-turvy week of big drops and rises, with serious falls coming this week on Monday and Wednesday.

CEO's name; the bank, number of shares owned, their value on July 29; and their value on August 10:

* July 29 figure excludes purchase of 100,000 shares on August 4, but August 10 figures includes this

Investors are mainly concerned the U.S. economy is getting weaker and that the European debt crisis could spread across the Atlantic.

Poor consumer confidence data today did little to help sentiment, but better retail sales and jobless figures were released this week.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, bought 100,000 shares last Thursday at $20.62 each before his stock dropped to $16.45 on Wednesday.

He has seen total stock losses of $5.4million - but this is nothing compared to Mr Blankfein’s huge losses, reported Bloomberg.

Mr Blankfein’s holdings were worth $232million at Wednesday’s closing price, down 18 per cent on July 29 from $284million.

James Dimon, 55, of JPMorgan, was the second biggest loser, with his stock dropping 15 per cent from $205million to $175million.

‘We
will build this business,’ he told CNBC earlier this week. ‘And I 
guarantee you in five years the stock will be higher than today.’

Vikram Pandit, 54, of Citigroup, saw his stock value fall 26 per cent to $13million from $18million at the end of last month.

The Wall Street CEOs owned a combined $439million in common stock on Wednesday, down from $531million on July 29, reported Bloomberg.
