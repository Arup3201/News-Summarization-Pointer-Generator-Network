These are the Chinese migrant families who are forced to live in old shipping containers due to a lack of housing.

For just £50 a month, they rent out their metal homes on the outskirts of Shanghai.

Millions of rural migrants have flocked to China's fast developing cities in recent decades, but many are unable to join the property ladder as house prices have boomed and rents have soared.

Left behind: The containers, which house different families, were set up by the landlord, who charges a rent of 500 yuan (£50) per month

Risk: A similar container village in Pudong was pulled down by the Chinese authorities in 2011 because it was too 'dangerous'

Struggling: There are 18 shipping container homes in this 'village' on the edge of Shanghai

They also struggle for rights to 
health care and public education because of the government's 
household-registration system 'hukou'.

Li
Yanxin, a native of Anhui Province, said she and three other migrant 
families have lived in the so-called 'container village' for the last 10
years.

The old cargo 
containers were reportedly rescued by a man in his 70s, known simply as 
the 'old man', who acts as landlord after he found them discarded on the
side of a road.

All are equipped with doors, windows, electricity and water and Li said she feels safe.

She
has divided her 15 square metre home into a small supermarket, selling 
food, drinks and other daily necessities, and a living room with a bed, 
sofa and even a television.

Safe: All the containers are equipped with water, electricity, doors and windows

Overcrowded: Shanghai has a population of around 23million but many migrants can't afford housing

Established: The shipping containers are believed to have housed workers for more than 10 years

Li
told Shanghai Daily: 'It was more than 10 years ago that the 'old man' 
bought the containers from local customs. He planned to use them as 
warehouses on the land he rented from the government but later decided 
to lease them out to migrant workers.

Another
female resident living in the container said the 'old man' took pity on
some migrant workers who survived by collecting garbage and charged 
them very low rent.

'Many 
people ask me how I feel living in a container. I say it's quite fine as
I've never lived in an apartment in the city,' said Li.

'The iron containers are quite solid and I do not have to worry about leakages during rain or the roof collapsing.'

A similar container village existed in suburban Gaoqiao Town in Pudong in 2011.

But last May, Gaoqiao government officials claimed the container village 'posed danger to residents.'

Rescued: The old cargo containers were reportedly taken from the side of the road by a man in his 70s who acts as landlord to the workers

Abandoned: Many Chinese families struggle to find affordable accommodation and are forced to put up with living conditions many would view as intolerable
