Britain will find it almost  ‘impossible’ to fight simultaneous wars after dramatic cuts to the Armed Forces, the former head of the Army warned yesterday.

Lord Dannatt said it was a ‘risky’ policy to slash the numbers of service personnel to their lowest levels for more than a century in a bid to cut costs.

His comment came as 3,800 members of the Armed Forces were yesterday given redundancy letters.

Lord Richard Dannatt said it was a 'risky' policy to slash troop numbers

Some 2,900 soldiers received their notice. A total of 170 sailors and 730 RAF personnel were also made redundant.

The Army is facing another wave of severe cuts as early as next year to bring numbers down from their current level of 97,000 to 82,000 – its smallest size since the Boer War at the end of the 19th Century.

Former Army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt, now Lord Dannatt, warned: ‘In future we won’t be able to do the kind of things we have done on the scale we have done them in the past. That’s fine as long as the next decade is more peaceful.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said fewer than anticipated were being axed from the Royal Navy and the RAF

Asked whether Britain could fight simultaneous wars like it did in Iraq and Afghanistan, Lord Dannatt told the BBC: ‘It will be very difficult, verging on the impossible to do that when the Army is down to 82,000 by 2020.‘I know the policy is to rely very much more heavily on the reserves and that policy could work but it’s a risky policy and it’s unproven. I’m not saying what the Government is doing is wrong, but there are risks.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the cuts were regrettable, but necessary to plug a ‘multi-billion pound black hole in the defence budget’ left by the Labour government.

Mr Hammond said: 'Of course I regret 
that it has been necessary to make redundancies to deliver our plans for
reducing the size of the armed forces.

'We’ve now brought the defence budget back into balance for the first time in a generation.

'We will have smaller armed forces but we will ensure they will have the protection and equipment they need.

Mr
Hammond meeting members of the Brigade Advisory Group at Camp Bastion 
in Afghanistan today. The MoD is trying to reduce the size of the Army 
to 82,000

'The
Royal Navy and RAF redundancy figures are smaller than anticipated due 
to the MoD’s ability to use other measures, such as slowing recruitment.

'No
further significant reductions are expected for the Royal Navy or RAF. 
We still have some way to go to bring the size of the Army down to 
82,000 and decisions on what is necessary to achieve this are yet to be 
taken, but we won’t compromise the mission in Afghanistan.'

But Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘Savings have to be made, but we worry important skills and capabilities are being lost without thought for our Forces’ role in the world.’
