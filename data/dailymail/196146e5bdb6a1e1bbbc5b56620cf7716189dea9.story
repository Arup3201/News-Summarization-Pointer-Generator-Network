AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has said he lost out at the World Cup because a £28million transfer involving Mario Balotelli and a Premier League club has stalled after Italy’s performances in Brazil.

Italy crashed out at the group stages after failing to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica, and Berlusconi believes Balotelli’s disappointing performances in those games have scuppered his plans to get rid of the unpredictable 23-year-old.

One person who will no doubt that Balotelli is staying in Milan is his girlfriend Fanny Neguesha who was seen enjoying a spot of shopping in the Italian city.

But Berlusconi is far from amused, he said: ‘Other than Italy, I’m the one who lost at the World Cup,’ he is reported to have said during a meeting of his political party Forza Italia in Rome.

La Gazzetta reports him as saying: ‘I was selling Balotelli to an English team for several millions, but, after this World Cup, who will buy him now?

'I was going to sell it to a top English club for 35million [euros], then the deal has stalled.'

Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani defended the striker for his performances in Brazil, but another club vice-president, Berlusconi's daughter, Barbara, hinted at the possibility of a transfer this summer by saying he is 'replaceable'.

The former Manchester City forward has been heavily linked with a move to Arsenal over the summer, though Arsene Wenger was quick to dismiss the rumour last month.

'No. No, that’s pure invention,‘ the Arsenal boss said while working as a pundit for beIN Sport.

'We cannot believe absolutely everything that is on internet or is in newspapers.

'Sometimes it’s created by agents or by press who needs news. But in that case, it’s not true.'

Balotelli himself is said to be keen on a move to the Premier League side.
