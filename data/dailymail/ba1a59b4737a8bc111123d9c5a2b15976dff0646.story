Scuffle: Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, got into an approximately three minute scuffle when two convenience store owners catch him trying to steal beer from their store

An Oregon man left a convenience store with less than he walked in with when the store owners caught him trying to steal two beers and wrestled with him for nearly four minutes until he fled the store in nothing but his boxers and sneakers, authorities say.

Twenty-one year old Solomon Yemane-Berhane was arrested last Sunday and charged with resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, third-degree robbery, third-degree criminal mischief, third-degree theft, and fourth-degree assault, according to The Oregonian. 

A more than four minute surveillance video captured the scene Nov. 9 at a Best Mart in Beaverton beginning when one of the store's owners raced to the front door to block Yemane-Berhane from leaving with the stolen beers.

The owner manages to keep Yemane-Berhane away from the door long enough for her husband arrive. 

The three then wrestle around the store for about three minutes knocking down displays and tossing candy and other items onto the floor. Two other store-goers were inside at the time, but out of the camera's view during the scuffle.

Yemane-Berhane manages to slip out of the owner's hands, only after being wrestled out of his jacket, t-shirt, and shorts. He flees the store in his boxers with the owners not far behind.

After a short lull in the video, suveillance footage catches Yemane-Berhane returning to the store and snatching his jacket and shirt off the floor before leaving again. 

When police tried to stop Yemane-Berhane after he fled the store, Yemane-Berhane reportedly flipped the officers off and ran, according to The Oregonian.

Yemane-Berhane was indicted Friday on the slew of charges.
