Change: Parents contacted Wonton Food after becoming concerned

The world's largest fortune cookie manufacturer has removed romantic messages from their products after complaints from parents.

Wonton Food was contacted by parents concerned that the 'words of wisdom' offered in the crisp cookies were unsuitable for children.

The Brooklyn-based company, which produces five million 
cookies every day, has now replaced the saucy 'fortune' notes with milder prophecies.

'Some parents sent us e-mails.

'They said
they didn’t want their kids reading them,' explained vice president Derrick Wong.

'Different people have a different 
perspective,' he said. 

The company have now removed the more suggestive fortunes from their catalogue of 10,000 messages, reported The New York Post.

Messages
which raised eyebrows among parents include 'One who admires you 
greatly is hidden before your eyes,' and 'The evening promises romantic 
interest,' and 'A 
romantic mystery will soon add interest to your life.'

New direction: The Brooklyn-based company, which produces five million cookies every day, has now replaced the saucy 'fortune' notes with milder prophecies

They have been replaced by 
less controversial message such as, 'You make every day special,' 'No one on Earth is 
as beautiful as you,' and 'Only love makes us see ordinary things in an 
extraordinary way.'

'You
never know who will get the cookie,' said Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles.

'You will meet a tall,
dark stranger,’ means one thing to a 20-year-old fashionista - and 
another to a 6-year-old kid. Romantic messages aren’t one size fits 
all.
