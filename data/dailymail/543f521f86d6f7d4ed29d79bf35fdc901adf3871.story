'Victimised': Carol Howard, 35, today claimed she was 'smeared as a child predator' by Scotland Yard after winning a racism case against the force

A glamorous black policewoman who became Scotland Yard’s poster girl for policing of the 2012 Olympics today claimed she was 'smeared as a child predator' after winning a racism case against the force.

Carol Howard, 35, an armed officer in the elite Diplomatic Protection Group, sobbed as she told of how she had endured a long campaign of harrassment by senior officers.

This included her being painted as a 'sex offender', she told the Central London Employment tribunal.

Mother-of-two Mrs Howard won a racism and sex discrimination case against the Met earlier this month after being bullied by a senior officer.

The tribunal met again today to rule on the amount of compensation she is entitled to receive from the force.

Donning a leather mini-skirt, a white shirt and gladiator sandals, Mrs Howard told the hearing that she has been arrested three times since bringing the case against the force.

She has been investigated for assault, harassment, making threats to damage property, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession an indecent image of a child.

But in a witness statement, Mrs Howard, who was suspended from duty until yesterday, said the Metropolitan Police had ‘deliberately and maliciously smeared’ her.

She told the tribunal: 'I have been unfairly and unjustly smeared not only as a criminal but as a child predator because of misleading information deliberately and maliciously provided to the media by the police.

'I have always denied attacking my husband to whom I am still married. As for the alleged indecent image, it is a single innocent picture of my own six-year-old daughter shared with her father only, which the CPS have already alluded is not in the public interest to pursue.

'I am being advised separately in 
relation to all these matters. My husband and I remain fully committed 
in being good parents and role models to both of our children.'

Mrs Howard was one of only 12 female officers - and just two black women - in the Diplomatic Protection Group.

Earlier this month, the judges ruled she was the victim of 
sexual and racial discrimination while working in the unit.

Today, Mrs Howward directed her criticism at Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for playing down the victimisation while she was a frontline officer.

She said: 'I feel so angry, confused and upset. The Commissioner [said] that the actions surrounding my mistreatment were caused by one individual only.

'The truth was it was a collection of 
officers for whom he is responsible and who played a collective part in 
discriminating and victimising me, and the policies that the MPS has in 
place to deal with discrimination.

'This is also supported in the tribunal’s judgement. The Commissioner in interview played down the tribunal’s findings and he was dismissive of it.

'Watching it was like adding insult to injury. He did not seem to grasp what his organisation had done was simply wrong and he appeared to be in denial.'

Mrs Howard also claimed Scotland Yard had been feeding information to the media 'maliciously' about her arrest for alleged assault after it lost the high-profile suit.

She said. 'The Metropolitan Police 
introduced these matters to the press which were strategically and 
conveniently timed for the sole purpose of damaging and denigrating my 
good reputation. To make me unemployable.

'There is absolutely no viable or justifiable reason for this. This in itself is a vindictive act which is meted out to officers who seen to challenge and speak up about their experiences surrounding unfair treatment and unethical practices in the service.'

Mrs Howard was told by the Met Police that it had lifted her suspension at 4pm yesterday afternoon.

She said it was 'purely with today’s tribunal in mind' and labeled it 'absurd'.
