Families who dodged the rain for long enough to take a swim in the sea last summer were more likely to catch a bug and fall sick.

More than one in 20 popular beaches failed to meet even the minimum water quality standards set by the EU, according to research published today.

The list of 42 failures, which is 17 more than last year, includes several beaches at some of the UK’s most famous resorts such as Blackpool and Rhyl.

No good: Popular seaside holiday destination Blackpool in Lancashire was among the beaches who failed

EU rules mean that if these beaches are not cleaned up they will be required to put up danger signs, warning people not to swim, from 2016 onwards.

Household water bills have soared in recent decades to raise billions of pounds to treat and clean-up sewage released into rivers and the sea.

However, relentless rain and flooding during the wettest summer in 100 years led to an increase in the amount of bacteria and viruses ending up in bathing waters.

This type of pollution can originate from farmland and urban run-off, storm waters, misconnected plumbing, septic tanks and dog faeces.

Health risk: Several British beaches, including Rhyl in North Wales, did not meet the minimum water quality standard set by the EU

Danger: Summerleaze Beach at Bude on the Cornish coast was not judged clean and safe by the Marine Conservation Society

Bad business: For holiday destinations such as East Looe at the south Cornish resort of Looe, the water quality failures may lower visitors numbers further this summer

For swimmers, there is a risk of going home with an ear, nose or throat infection, or even gastroenteritis.

Blackpool, Lancashire

Rhyl, Wales

Summerleaze at Bude, East  Looe, Seaton, all in Cornwall

Plymouth Hoe and Exmouth, Devon

Church Cliff Beach at Lyme Regis and Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset

South Cliff at Bridlington, East Riding

Seaham, County Durham

Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire

Teams from the Marine Conservation 
Society(MCS) took water samples from some 754 officially designated 
bathing beaches last summer.

The number with excellent water quality fell by 113 to 403. The remaining 351 failed to achieve the highest rating with 42 missing even the minimum safe standard.

Among the high profile failures were some of the beaches in Blackpool, Rhyl, Bude, Bridlington, Lyme Regis, Exmouth, Seaham, and Kimmeridge Bay, in Dorset.

The findings are a blow to the resorts, which are already struggling because of a cost of living squeeze that means many people are staying at home.

However, not all is lost, for the same study was generally able to identify beaches within a short distance that were clean and safe.

Underperformed: The 42 failing EU beaches included several in the UK, such as Lyme Regis beach in Dorset

The failing beaches were spread across Britain, going as far north as Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, Scotland

MCS Coastal Pollution Officer, Rachel Wyatt, called for improved monitoring of sewer overflows and urgent action to reduce pollution from farms and populated areas.

‘We have recommended fewer beaches in every English region and in Wales and Scotland. In England, the north west and south west were hit particularly hard, with the fewest number of recommended beaches for at least a decade.

‘Action must be taken now. With stricter bathing water standards from 2015 and summers that appear to be getting wetter, the iconic image of people bathing off golden beaches could be at serious risk.’
