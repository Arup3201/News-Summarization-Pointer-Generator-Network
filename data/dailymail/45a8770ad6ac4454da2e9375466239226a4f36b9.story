The annual Garma Festival is a colourful and vibrant celebration of the Yolngu culture, held at Gulkula in north-east Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.

Now in its 16th year, the four day event is set against the backdrop of a stringybark forest and is designed to preserve cultural traditions and provide a forum for discussion on issues affecting the Aboriginal community.

Throughout the festival young and old take part in traditional bunggul, or dance, manikay, or song, and cultural ceremonies known as Wangga. Art, storytelling and other forms of education are all incorporated into Garma.

More than 800 tents are dotted around the Gulkula area, overlooking the Gulf of Carpentaria, and attendees are encouraged to stay onsite to appreciate the experience in its entirety.

Located in the north-eastern corner of the Northern Territory, Arnhem Land has been occupied by Indigenous Australians for tens of thousands of years and is rich in Aboriginal culture.

The area is sacred to its original inhabitants and rock paintings and artifacts have been dated back as far as 40,000 years. Taking in Kakadu National Park and bordered by the Gulf Of Carpentaria, Arnhem Land is one of the largest and most remote Aboriginal reserves.

The Yothu Yindi Foundation, who present Garma, describe the festival as 'Australiaâ€™s most significant Indigenous event, and a model for self-determination, reconciliation, Indigenous knowledge sharing, transfer and exchange'.

This year's theme is 'responsibility, reform, recognition', director of Garma Denise Bowden told the ABC, and highlighted the importance of closing the gaps for Indigenous Australians.

A new Garma Knowledge Centre was opened as part of this year's festivities, with many members of the Aboriginal community in traditional dress and body paint for the ceremony.

Politicians past and present attended the festival this year, with former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke at the event at the weekend and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten giving an address to Garma on Sunday.
