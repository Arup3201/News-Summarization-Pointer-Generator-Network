Missing: Eligenys DelValle, 15, of Vineland, New Jersey, is now believed to be with her mother

A 15-year-old U.S. schoolgirl who went missing after running away from home for the first time was found alive and safe yesterday, police said.

Eligenys DelValle, of Vineland, New 
Jersey - who had last been seen at home by her father Eligio Sanchez at 6pm local 
time (1pm GMT) on Saturday before he left for work - was last night believed to be with her mother.

Mr Sanchez had raised the alarm on Sunday morning and police later said that the 5ft 6in girl, who weighs 8 stone 8 lbs, had never run away from home before and they were not sure where she could have gone.

Lieutenant Pedro Casiano of Vineland 
Police Department said on Sunday after her disappearance: ‘Foul play is not 
suspected as the residence was secured and Eligenys did take some 
personal belongings prior to leaving.'

Detective Sergeant Paul Shadinger from the police force confirmed in an email to MailOnline last night that Eligenys 'has been found safe'.
