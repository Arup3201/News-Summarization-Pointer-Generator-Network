A Rhode Island farmer has welcomed Taylor Swift to his neighbourhood by cutting the words ‘Welcome Taylor’ into a corn maze.

Richard Manfredi heard about the pop singer’s recent purchase of a 17.75 million dollar seaside vacation home in Westerly and mowed the large message, and a guitar, into the 8-acre field.

A warm welcome: Rhode Island farmer, Richard Manfredi, mowed this message into his corn field to welcome singer Taylor Swift to the city

The Taylor Swift-themed maze at Manfredi Farms is open from 10am to 7pm and costs $8 a person to go through.

The farms also has a petting zoo with 150 animals, hayrides, golf, pumpkins and other fall activities, according to their Facebook page.

Manfredi says he created the message with the help of three others and did it to be a ‘good neighbour’, according to The Sacramento Bee.

Singer Taylor Swift recently bought a 17.75 million vacation home in Waverly, Rhode Island

Vacation home: Swift's new, five-bedroom, five-acre seaside mansion in Waverly, Rhode Island

The ritzy mansion, which has five bedrooms, is Swift’s fourth home.

It sits in front of 700 feet of 
waterfront and encompasses more than 11,000 square feet of living space,
sitting on five acres of land.

The singer, who started her career as a country musician and received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2008, is estimated by Forbes to be worth over $220 million.

Deadly: Swift has donated her guitar to a charity auction that raised money for fire victims in a Rhode Island nightclub, The Station, which killed 100 people in 2003

Swift, 23, recently proved she can be
a good neighbour too, by donating a guitar for a charity auction in 
West Warwick in August that raised money for a local scholarship.

It also raised money for a memorial to honour the 2003 Station nightclub fire victims.

The
Station Nightclub fire was the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. 
history, killing 100 people in February, 2003, during a concert by the 
band, Great White.
