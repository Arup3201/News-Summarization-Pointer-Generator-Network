At the controls of a blazing and doomed airship, Australian pilot Michael Nerandzic's mind turned to his passengers.

The 51-year old was preparing to land at an airfield in west Germany in June 2011 when trouble struck and fuel caught fire at the rear of the Goodyear blimp.

Lowering the craft just enough for his three passengers to jump clear, the shift in weight sent the airship rapidly skyward and Mr Nerandzic to a fiery death.

Described as an ultimate professional, Mr Nerandzic's wife Lyndy said he would have known what was ahead after the passengers jumped.

'He knew exactly what he was doing that day,' she said.

For his selflessness, Mr Nerandzic will posthumously receive the Star of Courage, one of Australia's most prestigious civilian awards.

Mr Nerandzic, who had more than 12,300 hours of Â­experience, will be the 143rd recipient of the Australian Bravery Decoration awarded by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove.

His wife Lyndy Nerandzic, who lives in Berkeley on the NSW south coast, told the Sydney Morning Herald her late husband had already received two other bravery awards but had no idea he had been nominated for this particular honour.

The pilot managed to get near enough the ground for passengers to escape before climbing back up

'He loved what he did, he absolutely loved it, he always wanted to fly,' she said.

'The one thing he always said was "Don't worry, you'll never die in an airship, they're so safe".'

However she hopes the award will help keep Mr Nerandzic's legacy alive.

'When Michael told them to jump, he knew then it would send him straight back into the sky,' she also told the Daily Telegraph.

'He's not just gone and disappeared,' she said. 'He's recognised for an act he did...it makes it easier.'

His award will be one of 78 Australian Bravery Awards and 22 Bravery Medals announced by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove on Monday.
