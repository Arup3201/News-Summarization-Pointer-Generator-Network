Britain is poised to overtake ailing rival France in car production as UK motor manufacturing heads towards a new record high.

Strong and rising sales of British-built cars - both at home and abroad - mean France is set to slip from third place in the European production league-table - behind Germany and Spain - to be replaced by Britain.

Figures to be released later this month are expected to show UK car production nudging ahead of France with around 1.55million cars built in 2013.

Pushing ahead: Figures to be released later this month are expected to show 1.55million cars were built in the UK in 2013

This would be up from 1.47 million in 2012 and 1.35million in 2011. And it is predicted to hit a new record of nearly 2 million within three years.

By contrast France’s car production is expected to slip to around 1.54million cars for 2013 -  down from 1.66million in 2012 and 1.88 million in 2011.

France’s ailing economy -  exacerbated by problems with the Euro -  and overcapacity under the current socialist Government are cited as key reasons for its declining car sales.

A spokesman for Britain’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said: ‘We’re currently neck and neck with France.

‘But Britain’s car production is on an upward trend. France’s is on a downward trend. We’re about to cross. It could well be that the new figures will show that 2013 is the year in which we overtake them.’

Germany is on track for 5.45m cars in 2013 with Spain reaching 1.76m.

But recent big investments by car-makers in Britain are aimed at boosting production even further, said the SMMT.

So by 2017 Britain is expected to hit a new record production level exceeding the 1.92million cars built in 1972 during the highpoint of the UK car industry - but also a period blighted by strikes, industrial unrest and union militancy.

Car production for the first 11 months of 2013 was up 4.5 per cent to 1.424million with the SMMT predicting full year production is ‘set to pass 1.million for the first time in six years.’

The news comes as latest figures released yesterday (Tuesday) showed sales of cars in the UK soared by nearly 11 per cent in 2013 to a six year high of more than 2.26milliion - and back to levels last seen before the economic melt-down.

Production: The motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the UK

The sales boom has been fuelled by rising confidence, cheap and flexible car finance deals, and windfall pay-outs by the banks to customers from the ‘personal protection insurance’ or ‘ppi’ miss-selling scandal. Pay-outs of around £3,000 per customer equate roughly to the deposit needed on a car finance plan.

The motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the UK.

Some 80 per cent of the cars built in the UK are exported. Of those exports, worth £30bn, half go to Europe and the other half to the rest of the world. Exports of cars and engines make up 10 per cent of the value of total UK exports.

The car-building boom is being spearheaded by mainstream British-brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, MINI, and Vauxhall, super-luxury car-makers like Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and the UK factories of Japanese giants such as Nissan, Toyota and Honda.

Bentley, owned by Germany’s giant Volkswagen group, is expanding to produce a new luxury 4X4 at its Crewe factory.

Nissan is about to start full production of its new generation Qashqai model at its factory in Sunderland where it employs more than 6,100 building it and the Note, juke and all-electric LEAF models. In 2012 it recorded record production of 510,57 cars.

From 2015 a new Infiniti model will be added following £250m investment creating 1,000 new jobs at the factory and with suppliers.

MINI, owned by Germany’s BMW, started production at its Oxford plant of its latest generation model in November with the help of 1,000 new robots installed as part of a major £750million investment that helps preserve 5,500 jobs at the plant.

Leading the way: The car-buying boom is being spearheaded by companies such as Jaguar

Rolls-Royce, also owned by BMW, is enjoying record sales with its Phantom, Ghost and Wraith Models.

Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata, is now expanding globally after investing billions in Britain including £1.5billion in a new hi-tech aluminium facility in Solihull creating 1,700 new jobs.

Because so many car-makers are foreign owned, executives refer now to ‘the car industry in Britain’ rather than ‘the British car industry’. But business leaders and ministers say their presence proves that the UK is a good place to manufacture motor cars.

New car sales in the UK alone raced to a six-year high in 2013. A total of 2,264,737 new cars were registered in 2013 - a 10.8% rise on the 2012 figure and the best annual total since the pre-recession year of 2007, said the SMMT. The annual total was boosted by a festive 23.76per cent rise, to nearly 153,000 sales in December alone- the 22nd successive month of increases.

On average, an additional 600 extra cars were registered per day in 2013 than in 2012. Private sales made up 1.07 million of the registrations last year - a rise of 15.6% on the 2012 share.

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ‘With its best year since a pre-recession 2007, the UK new car market has helped stimulate the country’s economic recovery.’ He noted: ‘While the European market is only now showing signs of improvement, the UK has consistently outperformed the rest of Europe with 22 consecutive months of growth.’

Mr Hawes explained: ‘The 10.8% increase in 2013 reflects the attractive financial offers available, as well as increased demand for more technologically advanced new cars.’We expect new car registrations to remain stable in 2014 as customers return to a more regular replacement cycle.’

Petrol engines’ share of the market grew slightly - from 47.8per cent in 2012 to 48.8per cent in 2013 - while diesel’s share dipped from 50.8per cent in 2012 to 49.8per cent. in 2013. The share of the market by alternatively-fuelled vehicles remained flat 1.4per cent. The ‘supermini’ sector was the largest last year, accounting for nearly 36per cent of all sales.
