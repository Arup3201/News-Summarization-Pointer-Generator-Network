Severe weather packing baseball-size hail, gushing rain and dangerously ferocious winds rolled into Nebraska on Tuesday afternoon as potentially dangerous storms targeted a number of Midwestern states.

South Dakota and Iowa, where voters were casting ballots in primary elections, were also in the line of fire Tuesday evening as the National Weather Service said the highest risk for severe weather was centered in parts of northern and eastern Nebraska, Iowa, and northeast Missouri.

Officials said there was the potential for a weather event called a derecho, which is a storm of strong straight-line winds spanning at least 240 miles, that could affect some 35 million people across the country's midsection.

Gonna be a long one: Meteorologists warned Tuesday that severe weather that had already brought 80MPH winds, tornado warnings and massive hailstones to the Midwest was expected to last well into the night

'This is one of these days we can't let our guard down,' said Bill Bunting, forecast operations chief at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. 'It's unfortunately panning out as we thought it would. This is shaping up as a very dangerous evening.'

The weather could pack winds of up to 80 mph, large hail and up to 4 inches of rain. An outbreak of severe thunderstorms is forecast for the afternoon into the early hours of Wednesday. It is expected to also affect parts of Illinois, Kansas and South Dakota.

Severe weather has been reported in Omaha, where the Eppley Airfield airport closed as officials wait out the effects of the storm system. Baseball-size hail was also reported in the northeast community of Norfolk, Nebraska.

The bad weather has already had an impact on the primary elections in South Dakota. A thunderstorm forced Senate candidate Mike Rounds, who was flying to Rapid City, to land in Pierre. Secretary of State Jason Gant said he hopes the weather doesn't hurt voter turnout, but he wants people to be safe.

'If you're in Nebraska, Iowa, or Missouri, this is going to be a very long night,' said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers

Derecho: The storm brought with it the potential for a derecho, a dangerous 240-plus mile long storm with severe winds that can affect millions across a broad area

Bunting said Iowa residents planning to vote Tuesday should be cautious about when they head out to the polls.

'There may be in many areas time to go out and do things before the storms hit. I think the main thing is to listen to the forecast, get some sense of when storms are likely in your area and just make sure you're in a safe place before the storms hit,' he said.

The severe weather threat arrives amid an unusually quiet late spring, with far fewer documented tornadoes in May than in many recent years.

CNN meteorologist Chad Myers warned that the severe winds could pose the biggest risk even after the other dangers appear to have passed.

'The derecho is a big wad of storms...that charges ahead very quickly and pushes out a tremendous amount of wind,' Myers said.

Myers urged residents in the affected region to stay indoors, perhaps for hours.

'If you're in Nebraska, Iowa, or Missouri, this is going to be a very long night,' Myers said.
