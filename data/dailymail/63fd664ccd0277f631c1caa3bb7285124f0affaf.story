The 22-year-old daughter of a renowned painter has been charged with two counts of attempted murder after stabbing her father and his friend at a Chicago art studio.

It took six police officers to restrain Isabella Maschietto, after she allegedly attacked the two men on Wednesday morning with steak knives she had hidden inside a book.

After stabbing her father, Romano Maschietto, and a 43-year-old man, prosecutors say the young woman repeatedly plunged a knife in the studio wall.

Frantic: It took six police to restrain Isabella Maschietto after the stabbing

Her father, who has regularly been commissioned by the city since the 1970s to create murals, is still in hospital.

The painter, who is responsible for the 60ft high and 44ft wide mural on the wall of a Michigan Avenue hotel, was stabbed repeatedly as he tried to stop his daughter.

She had 
allegedly been talking to a 43-year-old man at the studio, when she 
suddenly said she planned to kill him, and pulled out the knives, DNA 
Chicago reported.

The
 man, who has not been identified, was stabbed close to his heart. He 
fled when Romano Maschietto tried to grab his daughter.

The 22-year-old allegedly told police that she had taken drugs the day before the attack.

In
 January, her father had posted a message on Facebook asking for support
 for his youngest daughter, who was facing some struggles.

'I don't 
know what path is hers but the caring in the world will assist her 
success, realizing that wonderful potential that she is,' he said.

And,
 in 2011, he had described Isabella, the youngest of three sisters, as 
his 'sweet, charming and lovely youngest daughter'. He added: 'She is 
in deep need to build her self-esteem back up.'

Maschietto has lived in Chicago since leaving his childhood home of Vienna, in Austria, shortly after the Second World War.

He currently has a studio in the Zhou B Art Center, but when he received his first commission from the city in the 1970s, he helped children create large public murals.
