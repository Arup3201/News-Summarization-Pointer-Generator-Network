Teenage boys and girls at a secondary school are sharing the same toilets - to the outrage of parents.

Moulton School, Northampton, merged two blocks last month in a bid to cut bullying in 'intimidating' single-sex toilets.

But parents said the move could have the opposite effect - and teenagers with 'raging hormones' may shift their amorous liasons away from the bike sheds and onto school property.

Anger: These unisex toilets were installed for pupils in Moulton School, Northampton. One parent said it would encourage 'raging hormones and teenage angst' while another criticised the lack of mirrors

Mother-of-two Jayne Poole, 39, said: 'If the kids are dating there will be no more "round the back 
of the bike sheds" - it will be the toilets they escape to.

'At a time of raging hormones and teenage angst they need their own personal and separate space.

'I think this is a very bad idea.'

Headteacher Trevor Jones is believed to have made the controversial decision with the backing of school governors.

He said: 'We want to provide 
excellent facilities for our students and this design is intended to 
reduce both bullying and vandalism, as traditional toilet areas can be 
intimidating and unpleasant areas for students to go into.'

There are also other toilets in the school which have remained single-sex-only.

Headteacher Trevor Jones defended the move saying other toilets were 'intimidating and unpleasant'

Unisex school toilets are far from flash-in-the-pan - they were introduced six years ago.

The now-defunct company which ran Labour's Building Schools for the Future programme said the mixed-sex facilities could stop bullying.

Guidelines signed off by Labour's Department for Education also said urinals should be scrapped, glass-panelled walls installed between sinks and background noise increased to ensure 'aural privacy'.

Hand-washing 
areas would also be moved to semi-open corridors near the cubicles, where staff could see them.

And each school was recommended to have an extra 
self-contained lavatory with its own sink, where pupils could have more privacy.

The parents' group Campaign for Real Education opposed the facilities previously, too, saying: 'Itâ€™s very important that young people are not allowed to be pressured by the opposite sex and can retain their modesty.'

However, they are believed to have been installed in hundreds of schools which were built or revamped under Building Schools for the Future, which was axed in 2010.

They have become so widespread that national building firms have a 'stock design' for unisex toilets.

But the mixed toilet, which has two 
boys' and two girls' cubicles with a shared wash basin and hand dryer, 
has annoyed parents in other ways.

It has no mirrors, supposedly to stop it becoming a social hub.

One parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'Girls,
especially teenagers, care about their appearance, even more so when 
they are at a school with boys, so to remove the mirrors is ridiculous.

'They should be allowed to keep their appearance up, even if it is a simple thing such as making sure they look presentable.

'Even for the boys, they might want to re-arrange their tie if it has gone a bit wonky.'

She added: 'I have a daughter who goes to the 
school and she deserves privacy when she goes to the bathroom. Teenage 
girls go through changes, everyone knows that, it can be a delicate and 
embarrassing moment in their lives.

'It is just a gross breach of privacy.'

Former headteacher Chris McGovern, 
62, is the chairman of the volunteer parents' group the Campaign For 
Real Education and worked as a teacher for 35 years.

He
said he was 'extremely sceptical', adding: 'It may actually increase 
bullying because it is an area that teachers will rarely go - it could 
drive bullying underground, behind closed doors, in a way.

'There's no reason why it will possibly reduce any form of bullying.

'Toilets
are, and should be, private for both sexes. Mixing them could cause a 
disaster and children would probably want to have separate toilets.

'Pupils are under enough pressure as it is in school.

'I do believe it will be worse for the 
girls - and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the students don't want 
to go to the toilet while they are in school.

The changes took place last month at Moulton School in Northampton, which has more than 1,500 pupils

He added: 'It seems to be an exceptional decision, I haven't heard many like this before. It doesn't seem logical at all.'

The school, graded good by Ofsted this year, has more than 1,500 pupils and was made a specialist science college in 2002.

Headteacher Mr Jones said: 'The new area is being used regularly and safely, and the only adverse comment that has come from the students is regarding the absence of mirrors; a deliberate decision to avoid toilet areas becoming areas for social gathering.'
