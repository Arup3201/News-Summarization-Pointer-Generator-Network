The ancient city of Alexandria was built to align with the rising sun on the day of Alexander the Great's birth, a new study suggests.

The Macedonian empire builder, who conquered a swathe of territory stretching from Greece to Egypt in the west, to as far as the Indus River in the east, founded the city on Egypt's Mediterranean coast in 331BC.

Now research shows that on Alexander's birthday the main east-west thoroughfare of the ancient city is 'in almost perfect alignment' with the rising sun of the fourth century.

Giulio Magli, an archaeoastronomer at 
the Politecnico of Milan, hopes his results could help researchers in 
the hunt for Alexander's tomb, the location of which has been lost for 
over 2,000 years.

These days
 a modern city home to 4million people, Alexandria was in ancient times 
hugely prosperous and home to the Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the 
Wonders of the Ancient World, as well as the Library of Alexandria.

However
 a study of the ancient city's main thoroughfare, called the Canopic 
Road, shows it was not laid out according to topography - sitting, as it
 does, slightly off parallel with the Mediterranean coast.

Professor
 Magli and his colleague Luisa Ferro used a computer to plot the sun's 
position in the fourth century B.C. Because the earth's orbit varies, 
the path of the sun through the sky changes changes over time.

Still prosperous: The modern city of Alexandria on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, which is these days home to 4million people

Alexander III, commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Macedon, a state in northern ancient Greece.

Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16.

By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Himalayas.

He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history's most successful commanders.

Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia.

In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in several states ruled by Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.

After his death he became a near-legendary figure. He has long been the measure against which military leaders compare themselves and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics.

Alexander the Great was born on July 
20, 356BC, by the Julian calendar - which differs from our modern 
calendar because it omits leap years, which keep our calendar 
synchronised with the astronomical year.

The researchers found that on that 
day in the fourth century BC the sun rose in near perfect alignment with
 the Canopic Road, at a spot less than half a degree off the road's 
route.

A second star would have reinforced 
the effect. Regulus - the so-called 'King's star' which is the brightest
 in the constellation of Leo, found near the lion's head - also rose in 
near perfect alignment with the road.

Professor Magli told LiveScience that basing architecture on astronomy was common in the ancient world. The Great Pyramid of Giza is in near-perfect alignment with the points of the compass, for example.

The Egyptians, who Alexander conquered and who were admired in the ancient world for their science and maths, had long associated the sun god Ra with their own rulers, the pharaohs.

The researchers say Alexandria was the prototype of a series of Hellenistic towns designed as ‘king's towns’ that aimed to make explicit the divine power of their founder.

'Aligning the city to the sun in the day of birth of Alexander was a way to embody in the architectural project an explicit reference to his power,' Professor Magli told LiveScience, adding that the King's Star would have only added to the mystique.

Professor Magli and Ms Ferro are now examining other cities founded by Alexander and his successors to see if they maintain the link to the sun's route across the sky.

Their research was reported online in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology.

In the fourth century BC the city's main road would have also lined up with Regulus, the 'King's Star' which is the brightest in the constellation of Leo
