David Moyes insists he is over his sacking by Manchester United and has declared: 'I am ready to return to management.'

The Scot lasted less than a year at Old Trafford and was sacked in April with the club lying in seventh place in the Premier League.

Having been out of work for six months though, the former Everton manager told the BBC's Football Focus   he wants to get back in the dugout.

Moyes has had six months to reflect on his time at Old Trafford and says he wants to get back in the dugout

'I am ready to return,' Moyes said. 'I have enjoyed the time off but I have got to wait on the right job and make sure it's one that I want.'

He added: 'I will know when the right club comes along and I needed a little bit of time just to make sure that I am ready, and I am feeling good to go back.'

Reflecting on his time at United, Moyes reiterated his stance that he was not given enough time in the job.

'I got the job and I expected it to be a six-year plan,' he said. 'I expected to be given an opportunity to fulfil that and it wasn't what was expected.'

The 51-year-old was criticised for signing Marouane Fellaini, who performed poorly last season 

Moyes has backed his successor Louis van Gaal (right) to be a success as United manager 

Moyes' successor Louis van Gaal presided over one of the worst results in United's history as they were beaten 4-0 by League One MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

But the Dutchman has turned things around to get United up to fourth in the table and Moyes backed him to succeed.

'I daren't imagine what would have been said about it (if Moyes was in charge during the MK Dons defeat),' he said.

'But Louis Van Gaal has got a difficult job as well, just like I did when I took over at the job, and he needs to be given that opportunity to get his mark on the team, turn it around.'

Taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford proved to be too daunting a task for Moyes
