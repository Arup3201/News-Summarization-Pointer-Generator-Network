A curious new natural dietary supplement, most comparable to molasses, has been declared by Dr Oz as a powerful weight loss aid and a 'metabolism gamer changer', because it 'lowers hunger hormones.'

Yacon syrup was recently road tested by The Dr Oz Show, and 73 per cent of the 40 women who trialed it lost weight - an average 2.9 lbs - simply by consuming one teaspoon of the mild sweetener with every meal for four weeks, and changing nothing else about their lifestyles.

The fiber-packed syrup, extracted from the South American yacon root, is high in a compound called FOS; a digestion supporting prebiotic which feeds healthy gut bacteria and supposedly helps you feel full, at only 20 calories per tablespoon.

Yacon syrup, which is said to taste like raisins, is actually nothing new - it's been around since Aztec times and people in Brazil and Peru have long touted it as a good low-sugar food that can help with diabetes, digestive problems and even kidney disorders.

As for rock-solid scientific evidence on yacon syrup's benefits, there isn't much beyond Dr Oz's trial. Only one small study which was published in Clinical Nutrition in 2009, and found that obese women did experience 'a significant decrease in weight, cholesterol and insulin levels' after taking the syrup three times a day for four months.

But don't get too excited. The women were also instructed to walk for 45 minutes a day and reduce their caloric intake, which appears to rather defeat the point of that particular exercise.

And in the case of Dr Oz's study, the weight loss attributed to yacon syrup could also be down to a common diet-test phenomenon whereby research subjects subconsciously make better food choices while they are under the microscope - even when they are instructed not to change their lifestyles in any other way.

A quick Amazon search on the top-selling brand of Yacon Syrup turns up generally good reviews from those who have tried it.

 Yacon syrup is a thick, molasses-like substance which can be used as a low-calorie natural sweetener and as a diet supplement.

It is high is fiber and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) - which are prebiotic, non-digestible carbohydrates that act as food for healthy gut bacteria.

The syrup is said to help with weight loss by regulating blood-sugar levels, reducing appetite and making you full, at only 20 calories per tablespoon.

'Like many, I bought this after seeing the Dr Oz segment. It did work for me, as I lost three lbs after a month of taking the yacon syrup,' one customer writes, although she points out that there are 'cheaper alternatives' of foods rich in FOS.

Nineteen out of the 205 reviews were negative however, with one customer warning: 'This product was touted as being a stabilizing influence on blood sugar... but it was just the opposite.'

Another writes: 'I took it morning and evening and gained ten pounds. My blood sugar went out of control. Never again.'

Of course, while often helpful, reviews - much like the advice of Dr Oz, as history dictates - should be taken with a pinch of salt.

MailOnline asked New York and LA-based 
nutritionist Shira Lenchewski for her lowdown. 'To say that yacon syrup 
will assist with weight loss is generous, but not totally bogus', she 
says, but adds that the syrup is a 'promising sugar alternative'.

The benefits of digestion-boosting FOS are certainly plentiful, Ms Lenchewski claims: 'Gut health translates to overall health, so a robust flora ecosystem is essential for preventing inflammation and boosting intestinal immunity.

It's also high in soluble fiber, which helps people feel full, and assists in mediating the body’s blood glucose response after a meal.'

'To say that yacon syrup will assist with weight loss is generous, but not totally bogus'

She did warn however, that because yacon passes through the intestines largely undigested: 'It can be harsh on the gastro-intestinal  tract, especially in people with inflammatory bowel conditions, and may cause gas'.

The consensus then appears to be that at best, yacon syrup may indeed assist with healthy weight loss, and at worst, it could have unwanted side effects. On balance however, its natural health properties do seem to outweigh the possible risks and, whether or not it truly works as a diet aid on its own, it makes for a good low-calorie sweetener.
