Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a two-year-old girl died in hospital on Saturday afternoon.

Kasey Hambleton was pronounced dead at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool at 1pm after suffering a number of serious injuries.

Connor Gibson, 23, of Blackpool, Lancashire, has been charged with murder and will make his first appearance at magistrates court tomorrow.

Death: Two-year-old Kasey Hambleton died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital from serious injuries

Second arrest: A woman was also arrested on suspicion of murder

A 23-year-old woman, also from Blackpool, was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been bailed until Tuesday 8 July 2014.

Officers were originally called by the Ambulance Service to attend an address in Blackpool, at around 10.20am on Thursday, where Kasey was reported to have been found unresponsive.

She was taken by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital but later transferred by air ambulance to Alder Hey in a critical condition.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Gilbert from Lancashire Constabulary's Force Major Investigation Team said: 'This is a terribly tragic incident where a little girl has sadly lost her fight for life and I am determined to find out exactly what has happened to her and how she has come to acquire injuries so serious that they have proven fatal.

'I personally encourage anyone who may have any information about little Kasey and the days leading up to her death to come forward to help us in what has now developed into a murder investigation.'

A one-year-old child was also admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital on Thursday with bruising, where she was assessed. She is not in a serious condition.

Anyone with any information about this incident should contact Lancashire Police.
