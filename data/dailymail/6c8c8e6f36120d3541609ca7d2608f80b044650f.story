Surprise: Airports may seem unexciting - but many are now using them as perfect places to 'hook up' with new partners, according to a survey

For most people airports are places to be endured rather than enjoyed.

But a new survey has shown that many travellers see these busy transport hubs as perfect venues for finding love.

This is now so common that a website has  published a list of the top five US airports in which to 'hook up' as voted for by its members.

The poll by Miami-based MeetAtTheAirport.com
- which acts as a dating website for travellers - found that east coast airports 
are more fruitful hunting grounds for those seeking a relationship than 
their west coast counterparts.

This is due, in part - it found - to worse weather and longer delays, which give singles more time to meet each other.

The website surveyed its 60,000 members to come up with the top
five airports for hooking up - taking into account issues such as the airport's size, restaurant and 
bar options, weather and other factors.

Top
spot went to Orlando International Airport in Florida, which received a
rating of 3.5 out of a possible five stars in the vote.

The
airport is thought to be the best place to meet, among other things, 
because of its large number of restaurants and bars and the presence of a
Hyatt Regency Hotel within the main 
terminal offering plenty of rooms for liaisons.

Another Florida airport, Miami International, came second in the list. 
The hub also has a large number of restaurants and bars and attracts a 
mix of international travellers as the main gateway between the US and 
Latin America.

Newark International Airport, which came
third, is thought to have scored well because of its closeness to New 
York city and the variety of travellers who use it - from  
Wall Street businessmen to supermodels.

Looking for love: Orlando International is the top US airport for finding love, according to a new survey. One of the attractions listed was its on-site Hyatt Regency Hotel (pictured)

Meeting place: Miami International Airport came second in the poll and was rated highly because of its restaurants and bars and for its mix of international travellers

Boston's
Logan International Airport came in at number four in the list 
primarily because of bad weather such as snow, which can sometimes cause
long delays - giving travellers more time to get to know each other.

As
the 'City of Brotherly Love' it is perhaps no surprise that 
Philadelphia International Airport made it in to the top five.

The airport 
has 16 bars, 
seven lounges and 57 restaurants, according to the survey, and also scored well because of its large 
size, proximity to the tri-state region, and 'friendly 
locals,' USA today reports.

Success: Newark International Airport came third in the survey - and was rated highly because of its closeness to New York city, and the number of Wall Street traders and other successful people who use it

Logan: Boston's Logan International Airport came fourth in the survey. The hub was rated highly, in part, because of delays caused by bad weather

Venue: Philadelphia International came fifth in the list of top US airports in which to meet people
