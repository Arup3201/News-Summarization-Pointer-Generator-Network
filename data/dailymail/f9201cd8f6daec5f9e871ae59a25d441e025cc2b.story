The NFL is expected to adopt penalties for using the N-word on the field that will be enacted starting this upcoming season.

A proposal currently circulating through the league’s competition committee seeks to impose a 15-yard penalty against the team of a player using the racial slur, with a second utterance resulting in ejection.

John Wooten, head of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which monitors diversity in the NFL, first disclosed the initiative to CBS Sports.

Something must be done: Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito (68) and tackle Jonathan Martin (71) stand on the field during training camp prior to last season - one in which Martin left the team amid claims he was bullied

He said the league is seeking to completely remove the word from league workplaces and make it a fineable offense – from the front office all the way down to the field.

‘I will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we're trying to do,’ Wooten said Saturday to a standing ovation during the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.

‘We want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room,’ he continued. ‘Secretaries, PR people, whoever, we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere.’

The NFL declined to comment, but told the site workplace ‘respect’ is a key aspect of changes the league is seeking to make in the fallout from the Miami Dolphins bullying and Riley Cooper scandals.

Wooten said that next month’s competition committee meeting is the first step to making the penalty the law of the land.

‘I think they're going to do what needs to be done here, there is too much disrespect in the game,’ he added.

Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome, himself African-American and a member of the competition committee, also spoke about the proposal Saturday during the combine.

‘With any rule that we put into play, we have to look at it from A to Z and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences,’ he said, according to NFL.com.

‘But as it was stated in our meeting, there are mics everywhere,’ Newsome added. ‘If something is being said, it's probably going to be captured somewhere. So, it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to.’

Newsome, one of only seven black GM's in a predominantly African American league with 32 teams, also expressed a desire to see the rule further discussed.

Former New York Giants great Harry Carson, now the executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told the New York Daily News that use of the word already results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but that more needs to be done.

‘It needs to be put a halt to in the locker room, on the field, whether it’s staff, whether it’s a player, there is no room for it,’ said the Hall of Famer.

Infamous: Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught using the word at a concert, he received no fine or penalty for his actions, he also did not miss a single game

Fans who spoke to the paper had mixed reactions.

‘I am sure that word gets thrown around all the time every game so how would you even enforce that?’ Giants fan Brian Ellis wondered aloud, adding ‘I don’t think it should be banned.’

A friend of Ellis’ said ‘the whole idea is stupid.’

A Philadelphia Eagles fan told the paper he is in favor of policing the word’s use.

‘There are a lot of ways to trash talk without saying certain words to people… the players will learn to comply with the rules.’

Cooper, who plays for the Eagles, was infamously caught on video repeatedly shouting the slur at an African-American security guard while attending a concert at the team’s stadium prior to last season.

Twitter reactions ranged from surprise to calls of hypocrisy as many compared it unfavorably to the ongoing Washington Redskins name saga.

‘Saying the n-word on the field is a 15 yard penalty. Wearing a racial slur on the front of your jersey; totes cool,’ a fan wrote.

Hypocritical?: Many fans wondered on social media how a racial slur - Redskins is a derogatory term for Native Americans - can be used as a team name but not spoken on the field

‘Please tell me the NFL isn't seriously considering a penalty if a player says the N word. Games would take 6 hours,’ said another.

‘Latest NFL recap: N-word, 15-yard penalty; R-word, marketed; caught dragging unconscious fiancé out of elevator, employed. Got it,’ tweeted one more.

Others said teams would run out of players and be forced to look into the stands for players to finish out the second half of games.

The rule must be backed by the competition committee to go to the owners for a final vote, which would take place prior to the upcoming season.
