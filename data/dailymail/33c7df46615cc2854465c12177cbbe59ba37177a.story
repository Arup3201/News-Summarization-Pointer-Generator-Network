Top fashion brands are on the cusp of designing larger pockets for jeans in order to fit Apple's new iPhone range.

At 5.5 inches the iPhone 6 Plus is larger than most other  smart phones on the market. It's also going to be one of the most popular on the market.

Some users have claimed it's too big to fit into their jeans without causing damage and others have gone as far as saying it can even bend if you sit down with it in your skinny jeans pocket.

But now it turns out some fashion designers are prepared to bend themselves towards the iPhone.

Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo recently told Quartz that the company was in talks about clothing comparability.

'(The company is) having conversations currently with the product development team regarding technology overall, and how our clothes can provide compatibility from a user perspective. Jean pockets is one of those conversations,' they said. 

Five other brands told Mashable they were looking at re-engineering their pants around bigger phone handsets.

'Without being iPhone 6-specific, our mantra, like (Steve Jobs), will always be to design products that make people's lives a little better, Levi's Head of Global Design, Jonathan Cheung, said. 

Lee Jeans designer, Whitney Neary, said the company started talking about pocket size when the new iPhones were released, but they haven't committed to anything just yet.

'It's something that we always are considering, in terms of the functionality of our garments. Of course, we're always going to make sure that we're going for something that's flattering for the consumer,' she said.

Apple's newest additions, which were released on September 19, are larger and lighter than the iPhone 5 (left) which was 4 inches, compared with the iPhone 6 Plus (right which is 5.5 inches

'But we're always thinking about how she wears the garment, what occasion she's wearing the jeans for and what she needs to just make them work for her everyday life.' 

An American Eagle's spokesperson said 'Currently our men's pockets already accommodate the larger phones including the iPhone 6. Women's is still being evaluated'.

'Within certain product lines, such as our men's active apparel for instance, we do use iPhones and Samsung phones in our fit sessions to ensure that the pockets are large enough to accommodate these larger phones. The iPhone 6 would fit in the pockets now,' a spokesperson for L.L. Bean said. 

The iPhones went on sale on September 19 and those in Australia were among the first to get their hands of the new Apple products

The size of the handset didn't stop thousands from queuing for hours outside Apple stores around the world to be the first to get their hands on the new devices

J. Crew's head of women's design, Tom Mora, said the company tried to consider every aspect of a customer's life through the design process and phones 'is no exception'.

'We think about all of these details - whether it's introducing new tech accessories for the new iPhone 6 - or special interior pockets to carry the various generations of iPads or tablets,' he said.

It comes after social media was abuzz with #bendgate when people claimed the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus could bend if you wore jeans or had it in your pocket for long periods.
