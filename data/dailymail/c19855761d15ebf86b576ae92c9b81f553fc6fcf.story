Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted he still thinks about Manchester United and misses Sir Alex Ferguson, the former Old Trafford manager who helped make him a superstar.

The Real Madrid forward was speaking after winning the Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year, beating Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer to the prize in Zurich.

It was the third time Ronaldo has claimed the honour and he said afterwards: 'I think about Manchester United.

Ronaldo's development as a young player at Manchester United was aided by Sir Alex Ferguson

'The beginning of my career was there, that's where I started. I know the fans are there supporting me.

'I haven't had a message from Sir Alex yet but I speak with him often.

'He told me to keep improving all the time. He said: "Cristiano, you're the best, don't worry about the rest."

'He's fantastic. I miss him.'

Ferguson signed Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon as an unproven 18-year-old in 2003 and helped him develop into a global superstar.

Ronaldo has continued to enjoy success since moving to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2009

The Portuguese scored 118 goals in 292 appearances during his six seasons at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League titles, the FA Cup, two League Cups and the UEFA Champions League.

Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid for a then-world record fee of £80million in July 2009 and has gone on to win a La Liga title, two Copa del Reys and a second Champions League.

But the 29-year-old ruled out any chance of a return to Manchester, having recently signed a new contract to remain at the Bernabeu until 2018.

'I signed a new contract for many years so I am motivated to win more things for the club,' he added.
