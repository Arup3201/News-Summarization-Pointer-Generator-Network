Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a New Year's message to U.S. President Barack Obama that Moscow is looking for equality in bilateral relations next year.

The Kremlin on Wednesday published several dozen New Year's messages addressed to heads of states and international organizations such as the Olympic Committee and FIFA.

Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and said that it should serve as a reminder of 'the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability.'

Moscow is anxious for the relations to advance but only as long as there is 'equality and mutual respect.'

Conspicuously absent from the list of the recipients of New Year's messages was Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

He also used his New Year's speech to hail his country's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula as an achievement that will 'forever remain a landmark in the national history.'

Putin's comment in his pre-recorded annual address on Wednesday already has been broadcast in Russia's far eastern regions, where the holiday was celebrated hours ahead of Moscow, given the time difference.

Under the combined blow of the sanctions and slumping oil prices, the Russian ruble has lost about half its value this year and the national economy has drifted into recession. 

Putin has promised that the economy will rebound in two years, but he has failed to offer a specific plan for easing Russia's heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues.

That mattered little until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine.

Experts have warned that Putin's popularity, which soared after the annexation of Crimea, could fizzle quickly amid his nation's economic downturn.

But the Russian leader refrained from directly referring to Russia's economic woes in his New Year address, praising his citizens for their
