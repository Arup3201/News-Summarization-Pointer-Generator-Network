Giving a thumbs and smiling for the camera, this African migrant celebrates after successfully storming a barrier to make his way into Spanish territory.

The migrant, accompanied by another man who drapes his arm over him, was one of 600 Africans, who charged at the border fence separating the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco today.

Only 30 of them successfully managed to climb over before running to safety prompting the group to congratulate themselves for succeeding in their dangerous mission.

A migrant gives a thumbs up for the camera and celebrates with a friend after the pair become successful in managing to storm a barrier in Morocco to make their way into Spanish territory 

Only 30 men successfully managed to climb over the 20-foot high fence before running to safety prompting the group to congratulate themselves for succeeding in their dangerous mission

According to the Spanish government, the group were the latest in a flow of migrants who have been trying to reach Melilla and the other Spanish north African territory of Cueta, which together have Europe's only borders with Africa.

Several migrants remain perched at the top of the  fence, refusing to come down, with Moroccan authorities waiting for them at the bottom for when they decide to come down

In a statement the government explained that the group stormed the 20-foot, triple layer fence around Melilla early this morning, with 30 succeeding in climbing over.

Shortly afterwards, a separate group charged at another part of the fence, but they were kept away by Moroccan security forces in co-ordination with the Spanish police, the statement added.

The two groups totalled more than 600 migrants and several remain perched on top of the fence, at the foot of which Spanish police remained deployed.

No migrants nor police were known to have been hurt in the incident - unlike during some earlier attempts this year.

The flow of migrants seeking to enter Europe via Ceuta and Melilla has intensified this year.

Some 16,000 migrants have tried to storm the Melilla fence and more than 2,000 have made it over, the Spanish government delegation there says.

There have been at least 65 attempts by groups of Africans to climb the fence this year, compared to a total of 38 in 2013.

Spanish authorities accuse human-traffickers for bringing the migrants to the border in the hope of reaching European soil.

Fleeing war, persecution and poverty in their home countries, hundreds of these men arrive every month, and will regularly rush the high wire fences in order to climb over.

Many will injure themselves in their frustrated attempts - cutting their hands and feet to pieces on barbed wire, or hurting themselves falling over the other side.

From there, they are scooped up by border guards who watch the fence day and night. They will be taken to a migrant centre in the nearby town where they will either be released - or deported.

In October, 20 migrants were pictured climbing over the fence close to a luxury golf course in Melilla, while golfers teed off.

They could be seen perched at the top of the 20 foot fence in the background of the fairway while golfers, playing at the exclusive course, lined up their shots in the foreground.
