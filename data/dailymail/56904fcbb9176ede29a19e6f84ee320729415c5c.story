A 21-stone man who was bullied for his looks has opened up about how he dropped 8st in two years and completely turned his life around - by using Big Brother star Josie Gibson's exercise DVD.

In his late teens, 27-year-old Adam Brown, from Southport, Merseyside, wore XXXL clothes and tipped the scales at 21st, and he saw no end in sight to his unhappy and unhealthy lifestyle.

He said: 'Eventually I just learnt to block the bullies out. But then when I got home, the days' events would all go through my mind and I would sit and just eat countless packs of crisps, chocolate bars, big bottles of fizzy drink and ice cream.'

Adam Brown has always been 'on the large side' (left) and was bullied at school for his weight. Over the past two years he has dropped eight stone and completely turned his life around (right)

Two years ago Adam decided it was time to make a change. He gave up junk food and fizzy drinks and began walking his cousin's dog, which was the physical activity that kickstarted his weight loss

Even after he left school, the bullying continued and the stress of it all made him turn to food for comfort.

'I have even been refused entry to a busy bar because of my size,' he said.

'I took up the space of two people, so they refused my entry, which then resulted in me getting a big takeaway and going home.'

He took a job at a bar, which kept him on his feet for hours at a time, but his love of alcohol and penchant for partying meant he gained even more weight. 

Finally, things began to turn around when Adam confided in a close friend that he was gay. 

'She didn't judge me in anyway,' he said. 'She was there for me in every way a friend could be, she was my rock.'

Adam lacked confidence and thought he would be single and overweight forever

Not only has he transformed his lifestyle, but he is also now dating Ant Hookway, the love of his life (left). The couple got engaged this Christmas

From then on, Adam decided it was time to transform himself. He gave up junk food and fizzy drinks and began walking his cousin's dog, which was the physical activity that kickstarted his weight loss.

Then he came across a workout DVD that changed his life forever - 30 Second Slim, starring Big Brother's Josie Gibson.

'I could do this from the comfort of my living room with nobody watching me,' he said, admitting that at first, he was so out of shape that he could only do parts of the DVD at a time.

But as the weeks and months went by, the workout got easier and easier, and Adam began to see the weight slip off.

The former Big Brother star event took to Twitter to voice her support for her number one fan, tweeting at him last week: 'You are so cute!!! Xxx I wish I could give you a little cuddle x'.

Now, two years later, Adam is an incredible 8st lighter and 'completely over the moon' with his transformation.

He has finally found the confidence to launch his own event-planning company, and he regularly gives advice via Twitter to others who are struggling with their weight issues.

What's more, while he once believed he would remain single forever, Adam has recently found his true love Ant Hookway, who has supported him in his weight loss journey. The couple got engaged this Christmas.

'I can't wait for us grow old together and be one happy family,' Adam said.

Now, Adam has made diet and exercise an essential part of his life
