There have been a lot of ups and downs in the 50-year history of the programme, but few TV shows have held the same appeal as Match of the Day over the years.

After Kenneth Wolstenholme left, I was lucky enough to get my chance and the thing that put me on the map was the FA Cup third round replay between Hereford and Newcastle. That match, with Ronnie Radford’s terrific goal, convinced people I could do the big games.

Special goal: David Beckham scores for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996

Those were the halcyon days when 10 million people tuned in each week, but things have changed since then.

We never used to see a replay — the only machine that the BBC had that was capable of doing them was used for horse racing! So Barry Davies and I would track the action with words and then a replay would be added after Grandstand.

The other big change has been the logistics. We went from preparing for teams of 11 players with one sub to full squads of 18. I remember walking around grounds to commentary positions on camera platforms and it was all shoulder to shoulder, but the whole scene is now geared towards public entertainment and glamour.

Legend: TV commentator John Motson covered top matches for over 30 years for the BBC

Special one: Motson enjoyed watching Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United

After around 1,500 games of commentary, it’s hard to pick out favourite ones — but there were always special players to cover.

In the Premier League it was Thierry Henry, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo, and before that people like Paul Gascoigne.

The one game that does stick out was England’s 5-1 win in Germany and if you pushed me for a goal it would be David Beckham’s from the halfway line against Wimbledon. I was shocked by the sheer audacity of it and I got a very good view!
