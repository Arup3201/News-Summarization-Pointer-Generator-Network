Murdered: Alexander Litvinenko was believed to be helping the British

Dissident Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko was yesterday branded a 'traitor' by his own father.

Litvinenko, 43, is believed to have been murdered by radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 after his tea was spiked at a top hotel.

As he lay in agony on his death bed, he blamed Vladimir Putin - an accusation echoed at the time by his father Valter, now 73.

But yesterday the pensioner begged forgiveness for the charge and accused his son of being a 'traitor' and a British spy.

The attack on his own son - and a stunning volte face - comes as Valter, a widower, bids to win back the support of the Putin regime so he can return to Russia after a period of exile in Italy.

In 2006, Valter had said of his son's 
death: 'I have no doubt that it was done by the secret services on the 
authority of Vladimir Putin.'

He begged Russian TV: 'Help me, an old man, to get back to my country.'

He said he suddenly realised his son's treachery 'like a click in my head' following revelations that he was paid by the British secret services after acting as a consultant on Russian organised crime.

'I ask you to forgive me, my motherland, forgive me for God's sake!' said a tearful and emotional Valter Litvinenko on state controlled Russian television.

His son - a Putin enemy who fled Moscow for London - was 'a disgrace to me, to all of our family', he said.

Litvinenko Senior accused prominent exiles in London of using him for their own ends to blacken the Russian premier's name.

There was no immediate reaction from the Russian authorities on whether he would be welcomed back.

Scotland Yard's main suspect in its 
murder probe is Russian MP and ex-secret services agent Andrey Lugovoi. 
Russia has refused to extradite him to face murder charges.

Last week MI5 and MI6 were ordered to hand over any secret documents concerning their alleged relationship with Mr Litvinenko.

The 
evidence will form part of a wide-ranging investigation into allegations
that Mr Litvinenko was killed by the Russian state while he was 
working for the British security services.

The request has been made by Dr Andrew Reid, the St Pancras coroner, who is conducting the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death.

He has agreed to consider allegations that Mr Litvinenko was murdered because of his outspoken criticism of Vladimir Putin.
