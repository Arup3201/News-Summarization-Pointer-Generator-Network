Uruguay remain confident that Luis Suarez will be fit to face England on June 19 - despite the striker having an operation on a knee injury today.

Sportsmail understands that officials believe the 27-year-old is unlikely to be fit for the World Cup opener against Costa Rica, but that he could play five days later.

Suarez picked up the injury in training on Wednesday and underwent meniscus surgery on Thursday morning. Despite Uruguay's optimism, he could still miss the tournament, given the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines.

Out? Luis Suarez is touch and go for the World Cup after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury

Major blow: Suarez is Uruguay's talisman and is set to miss the whole of the first stage

The 
striker - who was voted PFA Player of the Year for his performances at 
Liverpool this season - is Uruguay's talisman but is almost certain to 
miss up to between four to six weeks.

And,
 in a direct boost to England's chances of progressing out of Group D, 
Suarez may be out for the entirety of the first stage and beyond 
following results of an MRI scan.

A Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The latest information is that we 
are deciding what to do, but there are increased possibilities 
(involving surgery).

'I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay 
Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’

The South American's are fancied as potential dark horses and face Roy Hodgson's side as well as Italy and Costa Rica.

Suarez was checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil.

The best case for Suarez is recovery within four to six weeks, but with the final 23-man squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves the country with very little wiggle room.

Any decision to include Suarez from there - not match fit - would represent a sizeable risk.

They won't be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn't play his first game for seven weeks.

The worst case scenario for Suarez is a four-month lay-off, which would heavily impact on Liverpool's start to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven't been officially informed.

It's your time again: Diego Forlan is set to become even more involved in the Uruguay frontline this summer

Knock: The Liverpool striker picked up the injury on Wednesday and was immediately sent for an MRI scan

Upset: The 27-year-old is having meniscus surgery on Thursday and could miss up to six weeks

Main man: Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani will have the task of firing the South Americans to glory

Luis Suarez: (77 caps, 38 goals)

Edinson Cavani: (60 caps, 20 goals)

Diego Forlan: (107 caps, 36 goals)

Christian Stuani: (66 caps, 13 goals)

Abel Hernandez: (11 caps, 7 goals)

The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar 
Tabarez's squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem 
later in the evening.

Roberto
 Pastoriza, executive of the Uruguayan Football Association, confirmed 
that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps.

Developments heap more pressure on Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani, who will lead the line when they face Costa Rica on June 14.

Veteran Diego Forlan - so impressive in South Africa four years ago - was expected to play a bit-part role but may now be needed alongside Cavani.

They do still have other options, with Espanyol's Christian Stuani and Palermo's Abel Hernandez waiting in the wings.

Since he signed for Liverpool in January 2011, he has not missed a single match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his team-mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and determination – he will always make himself available for training, even if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others to spend time in the medical room.

Should Suarez be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in Brazil, he would be left distraught. The last time there was a major tournament in South America, the 27-year-old was the star of the show as Uruguay won the Copa America in 2011.
