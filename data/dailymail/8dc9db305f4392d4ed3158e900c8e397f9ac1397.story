Retired Dutch footballer Ruud Van Nistelrooy has been accused of racism after visiting a hospital dressed as a King with a 'blacked-up' face.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, who was taking part in the Parade of the Three Kings in Marbella, Spain, dressed up as Middle Eastern king Balthazar.

Wearing black face make-up, a jewelled head dress and a robe with a leopard print trim, the Dutchman entertained the crowds at the weekend.

Meeting locals: Along with the two other 'Kings', Van Nistelrooy met with locals

Along with the two other 'Kings', Van 
Nistelrooy visited a hospital where he gave gifts to
 staff and handed out sweets to children.

He posted several photos of his costume on Twitter writing: 'In hospital with presents for the young and old.'

But many fans were outraged and Twitter user Ian Harding tweeted: 'What the sweet Jesus is Rudd Van Nistelrooy doing? And yes, that's actually him!!'

McAllyn wrote: 'Nistelrooy Is A Huge Racist Piece of S***'

Kris Maher ‏wrote: 'So this what Ruud Van Nistelrooy has been up to since he retired!?'

Popualr: Dressing up as the kings is popular and this regularly involves ‘blacking up’ in Spain

Charity work: He posted several photos of his costume on Twitter writing 'In hospital with presents for the young and old

Betting website Paddy Power declared 
on their Twitter page: 'Ruud Van Nistelrooy thought he was doing a good 
deed by visiting a hospital but he didn't think this one through...'

But
 one of his fans @MarkieBoy tweeted the footballer saying:  'People are 
playing that racist card to easy now a days ,to busy jumping on the band
 wagon to see the good you were doing.'

Although the costume appears controversial, Balthazar is traditionally portrayed as a black man in historical texts.

In Spain Three Kings’ Day is an annual post-festive celebration, held every January.

In celebration of the Three Wise Men 
visiting the baby Jesus, people mark the end of the Christmas 
season with processions and presents.

Dressing up as the kings is popular and this regularly involves ‘blacking up’.

Hero: Ruud Van Nistelrooy during his Manchester United heyday

This
 kind of behaviour would generally be viewed as controversial in the UK 
whereas in Spain it seems completely normal and simple harmless fun.

On Friday German chancellor Angela Merkel raised eyebrows when she was pictured alongside children with blacked-up faces on the steps of the chancellery in Berlin.

Fortunately for the CDU leader, the 
visiting children were not part of a political stunt but carol singers 
dressed up as the three wise men for the German Twelfth night, known as 
Three Kings' Day.

And 
last week a ten-year-old Leeds United fan became embroiled in an online 
race row after he blacked up to pose with his hero El Hadji Diouf.

The child posted a series of pictures on his Twitter account provoking a backlash from users who said he was racist.

But the primary school child said he did not realise it would be offensive and did it as a tribute to his footballing hero.
