A man who allegedly sparked a Christmas Day siege on the Gold Coast has appeared in court on charges of attempted murder and keeping a rabbit.  

Anthony Shane Randall, 36, was arrested on Christmas morning after a lengthy stand-off with police during which he allegedly fired gunshots in Southport.  

Randall came to the attention of police on Christmas Eve when he was involved in a dispute and allegedly ordered another man into a car against his will.  

During the argument, a first gunshot was allegedly fired.  

He then fled to a nearby unit complex on White Street and allegedly fired another shot when police negotiators and specialist officers surrounded the building.

The siege came to a head about 11am local time on Thursday when Randall surrendered.

Weapon: This is the shotgun the Gold Coast gunman used during today's siege

He appeared in the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday morning, charged with attempted murder, assault occasioning bodily harm, unlawful possession of a weapon and deprivation of liberty.

Randall also had more charges added to his list prior to the appearance, including going armed so as to cause fear, possessing explosives, and keeping a declared pest (a rabbit).

He did not seek bail and his case was adjourned until January 9.

The dramatic events began when officers were called to a disturbance on Anne St, Southport, around 11pm last night.

He then retreated to the unit where he remained for 12 hours. Authorities initially feared other people were inside the unit, although they now believe he was alone.

Police deployed a black Bearcat armoured police vehicle and a squad of camouflaged troopers.

The man's surrender followed tense telephone negotiations with officers. 

Inspector Bruce Kuhn told reporters earlier that police were concerned by the man's gunshots.

Train and light rail services were also suspended and traffic diverted from the area. 

In a statement, Queensland police said they were aware the incident might disrupt some people's festivities.

'While police understand that many people will soon be wishing to leave their homes and make their way to Christmas festivities, for their own safety, they are requested to stay inside until advised otherwise,' a spokesman said. 

Police have requested locals follow their directions throughout the siege.
