A Romanian princess accused of running cockfights at her Oregon ranch has pleaded guilty to running an illegal gambling business with her husband.

Irina Walker admitted to the gambling charges on Wednesday under a plea deal in which charges of animal fighting and conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act were dismissed.

Walker, whose father King Michael I was forced to abdicate by communists in 1947 and raise his family in exile, was arrested last summer.

Plea deal: Romanian princess Irina Walker, left, and her husband John Walker, a retired sheriff's deputy, right, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to running an illegal gambling business

In court yesterday the 61-year-old admitted that she had profited from the fights in which roosters had knives strapped to their legs and then fought to the death.

'I provided food and beverage, your honor, and the location.' she told district judge Michael Mosman.

Walker and her husband John, a retired sheriff's deputy, were accused of hosting at least ten cockfighting fights in a barn at their Irrigon ranch, which is about 175 miles from Portland.

Assistant U.S. attorney Stephen Peifer said the Walkers charged spectators $20 to enter, and attracted crowds of more than 100.

Peifer said that Irina Walker had initially provided food for the spectators, but her husband brought in outside catering to provide tacos when her dishes proved unpopular.

Her 68-year-old husband, who worked for the Coos County sheriff's office from 1998 to 2008, told the judge an experienced cockfighting referee had approached him about staging fights.

Exile: Irina Walker's father, former King of Romania Michael I, with his wife and some of his daughters in 1955

Regal past: Before Walker's family were forced into exile by communists, they lived in several palaces including Peles Castle, which was used as a summer residence by the Romanian royals from 1883 to 1947

At first the fights were held outside, but later Walker had a barn-like structure built, which he told the judge had been for hay.

Walker, who owned several guns, was allegedly in charge of security, and also arranged for a company to provide portable rest rooms.

The people who brought 
roosters to fight paid $1,000 to enter, and the pool ranged from $10,000
 to $18,000.

The person whose roosters won the most fights took home the
 money, except for the 10 percent takeout kept by the referees.

More
 than a dozen other people were indicted in the case. Charges against 
the woman who made the Mexican food were later dropped and two 
defendants - Ruben Saltos Godina, known as Chino; and 
Antonio Dominguez Robles, known as Tono - have not yet been caught.

Everyone else pleaded guilty, either in Oregon or Washington state.

Walker and her husband John, had accepted plea deals in the case, and are due to be sentenced on October 22. They were released to await sentencing.

Accusations: The Walkers are accused of staging cockfights at their ranch, in which spectators paid $20 to watch the barbaric sport

According to Oregon Live, as part of the deal they couple must sell part of their ranch by November 2015 and forfeit $200,000 to the government.

The government has recommended a sentence of probation for the couple, along with the forfeiture of $200,000.

Irina Walker moved to the U.S. from Switzerland in the 1980s, her daughter Angelica Kreuger, from a previous marriage, told AP last year.

Kreuger said her mother had enjoyed horse riding and gardening while she raised her two children. She later married John, who was a family friend and neighbor, and they moved to rural Irrigon.
