A hundred years ago, Giovanni Bergoglio fought in some of the fiercest battles of the First World War.

Luckily he survived, but his grandson Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, remembers how the old man would only speak of the 'painful memories' of the Great War.

And today the pontiff made a holy pilgrimage to Italy's largest war memorial to pay homage to the sacrifices made by Giovanni and millions of others.

Standing amid row upon row of tombstones dedicated to Italian soldiers who fell during the First World War, Francis warned of a 'third world war' amid new threats from the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

He said: 'Humanity needs to weep and this is the time to weep. Even today, after the second failure of another world war, perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction.

The Isonzo campaign claimed the lives of almost half the Italian soldiers to die during the First World War, and was the worst defeat in the country's military history

'War is irrational; its only plan is to bring destruction: it seeks to grow by destroying. Greed, intolerance, the lust for power. These motives underlie the decision to go to war and they are too often justified by an ideology.' 

He recalled the trauma suffered by his own grandfather, who fought during Italy's bloody campaign along the Isonzo River, close to the graveyard, before emigrating to Argentina after the war. 

Between 1915 and 1917 the Italian army launched a series of bloody attacks against the Austro-Hungarian forces stationed along the Isonzo River, losing almost half of all soldiers killed in the conflict there. 

The pontiff prayed among gravestones  in an Austro-Hungarian cemetery, before visiting Italy's largest war memorial where he held an open-air mass beside a Fascist-era monument to 100,000 fallen soldiers. 

Francis' grandfather, Giovanni Bergoglio, was one of thousands of Italians who fought in the trenches near the Isonzo River, which was part of Austria at the time, but now part of Slovenia close to the border with Italy.

Italian general, Luigi Cadorna, believed an attack across the fortified mountainous terrain could  pierce the Austro-Hungarian defenses, shattering their defensive line and allowing large territorial gains.

However, the entrenched opposition made the Italians pay dearly for even modest moves forward, and following reinforcements by the Germans in October 1917, they overran the Italian lines, inflicting the largest defeat in the country's military history.

The 12 battles of the campaign are memorialized at the Redipuglia monument which was dedicated by Italy's Fascist government in 1938 on the eve of World War II.

'I have heard many painful stories from the lips of my grandfather,' the pope has said.

Hundreds of thousands of Italian troops died trying to cross the Isonzo River between 1915 and 1917. The only meaningful success came with the capture of Gorizia (pictured left) in August 1916, but the town was quickly overrun by German and Austro-Hungarian forces the following year

The elder Bergoglio, who was drafted at age 30 as Italy entered the war, took part in the Isonzo campaign, obtaining a certificate of good conduct and 200 lire at the war's end, according to documents from the time. 

With postwar Italy's economy stalled, he emigrated to Argentina where Pope Francis - then known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio - was born.

The enduring impact of war, is evident in the visitors who still make pilgrimages to the monument, although in ever decreasing numbers, said Fogliano di Redipuglia Mayor Antonio Calligaris.

'The Repiduglia sanctuary until 20 years ago was always full of visitors, but it has been forgotten by institutional memory,' Calligaris said. 

'The papal visit is very important because it renews attention on this history.'

The monument consists of 22 granite steps leading upwards to three large crosses. It marks the burial spot of 100,000 Italian soldiers, around 60,00 of which have never been identified.

Italy's entrance into the war was long-anticipated, and Austria-Hungary heavily reinforced the Isonzo beforehand with trench systems and artillery emplacements

The Austro-Hungarian cemetery, one of several in the area, contains 14,406 dead from five nations that fought under the Austro-Hungarian empire, with only 2,406 identified.  

Many visitors to the Italian monument search the engraved names for their forbears.

'They are making a lot of saints these days. Even popes,' said Margherita Braga, 52, of Brescia, who was visiting the site with her Italian military veteran husband. 'But for me, these are the real saints.'

Just two levels up from the altar where Francis will say Mass, the name of a fallen soldier named Adolfo Bergoglio is engraved in a wall. 

Nardin, the local priest, said he is not believed to be related to the pope. But World War I historian, Col. Lorenzo Cadeddu, who has found two Bergoglios listed among the Italian casualties of World War I, said it remained a possibility.

'Bergoglio is not a common name,' Cadeddu said. 'It is likely that they are related.' 

Antonio Calligaris, the mayor of Fogliano di Redipuglia, said the Pope's visit was important to spark interest in the grave sites, which have been largely forgotten

Among the 40,000 named soldiers buried there are two with the surname Bergoglio, though it is not known if they are related to the Pope

When Italy joined the First World War in 1915, one of its first moves was to launch an attack against Austro-Hungarian forces massing along a mountain range at the head of the Adriatic Sea, in what is modern-day Solvenia.

Italian General Luigi Cadorna believed the best chance of breaking through the defensive line was to cross the north end of the Isonzo River, bypassing the mountains and coming at the Austro-Hungarian forces from the rear.

However, Italy's entrance to the war was well anticipated, and Austria-Hungary had sent large numbers of men and artillery to the region ahead of time which were dug in along mountainous ridges overlooking key attacking positions.

Modern historians largely accept that there were 12 battles of the Isonzo, though the fighting was so fierce and prolonged that one battle often merged into the next, and the total has long been disputed.

Between June 1915 and March 1916, the Italian forces tried to cross the river on five separate occasions, but on every one they were repelled, suffering heavy losses for only modest gains in territory.

During the sixth battle, from August 6–17, 1916, General Cadorna finally captured the town of Gorizia and with it a bridgehead across the Isonzo, which marked the first victories of the campaign.

A series of small, intense attacks followed as the Italians attempted to limit their casualties, before two large assaults. The second, between August 19 and September 12, 1917, involved 51 divisions and 5,200 guns, and succeeded in forcing the defending troops back.

Fearing that the line was in danger of being overrun, the Germans reinforced their allies and in October 24 their combined forces took to the offensive, forcing the Italians to retreat.

Many war-weary soldiers simply threw down their weapons and were captured, though many units continued to fight as they retreated toward the Piave River where they finally held the line.

In total, between 300,000 and 600,000 troops died during the fighting, almost half of all the Italian soldiers to be killed during the war, making it the worst defeat in the country's military history.

Hemingway's book, A Farewell To Arms, captures the conflict through the eyes of protagonist Frederic Henry, though the author himself was never involved in the fighting.

Instead, Hemingway served as an ambulance driver at Piave between June and July of 1918, after Italian forces had retreated away from Isonzo.

He spent three weeks with American Red Cross Ambulance Section Four before asking to be transferred to canteen duty along the more active from along the Piave river. It was herem, at Fossalta di Piave on July 8, 1918 that he was hit by Austrian trench mortar.

He was evacuated to a hospital in order to recover and never rejoined the war on active duty.
