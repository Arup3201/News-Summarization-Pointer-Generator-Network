Succulent lobster, whether served with cream and brandy as a lavish thermidor or simply with butter, is the ultimate luxury dish, writes ALDO ZILLI.

Yet this gourmet treat is suddenly cheap as chips - with supermarkets competing to sell it for the lowest price.

Budget chain Lidl is offering entire frozen lobsters for £5.99 each, while Iceland - which has started stocking the delicacy for the first time this week - is selling them at just £5.

Lobster is suddenly becoming cheaper - with supermarkets competing to sell it for the lowest price, writes Aldo Zilli (pictured)

The retailers are able to do this because the wholesale price of lobster has plunged by an astonishing 70 per cent in recent years, according to the Wall Street Journal.

So why the sudden drop?

The reason appears to lie with climate change. As the sea temperatures rise, lobsters are hatching earlier and they are growing faster.

Also, the over-fishing of cod in the Atlantic means that fewer of these predatory fish are gobbling up baby lobsters.

The result is that this ocean is now teeming with the tasty crustaceans. And it is these lobsters from American and Canadian waters that are now being sold at rock-bottom prices in British stores.

By contrast, lobsters from Scottish waters still have a pricier tag: one from the Orkney Islands, for example, is likely to set you back upwards of £20.

But are the cut-price varieties reduced in taste, too?

Here, I test a range of supermarket lobsters and lobster tails and give my verdict, as a chef and seafood expert.

All of the lobsters come from the freezer aisles, and while some are pre-cooked and others raw, I’ve prepared them in the same way: by sautéing in a little butter.

Luxury Canadian Whole Cooked Lobster, 350g, £5.

The lovely, coral-red shell makes for a fantastic centrepiece. But looks are deceptive. The tail meat is mushy when it should be firm. I suspect the lobster was left out of the water too long before it was killed. Lobster meat deteriorates rapidly.

The claw meat is usually my favourite because it’s even sweeter and more tender than the tail, but this contains just a few strings of flesh reminiscent of tinned salmon. Yuck.

This lobster is not tasty enough as a stand-alone dish. But at a bargain price of £5 it’s definitely not a disaster: I would happily use it for my favourite lobster spaghetti recipe.

Remove all the meat from the lobster and chop up the tail meat, but leave the claw intact. Fry a small red onion and a sliced garlic clove in olive oil. After two minutes pour over 50ml of brandy, and flambé.

Once the flames die down, add two chopped beef tomatoes, four tablespoons of chopped parsley, four chopped basil leaves and another garlic clove. Pop in the lobster meat and 150ml of dry white wine. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until the juices reduce slightly. Serve with 175g of cooked spaghetti. That’s enough for two people. Bellissimo!

Deluxe Whole Cooked Lobster, 350g, £5.99.

Fantastic. This lobster is crammed with meat and it’s deliciously sweet. The shell cracks well when I bend it with my fingers and the flesh comes away easily from the tail, which shows it’s really fresh. If the lobster’s out of the water for too long before it’s killed, the flesh shrinks away.

The claws are full of delicious, tender flesh. It’s so good, you don’t need to do a thing to it.

It reminds me of a lovely lobster supper I recently enjoyed in Italy under the stars. I just poured myself a glass of Prosecco and got stuck in.

I’m impressed.

WAITROSE

Big & Juicy Whole Cooked Canadian lobster, 425g, £9.99.

This is the biggest lobster by far, so I was expecting a feast. But what a letdown. The claws are virtually empty — I have to dig around to get even a sliver of meat.

And the meat in the tail is unpleasantly chewy. It’s like gnawing on a skipping rope. Sadly the best thing to do with this lobster is use it for stock. Put the head and shell into a pan, cover with water, add a tablespoonful of brandy, splash of tomato puree and handful of dried herbs then cook very gently for two hours.

But what a waste when for the same money you can buy two juicy lobster tails (see Aldi below).

TESCO

Cuisine & Ocean Whole Blanched Lobster, 350g, £8.

THIS is so mushy, it’s like chewing a wodge of cotton wool — and just as flavourless. The packaging says the lobster has been blanched for 1-2 minutes ‘just long enough for the meat to separate from the shell — the secret of perfect texture and tasty meat’. Well something’s gone wrong. I have to prise the meat out.

It’s not tasty and the texture is terrible. It’s also watery — a sign the lobster was left out of salt water for too long before cooking because the fishermen simply didn’t take enough care.

Twist the claws of a cooked lobster to remove them from the body. Insert a sharp knife into the back of the head and slice down to the tail to cut in half.

Remove and dispose of the pale sac, gills in head area and dark intestinal thread that runs the length of the body.

Remove any green meat - this is ‘tomalley’, the lobster’s digestive system and perfectly edible.

Remove any red meat, too - these are immature eggs and are a delicacy, a sort of lobster caviar.

Put both in a bowl. Combine an egg yolk with a dash of double cream, a teaspoon of brandy and teaspoon of English mustard. Whisk until you have a foamy consistency.

Add the meat and season. Then pour the foam over the pre-cooked lobster, shell side down. Pop under a hot grill until golden brown — about three minutes. Enjoy!

SAINSBURY’S

Taste the Difference Raw Whole Canadian Lobster, 380g, £10.

This lobster may have been freighted in frozen from Canada but it looks so fresh it could have come straight from Billingsgate Fish Market in London.

This is exactly how good lobster should be — packed with meaty flavour. Being raw, it’s easier to prepare than a cooked lobster, which can end up overcooked unless you’re happy to serve it totally cold.

I’d cut this in half and fry in butter with a couple of crushed garlic cloves for around five minutes. It’s ready the second the meat starts to shy away from the shell.

ALDI

Specially Selected Wild Lobster Tails with Garlic Butter (available from December 21), £9.99 for a 260g pack of two.

These are really yummy — sweet and tasty and exactly what you expect from really good lobster tails. The garlic butter is excellent, and they pan-fry in under five minutes.

With double the number of tails, you get a serious amount of top-quality meat for your money — at least enough for two hungry people.

A pot of mayo, a platter of chips and a bottle of chilled dry white, and you have the perfect ‘date night’ feast. On the downside, you lose the wow factor of a whole lobster.

ICELAND

Luxury Uncooked Canadian Lobster Tails, £7 for a 200g pack of two.

Oh dear. There are barely a couple of mouthfuls in each tail, and the meat is so rubbery I could be chewing on my bathtime rubber duck. The instructions say to fry in the butter supplied. It’s a mistake. The butter has a horrid salty aftertaste and I need a pitcher of water to wash it away. You’d be better using your own butter. For extra flavour, add a chopped garlic clove.
