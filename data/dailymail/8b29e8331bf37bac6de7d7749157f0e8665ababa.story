This is the hilarious moment three snapping turtles got stuck on top of each other when one of them stopped abruptly and the two behind failed to notice.

The 
photographs of the reptilian pile-up were taken at Haus des Meeres Aqua 
Terra Zoo in Vienna, Austria by 45-year-old Hans Jorg Leth.

The retail manager, who lives in the city of Graz, said he took the comical photograph after spending an afternoon at the zoo earlier this month.

Pile-up: The hilarious accident took place when the first snapping turtle stopped abruptly. The two following closely behind him failed to notice he had come to a halt and were moving too quickly to stop in time, leaving the trio piled on top off one another

After the initial three-turtle pile up, several more lined up behind. Within just a few minutes seven turtles were left waiting patiently in line for the first turtle to get himself moving again.

'There were a lot of visitors at the zoo on the day I took that picture,' Mr Leth said.

'It seems that the first snapping turtle stopped to have a view of the crazy looking visitors who were staring at him... There were two other turtles walking behind him and were going too fast to stop in time,' he added.

'The three turtles all landed on top of each other - it was very funny,' he went on to say.

Common snapping turtles, with their powerful beak-like jaws and highly mobile head and neck, are known for their aggressive personality when out of the water.

Their natural habitat extends from southeastern Canada to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida.

In some areas they are hunted very heavily for their meat, as they are a popular ingredient in turtle soup.

Some common snapping turtles have lived for up to 47 years in captivity, but the lifespan of those in the wild is estimated to be around 30 years.

Haus des Meeres Aqua Terra Zoo opened in 1957 and is one of Austria's best known aquariums - housing over 10,000 aquatic beings in an area of around 43,000 square feet.

It is run for no profit by the privately owned Aqua Terra Zoo organisation, and attracts an estimated 430,000 visitors every year.
