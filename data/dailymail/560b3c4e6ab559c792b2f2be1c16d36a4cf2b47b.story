Robin van Persie is the most popular player in the Premier League after it was revealed that his name more than anyone else's was emblazoned on the back of supporters' shirts.

Findings published in the Premier League Season Review 2013/14 revealed the Manchester United striker was ahead of Liverpool pair Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez in having the most fans use his name last season. 

It is the second year on the trot that Van Persie has topped the pile.

Of course, Suarez has since moved away from Anfield - sealing a £75million deal with Barcelona - but Liverpool fans across the world previously flocked to have the Uruguayan on their replica kit.

On signing for Arsenal this time last year, Mesut Ozil's reputation was plainly evident with hundreds of people pictured with the strip accompanied with the Germany star's name ahead of his first game. 

Unsurprisingly, Wayne Rooney is consistently in the top 10 and that was no different in the last campaign. The continued sale of 'Rooney 10' shirts goes some way to explaining why United have always been so desperate to keep the striker and only heightens the perception that the club's global brand is as important as results. 

Louis van Gaal will be hoping new signing Ander Herrera makes enough of a mark to nestle in on this list next year, but performances don't always dictate who finishes where on this particular list.

A case in point is Shinji Kagawa, whose name has shifted loads of United shirts since his move from Dortmund - largely because of the Japan midfielder's vast appeal in Asia.
