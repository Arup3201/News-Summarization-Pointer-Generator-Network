A woman teacher was struck off for life today for sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil - and her headteacher was also suspended for covering up the affair.

Teacher Emma Ager, 34, picked the teenager up after classes at the 950-pupil Rhymney Comprehensive School in Tredegar, South Wales, to drive him away to have regular sex in her car.

Headteacher Meredydd James, 62, then covered up the rumoured relationship after she agreed to resign - and gave her a glowing reference.

A disciplinary hearing was told the English teacher told the boy: 'I bet you won’t be able to keep up with me during sex.'

Emma Ager, 34, a teacher who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School, in Tredegar, South Wales, has been struck off for life after having sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car

The boy - referred to as Pupil A in the hearing - was studying his GSCEs when Miss Ager began driving him off for secret sex in a factory car park.

The former pupil, who is now 22, told the hearing: 'She said as long as I kept quiet everything would be OK.

'We would meet up daily or every other day.

'We would meet up an hour or two after school and drive and have sex in her car. We would drive to a secluded spot near a factory.

'We only ever had sex in her car.

'She said if people did find out I would be a legend. It continued for two months.

'One of my friends rang her up to ask for a threesome but she said she wouldn’t do it.

'It was common knowledge among pupils in the school but I don’t know if the teachers knew. I left a short time after it ended.'

The South Wales school attended by the pupil. Now 22, he said the teacher kept a picture of his penis on her mobile phone

The hearing was told Miss Ager had taught for two years when she began having sex with the pupil.

The boy claimed he was told Miss Ager had a picture of his penis on her mobile phone.

The hearing was told she bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in 2008.

Pupil A said: 'On a school trip to London sombody saw she had a photo of my penis on her mobile phone but she said it was somebody else’s.

'She brought me back a teddy and some sweets.'

Pupil A ended the two-month sexual relationship in March 2008 to be get back with his ex-girlfriend.

The General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing in Cardiff heard Pupil A’s mother found out her son was getting inappropriate phone calls and texts from Miss Ager.

She told the school about the inappropriate calls - but she did not know it was a sexual relationship.

GTCW presenting solicitor Martin Jones said Miss Ager was pulled into a meeting with her headteacher about inappropriate contact with Pupil A.

Mr Jones said: 'As a result of that she offered her resignation and it was accepted.

'She left the school a short while later.'

Headteacher Meredydd James failed to follow child protection policy by reporting the sex allegations and inappropriate calls to social services.

Instead he accepted Miss Ager’s immediate resignation - and gave the English teacher a glowing reference.

He told a nearby school: 'Miss Ager expected high standards of behaviour and had a good working relationship with pupils.

'She would be a great asset to the school.'

But Mr James had harboured serious concerns about her conduct even before the sex allegations.

He told Miss Ager in a meeting: 'If I dig too deep I’m worried what I will find.'

Their affair was revealed in 2012 when school staff went on a safeguarding course - and told council officials about his handling of the rumoured affair.

Mr Jones said Mr James had heard enough serious allegations to trigger a referral to social services.

Mr Jones said: 'He chose not to make one.

'He had information which at the very least pointed to suspicion of Miss Ager engaging in a sexual relationship with pupils.

'He allowed the teacher to leave the school without proper investigation and then opted to provide a positive reference to another school.

'He placed other pupils at other schools in potential risk of harm - pupils who may have been more vulnerable.'

The GTCW panel ruled Miss Ager was proved to have committed unacceptable professional conduct by having an 'inappropriate and/or sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil'.

She did not attend the disciplinary hearing and failed to answer the charges.

Mr James, now retired, was proved to have failed to follow proper child protection procedures and take appropriate action.

Miss Ager was prohibited from the teaching register indefinitely in any state school in Britain.

Panel chairman Steve Powell said: 'This is necessary to protect pupils and maintain public confidence in the teaching profession.

'Miss Ager has shown no insight into her failings.'

Mr James was suspended from the register for three months and ordered to undergo a safeguarding course before re-entering the profession.

Mr Powell said: 'These incidents cannot be described as an isolated lapse. But they did occur during 18 months of a 40-year career. His conduct could have seriously affected pupils.'
