Ukraine had gas supplies from Russia turned off today after it missed a deadline to pay nearly £1.2billion in overdue bills.

A
 spokesman for Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled energy giant, said 
that from now on the company would demand that Kiev pay in advance for 
gas.

While the decision does
 not immediately affect gas flow to the rest of Europe, analysts warned 
it could disrupt the whole region's long-term energy supply.

Any shortage could see heating bills rocket.

Sergei Kupriyanov, 
Gazprom's spokesman, said: 'Gazprom supplies to Ukraine only the amount 
that has been paid for, and the amount that has been paid for is zero.'

The
 gas dispute comes after Russia strongly condemned Ukraine's handling of
 a separatist insurgency in its east, which broke out in the wake of the
 overthrow of the country's pro-Russian president in February.

The
 pipeline to Ukraine also carries gas meant for the rest of Europe, but 
Mr Kupriyanov said that the supply to Europe will continue as planned. 
Ukraine is obliged to make sure gas reaches European customers, he said.

However,
 Gazprom has notified the European Commission of 'a possible disruption 
in the gas transit' in case Ukraine decides to siphon off the gas, the 
company said.

Russia 
provides about a quarter of the gas used by Europe, making it the 
continent's biggest single supplier. Much of that is stored in Ukraine 
before it is piped west.

Analyst
 Tim Ash at Standard Bank told the Associated Press that Ukraine could 
in theory simply take whatever gas it wants, since it all travels 
through the same pipelines.

That
 would lead to a shortage of deliveries to Europe, slowing the build up 
of gas stored for winter, when demand rockets. 'So the message is that 
this is unlikely to bring a short-term hit to gas supply in Europe, but 
it will build up problems for the winter unless a deal is reached 
quickly,' said Mr Ash.

European Union spokesman
 Sabine Berger said Brussels had no official information as to changes 
in gas supply to the EU, and that as far as she knew, the flows remained
 'normal.'

Ukraine's gas 
crisis comes in the middle of a wider standoff with Russia following a 
February coup which deposed democratically elected, East-leaning 
president Victor Yanukovych.

The
 revolution and installation of a pro-West interim government spurred 
Russia to annex the Black Sea province of Crimea, the location of a 
major Russian naval base, and sparked a separatist insurgency in 
Ukraine's east.

Ukraine has 
accused Russia of supporting the insurgency, am allegation the Kremlin 
denies and counters with its own claims that the new government in Kiev 
includes 'fascists' bent on the persecution of Russian-speaking 
Ukrainians.

Russia has previously used its dominance of the gas market to exert influence on Ukraine's politics.

In
 December, Gazprom offered Mr Yanukovych a 
discounted price of $268.50 per thousand cubic meters after he backed 
out of an economic and political agreement with the EU.

That
 price was cancelled April 1 and raised to $485 per thousand cubic 
meters. Russia has now offered $385, the price that Ukraine was paying 
until December, but Kiev is insisting on a lower price.

Gazprom
 had up to now tolerated Ukraine's late payments but now says Kiev owes a
 total of £2.5billion for gas from last year and this year.

It
 wanted a payment of $1.95 billion for past-due bills by 9am this 
morning, Kiev time. As the deadline passed Gazprom issued a statement 
that it would start demanding payment in advance for gas.

The
 company says it will now sue Ukraine's state energy company, Naftogaz, in
 an international court over the full unpaid bill. Naftogaz said it has 
also filed a suit against Gazprom, seeking a 'fair and market-based 
price' for gas, as well as a repayment of $6billion for claimed overpayments for gas from 2010.

Ukrainian
 Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk angrily rejected the Russian position,
 saying that 'we are not going to give in to Russian pressure... we are 
not going to subsidize Gazprom.' He said Ukraine would press in the 
arbitration court for prices set 'honestly, openly and on market 
principles.'

In Moscow, 
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told a meeting with the 
Gazprom chief and other officials that the Ukrainian position was 
'absurd.'

The European Commission said 
in a statement that Ukraine was ready to accept a compromise in talks in
 Kiev of paying $589million now and more later, but Russia didn't accept
 the offer.

Ms Berger said 
aid EU energy commissioner Guenther Oettinger remains committed to 
helping broker a deal between Kiev and Moscow.

'We
 stand ready to act as a mediator in these talks to facilitate a 
compromise, but for the moment, there are no new dates set,' she said.

One
 reason for EU involvement is the current state of Ukrainian gas 
reserves. Ms Berger said they now stand at around 13.5billion cubic 
meters. For the EU to be assured to enough gas for the coming winter, reserves should be at 18-20billion cubic meters at the end of the
 summer, she said.
