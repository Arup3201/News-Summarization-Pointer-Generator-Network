In the locker room, it looks to be a match made in heaven.

From a cosy soak together at a spa to a spot of grooming, it looks like Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov are so comfortable in each other’s company.

But the Wimbledon champion will have to put his burgeoning ‘bromance’ with his Bulgarian rival to one side today, as the pair do battle for a place in the semi-finals at the All  England Club.

From a cosy soak together at a spa to a spot of grooming, it looks like Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov are so comfortable in each other's company. But today, they face each other on court

Dimitrov, the 11th seed, is dating former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, who crashed out of the tournament yesterday

The larky friendship between the tennis stars was revealed in January when Dimitrov posted a picture on Twitter showing the pair in just their swimming trunks as they took a post-match bath in Melbourne.

Then, during a tournament break a few months ago, Murray tried his hand at hairdressing at  a Rome salon.  Dimitrov mischievously described Murray’s coiffure skills as ‘beautiful’.

Warming to the theme, Murray yesterday revealed the pair had ‘spent more time together recently’ after Dimitrov hired a new coach who is a mutual friend.

The third-seeded Scot added: ‘We get on well, he’s a nice guy and has good people around him.’

But he added that their friendly rivalry off the court was ‘about to get serious’.

Another battle is likely to be played out in the stands between their  respective girlfriends.

Dimitrov, the 11th seed, is dating former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, who crashed out of the tournament yesterday.

The 23-year-old began going out with the world’s richest sportswoman in 2012 after breaking up with world number one Serena Williams, prompting a bitter catfight.

Williams gave an interview to a US 
magazine in which she described Sharapova as ‘boring’ and accused 
Dimitrov of having a ‘black heart’.

The All England Club has rejected calls from stars including Novak Djokovic for Wimbledon to introduce play on the middle Sunday of the tournament.

Djokovic spoke out after several players – including the No5 seed, Stan Wawrinka – had their schedule disrupted by rain on Saturday, meaning they only played two matches in the first week. 

Wimbledon is the only one of the four grand slam tournaments that has a rest day and organisers insisted it would remain that way – so that the grass courts can have a much-needed rest. 

The tournament referee Andrew Jarrett said: ‘The surface itself needs to recover. On Saturday night and Sunday morning, the courts get absolutely soaked, which they need in order to perform to their maximum in the second week. 

‘We treat all players as fairly as we can, but it’s a busy schedule and if we get rain-affected, obviously it can’t be perfect.’

Sharapova responded by pointing out that Williams was believed to be dating her married coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

Dimitrov’s turbulent love life is a world away from Murray’s relationship with long-term girlfriend Kim Sears.

Miss Sears met Murray at the US Open when she was 17 and, apart from one brief split, they have been together for almost nine years.

Private school-educated Miss Sears, the daughter of tennis coach Nigel Sears, grew up in an £800,000 detached home in Barcombe, East Sussex.

The 26-year-old now lives with Murray in a £5million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, where she does the laundry and shops for fruit and vegetables at the local Tesco.

The English literature graduate is now an artist specialising in painting portraits of dogs.

She and Murray are often seen by locals walking their terriers together.

On her blog she says that her favourite things, apart from family and friends, are ‘tea, lots of chocolate biscuits, Classic FM and copious amounts of Jilly Cooper. All at once.’

Miss Sharapova has had her hands full taming the roguish Dimitrov – although he admits he is still in awe of the woman he watched win Wimbledon in 2004 when he was just 13.

‘In a way, like in many tennis fans’ shoes, she is Sharapova for me, but she is Maria when we get home,’ he said in a recent interview. 

Judy Murray knows a thing or two about raising a tennis star – and she says parents are letting their children down when it comes to sport.

The 54-year-old said too many parents choose to let their children watch DVDs or pack them off to activity classes. 

The mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray added: ‘I loved all sports when I was young, I wanted my kids to enjoy sport so I was always playing actively with them, whatever they wanted to play. But it’s not every parent that does that with their kids.

‘It’s much easier to hand them a DVD or a CD or something and sit and watch that. 

‘I think parents generally have less time, maybe more money and less time, so they are paying people to look after their kids.’ 

Mrs Murray spoke at the launch of Miss-Hits, a programme she has started with the Lawn Tennis Association to get more young girls playing the sport.

She said:  ‘If you can get them at a young age,  enjoying activity and movement, before it becomes a chore as a teenager, then  they will hopefully enjoy being active for all of their lives.’
