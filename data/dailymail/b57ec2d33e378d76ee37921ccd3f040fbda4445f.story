Elisabetta
 and Francesca Grillo lived a life of luxury that can be seen 'portrayed
 in glossy magazines' using Charles Saatchui's credit cards, the jury 
was told during the trial.

The
 Italian sisters lavished thousands of pounds of the millionaire's money a shop til you drop New York 
trip, a stay in the Ritz Hotel in Paris and dozens of items of designer 
clothing.

When asked about where they got their expensive clothes, the sisters would say they had bought bargains online.

But really the pair had secretly embarked on a four-year 'greedy and fraudulent free-for-all' using Charles Saatchi's credit cards, Isleworth Crown Court was told.

Mr
 Saatchi and Miss Lawson – who has her own 
fortune of £20million – were so awash with cash it was only a chance 
occurrence that uncovered the Grillo sisters' lavish spending.

It
 happened when the sisters ordered a taxi with a firm kept on account by
 Mr Saatchi’s art company Conarco, and left it waiting for an age 
outside the family home.

Irritated
 by its beeping, 70-year-old Mr Saatchi made enquiries. He was shocked 
to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants 
to a polo match in Berkshire.

Mr
 Saatchi’s finance director at Conarco, Rahul Gajjar, told the court 
that although he had noted Francesca Grillo’s credit card spending 
creeping up – with her monthly limit leaping from £25,000 to £100,000 – 
he had not yet thought to raise the matter.

Only
 when the taxi incident happened did he investigate properly and tell Mr 
Saatchi that each month Francesca was spending on average £48,000 and 
Elisabetta £28,000.

Francesca
 had spent more than £4,700 on flights to New York, where she spent 
£1,850 at high-end fashion store Miu Miu and more than £2,000 on hotels.

She
 paid £613 at the Soho House Hotel in New York on June 3, and two days 
later had shelled out £1,424 at the Gansevoort Hotel. In addition, she 
also withdrew large amounts of cash while she stayed in the city.

She also used the card to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz hotel in Paris on the same day that she bought a Chloe dress for £723.

On June 12 last year she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London, and £2,650 at designer store Prada.

The relationship between the Grillo sisters and the couple collapsed altogether last year after Saatchi's finance director Rahul Gajjar, pictured arriving at court, discovered how much the Grillos had been spending on their credit cards

Elisabetta visited more high 
street shops and fewer high fashion boutiques than Francesca – with Zara
 and John Lewis among them – but still managed to rack up almost £5,000 
personal expenditure in the month, including cash withdrawals on the company 
card.

Among other luxury 
brands the women blew thousands at Dolce and Gabbana, Chanel, Louis 
Vuitton, Vivienne Westwood and the Four Seasons hotel group.

Over the course of a four-year period she splurged £58,744 in just 50 transactions at an array of designer shops and spas.

But
 other personal assistants not charged with any offence also spent money
 – at Annabel’s nightclub, the Babington House country venue and on 
Christian Louboutin shoes.

Anthony
 Metzer, QC, defending Lisa, said of the Grillos: ‘They believed they 
were authorised to incur this personal expenditure.’

Mr
 Metzer told the court that the Italian sisters worked long hours for 
‘modest’ salaries – £25,000 for Lisa and £28,000 for her sister – and 
suggested it was common practice for assistants to be allowed to spend 
on themselves.

They would also be able to live rent-free at a flat owned by Miss Lawson in Battersea, central London, the court heard.

The
 jury was told Francesca's average monthly spend was £48,000 while 
Elisabetta's was £28,000 - compared with the other personal assistants 
who racked up bills of £8,000.

Mr Saatchi's finance director Mr Gajjar confronted the sisters about their spending in the kitchen of the Saatchi family home in west London on July 3 last year.

The pair admitted lavishing money on themselves but initially offered to make amends and pay it back before the police were called in.
