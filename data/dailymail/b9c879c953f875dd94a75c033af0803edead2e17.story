Roy Hodgson is not a great lover of statistics. ‘I prefer the naked eye,’ he admitted ahead of England’s 2-1 defeat against Italy.

It will not matter a jot to England’s head coach that Andrea Pirlo, the outstanding player on the field, had 117 touches of the ball and completed 100 passes in the Arena Amazonia.

His team-mate Daniele de Rossi, stationed in his familiar central midfield role, had 114 touches. He was the second best player on the night.

The best teams in the world, Italy among
 them, are trying to tell England something and yet this country 
continues to ignore it at almost every level of the game. It is 
heartbreaking.

Instead we are told that the national team’s 
philosophy is to play a hybrid of traditional English guts with some 
glamour touches for a few key players. It isn’t working.

Pick the bones out of England’s 2-1 defeat in the Arena Amazonia and this was yet another lesson in possession.

Glen
 Johnson, at right back, had more touches (82) than any other England 
player. Steven Gerrard, with 78 on the night, was miles off the standard
 set by the world’s best players in midfield.

People were 
crowing about England’s 93 per cent passing success rate in Manaus; what
 they didn’t mention was that Gerrard (67) was the highest in the 
England team. Pirlo (108 attempted passes) and De Rossi (105) were 
operating at another level.

Until this country is dragged kicking and
 screaming into the modern era and the possession game, England will 
never stand a chance of winning a major football tournament. It just isn’t possible.

When Germany beat England on November 11 last year, Toni Kroos had 125 touches of the ball in our own backyard.

In Bayern Munich’s Champions League tie at the Emirates, Kroos had 175 touches. It was a masterful performance.

Watch
 Germany on Monday night in their opening group game and two or three 
players in midfield areas will have more than 100 touches each. England 
rarely get anywhere near it.

Spain mastered it at Euro 2008, the World Cup two years later and again at Euro 2012.

When
 they were beaten 5-1 by Holland in their opening group game in Brazil, 
many celebrated the demise of Vicente del Bosque’s team.

In the past 
eight years Spain have won more trophies than England have in their 
entire history and there is still much to learn from them.

Those who 
are stuck in the dark ages will argue that it’s all down to what you do 
with the ball when the players are in possession.

True, but no-one has ever lost a football match when the ball is in circulation.

Until England learn to keep control of a game, they will never compete at the very highest level.
