Norwich City have suspended two supporters from attending matches at Carrow Road while the club and police investigate claims of racial abuse during their Sky Bet Championship clash against Wolves last Sunday.

The Norfolk club have also promised to hand out lifetime bans to any supporters found guilty of racist behaviour.

Norwich received numerous complaints from supporters following an incident in the visiting end at Molineux as the Canaries lost 1-0 in their first competitive match since relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

'Self-policing by supporters is a crucial factor in the ongoing battle to eradicate all forms of discrimination from the stands and it is greatly encouraging that Norwich fans reported this behaviour so swiftly.

'We also welcome the actions of the Wolves safety team that promptly identified the perpetrators, and commend both clubs for the strong stances they have taken following the incident.

'We have since offered Wolves and Norwich our assistance and support on the matter, and now await the outcome of any Police investigation with the evidence provided.

'Empowering supporters to challenge discrimination is vital, and any fan who sees, hears or is the victim of this type of abuse can report it immediately via the free Kick It Out app which is available for download on iPhone and Android devices.'
