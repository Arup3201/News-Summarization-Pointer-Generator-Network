Rafael has revealed he is set to return to training with Manchester United on Friday after undergoing surgery on a fractured cheekbone.

The right-back was withdrawn at half-time, along with Luke Shaw, during United's 2-0 win over Yeovil Town in Sunday's FA Cup third-round clash, with Louis van Gaal confirming the injury following the game.

Rafael underwent surgery earlier on Tuesday night and is now expecting to return to training with United on Friday, but will be required to wear a protective mask.

The Brazilian took to Instagram to inform followers of his successful operation and how he would return to training with a mask.

Rafael said: 'Operation was perfect back training normal with mask on Friday very happy. Thanks god for everything.' 

Rafael suffered a fractured cheekbone in a first-half aerial duel at Yeovil and had to be taken off at half time, while his defensive partner Paddy McNair needed staples in his head after a sickening clash with Kieffer Moore.

Van Gaal also revealed that another defender, Luke Shaw, had suffered a fresh ankle problem after he too was withdrawn at the break after playing through the pain barrier.
