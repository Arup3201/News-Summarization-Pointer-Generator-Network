These are the amazing scenes as a giraffe was born in front of dozens of people at a South African game reserve. 

The 1.8 metre tall baby took about two hours to be born and spent approximately 15 minutes lying on the ground being cleaned by its mother before it was eventually able to stand and begin feeding. 

However, despite being witnessed by more than a dozen people, keepers at the Kragga Kamma Game Park in Port Eilzabeth still do not know the sex of the new calf. 

These are the amazing scenes when a giraffe was born at a South African game reserve 

The female giraffe was in labour for approximately two hours before the 1.8 metre calf dropped out

Park co-owner Ayesha Cantor told The Herald: 'We don’t know the sex of the calf yet and no, it has not been named. However, it was born in full view of dozens of visitors, who were mostly locals, which is great because these are the folk that support this park very well.

'They certainly did not have to go all the way to the Serengeti to see this. What was also great was that I got to see the entire birthing process for the first time,” she said, adding that the gestation period for a giraffe was about 16 months. 

'What was interesting was that it came out with a gel-like covering on its hooves. During the birth, the dominant male went over to the mother periodically to check how she was doing.'

It is believed there are some 80,000 giraffes in the wild, down from 140,000 in 1999.  

During the birth, the dominant male approached the female to offer some prenatal support 

The newborn calf spent 15 minutes lying on the ground after its birth and was cleaned by its mother

The calf spent around 15 minutes on the ground before eventually struggling to his feet

With a couple of long stretches the giraffe calf raised itself to its full 1.8 metre height before feeding

Only minutes after birth, the giraffe suckled hungrily from its mother in the safety of the game reserve

Several groups of tourists were able to witness the amazing scenes as the giraffe calf was born

Park co-owner Ayesha Cantor said it was too early to tell what sex the giraffe calf was
