Defeat: SNP leader Alex Salmond has seen his majority in the Scottish Parliament cut to just two

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has suffered a crushing by-election defeat that leaves the SNP with a wafer-thin majority in the Scottish Parliament.

Labour won the contest in Dunfermline, Fife, by 2,873 votes after a fierce battle that saw an unexpectedly high turnout of 42.75 per cent.

Mr Salmond was left personally humiliated after he made a last-minute appearance on doorsteps yesterday evening in a bid to pick up votes.

But Labour won 42.5 per cent of the vote, with the Scottish National Party on 30.6 per cent - a swing to Labour of 6.9 per cent.

Winning candidate Cara Hilton was heckled and booed by SNP activists as she made her victory speech. She claimed the result sends a clear message to Mr Salmond ahead of next year’s referendum on Scottish independence.

The LibDems came third with 11.8 per cent, followed by the Tories on 8.3 per cent, UKIP on 3.8 per cent and the Greens on 2.5 per cent.

Dunfermline was a former LibDem stronghold, but fell to Mr Salmond’s SNP in his 2011 Scottish Parliament election landslide.

Labour’s victory is a significant boost for the party’s Scottish leader, Johann Lamont, and throws the next Holyrood elections in 2016 wide open.

It is the first time a seat has changed hands in a Scottish Parliament by-election for 13 years.

It comes just months after the SNP’s majority in a by-election in Aberdeen Donside was slashed and only weeks after Labour trounced their main opponents north of the Border in a council by-election in Glasgow’s Govan ward.

The result also casts further doubt on Mr Salmond’s chances of winning next year’s independence referendum, with polls suggesting fewer than 30 per cent of Scots want to leave the United Kingdom.

The by-election was held following the resignation of disgraced wife-beater Bill Walker, who had been kicked out of the SNP. Earlier this year he was found guilty of 23 counts of domestic abuse against three former wives and a stepdaughter.

Labour’s victory leaves Mr Salmond with a slender parliamentary majority of just two. He now has 65 MSPs - down from 69 in 2011 - with the combined opposition forces on 63.

Miss Hilton said: 'The people of Dunfermline have rejected Scotland being put on pause for another year.

'The government of Scotland has been suspended so that a referendum campaign can be won.

'We need a Scottish Government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after [independence].

'Dunfermline has sent a message to Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession.

'Use the powers you have now to make a difference, not just argue for more in the future.'

Count: The contest in Dunfermline was dominated by a local row over Labour-run Fife Council¿s plan to close primary schools

Surprise: Labour's victory throws the next Holyrood elections in 2016 wide open

SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: 'The SNP fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in Shirley-Anne Somerville, and we made the issues of the by-election the issues that matter to the people - saving local schools, and protecting vital public services.

'In the event, the seat was just too marginal, and we wish Cara Hilton well in representing the people of Dunfermline and the West Fife villages.

'However, the swing of just 6.9 per cent to Labour is extremely small. It is even less than Labour achieved in the Donside by-election just a few months ago, and is one of the lowest by-election swings in the history of the Scottish Parliament - which indicates the underlying strength of the SNP after six-and-a-half years in government.'

The contest in Dunfermline was dominated by a local row over Labour-run Fife Council’s plan to close primary schools.

That should have helped the SNP and the party’s candidate - former MSP Miss Somerville - who was widely considered a much more accomplished performer than Miss Hilton.

Labour also faced ridicule following the publication of a leaflet that listed a series of SNP policies - including the abolition of bridge tolls and a council tax freeze - and presented them as the party’s own ideas.

Countdown: Voters in Scotland will go to the polls in the Scottish independence referendum in September next year

But Mr Salmond suffered his own setback this week after he turned up at a closure-threatened school in a last-ditch attempt to boost support for the SNP.

Pitcorthie Primary School had actually been forced to shut its doors hours earlier because the creaking boiler system failed to work.

Seven candidates were contesting the seat, with university lecturer Susan Leslie standing for the LibDems. Her party continues to be punished by Scottish voters for joining the Tories in coalition at Westminster.

The Tories chose 22-year-old James Reekie, pro-independence campaigner Zara Kitson contested the by-election for the Greens, and UKIP’s regional organiser in Scotland, Peter Adams, also stood.

There was one independent candidate on the ballot paper - John Black - who has previously been involved with the Scottish Jacobite Party.
