More than half of Labour's MP candidates in winnable seats for the general election have already worked in politics, new research has found.

The party has stuffed its hit list of potential new MPs with former special advisers, party workers and lobbyists - compared to just 17 per cent of Conservative candidates with political backgrounds, and 46 per cent of Liberal Democrats.

It will fuel concerns about the development of a 'political class' of people who have never worked in real world jobs, which the public repeatedly say in polls turns them off voting.

Peter Hain, the former Cabinet 
minister who is carrying out a review into how Labour can win back 
voters, said the fact that people think politics is 'reproducing itself'
 is a growing source of discontent.

Mr
 Hain, Labour MP for Neath who is standing down next year, added: 'It is
 not the only factor but it means political parties are getting more 
distant from their electorate than they used to be.

'I
 think disconnection is so bad now that the old politics is in a 
terminal state. I think you can explain a lot of Ukip's rise and the 
anti-politics mood around that disconnection.'

The
 research - compiled by The Guardian - emerged as Ed Miliband, the 
Labour leader, and Nick Clegg are currently the least popular they have 
ever been, according to a Guardian/ICM poll.

'Just
 22 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is doing a good job while 61 
per cent thinking he is doing a bad job, his lowest rating since 2010.

'In
 a study of 177 candidates standing in marginal seats, those which could
 change hands with just a 5 per cent swing in votes , or those where the
 sitting MP is retiring, over half of the 90 Labour candidates have 
already worked in politics.

'Fifteen are ex-MPs standing again having been ousted by the electorate, some of their expenses such as Joan Ryan and Andrew Dismore. Others are current or former staff of Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and ex-ministers.

'Tulip Siddiq, 31, who is standing in Hampstead and Kilburn, where Glenda Jackson is standing down, has been a policy adviser to Tessa Jowell and worked on Ed Miliband's leadership campaign.

'Candidates standing for Labour next year also include the so-called 'Red Princes' whose fathers were in politics – Stephen Kinnock, son of former leader Neil, Will Straw, son of former foreign secretary Jack Straw, who works for a think tank.

It is widely speculated that Tony Blair's son Euan, 30, could stand in Bootle, Merseyside where 80-year-old MP Joe Benton is standing down.

Former Labour minister Peter Hain said the fact that people think politics is 'reproducing itself' is a growing source of discontent

Only 17 per cent of Conservative candidates in their 52 winnable seats have political backgrounds, as many come from business, the law and the military.

But they are overwhelming male (68 per cent) while Labour's are 56 per cent women. The Lib Dem candidates are 43 per cent women.

Fifteen out of 35 Liberal Democrats selected in the most winnable seats have links to Westminster or Brussels politics.

Dr Peter Allen, of Bath University, said over the last 20 or 30 years Labour 'increasingly seem to be picking people who have been political workers.'

Dr Allen said: In 'You can't underestimate the symbolic importance of who is in power because people will take their cues about what politics is about and like from what they see. If you see a lot of people who have nothing to do with your day-to-day life, you're going to begin to think politics isn't necessarily something for people like you.'

Few candidates from any party come from non-professional jobs, with some exceptions being Lee Sherriff, a former retail worker in Carlisle for Labour, and Scott Mann, a postman standing for the Conservatives in North Cornwall.

Sharon Hodgson, the shadow equalities minister said Labour has a Future Candidates programme which helps give people from non-political backgrounds the skills to run for selection.

But she added there is 'always more we can do'.

'Lots of people who are drawn to the Labour party are incredibly passionate about the causes that we fight for, and it's therefore no surprise that many of them want to work for the party or in other campaigning roles before running for office. That includes lots of people like myself from ordinary, working-class backgrounds', she said.
