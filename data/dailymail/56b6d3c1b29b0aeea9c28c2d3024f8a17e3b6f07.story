Tragedy: Amy Ratnett had beaten self-harm and was helping others with their problems but died after binge drinking with a friend

A woman who won a battle with self-harming died after she went out binge drinking with a friend while on medication because 'she just wanted to be normal', an inquest heard today.

Before her death Amy Ratnett told a magazine she had self-poisoned for years, taking mini-overdoses, but was now helping others with mental health problems.

But she died two months later following a night out drinking with a friend, an inquest heard.

A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure after hearing how the four cocktails and half a bottle of vodka she drank that night fatally combined with her medication.

The 29-year-old had travelled on the train from her home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to stay over with friend Fay Trezise in Reading, Berkshire, on January 17, the inquest heard.

Miss Trezise told the inquest in a statement that they had gone out for dinner and had four cocktails before returning to her flat and drinking vodka together.

She then told how her friend became 'paralytic' and she put her to bed, only to find her slumped up against the bedroom door the following morning.

'I was shaking her, saying her name repeatedly but I got no response,'  Miss Trezise said.

'I then realised her skin was cold to the touch. I called my mum for advice because she is a doctor and she said, 'call 999 straight away,' The paramedics gave me the awful news that Amy had died.'

Weeks earlier Miss Ratnett had given the interview about her battle with mental health problems and her bid to raise public awareness with a blog she had started.

She talked about self-poisoning - taking mini-overdoses regularly - and told Cosmopolitan: 'I had no idea self-poisoning was a thing, I thought I was the only one doing it.

'But now, through my blog, I receive at least one email every week from young women telling me they're thinking of taking a mini-overdose. And I tell them not to - the risks are too high.'

Tributes: Miss Radnett was described as charismatic and brave, but her heartbroken father Paul told the inquest that 'she just wanted to be normal'

She had been making marked improvements in the months before her death, according to mental health experts.

However, she was still taking a heavy mix of anti-depressants and sleeping pills when she went out drinking on the eve of her death.

Her devastated father Paul told the coroner: 'She just wanted to be normal.'

The inquest heard Miss Ratnett was still taking the anti-depressant fluoxetine, olanzapine, which is used to treat schizophrenia, zopiclone for insomnia, and diazepam for anxiety.

A pathologist concluded the drugs proved fatal when mixed with alcohol, causing her vital organs to shut down while she slept.

Peter Bedford, the Berkshire coroner, said: 'Effectively, alcohol has caused her to become unconscious. She would never have woken up.'

Miss Ratnett's parents, Paul and Diane, were present at the inquest in Reading but did not comment afterwards.
