Chelsea will spend Christmas three points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League after they regained the cushion with a 2-0 win at Stoke.

Sportsmail's Ralph Ellis rated the players' performances at the Britannia Stadium on Monday night.

STOKE (4-2-3-1)

Asmir Begovic 6 

Let down by his defence for the early goal, he kept the score down with a good save from Costa late on

Phil Bardsley 5.5

Should have seen red for shocking tackle on Hazard. Booked

Ryan Shawcross 7 

A reminder that he deserves another chance with England – handled Diego Costa with authority.

Marc Muniesa 6 

Ex-Barcelona defender still hasn’t adjusted to Premier League. Hesitant at times.

Erik Pieters 5.5 

Had his hands full defending and couldn’t join attacks as he might have liked.

Geoff Cameron 5

Got bullied by Terry for the early goal and struggled to affect the midfield. Subbed.

Steven Nzonzi 6

Best of Stoke’s midfield players, kept it simple

Jonathan Walters 6

Worked hard – as always – but with little reward.

Bojan 6

Hints of promise from the man who was once considered Barcelona’s next Lionel Messi but not enough end product

Marko Arnautovic 5

Very little impact on the left, and failed to beat first man with a couple of crosses

Worked hard but had to fight for scraps. Subbed after 62 minutes

Thibaut Courtois 6

Good early save and dealt well with long throws and crosses.

Not as effective going forward as he often can be, but solid at the back

Gary Cahill 7 

Lion hearted defender made brave blocks and bossed Peter Crouch in the air

Chelsea defender John Terry powered header past Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic

John Terry 7.5

Two weeks after his 34th birthday he’s still the heart and soul of Chelsea – great early goal

Cesar Azpilicueta 6

Kept busy dealing with the threat of Walters, confirmed his defensive qualities.

John Mikel Obi 6

Steady job in midfield, breaking up Stoke’s passing and keeping it simple.

Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic played a pivotal role in away victory at Stoke

Nemanja Matic 7.5 

A reminder why Chelsea’s one defeat so far this season was also the only game he missed.

Willian 6.5

Creative Brazilian isn’t afraid of a bit of hard work too.

Cesc Fabregas 8

Prompting, plotting, always available, always looking to thread the killer pass, and an instinctive finish for his goal

A constant threat when he got on the ball and his perseverance was rewarded by setting up the second goal.
