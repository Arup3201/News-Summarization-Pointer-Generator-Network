It was the scene of one of Prince Philip's most infamous gaffes. As he helped the Queen to open the new British Embassy in Berlin in 2000, the royal was memorably overheard describing the building as 'ghastly'.

Now the Duke of Edinburgh is set to make a return to the city - and the embassy -  after Buckingham Palace announced that the prince  will travel with the Queen to Germany this summer.

The tour, which will be the Queen's first to the country since 2004, follows an invitation from President Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident. 

On her travels: Buckingham Palace has announced that the Queen and Prince Philip will visit Germany

Visit: The Queen's last visit abroad was in June 2014 when she made a state visit to France 

Remembrance: The visit was to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings on the 6th June 1944

Mr Gauck and his partner, Daniela Schadt, were the guests of the Queen and Duke at a lunch at Buckingham Palace in November 2012.

Buckingham Palace said in a short statement: 'The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from 24 to 26 June.

'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck.'

The tour will be the first international visit undertaken by the 88-year-old monarch since the state visit to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings last year. 

Meeting: The Queen was invited by President Gauck (left) but is likely to meet with Chancellor Merkel as well

Regular visitor: The Queen, who last travelled to Germany in 2004, has made several visits to the country

Warm welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip wave to well-wishers in Potsdam during their 1992 visit

Partition: The Queen also visited during the Cold War in 1978, at the request of then President Walter Scheel

First trip: The Queen travelled to West Germany 10 years after the end of WW2. She is seen here in Stuttgart

During that trip, the Queen took part in a ceremony at Sword Beach, the scene of 683 British deaths, alongside David Cameron, Germany's Chancellor Merkel and President Obama.

She also took the opportunity to reiterate her admiration for the men who fought during the Normandy campaign during a speech at the Élysée Palace, telling France's President Hollande:

‘The true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them last. Each year has compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War. 

'Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 700 years as they do after 70.'

Her Majesty has remained in the UK since returning from that visit, although the Duke of Edinburgh has made several trips to the Athlone Barracks in the German village of Sennelager near Paderborn. 

Regular visitor: The Duke of Edinburgh regularly visits the Athlone Barracks and the Queen's Royal Hussars 

 Colonel-in-chief: He last visited the regiment in November and handed out Afghanistan campaign medals

Meeting: Angela Merkel is likely to meet the royal couple and last met the Queen in February 2014 in London 

His most recent trip was in November, when he welcomed home members of the Queen's Royal Hussars, who were among the last soldiers to leave Afghanistan.

Prince Philip is the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief and regularly visits the men, as well as handing out combat medals to veterans.

While it is not known whether a visit to the Barracks will be included in the itinerary for June's tour, a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel is almost certain.

The 60-year-old politician has met the Queen several times, most recently during a state visit to Britain that she made in February 2014.

Welcomed by the monarch to Buckingham Palace, the German premier offered Her Majesty an awkward handshake in front of the cameras before being whisked away for a private afternoon tea.
