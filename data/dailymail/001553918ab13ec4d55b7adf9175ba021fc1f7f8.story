A teenage athlete has died after being hit by a discus during the warm up for a track and field event.

Joshua Ramirez, 15, was reportedly performing stretches before the competition at Plainview High School in Houston, Texas, when he was hit on the hip.

High school officials say he was initially checked out by an athletic trainer who examined the injury and advised him to go the hospital if he started to feel increased pain.

Joshua went to a follow up visit two days later, on March 10, and eventually went to the hospital where he was treated and released for a bruised hip.

His school's website says Joshua then started to feel unbearable pain and was taken to the Emergency Room on March 12, where he admitted into intensive care.

He died on March 17.

His family said in an obituary: 'Josh was born Feb.10, 1998, in Hereford, to Joshua John and Alma Silva Ramirez. He loved his Lord and his family.'

He is survived by three siblings, a brother, Isaac Ramirez; and two sisters, Teresa Ramirez and Krystal Ramirez.
