Dramatic footage claims to show the moment a helpless child was pulled screaming from the rubble of his home after an air strike  in Syria's largest city.

The video was reportedly shot today in the Bab al Nairab district of Aleppo, where Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs from helicopters killing 10 people.

As the dirt-covered and bloodstained frame of the boy is hauled to safety by civil defence workers, a man shouts in Arabic: 'Rescuing baby from under rubble in Bab Al Nairab, God is the greatest.'

Rescue: These dramatic images reportedly show the moment a helpless child was pulled screaming from the rubble after an air strike today in Aleppo, Syria. The footage has not been independently verified

Distressing: As the dirt-covered and bloodstained frame of the boy is hauled to safety, a man shouts: 'Rescuing baby from under rubble in Bab Al Nairab'. Ten people died today when barrel bombs dropped on the district

The amateur footage, which emerged tonight on social media sites and news outlets, has not been independently verified.

But it came after barrel bombings today in the same district, which killed at least 10 people including four children and two women.

Activists said many others in the historic Bab Al Nairab district, once home to one of the main gates to ancient Aleppo in the 1200s, were buried under the rubble of buildings.

The Syrian army has regularly dropped barrel bombs over populated areas in rebel-held territory and parts of Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, was seized by rebels in 2012.

Distressing: The video circulated widely on social media sites and was reported by news outlets

The civil war in Syria is now in its fourth year, killing more than 170,000 people and continuing even after international attention has shifted to conflicts in Gaza and Iraq. 

It began after a peaceful street uprising against four decades of rule by the Assad family in March 2011.

But it spiralled into an armed insurgency when the army responded with massive and deadly force to suppress the unrest.

There has been renewed concern from the international community after Islamic State extremists took over huge parts of the north and east of the country.

There militants have declared a Caliphate where residents must follow an extreme form of Sunni Islam - and where their enemies' decapitated heads are displayed in public squares.

The IS group is now thought to control around a third of Syria including the city of Raqqa, from where it launches daily attacks on President Bashar al-Assad's troops and tribal militias.

Today the terror group reportedly crushed an armed revolt by the Shueitat tribe, in the eastern Syrian province of Deir el-Zour.

Expelling the fighters from three villages earlier this month, had been the first sign of local resistance to the Islamic State group since its fighters swept into the province.

But the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighters had regained control of the villages, beheading two tribesmen in retribution.
