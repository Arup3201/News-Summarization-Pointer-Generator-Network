Two siblings from Shepardsville, Kentucky have an extraordinary dance routine that is gaining international attention.

Even though Grace Latkovski, 9, uses a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy and cystic fibrosis, that doesn't stop her and her sister Quincy Latkovski, 11, from competing at the Jamfest Super Nationals and becoming an instant darling among fans.

In fact, both Quincy and Gracie incorporate wheelchairs in their heart-warming routine set to the song 'Reflection' from popular Disney film Mulan.

The routine incorporates the use of a mirror to illustrate the lyrics to the song 'Reflection' and to show how Gracie feels liberated on the inside despite her disability

This yearâ€™s Jamfest Super Nationals was larger than ever with 300 teams performing and more than 4,000 dancers.

'There wasn't a dry eye in the house,' Jamfest representative Hayley Reyes said of their unique performance.

Jamfest was the first time the girls appeared on a national stage and they made quite the impression.

'Within a second, everyone became a family,' Reyes said to HLN.

The girls' mom Christin Latkovski told HLN that Gracie picks all her songs and that the lyrics, 'I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart and what I believe in, but somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart and be loved for who I am,' describes the way Gracie struggles with her disability but how she overcomes it.

In the performance, Quincy doesn't push Gracie around, rather Gracie is able to operate her own motorized wheelchair on which she can twirl and dance.

Gracie does not see herself as disabled and wants people to believe in themselves despite what other people may view as limitations.

The sisters study at a dance studio where Gracie takes both private and group lessons. Gracie teaches others how to reveal who they are on the inside not through physical appearance but through art and creativity.

The routine begins with both Gracie and her sister Quincy sitting in wheelchairs looking at each other from opposite sides.

Eventually, Quincy rises from her wheelchair, dances through the mirror to the other side and acts as Quincy's inner self full of enthusiasm and exuberance.

Quincy spins, pops her leg into the air, and even flips on the stage in front of the massive and appreciative audience.

The girls spin hand in hand on the stage until Quincy walks back through the mirror for the grand finale.

Even though Gracie may never be able to kick her legs, it doesn't make her feel any less special on the inside especially with the love of her mother, her older sister, and her adoring fans.

Their touching routine was undeniably a showstopper
