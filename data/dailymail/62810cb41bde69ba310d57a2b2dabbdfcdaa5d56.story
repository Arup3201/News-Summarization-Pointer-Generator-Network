The families of the soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park IRA bomb have been accused of ‘bitterness’ and failing to move on, by the ex-Labour minister who agreed to the scheme which saw a suspect walk free from court.

Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain refused to apologise for the deals which critics say amounted to an ‘amnesty’ for nearly 200 suspected IRA killers.

He said that while the feelings of the relatives of the bombing victims were ‘understandable’, the Labour government had to help ‘society as a whole to move on’.

Fresh talks are being held today between government ministers and the devolved assembly, after First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign after being left in the dark about blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers John Downey walk free from court.

Convicted IRA terrorist Downey, 62, was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the July 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people.

He was told this week that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘get-out-of-jail-free card’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police.

The letter was sent in July 2007, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since May 29, 1983.

A judge will be appointed to investigate the operation of a Government scheme to deal with on-the-run republicans, David Cameron has announced.

The Prime Minister said he accepted calls for a 'full, independent examination' of the process after Democratic Unionist (DUP) First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign.Mr Cameron said: 'The case has already been referred to the Police Ombudsman but, as the First Minister has said, we should have a full, independent examination of the whole operation of this scheme.

'So I can announce today that we will appoint an independent judge to produce a full public account of the operation of this administrative scheme to determine whether any other letters were sent in error.'

The judge will be given 'full access to government files and officials' and will report by the end May, Mr Cameron said, with the findings being published.

The letters scheme was set up in 2005 after public outcry forced Mr Hain, then Northern Ireland Secretary, to drop legislation that would have written the amnesties into law.

He has now refused to apologise, saying the deals were necessary to secure peace.

‘It was a necessary part of getting to the position where Northern Ireland escaped from its hideous past of evil and terrorism to almost universal peace and stability. I make no apology for that.’

However, writing for the Guardian he repeatedly suggested that the need to reach a deal over-ruled the feelings of the victims’ families.

Mr Hain said: ‘The bitterness of 
families and friends of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park 
terrorist atrocity over the John Downey debacle is understandable,’ he 
said.

‘After being 
officially cleared as a suspect, he was prosecuted in circumstances I 
still find astonishing; then yesterday that prosecution was aborted. No 
wonder there is anger on all sides.’

He
 insisted that  Northern Ireland today is ‘light years from where it 
was’, the result of ‘determined leadership by Blair and his ministers’.

He said the widows of prison officers killed in the Troubles would always view the endgame as ‘betrayal’.

Mr
 Hain added: ‘They didn't and still don't accept the abnormal measures 
that were necessary to normalise Northern Ireland, just as bringing 
closure to other bitter conflicts around the world has required 
governments to do controversial and difficult things.

‘Although
 nobody should presume to ask victims to draw a line under the past, 
there are times when the government must take a view on the best way for
 society as a whole to move on, to get closure on the past, difficult as
 that is.’

done'

Families of the victims of the Hyde 
Park bombing said they felt ‘devastatingly let down’ by ‘catastrophic 
failures’ which led to Downey's release and called for a review of the ‘comfort letters’ issued to IRA
 suspects.

In a statement, 
the relatives of Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, 
Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, both 19, who were
 slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the Blues and 
Royals rode to the Changing of the Guard ceremony, said: ‘This
 news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when 
the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the 
Police Service of Northern Ireland.

Northern Ireland Peter Robinson threatened to resign if the UK government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders

‘The
 end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible
 events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to
 be done.’

Judith Jenkins, 52, the widow of L/Cpl Young, added: ‘It’s the cruellest injustice. For 32 years we have waited for justice.

‘We
 all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock. It’s 
absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case. This
 case has made a mockery of the criminal justice system.’

Mr Robinson effectively 
gave the Government 24 hours to respond to his demand for a public 
inquiry into how the letters were agreed.

Having
 asked for the Assembly to be recalled tomorrow, he has made clear the 
contents of a motion he would put before the House would be dependent on
 the Government's response to his demands - prompting the prospect of a 
resignation and subsequent election.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government was looking ‘urgently’ at Mr Robinson's call for a judicial inquiry, but warned against allowing the Downey case to escalate into a ‘full-blown political crisis’.

Stormont's Deputy First Minister is to hold talks with the Northern Ireland Secretary as a political crisis triggered by the collapse of the Hyde Park bomb case continues to threaten the future of the devolved administration in Belfast.

Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister, is to meet with Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers meet at Stormont Castle to discuss the controversy.
