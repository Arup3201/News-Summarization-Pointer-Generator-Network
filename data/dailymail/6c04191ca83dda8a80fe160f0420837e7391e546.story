They stand accused of believing that the family that robs banks together stays together.

Getaway driver: Eighteen-year-old Abby Catt allegedly drove a getaway car while her father and brother robbed banks

That is what authorities in Fort Bend, Texas allege about 50-year-old father Ronald Scott Catt, his 20-year-old partner in crime and son Hayden Scott Catt and their glamorous getaway driver, 18-year-old daughter Abigail 'Abby' Catt.

Indicted yesterday on charges of aggravated robbery at the First Community Credit Union on October 1st, the locked-up family are suspected of a further Texan heist and another five bank jobs in their native Oregon.

Arrested on November 9th, the three 
alleged thieves have been languishing in the Fort Bend County Jail since
then and father and son had their bail set at $140,000 while 
Abigail's was posted at $100,000.

On
October 1st, two men entered the credit union on Cinco Ranch Boulevard 
in Fort Bend dressed in orange traffic vests and dark sunglasses and 
held bank tellers at gunpoint.

According to the security camera, the younger man wore a fake mustache, while the older man sported a painter's mask.

Abigail is alleged to have been waiting outside with the engine running to ensure a quick getaway.

Authorities
investigating the robbery linked the vests to those sold at Home 
Depot and at a branch of the store 14 miles from the First Community 
Credit Union they found stolen license plates that were linked to a car 
used in a robbery in Harris County in August.

In that robbery, the two male suspects wore painter masks and overalls as disguises.

'While
viewing videotapes at the checkout counters, they identified Hayden and
Abby Catt purchasing the vests with their father's debit card,' the 
Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office said.

'Ronald Catt was later identified purchasing a painter's mask.'

The most important factor on the vests was the X on the back, which narrowed the search field.

Sheriff's
deputies arrest Ronald and Hayden Scott Catt on November 9th at a Katy, Texas 
apartment and later that day they apprehended Abigail.

Following interviews with the suspects, Fort Bend detectives notified authorities in Oregon -- where the Catt family is originally from -- as they 'believe the suspects may be connected to five bank robbery cases in the Portland ... area,' the sheriff's office said.

While it is not known where Ronald's wife or the children's mother is currently, it has been reported that Catt had recently divorced after losing his engineering job.

Having transplanted to Katy, Texas, Hayden had begun work as a front desk clerk at a small town hotel and Abigail had begun work at a local Victoria's Secret store.

'Finally got the job interview i wanted!' Abby wrote on her Facebook page on Nov. 3. 'man im workin my way up to big $$!! so proud of myself ever since i moved to tx. we all have so much potential, some jus need to decide what they are going to do with all of it! there is great things out there, go and find it!'

The allegations have surprised their friends and acquaintances. Eric Lundeen, a family friend, toldÂ ABC News that the family appeared to be 'really solid community members.' He went that Ronald 'had the responsibility to take care of his kids and I got to tell you, he was there for them.'
