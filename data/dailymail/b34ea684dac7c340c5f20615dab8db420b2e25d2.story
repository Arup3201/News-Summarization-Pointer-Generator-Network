An award-winning British athlete may never run again after he was paralysed when he jumped into a reservoir for a swimming workout and broke his neck.

Drew Graham, a 1500m runner, broke his neck when he dived into Cherry Creek Reservoir, in Aurora, Colorado.

His wife Laura jumped into the creek to save her husband but despite her best efforts, 29-year-old Mr Graham, from Gosforth, Newcastle Upon Tyne, had broken a vertebra.

He underwent six hours of surgery but it is not known whether Mr Graham, who took a scholarship at Adams State University in Colorado in 2008, will be able to run again.

His friends have now issued a £15,000 fundraising plea to help with medical costs - with generous donations already raising more than £11,000.

His parents Gary and Carol, both 56, and his brother Jonathan and sister Helena, who also ran competitively, travelled to the US when they were told the news.

Gary Graham, who is self-employed, said: 'We got the phone call last Saturday night. It's just one of those devastating phone calls every parent never wants to get.

'It was made worse because of him living so far away and we didn't have all the details. It took us 48 hours to get here and all sorts were going through our minds.

'And then to walk into the hospital to see your son fighting for his life was just tragic.

'He's a strong guy and physically fit and he's been an athlete since he was 10-years-old and that's going to help him. He's determined and anyone who ran against him will know that.'

After diving into the Cherry Creek Reservoir on September 21, Mr Graham lost all feeling and mobility below his shoulders and was transported to the Aurora Medical Centre before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

Because of work commitments, Mrs Graham, 31, a professional research assistant, doesn't live with him in Texas and he was visiting her at the time of the accident.

When he injured himself, her quick-thinking efforts meant that her husband never lost consciousness and increased the chances of his recovery.

Mr Graham, now a cross country coach at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, in Texas, has regained movement in his arms and began breathing on his own less than 48 hours after surgery.

It is hoped he will be transferred to a rehabilitation centre and it is not known how much of the cost will be covered by his insurance.

His father added: 'We are parents and we will do anything to help with the fundraising. We take the NHS for granted but Drew's life is in America.

'People in America started the fundraising and it's snowballed from there. Our friends and family in the UK have also been brilliant.'

Colin Haggie, President of Gosforth Harriers and Athletic Club where Drew used to train, said: 'It's quite devastating really. He wasn't being daft, he just dived into some water.'

As a Gosforth Harrier, he came through the ranks and by his late teens had firmly established himself as one of the region's leading middle distance stars.

In 2007 he won the Northern 800m title and became North East Champion in both the 800m and 1500m.

He then took a scholarship at Adams State University in Colarado in 2008, where he won 15 all-American titles across cross country and athletics.

In 2012 he was named the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches' Association Indoor Track Male Athlete of the Year.

He was also named the Men's Central Region Track Athlete of the Year, by the US Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.
