Snapchat’s popularity has soared in recent months and a number of firms, including Facebook, have been looking to emulate this status - with limited success. 

But latest rival Taptalk could finally steal the app's crown after Ashton Kutcher tweeted about it to his 16 million Twitter followers on Sunday. 

Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location.

Snapchat rival Taptalk (pictured) was developed by Berlin-based Onno Faber. Pictures and videos are shared with friends using a tap of the screen, and each file is sent with the user's location. Captions can also be added, and the photos and videos self-destruct after they've been viewed

Although it sounds almost identical to Snapchat, its developers and fans claim its much simpler to use, and could replace text messaging. 

Taptalk has a photo and video viewer at the top of the screen, and a grid of friends below. 

Tapping a friend’s face takes a photo with either the front, or rear-facing camera.

The image is then sent to the selected friend automatically. 

Tapping and holding the friend’s face sends the selected contact a video. 

Captions can be added before tapping the screen, and all files are sent with the user’s location included.  

Video and photos can be viewed only once before they are deleted.

Messages can only be sent to individuals, and not groups - like on Snapchat.

Due to it's single-screen design, Taptalk is also said to be much faster and easier to use than its rival.

This is because it’s stripped out the timers, profiles and navigation buttons seen on Snapchat.

Instead, Taptalk has a photo and video viewer at the top of the screen, and a grid of friends below.

Taptalk first started gaining traction on Ryan Hoover’s Product Hunt blog, which lists the most interesting new sites and apps.

It then raised investment from SV Angel, although the amount has not been revealed. 

Ashton Kutcher tweeted support for the app over the weekend, but it is unknown whether he has invested in the firm or not.

Kutcher has previously invested in companies alongside SV Angel, including Fab.com and Bloomthat, as well as putting money into Airbnb and Spotify through his A-Grade Investments firm. 

Other rumours state Facebook is looking to copy Taptalk’s features on its own Slingshot app.

Speaking on his Product Hunt site, Hoover said: ‘I've had the pleasure of playing with a beta of Taptalk for the past few weeks. 

‘I'm super impressed with the speed of communication. 

‘Each message is one-to-one, unlike Snapchat and other communication apps that allow you to send the same post to several people at once. 

‘This makes each message more personal and arguably more value because you know it's just for you.’
