Around 100,000 people were struck down with norovirus (pictured) over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise, experts have warned

Around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise, experts have warned.

Figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year.

The dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country.

A total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in England and Wales - up on the 2,255 of last year.

But the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that for every reported case, an estimated 288 were not flagged up, meaning around 1.12 million people could now have contracted the illness this season.

This is about 100,000 more than during the pre-Christmas period - until December 23 - when 1.01 million people were estimated to have come down with the bug.

The number of reported cases dropped slightly during the Christmas week but this was in keeping with dips at the same time in previous seasons, the HPA said.

John Harris, an expert in norovirus from the HPA, said: 'As we have seen in previous years there has been a dip in the number of confirmed laboratory reports owing to the Christmas and New Year period.

'However, in line with other norovirus seasons we will expect to see an increase in the number of laboratory reports in the next few weeks.

During the two weeks up to December 30, there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported, compared to 70 in the previous fortnight, bringing the total for the season to 590.

Cases of norovirus shot up earlier than expected this winter across Europe.

But experts have been unable to determine why this is the case or predict whether numbers will continue to rise at the same rate.

Although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year, activity increases in the winter months.

Norovirus is no different from other viruses that circulate at this time of year, but it is incredibly infectious.

It is the UK’s most common cause of gastroenteritis, and spreads easily when everyone is cooped up inside during the winter.

One problem is that people do not 
develop long-lasting immunity  – you are protected for only a few 
months, so next winter you can easily get it again.

The vomiting viruses, colds and flu tend
to peak in winter partly because people congregate inside, explains Dr 
Ron Cutler, director of biomedical science at Queen Mary, University of 
London.

‘Viruses can be picked up and passed on 
often as a result of poor hygiene — which often means people just not 
washing their hands,’ says Dr Cutler.

‘A get-together where people are in 
close contact inside — for example, a concert in a closed venue, or a 
church carol service — is the perfect environment for viruses to 
spread.’

He adds: ‘The problem with viruses is 
that in the first phase of infection there are no signs or symptoms — 
and this can last for days, although normally people are contagious at 
this stage so it can then be passed on to other people.’

Viruses also survive longer during 
winter weather, thanks to the lack of sunshine and the damp weather 
conditions, says Professor Ian Jones, a virologist from Reading 
University.

For norovirus, you need exposure to only
a small number of virus particles — between ten and 100 — to catch the 
sickness compared with 10,000 particles to catch flu.

‘You only need to come into contact with
a single droplet from a sneeze — which can contain up to a million 
virus particles — to become infected with a cold,’ says Professor Jones.

Mr Harris added: 'Norovirus is very contagious, and anyone who has had it knows it is very unpleasant.

'If you think you 
may have the illness then it is important to maintain good hand hygiene 
to help prevent it spreading.

"We also advise that people stay away
from hospitals, schools and care homes as these environments are 
particularly prone to outbreaks.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is well prepared for the winter. No A&Es have had to close so far this winter and we are providing additional funding to the NHS to help it cope with the added pressure that the winter brings.

'Flu and norovirus are typical at this time of year - that's why we are running the 'Catch It. Bin It. Kill It' campaign to remind people that one of the best ways to stop the spread of winter bugs is to Catch It, Bin It and Kill It when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands regularly.

'Our weekly published figures show the number of beds closed across the NHS due to norovirus symptoms is around 2.4 per cent. This compares to 2.9% of beds that were closed during the peak of norovirus cases last winter.'
