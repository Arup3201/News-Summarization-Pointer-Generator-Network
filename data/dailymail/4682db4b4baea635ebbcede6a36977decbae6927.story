More than 5,000 soldiers are being axed in a fresh round of defence cuts – despite Britain wading deeper into the battle against terrorists in Africa.

Former commanders said the controversial cuts were ‘too deep’, leaving the Army perilously overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments demanded by ministers.

Under the latest round of redundancies, the Army will shrink to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the Napoleonic Wars began 200 years ago. Some troops currently risking life and limb on the front line in Afghanistan face the axe next year, the Government admitted.

Ministers revealed the bleak news just
hours after Prince Harry returned from flying attack helicopters 
against the Taliban in Helmand.

The announcement also came after David
Cameron said Britain would be at the forefront of a ‘generational 
struggle’ to confront and destroy Al Qaeda-linked extremists in North 
Africa.

While he has ruled out sending combat 
troops, he is preparing to deploy Sentinal R1 spy planes and special 
forces in the wake of the insurgency in Mali and the Algerian terror 
attack.

But critics raised concerns about the 
wisdom of continuing to slash the Armed Forces when the battle against 
Islamic fanatics was shifting to Africa.

Colonel Richard Kemp, who 
commanded British forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘These cuts are too deep.
On Monday the PM said we had a decades-long struggle with international
terrorism, as illustrated by recent events in Algeria and in Mali.

Mr Hammond said medics in the Navy and Air Force would be cut in the next round of job losses

‘This struggle cannot be maintained 
without sufficient resources.

'The PM and his successors will continue to
commit British troops to defend the nation’s interests overseas, 
irrespective of how small the forces gets.

‘Of course our troops will rise to the
challenge but in doing so they will pay a price in overstretched and 
inadequate equipment.

‘The cost of our fight against world 
jihad has to be paid by somebody and it should be the taxpayer – the 
soldier should not be called upon to bear an unequal burden.’

This Government has been responsible for some of the most severe defence cuts ever.

Under the Strategic Defence and 
Security Review (SDSR), the MoD said it would cut the Army from 102,000 
to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside Wembley 
Stadium.

Some 5,000 personnel each from the RAF and Navy have already 
been made redundant.

The Government wants to replace regular troops by 
doubling the number of part-time soldiers to 30,000.

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy 
called for the ‘flawed’ defence review to be reopened because it had 
been ‘exposed by world events’.

He said: ‘The threats have increased and
yet the Army is being cut. The Prime Minister rightly spoke of the 
urgency of the Islamist terror threat to the UK from North Africa.

David Cameron was challenged in the Commons yesterday by former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell over the impact of cuts on Britain's ability to mount military operations around the world

'But 
in a “carry on regardless” strategy, the Ministry of Defence has 
announced 5,000 Army redundancies.

‘There are real worries about the 
military impact of a loss of skills and capability at a time of 
increased threats and new global challenges. Many will fear ministers 
are unprepared for threats we face.’

Defence Minister Mark Francois 
insisted the Armed Forces retained the capabilities required ‘to meet 
the challenges of the future’. Redundancies would not ‘impact adversely’
on operations in Afghanistan, he said.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
added: 'The Army is actively managing recruitment to reach the target 
numbers, but unfortunately redundancies are unavoidable due to the size 
of the defence deficit that this Government inherited and the consequent
scale of downsizing required in the Army.’

Ministers are taking the axe to the 
Armed Forces to save £4.7billion from the defence budget and plug a 
£38billion equipment overspend.

The latest round of redundancies 
affects junior soldiers to senior ranks.

Personnel preparing for, 
serving on, or recovering from operations on June 18 – the day 
redundancy notices will be issued – or recuperating from a serious 
injury will be exempt unless they volunteer.

But ministers warned that the Army 
will feel one more bout of pain, with as many as 4,000 troops made 
redundant next year, as well as Royal Navy and RAF medics.

The prospect of more sackings will be a
blow to morale for troops who are seeing their pay, pensions and living
allowances squeezed.
