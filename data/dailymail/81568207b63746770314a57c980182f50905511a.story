An international field of daredevils today defied health and safety zealots to tumble down a hill as they took part in the annual Cheese Rolling competition.

Rebel rollers again staged their own unofficial event after the world-famous competition, which sees thrill seekers chase an 8lb piece of Double Gloucester down a steep hill, was cancelled in 2010.

Organisers behind the event at Cooper's Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, had this year replaced the cheese with a lightweight foam version in order to make the downhill race safer.

There was a large police presence at 
entrances to the competition, but it went ahead as planned. The bizarre 
annual event attracts participants, spectators and media from across the
world.

Around 4,000 
spectators basked in the blazing sunshine to watch around a dozen 
daredevil athletes pursue the ‘cheese’ 200 metres down the 1:2 gradient 
slope of grass, brambles and nettles.

Competitors
slip, somersault and tumble their way to the bottom in spectacular 
fashion during the bone-crunching races - and the first person to grab 
the cheese wins.

Last week 
it was revealed police had warned cheesemaker Diana Smart not to supply 
the Double Gloucesters for the race because she might be held liable for
any injuries suffered by chasers.

But although today's races did finish 
with an ambulance being called to a man with a suspected broken leg, 
there were no other serious injuries.

John Anderson, whose soldier son Chris 
could not defend his chasing crown today because he is on a military 
training exercise in Kenya, said the police should not have spent money 
on a helicopter to watch the event.

‘They are probably up there filming everything so that next year they have ammunition to try to get the cheese rolling banned,’ he said.

‘But although there are far more people here than there have been at the unofficial races last year and the year before there is nothing for the police to worry about.

‘Everyone is behaving themselves. It 
shows that this event can take place without marshals, security men, 
emergency services and expensive insurance.’

Chris
Anderson, 25, has been the main winner of the races over the last five 
years and has claimed 13 cheeses in that time. He intended to defend his
record today, watched by his platoon from 1 Rifles Regiment.

But Mr Anderson Snr said his son was 'gutted' that a six week training exercise in Africa had been brought forward from mid-June and he could not take part.

It left the races wide open to 
challengers and the first downhill pursuit was won by jubilant American 
Kenny Rackers, 27, from Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The estate agent, wearing a morph 
costume with his hair dyed to match, said: ‘I've come especially for this
and it feels great to win.

Popular: Three years ago the official cheese rolling event was cancelled when about 15,000 people tried to attend - causing widespread traffic jams and concern about public safety on the treacherous hillside

'I've been training a long time for it - running up and down the ski slopes in Colorado. As soon as I saw this event on TV I put it on my bucket list to do.

‘We are celebrating Memorial Day today, remembering all soldiers who have given the ultimate sacrifice for their countries, and I want to dedicate my win to them, to all the soldiers everywhere.

‘I got a great start at the top of the hill and I just kept going. As far as I know I am the first American to hold a cheese high here.’

The Cheese Rolling Committee disbanded and it appeared the tradition was at an end. But locals thought otherwise and have kept it going.

Since then interest has been growing and 
today there was the biggest turnout yet for the unofficial races - 
partly fuelled by publicity about the police telling Mrs Smart not to 
supply cheeses.

Despite the police intervention, there were plenty of cheeses for competitors to chase today.

Wearing a T-shirt bearing the message 'and we roll again 2013', an organiser who gave her name only as Sarah said: ‘We've made some dummy cheeses out of sponge to roll down the hill so they are lighter and less dangerous.

‘But we have real cheeses for the winners. You don't have to tell someone selling cheese what you want it for, do you?

‘We are determined to keep this traditional event going every year and we're very grateful to all the people who have turned out to support us.’
