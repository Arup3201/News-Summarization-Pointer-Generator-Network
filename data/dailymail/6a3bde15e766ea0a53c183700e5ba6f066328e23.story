Holding her winners trophy aloft, Jennifer Aniston showed off her impeccable figure - and her pecs in a tight leather dress.

While the actress has long been a devotee of the gentler pursuits of yoga and Pilates, she appears to have moved on to a bit of bodybuilding as she unveiled a bulked up figure at the MTV Awards last night.

The actress won the best on-screen 
dirtbag award at this year's MTV Movie Awards for her performance as a 
sex crazed dentist in Horrible Bosses.

And while she has always been in great shape, she certainly cut a more muscular figure than of late in her one-shoulder black leather dress.

Compared
to last year when she attended the launch of her perfume Jennifer 
Aniston at Sephora in New York, the actress has gained muscle in the 
upper body, and looks more powerful in the leg area.

Perhaps she has been sharing workouts with boyfriend Justin Theroux, 40.

Jennifer, 43, looked overjoyed to win the unusually named award which was introduced this year to celebrate the silver 
screen's most cringeworthy characters.

She managed to beat off her co-star 
Colin Farrell (not physically) to take the award, who was nominated for his turn as 
psychologically unstable Bobby Pellitt.

She told the audience: 'I mean, do you know how long I have tried to have somebody let me 
unleash my on-screen dirtbag? A really long time.

'And thank God this category just popped up.

'So I would like to 
say "thank you" to the television show 'Friends' for letting me unleash 
the inner sweetheart and here's to [director] Seth Gordon for allowing 
me to be a dirtbag.'

Jennifer faced some stiff competition for the prize, but her display as Dr Julia Harris in the film, in which she memorably ate a banana while in her underwear, was enough to see her home.

The other contenders for the award was Bryce Dallas Howard for her turn as racist Miss Hilly in The Help,  Kristen Wiig's repellent friend with benefits Jon Hamm in Bridesmaids and Project X party boy Oliver Cooper.

And there was also a moment of drama before Jennifer went on stage to receive her golden popcorn award.

After emerging to announce the nominees an audience member heckled a shocked  Mila Kunis.

Luckily her butch fellow presenter Mark 
Wahlberg stepped in, saying: 'And here I thought I was going to have to slap Russell.'

The dynamic duo then shrugged the incident off and got onto the serious business of presenting their award.
