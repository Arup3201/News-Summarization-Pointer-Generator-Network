A Chinese beekeeper covered his semi-naked body with more than 460,000 bees for a publicity stunt aimed at selling more of his honey, using a technique known as 'bee bearding'.

She Ping, a 34-year-old honey merchant from the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, covered himself in bees that collectively weighed more than 100 pounds.

Pictures of She's stunt show him posing 
topless beside more than a dozen blue hives, before the insects swarm 
over his body, which appears to be protected only by a plastic bag 
placed over his head.

That looks painful, honey: She Ping, a 34 year-old local beekeeper, covered with a swarm of bees in southwest China's Chongqing

'To be honest I felt very nervous, but I do it to promote my honey,' She said, adding: 'I'm used to dealing with bees... and started these activities when I was about 22.'

'It hurt but I didn't dare to move,' he said, adding that he was stung more than 20 times during the 40-minute stunt.

'The main preparation is avoiding taking a shower, especially avoiding using soap because it can excite the bees,' he said.

Ouch: Unsurprisingly, She was stung more than 20 times during the 40-minute stunt

Chongqing has emerged as a hotspot for
 bee bearders, with several other local honey merchants taking part, and
 honey shops with signs showing them covered in the insects visible in 
the city.

Meanwhile, a pair of beekeepers in northwest China got married while covered in suits of bees, reports said in 2009.

China is one of the world's major 
producers of honey, though its exports have been banned in several 
countries due to fears of counterfeiting.

'The main preparation is avoiding taking a shower, especially avoiding using soap because it can excite the bees,' he said. She admitted that his attempt fell short of a world record, but claims the record for carrying out the stunt without any clothes

She admitted that his attempt fell short of a world record, but claims the record for carrying out the stunt without any clothes.

'Of the people who do it naked, I'm probably the most awesome,' he said.

Bee bearding is a global pursuit, and 
Indian Vipin Seth holds the world record for wearing a mantle of bees 
weighing 135 pounds, according to Guinness World Records' official video
 channel.

Participants generally attract the bees by placing a queen bee in a small cage hanging from their body.
