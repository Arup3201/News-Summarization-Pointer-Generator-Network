A seven-year-old boy was suspended from school on Thursday after biting his breakfast pastry into a shape that his teacher thought looked like a gun.

Josh Welch, a second-grader at Park Elementary School in Baltimore, said he was trying to nibble his strawberry snack into a mountain.

But when his teacher saw what he had done, the boy says she got 'pretty mad' and he knew he was 'in big trouble.' Josh was suspended for two days.

Dangerous? Josh Welch, a seven-year-old boy from Maryland, was suspended from school for two days in March 2013 for shaping a pastry into what his teacher thought looked like a gun. He has since left the school

Threat: The school sent home a letter with every student informing parents that: 'A student used food to make an inappropriate gesture'

Josh's dad was called by the school and informed that his son had been suspended for two days.

The school sent home a letter with every student informing parents that: 'A student used food to make an inappropriate gesture.'

Josh, who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and enjoys art classes, told Fox 45 that his actions were innocent.

'It was already a rectangle and I just kept on biting it and biting it and tore off the top and it kinda looked like a gun but it wasn't.

'All I was trying to do was turn it into a mountain but, it didn't look like a mountain really and it turned out to be a gun kinda,' the seven-year-old recalled.

The boy's dad found the incident ridiculous. 'I would almost call it insanity. I mean with all the potential issues that could be dealt with at school, real threats, bullies, whatever the real issue is, it's a pastry.., Ya know?' he said.

The school refused to comment due to privacy issues. The boy's father said the school claimed Josh had said 'Bang! Bang!' while holding the pastry, according to Fox News.

Josh denies that his food art was ever meant to be a gun.

Harsh: Josh's dad called the incident 'insanity.'
