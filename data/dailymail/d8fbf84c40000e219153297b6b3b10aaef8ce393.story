A musician singer-songwriter has been jailed for giving his 17-year-old fiancée a lethal morphine overdose two years after he got her addicted to Class A drugs.

Jack Alderton, 25, from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, got her addicted to Class A drugs when she was only 15, and finally killed her with the fatal dose in March last year, a jury heard.

Georgina Boxall was found unconscious in a
 drug dealer's bed and died in an air ambulance on the way to hospital.

The jury heard how Miss Boxall, pictured right, was in thrall to her older boyfriend, pictured together left, and wrote a poem about him called 'Endless Love' which described their relationship as feeling 'like a dream'

Alderton, aged 25 years, had been served 
two child abduction notices by police to stay away from Ms Boxall in the
 two years before her death, to no avail.

A
 judge blasted Alderton's 'calculated and destructive' actions in 
supplying drugs to the blonde teenager, as she jailed him for eight 
years at Reading Crown Court.

The
 jury had heard Alderton started abusing drugs at the age of 13 years, 
and was 'obsessed' with getting high by the time his young fiancée died 
on March 16.

In
 a text message shortly before her death, Miss Boxall told him: 'I just 
want you to have a convo (sic) with me occasionally without it being 
about drugs.'

The
 jury heard Miss Boxall had been trying to ween herself off the drugs - 
which she started heavily abusing when she met Alderton - but he would 
not let her quit.

Following
 an overdose of illegally obtained morphine sulphate, she stopped 
breathing as she slept in a child's bed at the house of one of 
Alderton's suppliers, Damien Stone.

Stone,
 aged 44 years, of Crowthorne, Berkshire, admitted supplying class A 
drugs and was jailed for three years following Alderton's trial.

Dreadlocked
 Alderton - whose mother forced him to shave his hair off for the court 
case - had denied supplying the class A drug that killed Miss Boxall.

However, in an extraordinary blog post on the eve of the trial, Alderton said he was 'lucky' not to have been charged with manslaughter.

Alderton added: 'I have never been to jail before, but I'm thinking I will be ok. Might write a book about the whole thing...Been a pretty intense life so far.'

The heavy drug user told how he met Miss Boxall while he was studying in Surrey, and said: 'I think I was the first person she ever trusted in her life. This was all great, however we were both full on drug addicts.'

Alderton would use money from his disability benefits to buy substances from internet sites, as well as from street dealers, which he would give to Miss Boxall.

He would also make money from dealing drugs himself, the trial heard.

Miss Boxall's horrified parents, Leslie and Susan, had twice secured child abduction notices for Alderton to stay away from their daughter in the two years before her death.

However, she was in thrall to her older boyfriend and the drugs - and got engaged to him, the jury heard.

Miss Boxall, an aspiring poet and artist, wrote about her fiancé in one poem entitled 'Endless Love'.

She wrote: 'The feel of your skin against mine, that content and euphoric experience - feels like a dream. Our passion will never end, even with the drugs. Those poisonous lines. The feel of your dreadlocks against my own, I know I can never be alone.'

Drug dealer Damien Stone, 44, was also jailed after Miss Boxall was found dead in a child's bed at his house

The trial heard Miss Boxall had tried to give up taking drugs, but Alderton carried on supplying them to her.

In her sentencing remarks, Judge Angela Morris said: 'The text messages suggest she was trying to rid herself of the addiction to drugs by going cold turkey.

'There was no guarantee she would have succeeded - however, you did nothing to help that. In fact, you put drugs in her way.

'Your actions were simply improper, calculated and destructive because you knew only too well the danger Georgina Boxall was in by agreeing to the morphine use.'

Miss Boxall's devastated family sat in the public gallery quietly listening as Alderton was jailed at Reading Crown Court on Friday.

The judge told the relatives they had listened to the evidence 'with great dignity', and that sadly no sentence she could impose would compensate them for her death.

Alderton, of Harwood Road, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was found guilty of supplying the class A drug that killed Miss Boxall.

He had already admitted five other drugs-related offences, including supplying class A drug ecstasy three days before Miss Boxall's death, two counts of supplying class B drugs diazepam and cannabis in June, 2013, and two counts of supplying Class C drugs subutex and tamazepam in November 2012 and January 2013.
