A NYPD sergeant has been indicted along with a Colorado woman on charges of conspiracy to molest her one-year-old child.

Keira Norton and officer Alberto Randazzo each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if they are convicted.

Randazzo, 38, was arrested In February on charges of downloading child pornography. At the time he was on bail and before the courts for soliciting women to sexually abuse their children.

NYPD sergeant Alberto Randazzo has been charged with conspiracy to molest a 1-year-old after police uncovered a series of Skype video chats with a woman where they claim he directed her to abuse her child

Norton was arrested after investigators went through Randazzo's laptop and uncovered 11 files of Skype video conversations between the two, the New York Daily News reports.   

Court papers detail the conversations between the two in late 2010. In one video Norton follows instructions from Randazzo to perform sexual acts on the child.

The child has not been publicly identified. 

Norton, 44, was arrested last year and has been held at Rikers Island jail because she cannot pay her $100,000 bail. 

Randazzo, who has been on the force for 15-years and is assigned to the Midtown North Precinct, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He is currently suspended without pay. 

Randazzo is also accused of possessing 23 child pornography images and videos (stock image)

Randazzo allegedly admitted to federal agents that he had downloaded about 30 video files depicting child pornography while he was free on bail.

In relation to that matter, he is accused of possessing 23 still images and videos depicting lewd acts involving children as young as one, on his cellphone and laptop.

Randazzo is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center.
