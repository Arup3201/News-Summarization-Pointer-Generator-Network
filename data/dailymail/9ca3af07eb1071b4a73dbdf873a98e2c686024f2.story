When Kamina the baby gorilla was rejected by her mother after birth, human surrogates stepped in to take over the role.

And, as these touching photographs show, the adorable youngster doesn't seem to know any differently, thanks to their fur-covered suits.

On Monday, Kamina was flown by private jet from Oklahoma City Zoo, where she was born on August 16, to Cincinnati Zoo, where staff hope one of the female gorillas will take the baby in as their own. 

But before they try to integrate her with the troop, a team of 10 to 15 humans wearing furry vests and gloves will bottle feed and care for Kamina for about 12 to 14 weeks. They will also wear masks because baby gorillas are susceptible to respiratory infections.

New home: Kamina the baby gorilla is fed at Cincinnati Zoo. She was flown to the zoo after being rejected by her mother in Oklahoma City after her birth last month

Holding on: Kamina was taken out of her mother's care 24 hours after her birth when the female gorilla showed no maternal instincts, putting her baby's life in danger

Settling in: Staff, who cover themselves with gorilla-like fur, are now hand-rearing the baby gorilla for three months before they introduce her to the gorilla troop

Playful: Staff hope that one of the female gorillas at Cincinnati Zoo will take Kamina in as their own when she gets to meet them in a few months

'[Gorillas] need to feel that closeness, they need to feel that love like they should from their mother on day one,' Ron Evans, the primate curator at the Cincinnati Zoo, told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Staff will also move around like gorillas on their knuckles and make what they call 'gorilla vocalizations' to Kamina, a western lowland gorilla, so that she learns the sounds of her family-to-be.

'They start learning life lessons, and language, and rules of etiquette from day one just like we do,' Evans told FOX19.

Baby gorillas also rarely leave their mothers' sides, meaning that the zoos in both Oklahoma City and Cincinnati have relied on staff and volunteers to be with Kamina around the clock.

But ultimately, the baby will be handed over to her fellow gorillas. She will be ready to leave once she can walk on her own.

Kamina was forced to move homes after her mother, Ndjole, did not show any maternal care and put the newborn's life at risk, Oklahoma City Zoo Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer D'Agostino told The Oklahoman.

The zoo turned to Cincinnati to see if they would be able to raise the baby, in line with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums guidelines Species Survival Plan.

Oklahoma City Zoo staff, including Evans, took the private jet with her to her new home on Monday.

'She was in our laps the whole time. It was incredible.' Evans told the Enquirer. 'You cannot put a gorilla that young into a crate like you could with an older animal.'

The zoo recent had success with another rejected gorilla, Gladys, who was also rejected by her mother in Brownsville, Texas. She was flown to Cincinnati in February 2013 and is now arguably the happiest animal in the entire zoo, Evans told FOX19.

Staff now hope Kamina will have the same success.

Introductions: Dr. Srikant Iyer, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital, examines Kamina in at the Cincinnati Zoo on Tuesday

Checks: Staff hope that Kamina, pictured at the new zoo, will be matched with a mother after another rejected baby gorilla found a home at the zoo last year

Growing girl: Staff will remain will Kamina for 24 hours, seven days a week until she is walking on her own and ready to move in with the troop

They have candidates to take on the role of her mother: Samantha, who has proven to be a good mother, or Mara, who has no children but has shown an inclination to be motherly towards the younger members of the troop.

Another baby gorilla, Mondika, was born just two weeks before Kamina, so staff think she'll also have a playmate when she is finally introduced.  

'Over the next couple of months they will ease her in,' Oklahoma City Zoo mammal curator Laura Bottaro said. 'It's a very gradual process, and it's important that protocol be followed. But we feel like she's got a great chance to find a mom to take care of her. They've had success there before, just like we have had success finding surrogates for chimpanzees.'

Western Lowland gorillas are an endangered species and there are believed to be fewer than 800 in the world. They live in heavy rainforests across central Africa, which makes it difficult for scientists to know their exact numbers. 

Hopeful: Staff at Oklahoma City Zoo said they were sad to say goodbye to Kamina but know that she has the best chance of meeting a new mother in Cincinnati
