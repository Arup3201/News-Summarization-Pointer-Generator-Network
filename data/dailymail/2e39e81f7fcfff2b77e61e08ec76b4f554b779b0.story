Barcelona seemed to be having a good time as they joked about before their Champions League second-leg tie against Manchester City,with Neymar leading the fun.

As the Catalan club prepared for City's arrival, the Brazilian striker was in top form, laughing with team-mates before jokingly kicking Luis Suarez up the backside when the Uruguayan went to ground.

Suarez then got a second kick as he turned to see what had happened, when full back Dani Alves joined in the fun.

And it was telling to see the Brazilian at the heart of the fun on Tuesday, after reports that he had angered team-mates with his reaction to being substituted during last weekend's win over Eibar.

'I believe that he’s a very important player for us,' said Andres Iniesta of Neymar, defending his team-mate.

'Not only because of the goals he scores and all his help in match but because of how he is, how he plays.

'We are very pleased with him, if there’s a gesture or a special action I don't take that as a lack of respect, no. 

'Each one of us has to focus on ourselves, there is lots of respect between the players here, some situations people like more, some like this but there’s always huge respect between us.'
