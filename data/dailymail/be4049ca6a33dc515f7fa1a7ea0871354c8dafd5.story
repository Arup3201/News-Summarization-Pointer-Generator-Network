A mother and daughter have spoken of their experience of both being diagnosed with the same cancer at exactly the same age.

Christina Jones, 55, from Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham, was diagnosed with the blood cancer Hodgkin’s lymphoma at the age of 24 in 1982.

She beat the condition and, despite being told she may not be able to have children, gave birth to daughter Philippa in 1988.

Astonishingly, Phillippa was diagnosed with the same condition in 2011, despite the cancer not being considered to have a strong hereditary link.

Christina Jones and her daughter Phillippa were both diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma aged 24 - despite the fact the cancer is not thought to have a genetic link

‘I couldn’t believe that Phillippa could have the same disease as me at exactly the same age - especially as family history isn’t thought to play a role,’ said Christina

Indeed although there can be a slightly 
increased risk of developing the cancer if a close relative has suffered with the condition, it is not known whether genes or a shared lifestyle play the deciding role.

'It's an amazing story because the the risk of two relatives getting the cancer is very low,' said
 Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK.

Christina said she knew that something was wrong when she developed a lump on the side of her neck as a young woman.

‘Almost overnight, a lump appeared - but I thought it was nothing, so I left it for a couple of weeks. But it didn’t disappear and it was totally painless which is a key symptoms of Hodgkin’s.’

Christine eventually saw a doctor who sent her for blood tests. They showed an abnormality and a biopsy confirmed that she had cancer but that it was only in the early stages – between stage two and three.

Phillippa, now 25, said that having a mother who had been through the same ordeal was reassuring. Philippa's cancer was more advanced than her mother's when diagnosed and she underwent both chemotherapy and radiotherapy

Because the cancer was contained, she underwent four weeks of targeted radiotherapy.

‘It was tough – I felt nauseous constantly and of course the insides of my mouths were raw from radiation burns,’ she said.

But
 Christina said she wasn’t scared about the diagnosis because in the 
Eighties, people were far less aware of the gravity of cance, she says. 

‘Back then you just had to get on with it – there was less support. To tell you the truth, I needed it explained to me that lymphoma was a cancer of the blood because it just wasn’t publicised then.

‘I’m an optimistic person, too, and I just didn’t think to get too down about it.’

Christina was later given the all clear and has enjoyed good health ever since.

Christina admitted that in 2011 she hadn’t given much thought to her cancer in many years so when daughter Philippa started to exhibit certain symptoms, she didn't think it could be the same cancer she had suffered with three decades before.

'My lump was smaller than Mum's and didn't grow anywhere near as fast, no none of us thought it could be the beginnings of the same disease,' said Phillippa.

Eventually the symptoms worsened and Philippa began to lose weight, suffered night sweats, abdominal pain -  which doctors later discovered was caused by an enlarged spleen.

Doctors sent her for an ultrasound scan but because they didn't think it was urgent, she didn't receive the results for a month.

By the time the scan came back in August she had developed another lump under her arm.

Phillippa was given an immediate biopsy she was given the news that was suffering with Hodgkin's lymphoma within 24 hours.

'It was bizarre being given the same news but I didn't panic,' said Phillippa. 'There were a couple of tears but it was so good to know I wasn't alone because Mum had been through the same.'

'You don't want to burden your friends with your worries about cancer, so knowing I had Mum who had been through it all before made it feel like I could confide in her.'

Phillippa's lymphoma was more advanced than her mother's and she was diagnosed with stage three to four cancer.

She was treated at Heartlands 
Hospital in Bordesley Green and was given radiotherapy and underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.

Philippa went into remission in January 2012 and was given the all-clear the following month.

She is now feeling 'better than ever' and is enjoying her new job as a charity fundraiser for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research.

Nearly 1,500 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) in the UK each year. 

HL is cancer of the 
white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the 
lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread 
throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your 
immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic 
vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as 
lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to 
multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the 
lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands.

These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, 
armpit or groin.

It usually affects 
young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50.

The cause is 
unknown but risk factors include medical 
conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant 
medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which
 causes glandular fever).

It isn’t thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it.

The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy.

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the 
cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids.

It is not thought to be a cancer that is passed down through families
