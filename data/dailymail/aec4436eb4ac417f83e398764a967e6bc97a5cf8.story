Greta Scacchi has revealed a film director failed to recognise her as the sexy star of hit films Heat And Dust and White Mischief.

The 53-year-old mother of two, once regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world, said she had no problems with getting older but was mortified at not being recognised.

She said: ‘I was chatting to a young film director and he asked my name. After I told him he said, “Like the actress?” and I said, “Yep, that’s me”.

Really? Greta Scacchi, pictured at her East Sussex home, has revealed a film director failed to recognise her as the sexy star of films Heat and Dust and White Mischief

‘But then he said: “No, I mean Greta Scacchi, the actress who did all those films.”

‘I had to say to him, do I look so bad? I said you are describing me but you are not recognising me. Then he was mortified. That was a low point for me. To be unrecognisable as yourself is disturbing.’

The star spoke hours before being awarded the Cavaliere dell’Ordine al Merito della repubblica Italiana – Italy’s equivalent of a knighthood, for services to the arts, at the Italian Embassy in London last night. The actress, born to an Italian father and English mother, has dual Italian and Australian citizenship after being refused British citizenship at 18.  

Despite the director’s faux pas, Scacchi says she is positive about the future and, although she used to resent the sex symbol tag, she now regards it as a help. ‘The fact people might still think you are sexy is quite helpful when you are of an age when most women are dismissed.’
