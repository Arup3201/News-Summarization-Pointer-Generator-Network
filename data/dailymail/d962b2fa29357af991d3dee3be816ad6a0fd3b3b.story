It will be a very lucky pair of hands who gets to tinkle on these ivories.

Because this instrument is the oldest surviving grand piano in the country.

It was handmade in London by Americus Backers in 1772 and was owned by the first Duke of Wellington.

It will be returned to the home of its former owner, the first Duke of Wellington, at Hyde Park Corner in central London

It has now been returned to Apsley House, in London, where it will be played during a concert called 'The Duke of Wellington's Music of the French Wars' later this month.

It is the only known fortepiano by Backers existing today and has previously been on loan to the Russell Collection in Edinburgh.

The hammer mechanism is truly a breakthrough in design, Michael Cole, an instrument restorer and maker from Prestbury in Gloucestershire said.

Simple and reliable, it has withstand the test of time because of its unique advantage over others made in the same period.

Its design allowes users to adjust it and maintain its mechanisms through a series of set-off screws, easily accessible by removing the nameboard.

Americus Backers is often lauded as the father of the English grand pianoforte style.

He brought the hammer striking action for keyboard instruments from his master, Gottfried Silbermann’s, workshop in Freiburg, Germany to England in the mid-18th century.

Unlike other former students of Silbermann, who built square pianos with Silbermann’s method, he built into a grand harpsichord case and added two tonal effects – una corda and damper lift – activated by pedals built into the dedicated trestle stand, again his original innovation.

This new innovation transformed English music prompting composers and musicians to consign the plucked string harpsichord and its music to history.

Americus’s design is the blueprint for the modern grand pianoforte.

The grand Aspley building was to the Duke of 
Wellington after his victory over Napoleon at Waterloo, the interior of 
the house has changed very little since the days of the Iron Duke.

The house boasts one of the finest 
art collections in London, with paintings by Velazquez and Rubens as 
well as a wonderful collection of silver and porcelain.

A massive nude statue of Napoleon is considered to be one of the most treasured pieces of the museums.
