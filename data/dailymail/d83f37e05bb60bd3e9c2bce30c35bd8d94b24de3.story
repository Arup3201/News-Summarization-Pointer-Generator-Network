A lone piper led a handful of close family mourners today at a church graveyard following a funeral service for the late Ian Paisley in Belfast.

The grieving Paisley family had earlier held a private service at their home in Belfast this morning before the burial in Ballygowan, County Down.

Dr Paisley's successor as North Antrim MP, Ian Jnr, helped carry his coffin from the hearse a few feet into a white tent which covered the newly-dug grave.

Memorial: There was the respectful and hushed atmosphere of a family grieving, and the sound of the pipes carrying across the air

It lies on the brow of a hill overlooking a country road in the hills south of Belfast.

The
 location is a short distance from his home city - a city which once 
reverberated to his oratory and where thousands flocked to hear his 
message.

Today there was only the respectful and hushed atmosphere of a family grieving, and the sound of the pipes carrying across the air.

The private funeral came as 
Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson paid tribute to Dr 
Paisley as the undisputed leader of unionism.

Political
 parties from all sides offered heartfelt thoughts of the churchman and 
politician's legacy at a special sitting of the Stormont Assembly.

As the burial took place at Ballygowan Free Presbyterian Church, Mr Robinson said the founder of the Democratic Unionists was far above all others.

‘Ian Paisley was a remarkable man whose long career in public life has left an indelible mark on all of us who knew him,’ the First Minister said.

Ex-first minister and unionist leader Ian Paisley was a firebrand fundamentalist Protestant preacher.

The polarising figure’s vehement opposition to dealing with the IRA and extreme anti-Catholic rhetoric was well-known.

The bellicose symbol of unionist defiance was famous for bellowing ‘never, never, never’ during a mass protest against Irish government involvement in Northern Ireland affairs in the 1980s. He helped wreck earlier attempts at political accord, became the ultimate protest figure and promised to smash Sinn Fein.

But, in a potent symbol of the ground covered by negotiations which largely ended violence, he entered government with republicans in 2007 as Stormont's first minister after republicans lent their support to the police.

Eventually his partnership with the former IRA commander and current Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at the head of government led to them being dubbed the Chuckle Brothers.

‘The “Big Man”, as he was known, provided firm and decisive leadership when unionism lacked it most and needed it most.’

Mr
 Robinson said the task of remembering and paying lasting tributes to Dr
 Paisley was daunting and that no words could properly do it justice.

A public memorial service will be held later in the year. Books of condolences were opened today in the City Hall in Belfast and also at Stormont.

Dr Paisley died last Friday at the age of 88.

Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said his professional relationship and friendship with Dr Paisley - the source of much irritation in some sections of unionism and republicanism - should provide food for thought with the Stormont Executive dogged by political stalemate.

The Sinn Fein chief said he would leave history to determine Dr Paisley's legacy.

‘I can only talk about my own experience with him,’ Mr McGuinness said. ‘From the word go for some reason we hit it off.

‘We grew to like each other and that, incredible for people undoubtedly who for many decades intensely disliked each other.

‘But we genuinely grew to like each other and in doing so we confounded the world. He certainly made a huge effort.’

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams signed the book of condolence at the City Hall.

‘Many families who suffered the worst excesses of sectarianism may take issue with this, but Ian Paisley is due recognition for reaching agreement with Irish republicans on a peaceful future for all of our people and for the way he fulfilled his role as first minister, alongside Martin McGuinness,’ Mr Adams said.

‘Together they proved that politics can work and that unionists and republicans working together could make political progress and overcome significant political difficulties.’

Mr Adams said Dr Paisley's legacy is a huge challenge for all politicians in Northern Ireland and the current unionist leadership.
