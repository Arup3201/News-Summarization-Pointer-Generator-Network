A death mask made by Madame Tussaud has been used to recreate the likeness of Maximilien de Robespierre - the infamous revolutionary leader.

Madame Tussaud, now known for her world-renown waxworks museum in London, went by her maiden name of Marie Grosholtz when she made the wax sculpture.

During the French Revolution, she was saved from execution by agreeing to create death masks of famous people who met a grisly end by the guillotine.

Reconstruction: Death mask made by Madame Tussaud was used to recreate of Maximilien de Robespierre

Phillipe Froesch, a facial reconstruction expert, has used Madame Tussaud's mask to recreate the face of the leader who started the Reign of Terror that cost tens of thousands of lives in 1793 and 1794.

She took his head from the basket after he was decapitated on July 28, 1794 and the chambermaid's daughter sculpted the likeness.

Madame Tussaud took the original sculpture with her when she went to London in 1802 and copies were made.

One of these copies, in the Museum of Natural History in Aix-en-Provence, southern France, was used by Mr Froesch, the Times reports.

He was asked to recreate Robespierre's face for a documentary about illness that affected famous men and women.

Mapping: Mr Froesch used FBI techniques and it showed Robespierre had a pockmarked face

The facial reconstruction expert used a hand-held 3D scanner to map the scars, spots and fine details on the waxwork then set about recreating the face.

Mr Froesch used FBI mapping techniques and the result showed Robespierre had an extremely pockmarked face and was 'pale and tired'.

He said the result was a 'worrying face' and earlier portraits had made Robespierre look better than he was - probably out of fear.

The expert is well-known in France after he recreated the face of King Henri IV using the 16th century skull and is now working on a project to bring the face of Rene Descartes back to life.

Madame Tussaud learnt her skills from Dr Philippe Curtius and after she arrived in London set up and exhibition of her works in Baker Street.

The collection has continuously grown over the last century and now includes celebrities, monarchy and historical figures.
