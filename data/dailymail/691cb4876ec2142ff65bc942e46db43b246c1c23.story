An underage bellydancer who allegedly slept with former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi posed for photographs as she lay naked on the billionaire's desk, it has been claimed.

The pictures of Moroccan teenager Karima El Mahroug – known as ‘Ruby the heart stealer' - were reportedly found by a Brazilian model, who is expected to be a key prosecution witness in Berlusconi's ongoing trial.

Berlusconi, 75, is accused of having sex with Mahroug at one of his 'bunga bunga' parties when she was 17.

The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying for sex with a woman below the age of 18 is seen as underage 
prostitution and punishable by up to three years in prison.

Prosecutors 
claim that Berlusconi gave a string of women cash, jewellery and 
cars to attend his parties, which he insists were elegant dinners.

Brazilian model Michelle Conceicao, 33, said she found the naked photographs of Mahroug on her own camera while the girl was staying at her flat.

They showed the teenager lying on a desk in Berlusconi's office, 'the one where he did all his interviews, with the framed photographs of his whole family,' the Sunday Times reported.

Miss Conceicao said: 'Ruby was stretched out on top of it, naked as her mum made her and with her legs spread out.

'I told her she was crazy, she said she needed them to blackmail the prime minister and she laughed.'

Miss Conceicao said she was so shocked that she ordered Mahroug to leave the flat.

She
has already told Italian magazine Espresso that the allegation that 
Berlusconi slept with Mahroug at one of his parties was 'true'.

Asked if she saw Berlusconi ‘pay and go to bed with underage girls’, she replied: ‘Certainly that’s true – I was there.’

Miss Conceicao told the magazine ‘All the girls 
who were paid went with him. Those that stayed the night got 5,000 euros
or maybe more, the others who didn’t stay got at the most 1,000 or 
2,000 euros.'

She also claimed that two ‘very 
famous’ names were among Berlusconi’s favourite women and she was 
willing to testify about them when she gives evidence at the trial in Milan later
this month.

She is one of dozens of witnesses due to give evidence at the trial. Others include the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and actor George Clooney.

Berlusconi’s lawyers, Piero Longo and Niccolo Ghedini, ridiculed Miss Conceicao's account, saying it was 'completely baseless and contradicted by Mahroug's statements and by what Conceicao has already said to authorities in Milan.

Berlusconi has 
insisted that nothing untoward happened at his parties and that they 
were merely convivial evenings of 'fine food and music'.

Mahroug also says nothing 
happened between them.

The trial has been going on for a 
year and has already heard from several witnesses who described how 
women would dress as nuns and police officers before stripping off while
performing seductive pole dances for Berlusconi and two of his cronies 
at the parties which took place between 2009 and 2010.

Berlusconi
is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had 
Mahroug freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft by 
wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president 
Hosni Mubarak.

The trial continues and is not expected to finish until the autumn.
