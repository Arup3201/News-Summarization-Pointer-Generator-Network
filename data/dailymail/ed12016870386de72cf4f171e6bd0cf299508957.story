Council officials hope to crack down on antisocial behaviour – by removing fish from a public pond.

Reigate and Banstead Council has removed carp, goldfish and rudd to stop illegal angling.

Burgh Heath pond near Epsom, Surrey, has been targeted by anglers who use the banks for drunken parties.

Drunken parties: Reigate and Banstead Council have taken action after revellers started using Burgh Heath pond, near Epsom in Surrey, for drunken all-night parties

Councillor Joan Spiers said: ‘We get huge amounts of antisocial behaviour, normally associated with night-time fishing.

‘They keep residents awake with noise, shouting and the radio. It’s just not reasonable. They drink, get drunk, have loud music and fight.’

She added: 'We leave 
enough fish for the herons but not enough fish for these thugs to fish. 
They are not all removed because we want them to breed again.'

A council sign at the pond reads: 'Angling is not permitted on the pond.

'Following
 incidents of antisocial behaviour the council, in association with the 
Banstead Commons Conservators and the police, has initiated the removal 
of fish from the pond.

'Please
 be aware that the placing of fish in this body of water without 
permission is illegal. Anybody found doing so is liable of prosecution.'

But local resident Robert Russell, 50, said: ‘That is just an overreaction to a small problem. There are a few lads who I have seen fishing there but they all seemed to be behaving OK.’
