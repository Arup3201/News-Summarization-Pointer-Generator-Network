Google is to make changes to its search engine, directing users away from sites where they can illegal download content. 

The internet company is cracking down on piracy, and has in part, bowed to pressure from the entertainment industry that has argued that illegal sites should appear lower in search results. 

The new measures will see users directed towards legal alternatives such as Spotify and Google Play.

Google will now list these legal services in a box at the top of the search results, as well as in a box on the right-hand side of the page, according to the BBC. 

But if legal sites want to appear in the slot, they will need to pay Google for placement, something music trade group BPI has a problem with. 

Google has also added extra measures to doctor its search results so that links pointing to illegal content fall lower in results, with legal sites appearing higher up.

It has been doing this for several years, but claims it now has 'refined the signal' for detecting these links.

While BPI was pleased with Google changes, it said there shouldn't be any costs associated with providing users with legal services. 

BPI made 43.3 million requests for Google to remove search results in 2013 - the U.S equivilant group, the RIAA, made 31.6 million.

Google removed 222 million results from search because of copyright infringement.

Their Content ID system, which detects copyrighted material, scans 400 years-worth of video every day. 

According to a report on how Google fight piracy, some 300 million videos have been 'claimed' by rights holders. That means Google can place advertising on them.  

YouTube's Content ID system is able to detect the use of copyrighted material in videos - offering music labels the choice of having the content removed, or monetising by having advertising placed there.

In Google's piracy report it stressed its long-held view that the solution to piracy lay in putting effort into creating better legal services, rather than chasing off illegal ones.

'Piracy often arises when consumer demand goes unmet by legitimate supply,' the report said.

'As services ranging from Netflix to Spotify to iTunes have demonstrated, the best way to combat piracy is with better and more convenient legitimate services.' 

Google has been reluctant to tamper with how its search results appear, but following government pressure it has taken some measures to protect content.
