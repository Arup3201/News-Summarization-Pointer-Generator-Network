Robert Colover, who labelled a 13-year-old sex abuse victim as 'predatory', has agreed to resign from the CPS Rape Panel of advocates

A CPS prosecutor who described the teenage victim of a paedophile as sexually 'predatory' has agreed to resign from the Crown Prosecution Service's panel of advocates.

Robert Colover will no longer undertake prosecutions involving serious sexual offences or child abuse, the CPS said today.

The decision came after he admitted his description of the girl as 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced' was inappropriate.

Today the CPS said that after a 
review of the case, director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer QC had 
found the language used to describe the teenager was 'grossly 
inappropriate'.

A spokesman said: 'Counsel in the 
case agreed that he should not have used the expression that he did and 
deeply regretted his choice of words.

'It
was agreed that he would resign from the CPS Rape Panel of advocates 
and will no longer undertake prosecutions involving serious sexual 
offences or child sexual abuse.'

Mr Colover's controversial comments were made during the sentencing of paedophile Neil Wilson at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London last month.

He said the 13-year-old victim 'forced' herself on Wilson, 41, and described her as 'predatory in all her actions' and 'sexually experienced'.

Mr Colover added: 'She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15-year-old. There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing.

‘You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.'

Child protection campaigners branded him a 'disgrace' and called for his dismissal.  They also warned that his 'crass' comments would stop other young victims from coming forward.

The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is said to have found the comments 'deeply inappropriate'
