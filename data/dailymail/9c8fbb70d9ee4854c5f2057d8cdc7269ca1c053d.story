Yorkshire's Gary Ballance has been included in England's 15-man World Cup squad

Alastair Cook has been sacked as England's one-day captain ahead of the World Cup in February

Eoin Morgan will take over as England's one-day captain for the tri-series and the World Cup

Ballance did not feature in the Sri Lanka series, which England lost 5-2, and has not played international one-day cricket since the end of the summer. 

The squad departs on January 6 and will warm-up for the tournament with a tri-series against Australia and India.

Their opening World Cup fixture is against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on February 14. 

National Selector, James Whitaker, said: 'We have had to make some difficult decisions to get to our final squad but firmly believe that the 15 players selected offer the very best chance of success at the World Cup.

Stuart Broad also returns to the squad for the World Cup having missed the recent series in Sri Lanka

'I would like to congratulate all players on their selection and wish Peter, Eoin, and the squad all the very best. 

'Representing England in a World Cup is a huge honour and responsibility, something all the players recognise. 

'There have been a number of promising performances from players in recent series and it is important that this squad continues to develop their one-day skills quickly and players start to show the sort of consistency needed to succeed regularly on the world stage.'

Meanwhile, Jonathan Trott has been named as England Lions captain for their January tour of South Africa.
