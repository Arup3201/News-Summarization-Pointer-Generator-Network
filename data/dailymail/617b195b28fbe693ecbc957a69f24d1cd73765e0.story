The father of a beautiful, 23-year-old Lacoste marketer who was partially beheaded and disemboweled after being stabbed some 30 times by her jilted boyfriend, has told a judge the look of 'terror' on his dead daughter's face will 'haunt me for the rest of my life.'

Lynde Coit, a millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, Connecticut, laid bare his grief at the loss of his daughter, Sarah, in a Manhattan courthouse today, just days after Raul Barrera admitted to the brutal Lower East Side slaying, which left the woman with the blade of a knife still lodged in her skull.

'When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue,' Mr Coit testified, choking with emotion, 'her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.'

Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post.

He read aloud his final text to his daughter - 'Love you,' which he sent as he set off for the city.

But she had already been dead for eight hours, prosecutors said today, and what he saw when he arrived in New York was Miss Coit's once-beautiful face criss-crossed by gashes in the city morgue, her perfect teeth grimacing in pain.

Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos told 
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers, who will decide 
Barrera's fate, that the killer murdered the young marketer with 
'breathtaking viciousness.'

He
also described how neighbours awoke to her screams but heart-wrenchingly 
couldn't work out where to send police, according to The Post.

'There
were so many soul-shattering screams that half-a-dozen New Yorkers got 
out of their beds at 2.30 in the morning,' Bogdanos said.

'These neighbors roamed their hallways, calling, 'Where are you? Where are you?'

Miss
Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan 
neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left 
neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the 
building nextdoor.

As such,
Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police 
finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her 
last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering
the floor.

Barrera, 33, faces anywhere from 15 years to life in prison. Judge Carruthers will pass sentence after hearing evidence from both sides in the coming weeks.

Prosecutors are expected to ask for the maximum sentence - 25 years to life. But defence attorney Paul Feinman is likely to argue that Barrera deserves a reduced sentence because of mental health issues.

Miss Coit was killed on Sunday April 8 after a heated row that woke the neighbourhood.

'It was pure anger,' one source said. 'He didn't want her to leave, and he didn't want her to be beautiful for anyone.'

Brianna Andalore, 20, said she heard screams of 'No, no. 
Stop, stop. Don't hurt me' through the walls of an apartment she was 
staying in.

Another 
neighbour said: 'When she was brought out, the cops were yelling, "Don't
look Don't look", her head was almost off. Her neck was wide open.'

Assistant District Attorney William Beesch said: 'His father told him to turn himself in.'

Public relations worker Barrera has since been held without bail.

Sources close to the investigation said that after being picked up by police, Barrera said: 'I did something bad.'

Joost Bohner, 33, said, 'I heard her yelling, "Help me, Help me." It went on for quite a while, at least 20 minutes.

'People
from the building were yelling out, "Where are you, What apartment?" 
She never answered them, and people started calling 911.'

Miss
Coit was found face up on the living room floor with several stab 
wounds and the gaping neck wound, sources said. She survived long enough
to be taken to hospital, but died an hour later.

An autopsy revealed that the former high school athlete was killed by a stab in the back which left internal organs protruding.

Prosecutors revealed that Barrera, who was arrested 
last year on unrelated assault charges, was on his way to Penn Station 
to make his escape when he called his father.

Miss Coit had been studying 
marketing at Hunter College. Her father, Lynde Coit is a 
Cornell-educated lawyer and the family live in a $1.4 million home in 
Greenwich.

Speaking to the 
Post, a woman who lives nearby said: 'She was a bright, young, wonderful
girl. She had a bright future ahead of her. She has the most wonderful 
family you could imagine.'
