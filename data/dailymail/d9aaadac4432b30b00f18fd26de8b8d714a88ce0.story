There can be few things more annoying for the keen gardener than greenflies munching away on your prized roses.

But for those not keen on using chemical pesticides, one gardening expert has come up with a solution – delivering live ladybirds to your door.

Sarah Raven, a guest presenter on Gardener’s World, has started selling the insects through her website, sarahraven.com

Tackling the problem: A ladybird feeds on greenfly, pests which feed at plants

The ladybirds are put into tubes where they live happily on a diet of popcorn or cereal while being delivered by first class post.

Mrs Raven said: ‘Ladybirds are brilliant in the garden because they feed off green and black fly, as well as other insect pests who would otherwise be munching on your home-grown flowers and produce.

‘They are a chemical-free alternative to pesticides, so are great for the organic gardener.

‘They will get rid of pests without affecting your crops or being harmful to other wildlife.

‘They are sent by first class post in their own little box which contains a packed lunch of popcorn or cereal to keep them happy.

‘On the day that they arrive they should be stored somewhere cool until the late evening when they can be released out into the garden.’

Once established, they should start breeding – and help solve your greenfly problems for years to come.

Mrs Raven, who runs a gardening school at her farm in Sussex, said: ‘Releasing ladybirds should lead to a permanent decrease in the number of pests in your garden – each ladybird will eat about 500 aphids (greenfly) and will soon produce ladybird larvae which in turn also eat aphids.’

The ladybirds will be available from May until August.
