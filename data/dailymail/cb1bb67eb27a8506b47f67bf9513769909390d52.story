More snow and ice is expected to hit northern Britain today – while the South is set to enjoy unseasonably warm temperatures.

Rain in the North was expected to turn to snow overnight last night, with up to an inch set to fall on higher ground in the Peak District and Lake District.

The Met Office has issued ice warnings for this morning covering most of Scotland.

But while Scotland and northern England could also see 50mph winds, southern England can look forward to unseasonably mild temperatures of up to 13C (55F) over the weekend.

Met Office forecaster Alister McHardy said: ‘We have an Atlantic weather system coming in from the West which is going to bring some outbreaks of rain to the North West.

‘We can also expect to see some quite heavy spells of snow on higher ground on Saturday, mostly across the North in areas such as the Peak District and the Lake District – a few centimetres in some areas.

‘We are also likely to see rainfall up to 15 millimetres on higher grounds in Wales.

‘But areas such as Devon, Cornwall and Hampshire can expect to see very mild conditions for the time of year.’

Forecasters have issued a yellow warning of ice for Scotland until 10am today, warning of ‘difficult driving conditions’. But tomorrow’s temperatures are likely to be milder in northern Britain.

While rain is expected on Monday, next week will see the unseasonably mild weather continue, with highs of up to 13C (55F) in the South West, forecasters said.

New Year’s Day saw near record-breaking temperatures of 15.1C (59.2F) at Murlough in County Down, Northern Ireland.

The record was set in 1916, when Bude in Cornwall recorded 15.6C (60.1F) on January 1.
