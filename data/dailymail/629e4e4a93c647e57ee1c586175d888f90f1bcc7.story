Lewis Thelwall, 19, who killed himself after being bullied on Facebook - the coroner warned of the dangers of online bullying

Two young women have been cautioned by police after a young man who was being bullied online hanged himself.

At the inquest into the death of 19-year-old Lewis Thelwall, who committed suicide after false rumours about him were put on Facebook, a coroner warned users of social networking sites to 'think of the consequences'.

Philip Rogers, coroner for Neath and Port Talbot, said the two women had written 'malicious and completely unfounded' posts about 'colourful' Mr Thelwall on the site.

The inquest into the death of the budding photographer from Port Talbot who was known for dyeing his hair bright colours heard how he was targeted by others who posted false rumours about him online.

Police studied his Facebook messages to discover 'malicious and completely unfounded' allegations against Mr Thelwall, the inquest heard.

Detective Constable Lee Stephens, of South Wales police, described Mr Thelwall as a 'happy-go-lucky character' who was upset at Facebook slurs.

He said he interviewed several young people after Mr Thelwall's death and investigated the Facebook comments before cautioning two young women, who can't be identified for legal reasons, for malicious communication.

Det Con Stephens said: 'The two have apologised for their actions.'

The coroner said there was a 'long and complicated' story involving Facebook messages which he could 'only describe as Facebook bullying'.

He added: 'I would urge anyone who uses this sort of social media to think of the consequences.'

Mr Rogers said comments made online caused Mr Thelwall, who was originally from Swindon but moved to Wales when he was nine, great distress.  He said the effect was exacerbated because Mr Thelwall was vulnerable after the death of his father.

The coroner said: 'Two young women known to Lewis have taken it upon themselves to make entries on Facebook which they now accept as malicious and completely unfounded.

'Sadly he was a young man who was vulnerable because of the death of his father.

'The two young women have accepted their responsibility for these messages.  They accepted they had little idea of what affect it would have on Lewis.'

Mr Rogers said he was satisfied that Mr Thelwall, who was studying forensics and photography when he died on 26 November last year, hanged himself and recorded a verdict of suicide.

Mr Thelwall's mother Tina Thelwall also warned against online bullying, saying: 'Be careful what you write.

'Behind closed doors you don’t know what is going on. They did not understand what Lewis was going through.'

Reverend Matthew Trick of St Paul's church in Aberavon, which Mr Thelwall's family attended, said the young man was 'thought of very highly'.

He said: 'He fell in love with photography and was inseparable from his camera.'

More than 200 people joined the RIP Lewis Facebook group set up in Mr Thelwall's memory, and described him as 'charming', 'cheeky', 'warm-hearted' and 'fun'.
