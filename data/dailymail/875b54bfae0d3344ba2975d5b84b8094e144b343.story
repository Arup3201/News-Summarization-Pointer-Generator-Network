Amazing drone footage has captured the trail of destruction left by a rockfall in northern Italy.

Approximately 4,000 cubic metres of rock broke off a cliff face and then crashed through a barn and vineyards in Tramin on January 21.

One giant rock rolled through a 300-year-old barn destroying it completely before coming to an eventual stop in a field near a second boulder, which seems to have been dislodged in a previous rockslide.

A third boulder rolled toward the main section of the building, stopping mere metres before crashing into it.

The property shown in the video is The Freisingerhof, which is owned by the Servite order of the Catholic church.

The manager of the estate Baron Philipp von Hohenb√ºhel told South Tirol News  that the rockfall has done millions of euros worth of damage.

No one was hurt in the landslide, which was reportedly caused by a rock tower in the cliff face dissolving.

The area has been evacuated of residents, as geologists fear there is still the risk of further rock falls.
