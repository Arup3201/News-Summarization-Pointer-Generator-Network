England narrowly lost 20-15 to New Zealand after a late try by Conrad Smith extended the Kiwi's unbeaten run at Eden Park to 20 years.

Here, Sportsmail's Chris Foy rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which England players deserve to start next week's second Test in Dunedin.

ENGLAND

Mike Brown - 7Not his stellar best, often double tackled, but strong and feisty.

VERDICT: Must start in Dunedin

Strength: Mike Brown wasn't at his best, but was a constant source of power for England

Marland Yarde - 7

Tidy all-round game but rightly yellow carded late in second half.

VERDICT: Did enough to stay in

Manu Tuilagi - 8

Looks fit, fresh and hungry. Big threat to New Zealand defence.

VERDICT: I want him on left wing

Kyle Eastmond - 7

Some really nice touches, laid down a marker for the future.

VERDICT: Billy Twelvetrees if fit

Too strong: Manu Tuilagi (centre) is stopped by the All Black defence during the Test match

Jonny May - 6

Curate’s egg. Some good moments, must adapt to Test pace.

VERDICT: Move Tuilagi to the wing

Freddie Burns - 7

Composed, kicked his goals and justified Lancaster’s confidence.

VERDICT: Farrell to start if fit

In the mix: Both Kyle Eastmond and Freddie Burns were in impressive form at Eden Park

Ben Youngs - 6

Busy against top opponent. Second fumble nearly cost England dear.

VERDICT: Danny Care returns if fit

Substitutes - 7

Not a massive factor but Cipriani got on the front foot and kicked his penalty with aplomb.

Joe Marler - 7

Solid evening’s work and that short fuse seemed well under control.

VERDICT: Good to go again

Battle: Joe Marler (centre) is tackled by Liam Messam (left) and Richie McCaw during England's defeat

Rob Webber - 7

A standout effort. Good in the tight and line-out, extra option in loose.

VERDICT: Dylan Hartley to return

David Wilson - 6

Strong in scrum but oddly prone to fumbles for a good handler.

VERDICT: Good to go again

Joe Launchbury - 7

Good in the line-out, worked with calm efficiency. So reliable.

VERDICT: One of the first names on the team sheet

Safe hands: Joe Launchbury was strong in the line-out on Saturday

Geoff Parling - 7

Fine return after long time out of Tests. Ran line-out intelligently.

VERDICT: Lawes to come back

James Haskell - 7

Finished strongly for Wasps and maintained that form here.

VERDICT: Tom Wood is first choice

Chris Robshaw (capt) - 8

One of his best performances - and against McCaw as well.

VERDICT: Will lead from front again

Ben Morgan - 7

Very fine effort, carried very well and gave England go-forward.

VERDICT: ...but Vunipola returns

Leader: England skipper Chris Robshaw (centre) put in one of his best performances

NEW ZEALAND

Israel Dagg - 6

One slashing run in attack but unusually error-prone for such a quality player.

Ben Smith - 7

Made up for earlier handling errors with that brilliant try-scoring pass at the death.

Conrad Smith - 8

The old head knew exactly what was required in the 79th minute to score his try.

Experienced: Conrad Smith scored the crucial 79th minute try for New Zealand

Ma’a Nonu - 6

Not at his best by any means. Should have been yellow-carded for shirt-tugging early on.

Cory Jane - 6

Quiet night, few chances to shine, which is a testament to England’s pressure game.

Aaron Cruden - 7

Not without error but a very accomplished stand-in for the resting Dan Carter.

Aaron Smith - 8

Livewire, clever kicker, speedy delivery. New Zealand’s best player on the night.

Star man: Aaron Smith of the All Blacks was one of the best players on the pitch at Eden Park

Tony Woodcock - 6

Veteran World Cup-winning prop but England had the better of the front-row exchanges.

Dane Coles - 6

Has bulked up but still struggling at scrum time. New Zealand scrum improved when he departed.

Owen Franks - 6

Had his hands full in the tight and not seen in the loose as much as usual.

Missing: Dane Coles (centre) struggled to impose himself when it came to scrum time

Brodie Retallick - 7

Made that long second-half break and considerable line-out force. Good player.

Sam Whitelock - 7

Unsung workhorse as ever but tough going against an aggressive England pack.

Stopped: England managed Richie McCaw well and kept the New Zealand captain relatively quiet

Liam Messam - 6

Came second-best to England at the tackle area. Could drop out if Read returns.

Richie McCaw (capt) - 7

Quiet by his immense standards. England power at breakdown helped negate him.

Jerome Kaino - 7

Not a natural No 8. Great athlete and driving force - but at blindside flanker.

England captain Chris Robshaw was at his very best against New Zealand

Stuart Lancaster's side fought valiantly but were beaten in the final stages

Manu Tuilagi will be giving the All Blacks nightmares ahead of Dunedin
