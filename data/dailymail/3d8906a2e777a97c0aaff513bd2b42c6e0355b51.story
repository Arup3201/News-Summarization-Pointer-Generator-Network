Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga troubles continued on Sunday with a 2-0 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt that left the 2011 and 2012 champions bottom of the table after 13 games.

Alexander Meier's fourth-minute strike and Haris Seferovic's goal in the 78th were enough to inflict Dortmund with their eighth defeat of the season.

Meier got the home side off to a flying start when he ran onto Marco Russ's long clearance and clipped the ball past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.

A defensive mix-up between Weidenfeller and Matthias Ginter allowed Seforovic to clinch the result. Ginter headed the ball back to the Dortmund captain, only to find he had emerged from goal, and the grateful Seferovic made no mistake.

Frankfurt reserve keeper Felix Wiedwald produced a host of saves at the other end as the home side climbed to ninth.

The 24-year-old Wiedwald, playing because of an injury to Kevin Trapp, denied Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Kevin Grosskreutz almost equalized in the 24th minute when he struck the post on the rebound from Aubameyang's effort. 

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp vowed he would continue fighting to turn the side's domestic season around. 

'I consider myself fully responsible,' said Klopp. 'There's no tendency (for a coaching change) here. Until someone comes along and tells me otherwise, I can't go away. I can't go until there's a better solution.

 'If it was only based on luck, and if a coaching change was guaranteed to bring the luck back, then I would make the way free.'

Dortmund defender Lukasz Piszczek went off with a thigh injury in the 38th, when Juergen Klopp opted to send on Adrian Ramos, a forward.

Ramos also found Wiedwald in inspired form.

Meier missed two good chances before Seferovic sealed Dortmund's fate.
