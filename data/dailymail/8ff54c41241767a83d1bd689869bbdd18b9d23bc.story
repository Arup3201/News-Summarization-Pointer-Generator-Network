The Duchess of Cambridge is considering giving birth at a hospital near her family home, friends have said

The Duchess of Cambridge is considering giving birth at a hospital near her family home, it has been reported.

It had been expected that the Royal baby would be born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington.

It is where Princess Diana gave birth to the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

But friends of Kate Middleton have said she and her family want the baby to be born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where she and her sister Pippa were born.

A source told the Telegraph: 'Their thinking is that she will be based at her parents’ house during the later stages of her pregnancy and they do not want her to have to travel miles to Paddington when she goes into labour.'

The Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading has recently opened a  £3 million, assisted by Marcus Setchell.

It has been reported that Kate intends to 
live at her parents house in Bucklebury for the first six weeks
after the birth. The baby is due in July.

Kate was treated for severe morning sickness at the private King Edward VII Hospital, in Marylebone.

During her stay two radio presenters called the hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.

Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put through the call through, killed herself days later.

It is not thought the tragedy has formed part of Kate's decision making process.

Asbestos has been discovered at the couple's Kensington Palace apartment and is currently being cleared from the property.

Kate – who is six months pregnant – told guests at a recent reception that she had chosen a buggy by designer label Bugaboo, which has celebrity fans including actress Sienna Miller and television presenter Peaches Geldof.

The buggies, which cost from £500 to £1,000 and can operate as either a pushchair or pram, come in a variety of colours and parents who do not know the sex of their baby usually prefer neutral hues such as beige, off-white or black.

The Duke and Duchess have insisted that they do not know if they are having a boy or a girl.

But although it is possible to swap some of the buggy’s accessories for those in different colours, including pink, Kate’s choice of blue will be seen as a  clear hint as to her feelings about the gender.

She has said she would prefer a son while William wants a daughter.

Yesterday, Bugaboo said it had not presented the buggy to the Royal couple after being advised by officials not to send gifts.

So it appears that Kate, who was seen shopping for a Moses basket in South Kensington last week with her mother, bought the pram herself.

The Duchess, 31, revealed the Bugaboo colour when she chatted to a group of Army wives at a drinks reception in Aldershot on St Patrick’s Day.
