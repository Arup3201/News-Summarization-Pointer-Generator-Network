A celebrity-backed campaign to keep bluefin tuna off dinner plates and in the sea is reaping environmental rewards.

Scientists claim that the endangered fish population is showing signs of recovery, but warn there is still much to do to preserve the species for future generations.

Populations of the tuna remain at historically low levels, but the numbers of Atlantic bluefin are rising for the first time in decades.

Scientists claim that the endangered bluefin tuna fish population is showing signs of recovery, but warn there is still much to do to preserve the species for future generations. A shoal of the fish is shown in the Mediterranean sea, off the coast of Turkey

The gourmet fish fell victim to over fishing and, in a bid to save it, celebrities including Sienna Miller, Elle Macpherson and Stephen Fry, called for an end to the practice, with Emilia Fox and Terry Gilliam going so far as to pose naked with fish to grab attention for the sustainable fishing campaign, Fish love.

They were reportedly inspired to act after watching a film called The End of the Line, which was the first to expose over fishing and featured bluefin tuna being caught in the Mediterranean.

Earlier this week, the scientific committee for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) met in Madrid, Spain to assess the situation of the bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

In 2009, the commission reported that stocks had declined  by 72 per cent in the Eastern Atlantic, and 82 per cent in the west over 40 years.

Now, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has said the fish is ‘no longer at risk of collapse’.

ICCAT experts found that management efforts developed in recent years have resulted in an increase in population size, even including the possibility that the stock might soon recover to sustainable levels - the so-called Maximum Sustainable Yield level - MSY.

Bluefin tuna - Thunnus spp - can weigh up to 1,500lbs and grow to between 6ft (1.8 metres) and 10ft (3 metres) long.

They live in the east and west of the Atlantic Ocean, but are now extinct in the Black Sea.

Throughout history, the fish has been a prized food and large fish are targeted for the Japanese raw fish market, which are used to make gourmet sushi.

The commercial importance of the species has led to overfishing.

ICAAT said in 2009 that stocks had declined over 40 years by 72 per cent in the Eastern Atlantic, and 82 per cent in the west.

In 2010, measures were taken to restrict the number of fish being caught.

Dr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean, said: ‘In spite of the high uncertainties surrounding the assessment, one thing appears clear today: the stock is no longer at risk of collapse, and this is a direct result of the current recovery plan.

‘However, strong concerns remain, particularly regarding the traceability of the fish.’

‘We might be very close to what would be a resounding success in the history of fisheries, the dream of a sustainable bluefin tuna fishery in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic - let’s hope the lessons of the past have been fully learned and that - at least this time - history doesn’t repeat itself.’

There are two main stocks of Bluefin tuna. 

The larger of the two is in the Eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea and the smaller lies in the western part of the ocean such as the Gulf of Mexico, The Independent reported. 

The most dramatic signs of a recovery have been seen in the eastern waters of the Atlantic. 

A WWF spokesman said: 'The stock [of bluefin tuna] is no longer at risk of collapse, and this is a direct result of the current recovery plan.' Here, one of the mighty fish is tagged so scientists can learn more about it
