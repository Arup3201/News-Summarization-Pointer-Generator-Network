Police are hunting thieves who stole the bronze statue of a Second World War soldier from a memorial in a military town.

The one-off statue, commissioned for the garrison town of Tidworth, Wiltshire, was taken by two men to sell on as scrap metal.

Grainy CCTV footage shows two crooks taking 40 minutes to remove the sculpture from its plinth. They then carry it to their light-coloured car before speeding off.

Disgusting: The Tidworth war memorial was paid for with £15,000 from the Royal British Legion but it has now been stolen for scrap metal

It is estimated the 4ft-high memorial, which was made 13 years ago and stands outside the Royal British Legion building, is worth £10,000. Its loss is the latest in a series of metal thefts up and down the country which have seen historic buildings targeted as well as power and rail companies.

Legion secretary Ann Green said the callous theft was ‘unbelievable’.

She said: ‘I think someone knew exactly what they were doing and exactly how much they would get for it when they took it.

‘I don’t think we will get it back now and Remembrance Sunday is in just two weeks. That means we will have a service around the plinth it was on.

Saddened: Ann Green, the secretary of the Royal British Legion in Tidworth, holds a miniature bronze replica of the statue which had been the focus of memorial ceremonies in the Wiltshire town

‘It was a statue of a Second World War soldier with his kit bag.

‘It
 is meant to be that he has just come back from a battle. It is very 
important to the community – we are a very strong military town. 
Everyone here is in complete disbelief – no one can believe that someone
 would steal a remembrance statue because of what it is.

Scrap metal theft across the UK has hit almost epidemic proportions.

Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment.

Britain's railways and power supply companies are some of the hardest hit as metal prices continue to attract thieves looking for fast cash.

Rail companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number of thefts 'is huge'.

As police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act.

The coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders down. 

Minister are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy.

It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year.

‘I
 think the motive was to steal it for scrap and get the money. We paid 
£10,000 for it in 1998 but now I think the bronze will be worth more 
than that.’

The
 statue, by sculptor Vivien Mallock, was insured for £10,000, but the 
rising price of metal means this will not cover the cost of replacing 
it.

The theft occurred on October 17, between 2.40am and 3.19am, with the thieves heading north on the A338.

Sergeant Mark Freeman, from Wiltshire Police, said: ‘The statue is a one-off commissioned sculpture with a monetary value of £10,000, but its actual worth to the community is much more as a tribute and war memorial.’

The theft comes just a day after a bronze plaque was reported stolen from a war memorial in London.

The plaque, measuring two feet by three feet, was taken from Radnor Gardens, Twickenham, last week. It shows a naval scene with two officers surveying the horizon while a rating works on the lower deck.

Council leaders have vowed to replace it and have erected temporary CCTV cameras at the site.

Leader of Richmond Council, Lord 
True, appealed for its return saying: 'It is appalling that thieves have
 damaged the war memorial so close to Remembrance Sunday.

'Anyone who knows who is responsible 
and has any feeling for those in our armed forces still putting their 
lives on the line should turn these people in.'

Also last week, the lead roof of one of the most significant medieval ecclesiastical ruins in Britain was stolen.

Police are investigating how thieves managed to remove 64 square feet of lead from the roof of the Bishop’s Palace in Lincoln.

Lincolnshire Police have appealed for
 witnesses to the audacious theft and have confirmed that the lead was 
marked and therefore should be able to be identified and traced.

English Heritage officials, who look 
after and maintain the palace, have warned that the 'current theft 
epidemic is one of the biggest threats to this country's heritage.'

The organisation has already increased security measures at the medieval palace following metal thefts earlier this year.

As far back as July, thieves stole a 
huge bronze statue from Victoria Pier in Hull. ‘Voyage’ stood 6ft tall 
and weighed nearly 50 stone.

In the summer the popular tourist attraction, Blackpool's model village, was targeted.

A spokesman for the town's civic trust said at the time: 'The small lead roof tiles on the miniature houses were stolen. The metal thieves are taking everything, I've never known anything like it.'

Almost a quarter of the county of Hertfordshire was cut adrift from its broadband connection last year because of the theft of telecoms cable.

Meanwhile Lambeth Council in London had to close a library after it was flooded in heavy rain because it's copper roof had been stripped by theives.

In June James Sorby, 22, was burnt so badly 
that his daughter was unable to recognise him. He had been trying to 
take cabling from an electricity sub-station in a disused Post Office 
sorting room in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

But before he could even touch the cable, a massive charge jumped a gap to his 
body and he suffered severe 
burns to his face and hands, a weakened heart, lost partial sight in his left
eye and lost movement in one of his hands.

Thieves stole a two and a half ton bell from a cathedral in San Francisco. A spate of metal theftshas swept the city and the rest of the US thanks to the hike in global metal prices.

The bell, five feet in diameter weighing in at 5300 pounds was expected to be sold off for scrap after being taken from The Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in the city.

Church officials believe the bell is worth $75,000 but it on the open market as scrap metal it mayonly fetch a fraction of its worth, perhaps for as little as $10,000.

Metal prices have soared in recent months sparking a rise in thefts in the UK and the US.

If the bell were fully made of copper and not its copper and tin mix it would fetch $19,000 at currentinflated copper prices.

Investigating officers are still puzzled as to how the massive bell was moved.
