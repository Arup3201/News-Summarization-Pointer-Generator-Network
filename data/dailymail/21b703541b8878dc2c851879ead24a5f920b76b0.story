Here's the deal: Rahat explains in the video opening about this homeless man who hangs out not far from a convenience store

Rahat says he heard that a homeless man in his neighborhood was a 'nice and respectable guy,' so he decided to do something nice and capture it on camera.

'Listen man, I don't really have any money to give you but I do have this winning lottery ticket,' he told the unsuspecting man, caleld Eric, who was sitting on the curb in a hooded sweatshirt.

'I don't really know how much I won. … I can give this to you. I can take you to the store and we can get this cashed.'

The two walked into a local store to check the ticket.

Disbelief: Eric, the homeless man, cannot believe his luck as he is told he has won $1,000

Paying out: Rahat got the store clerk to pretend that it was a winning ticket and to give $1,000 cash to the homeless man

It's a winner! 'Oh my gosh. Guess what? You won $1,000 dollars,' the clerk said. 'You¿re kidding me right? You¿re kidding me right?' the homeless man said.

Contemplation: Rahat looked on as the man thought about what had just happened

Once inside the convenience store, the homeless man handed the ticket to the clerk. “Oh my gosh. Guess what? You won $1,000 dollars,” the clerk said.

'You're kidding me right?' Eric asked in disbelief.

The clerk took out the cash and promptly counted off 10 $100 bills before handing it to him.

What the homeless man didn't know was the ticket was actually a losing ticket, and the clerk was also in on the surprise.

On learning he has 'won' $1,000 he is understandably stunned and  immediately offers to share his winnings.

'I want to share it,' he said. 'This right here is enough for me. I would like to share it with you, big guy.'

When Rahat told him to keep it all, the man broke down in tears and hugged his new friend. Rahat also appeared to get teary-eyed in the video.

Some comments under the original video suggested Rahat had only made the short film to get advertising revenue from YouTube.

'In my opinion this is all about using a homeless person to generate monetized views on YouTube,' wrote one viewer.

Just for publicity: Some comments under the original video suggested Rahat had only made the short film to get advertising revenue from YouTube

Others thought the clip could be a fake, with another comment reading 'Come on, these are actors! Don't believe the hype...it's all made up professionally.'

Another blog, Hypervocal, looked at the video with a healthy dose of cynicism.

'The scope of YouTubers who are building their #personal #brands by seemingly casting homeless people in their springboards to instant viral fame, and there may be something more troubling at play here.

This leap to fame online has quickly developed into a genre: Helping the homeless with the world watching has become one of the web’s easiest ways to get noticed.

To be sure, these YouTubers are actually helping individuals in the short term. That’s commendable. But there’s very little follow-through, nor public concern for what comes next,' the website commented.
