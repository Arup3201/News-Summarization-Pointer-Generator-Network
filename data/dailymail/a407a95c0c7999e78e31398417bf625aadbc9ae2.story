Alex Salmond's ministers have bullied and threatened business leaders in an attempt to stop them speaking out against independence, according to damning claims to be broadcast in a TV documentary.

Tonight's episode of Dispatches on Channel 4 will air claims from a former boss of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) that his staff were told to stay out of the independence debate by SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson.

The claims will reignite a heated debate about intimidation, only days after Prime Minister David Cameron accused the Nationalists of making 'threats and warnings' to businesses.

First Minister Alex Salmond faces claims the pro-independence campaign has put pressure on companies not to support the Union

Gavin Hewitt, former chief executive of the SWA, told the programme: 'Angus Robertson and the SNP have regularly tried to get the message to the SWA that the Scotch whisky industry should stay out of the independence debate.

'He was, I think, trying to neuter business comment. There was a genuine fear that if we were seen to come out publicly against independence, there would be retribution down the track.'

Five major figures in Scotland's business community told the programme they were contacted by the Scottish Government and 'felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views'.

Of the five, one claimed they had been visited by ministers, two claimed they had received a phone call from a minister and two claimed they had received a call from Alex Salmond's office. A further 14 claimed to know of other businesses which felt under pressure. 

Lord Sutherland, former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University, also told the programme some of those running Scottish universities had come under pressure to stay out of the debate.

An independent Scotland could face higher interest rates that would add hundreds of pounds to mortgage payments, it was claimed last night.

In an interview with BBC economics editor Robert Peston, Mike Amey of investment firm Pimco said rates of government borrowing for a separate Scotland could be higher.

Pimco is the world's biggest investor in government bonds and, as such, the world's biggest lender to governments.

'Our best estimate, assuming a reasonably even split of assets and liabilities, would be the interest rate paid by a Scottish government would be between 0.5 and 1 per cent more than the UK Government currently pays,' Mr Amey said.

'Higher borrowing would reduce the Scottish Government's net income by up to 1 per cent.' The rate would rise because an independent Scotland would have no borrower track record.

Blair McDougall, chief executive of the Better Together campaign, said: 'An increase of 1 per cent on interest rates would put the average Scottish mortgage up by £1,300 and add around £120 a year to household credit card, catalogue and store card bills.' 

But a spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said Scotland was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, more prosperous per head than the UK, France and Japan and would be able to end Westminster's cuts and austerity.

At the weekend, Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse urged the Scottish and UK governments to pledge that academics who enter the referendum debate will not be penalised for expressing their views.

Tonight's Dispatches episode also includes:

Evidence that Finance Secretary John Swinney seized on the CBI's decision to back the No campaign to put pressure on public sector bodies to quit the organisation, as reported in the Scottish Daily Mail.

Documents which show British embassies around the world have been briefed about the UK Government's opposition to independence, as first revealed by the Mail.

Another intervention from Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics, who has renewed his attack on the Treasury for suggesting start-up costs for separation could be £2.7billion, describing the document that included this figure as a 'dodgy dossier'.

Although many business leaders have broken their silence, such as the heads of B&Q, Barrhead Travel and BP, there are continuing claims others fear they will face abuse or put their firms at risk if they speak out. 

Mr Hewitt told Dispatches he or senior members of his staff met Mr Robertson on at least six occasions over the past two years.

He said: 'Regardless of whether the SNP win or lose the referendum vote in September, they will be in power for many years to come and that those people who have stood against them or worked against the central plank of their policy, independence, will be singled out and will be remembered.'

Earlier this year, Mr Hewitt's successor, David Frost, used a dinner with the media - including the Scottish Daily Mail - to raise fears that losing access to the UK's diplomatic service could harm Scotland's most vital export industry.

Last night, Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'If the Scottish Government has been caught threatening and bullying businesses, then that is a disgraceful indictment on Alex Salmond and other senior SNP officials.'

But the Scottish Government said Mr Hewitt's claims were false. In a statement, it said: 'Angus Robertson, as the [Moray] constituency MP representing more than half of Scotland's malt whisky distilleries, regularly meets with the Scotch Whisky Association on industry regulation and taxation.'

A spokesman added: 'Businesses on both sides of the debate have been open in making their views known and we encourage all views to the debate on Scotland's future.'

Addressing Professor Dunleavy's comments to Dispatches, the spokesman said: 'This programme will make uncomfortable viewing for the No campaignand the UK Government.

'This is not the first time Westminster has been accused of producing a "dodgy dossier" in an attempt to mislead the public.'

Parade uniforms: The blue and tartan outfit will be worn by Scottish athletes at the opening ceremony

Scotland's Commonwealth Games athletes will open their home competition in a striking combination of light blue and tartan.

The eye-popping parade uniforms, designed by internationally known textile designer and artist Jilli Blackwood, were unveiled on Sunday. They will be used during the opening ceremony.

The uniforms are a stark contrast to Team GB's all-white dress for the opening ceremony of London 2012.
