A Pennsylvania couple have had a Christmas they will never forget.

Mother-of-two Courtney Stash, 25, was not due until February, but had been in the hospital since December 20 experiencing labor pains.

But at 10.30am Thursday, her babies were ready to come into the world.

Identical twin girls Claire and Avaree were born via cesarean, along with brother Eoin.

Welcome to the world: Little Eoin and his two twin sisters were born on Christmas Day at Hershey Medical Center. Eoin needed a breathing apparatus for the first 24 hours because of some fluid in his lungs

Intensive care: The babies - pictured here is Claire - remain in the neonatal intensive care unit

Precious: The triplets will be released from the unit once they can regulate their own blood sugars and body temperatures

They weighed 3 pounds 8 ounces, 3 pounds 10 ounces and 4 pounds 4 ounces, respectively, Penn Live reported.

The twins were born without any real issues, however Eoin had some fluid in his lungs.

Doctors removed the machine that was helping him breath on Friday, allowing the boy's father, Justin Dwyer, 26, to see his son for the first time.

'I was about to cry,' Dwyer told Penn Live. 

'It was the first time I saw his face without the mask and all the tubes. He was so cute.'

Happy parents: Justin Dwyer said he fell in love with his partner, Courtney Stash, because of her calmness

Big family: The couple are now raising five children, with Stash already having two from a previous relationship

The babies remain in the the neonatal intensive care unit at Hershey Medical Center, but will be released once they can regulate their own blood sugars and body temperatures.

Dwyer, a dairy farmer, admitted to being somewhat worried when the ultrasound showed they were having three children.

However he said Stash was fine with the news, adding that her calmness in the face of anything is why he fell in love with her.

Stash has two other children, aged five and two, who live with the couple.
