Nu Skin's co-founder has been arrested for allegedly harassing an 18-year-old woman her husband is accused of raping.

Nedra McKell, who started the skin care company in the 1980s, was allegedly constantly 'pestering' and 'harassing' the teen victim so she would drop the charges, court documents claim.

The charges stem from the case against her husband, Robert Clark McKell from Springville, Utah, who faces three first-degree felony charges for rape and sodomy.

Prosecutors claim that McKell sexually assaulted the woman even after she told him 'no', the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Arrest: Nedra McKell, who co-founded skin care company Nu Skin in the 1980s, has been accused of harassing an 18-year-old woman her husband allegedly raped in a bid to make her drop the charges

Robert McKell has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is scheduled for February.

As well as allegedly harassing the victim, Nedra McKell, 52, even drove her to Robert Mckell, which violated a protective order against him, according to court documents.

The documents add that the McKells have completely isolated the woman and have used family members to cut her off from friends.

Nedra McKell appeared in court on the charges on Thursday and a judge prohibited her from 
contacting the woman. Her next hearing is scheduled for January
27.

She co-founded Nu Skin, a company that sells anti-aging products and tchnologies, in 1984 after her brother encouraged her to develop skin-care products that did not contain any fillers.

Her brother persuaded a Texas company to make the products and they began selling them from McKee's basement - before becoming a multimillion-dollar company within years.

Company: She founded Nu Skin, a skin care and nutritional supplements company, but left a few years later

She left the company in the late 1980s and is no longer a major shareholder.

In 1996, she entered into a plea and abeyance agreement in a case involving insurance and prescription drug fraud, the Tribune reported. She was sentenced to three years probation.

After the death of her husband in 1994, McKell reportedly became reliant on precription painkillers and was hospitalized in 1995 after overdosing.

She has eight children - seven of whom are adopted. At the time of her charges in the 1990s, she had been divorced three times and had had four marriages annulled.
