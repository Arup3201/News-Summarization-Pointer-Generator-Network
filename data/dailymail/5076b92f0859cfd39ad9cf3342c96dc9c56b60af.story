Johnny Manziel admitted he must earn his playing time after being named as Cleveland's back-up quarterback behind Brian Hoyer.

The Browns selected Manziel from Texas A&M with the No 22 pick in the NFL draft, and the rookie has been in the headlines for his off-field partying this summer.

Cleveland head coach Mike Pettine confirmed on Wednesday that Hoyer would start at quarterback for the Browns in their season opener at the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 7.

Manziel accepted his position as back-up and acknowledged that he must improve.

He told ESPN.com: 'I need to earn everything for me to get in.

'Nothing should be given to me, I completely understand that. I need to continue to come in here every day and get better and be around these guys and let them know who I am and how I am.

Manziel landed himself in hot water when he gave a middle-finger salute to the Washington Redskins bench during a pre-season game on Monday night.

The rookie was filmed making the obscene gesture in a game that was televised live in America under ESPN's Monday Night Football banner.

Manziel added: 'He (Coach Pettine) said they were going with Brian and, obviously, to make the most of every rep that I'm getting ... and you'll get better.

'I know that. He didn't need to come in and say that to me. I'm smart enough to know that I didn't play to the best of my abilities last week (in a loss at Washington) and need to get better.'

The Browns finished bottom of the AFC North division last season with a 4-12 record, ending the season with seven consecutive losses.
