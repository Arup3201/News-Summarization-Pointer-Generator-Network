The mother of astronaut Sally Ride has revealed her ten-year battle to free a friend from prison following a staggering case of injustice which saw an innocent woman locked up for 17 years.

Gloria Killian was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news. An elderly couple, Ed and Grace Davies were shot in 1981 during a robbery of six cases of silver at their home in Sacramento, California.

Mr Davies died while Mrs Davies, who had been shot in the head, managed to crawl from her home and survived.

The murders were committed by Stephen DeSantis and his cousin Gary Masse.

An anonymous tip-off named DeSantis and Masse, sparking a huge police hunt. When officers tracked down Masse's wife Joanne, she told them that a woman named Gloria had orchestrated the robbery.

Mr Davies was a customer at the coin shop where Gloria Killian, then a 35-year-old law student, worked.

None of this information was known to Ms Killian when police asked her to the station to answer questions about the murders. Within hours, she found herself arrested and charged with capital murder. However after almost five months in jail, the case against the 35-year-old was dismissed on lack of evidence. 

Meanwhile, Masse had been convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole.

On
 the day he began that sentence, he called the district attorney and 
said that he would testify against Killian in exchange for 25 years 
inside.

Gloria Killian, from California, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news.

Killian, who had no criminal past and protested her innocence, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 32 years to life - despite the fact DeSantis said at his trial that the woman had nothing to do with the murder and robbery.

Each appeal Ms Killian lodged was lost. For a time, she faced the possibility of the death penalty until a change in the law in 1983 saw the option vetoed for murder accomplices.

In an interview with the American Public Media last year, she said: 'The worst was about seven years in. It 
happens to lifers between five and seven years.

'I guess reality hits you
 in the face. You lose all hope. You lose everything.'

Killian spent the years using her own legal education to help others fight their cases at the California Institution for Women prison at Chino.

It was here, in the early 1990s, that she met Joyce Ride, the mother of the first woman in space Sally Ride. Mrs Ride had dedicated her life to helping women behind bars and visited Chino through organization Friends Outside.

Mrs Ride, a Californian housewife, said that, at first, her daughter Sally could not understand why she was visiting prisons.

Mrs Ride, who is now 90, met Ms Killian when she worked with her on ways to help victims of domestic abuse in prison. After a year of conversations, Mrs Ride finally asked what had put Ms Killian in jail.

On hearing the story, the housewife said that she felt profoundly that Killian was innocent.

She told CNN: 'I'm annoyed by injustice. Profoundly annoyed. This was clearly an injustice.'

Despite protests from the prisoner, Mrs Ride started financing a private investigation and legal battle.

In total, it cost Mrs Ride $100,000 of her own money, with the elderly widow selling stocks to pay lawyers.

The investigation was triumphant - a letter emerged which exposed Masse's testimony as bogus in order to further his own leniency deal. Killian's prosecutor did not share this letter with the defense at the original trial. 

The prosecutor against Ms Killian, 
Christopher Cleland, was 'admonished' for failing to disclose the 
vital evidence - an unclear punishment at best.

Another letter came to light - where Masse admitted 'he lied [his] ass off on the stand'.

Without Masse's sworn testimony, the case was baseless and the murder conviction against Killian was overturned.

Ms Killian was released from prison in 2002 and Mrs Ride, then in her 70s, was waiting to pick her up at the gate. Ms Ride told CNN: 'Seeing her walk out was a really great joy. It was like a load was lifted off my shoulders.'

A decade on, the women share a home in Claremont, California along with a third woman that Ms Killian made friends with in prison.

Since her release, Ms Killian has founded the Action Committee for Women in Prison and shares her painful life story.

At 90 years old, Mrs Ride still makes trips behind the walls of prisons to help female prisoners.
