A protesting Cardiff City fan has sprayed ‘Tan Out’ graffiti on the gates of the controversial club’s stadium.

In a stunt that was criticised by members of the Cardiff City Supporters’ Trust on Friday morning, a vandal wrote ‘we will always be blue’ and ‘Tan out’ on the Ninian Park gate overnight.

We will always be blue: Graffiti can still be seen on the gate to the Cardiff City Stadium

Protest: Fans are unhappy with Vincent Tan's running of the club, in particular the change from blue to red

Laugh a minute: Tan has been the butt of plenty of jokes since Cardiff won promotion last season

The gates at the Cardiff City Stadium, which carry a memorial plaque to Jock Stein, who died at the club’s old ground while managing Scotland 1985, were re-painted on Friday, but the words were still visible.

The decision of owner Vincent Tan to rebrand the club from blue to red has incensed Cardiff fans, who have staged regular protests throughout a turbulent season.

A comment on the Supporters’ Trust’s Twitter feed read: ‘Very disappointing to see paint daubing at Ninian Park gates. Must not resort to vandalism as part of return to blue campaign.’
