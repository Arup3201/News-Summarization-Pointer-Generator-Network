Companies could be forced to pay out billions in backdated commission, overtime and bonuses, after a European Union court ruled a worker could still be paid his usual commission while on holiday.

The landmark ruling comes after British Gas salesman Mr Z Lock took his employer to an employment tribunal, claiming his commission should be paid on top of his basic salary while he was on annual leave.

Now the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled in Mr Lock's favour, saying the Working Time Directive - under which all EU holiday pay is governed - allows for employees to keep receiving their work-related benefits while on holiday.

Major unions have
 welcomed the ruling, saying it will force companies to pay 'proper 
salaries' and will mean employees are not short-changed on their pay.

But industry experts have warned the ruling could have a huge detrimental effect on businesses - potentially forcing companies across the country to shell out billions in backdated payments.

Some warn it could open the floodgates for thousands of claims relating not just to commission but to all employee benefits, such as overtime and bonuses, causing an 'unnecessary increase in uncertainty'.

As the directive was introduced in 2008, it is likely claims could potentially date back six years.

Tim Thomas, head of employment policy at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, told MailOnline that a medium-sized company, which on average is made up of about 200 employees, could be forced to pay out £3.3m in backdated payments.

Although the full financial impact is not yet known, Mr Thomas said the figure is so high because the Court of Justice could require UK employers to include almost all 
elements of pay within the calculation of holiday pay.

He said that, on average, businesses 
had calculated the ruling, if enforced, would add 4 per cent to their annual payroll.

He said: 'For 
medium sized and large employers, this will equate to hundreds if not 
millions of pounds.

'Employers
 who have complied by UK law will be dismayed at the future prospect of 
higher wage costs and the potential liability for back-pay, which they 
could never have foreseen or prepared for.

'Larger companies 
will inevitably look at how they will need to change the organisation of
 their businesses, as the court seems minded to include almost all 
elements of pay in the holiday pay pot – commission, bonuses and 
overtime.

'Smaller companies are likely to have fewer options – for some, there must be a high risk that they will go under.'

Mr Lock first took his employers to a tribunal in Leicester in 2012, which referred the case to the EU court.

He asked to be paid his commission between 19 December 2011 and 3 January 2012, when he was on annual leave.

According to court papers, Mr Lock said he was losing 60 per cent of his salary because his commission-related earnings were not covered when he went on holiday.

He claimed that, because he was unable to generate any new sales or follow up on potential sales while on holiday, this affected the amount he was paid once he returned to work.

He argued that, under European law, he was entitled to be compensated for this.

The court said Mr Lock had lost out on his usual amount of pay during his holiday at British Gas, which in turn could discourage employees from taking leave

The employment tribunal referred the case to the EU court, asking the Court of Justice of the European Union whether commission-earners could expect payment for potential sales they miss out on while on holiday, in addition to their base salaries.

It also asked how this anticipated drop in payment should be calculated.

Yesterday, the court passed down a preliminary ruling in Mr Lock’s favour, saying any employee given less pay while on holiday than they would usually earn while working could be deterred from taking annual leave - which itself goes against EU principles.

British Gas said it would 'await the outcome' of the employment tribunal to see exactly what impact the ruling would have on its business.

The ruling said: 'In today’s judgment, the court points out that, during annual leave, a worker must receive his normal remuneration.

'The purpose of holiday pay is to put the worker, during that period of rest, in a situation which is, as regards his salary, comparable to periods of work.'

It continued: 'As British Gas conceded at the hearing, the worker does not generate any commission during the period of his annual leave.

'In the period following that of his annual leave the worker is paid only reduced remuneration comprising his basic salary. That adverse financial impact may deter the worker from actually taking that leave.'

'We will have to look at the full judgment from the CJEU but the ramifications are massive. It is likely millions of workers in the UK have been short changed on their holiday pay'

Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the decision was bad news for businesses up and down the country.

He said: 'This judgement will cause unnecessary increase in uncertainty for businesses up and down the UK and is likely to give rise to far more disputes between employers and employees, haggling over what the appropriate level of remuneration should be whilst on holiday.

'The existing system was well understood and highly clear for both parties.'

Mr Thomas said it would raise the bill for companies across the board.

He said: 'In addition to this, there will be further 
costs that will arise.

'For example, there will be an increase in the 
national insurance contributions payable by the employer and pension 
contributions, and some employers will need to change their internal 
systems to perform the calculation.

'We are aware of some businesses who 
anticipate that they will need to recruit extra staff in order to meet 
the administrative requirements.'

But UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'This is an extremely important decision that will assist workers across the European Union to argue that they should be entitled to their normal pay, including any commission payments they normally receive, for periods of annual leave.'

And Gary Smith, GMB national officer for energy, said: 'We will have to look at the full judgment from the CJEU but the ramifications are massive.

'Companies who pay commission payments should be using those payments for the purposes of calculating holiday pay. It is likely millions of workers in the UK have been short changed on their holiday pay.

'As you would expect the CBI are warning that this will lead to the roof falling in but this is nonsense.

'Capital's share of annual national income has increased by nearly 50 per cent in a generation. This will put a small dent in that shift and is well affordable.

'The case will now go back to the Employment Tribunal but it is likely millions will be due back pay and will get a big boost to holiday pay in future.

'It is likely to force employers to start paying proper salaries too. There is little incentive now not to pay proper salaries. They are going to have to pay holiday pay on the workers earnings.'

The case will now be referred back to 
the employment tribunal to determine what annual leave payments Mr Lock 
is entitled to under UK law.

It will then be left open to the UK government to see how the ruling is put into domestic law.

Ralph 
Nathan, director of employment law at British Gas, said: 'Many of our 
people receive commission as part of doing their job, so we’re reviewing
 in detail the CJEU judgment.

'However,
 we’ll need to await the outcome of the UK Employment Tribunal’s 
decision to understand the precise impact of this European judgment on 
UK legislation.

'We’re
 already examining the issue raised by the Lock case as part of a wider 
review of employee incentives and working with trade union 
representatives to help us design our future employee incentive 
schemes.'
