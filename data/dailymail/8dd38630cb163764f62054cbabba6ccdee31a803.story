There was heartbreak in Scotland today after the Team GB all-Scots men's curlers threw in the towel eight ends into a comprehensive thrashing at the hands of Canada.

Supporters had gathered to watch play at Stirling Sports Village, where Dave Murdoch's team train, only to see their boys comprehensively trounced by a rampant opposition.

Team GB were forced to play a full eight of ten ends, according to the rules of Olympic curling, but with Murdoch's team trailing 9-3, the skip decided it wasn't worth carrying on.

Playing in their trademark aggressive,

mistakes by Britain to take a 6-1 lead after just four ends.

British
 supporters were left praying that the Canadians would make a mistake, 
but instead they raced away with the points in a match that was one 
sided all the way.

In 
Stirling and at the Ice Cube curling centre in Sochi, Team GB supporters
 held their heads in their hands as the Canadians used their muscular 
style and sharp tactics to successfully block practically all of Team 
GB's scoring opportunities.

Elsewhere fans gathered at Lockerbie ice Rink - where curling Murdoch honed his craft - to watch Team GB win the silver medal.

There had been high hopes for the British curling team - made up of four Scots - in the final game against Canada at Sochi.

But
 despite being frozen out 9-3 by the Canadians, their silver was the 
first medal won by any GB men's team since the sport's debut at the 1924
 Chamonix Games.

Michael Stevenson, Chairman of Lockerbie Ice Rink said the result was still 'a triumph'.

By end seven, the Canadians were racing for the finish, playing a tight game to prevent Britain's curlers from closing the gap.

Team GB had the hammer, but the Buff Boy's took every chance to knock away scoring and blocking stones, safe in the knowledge they were benefitting from an almost unassailable lead.

Holding a six shot advantage with just three ends to go all they had to do was make sure they didn't make any mistakes. And even the simplest of shots proved elusive for GB.

The Canadians had dominated play right from the kick off this afternoon, with blistering shots and masterful tactical play that left GB with few options.

The Buff Boys looked the more likely team from the off, well built and with a professional presence that may have been intimidating for the plucky Scots.

As play progressed British brows became increasingly furrowed as the highly practised Canadian team pressed their advantage again and again, repeatedly smashing British stones well away from the house.

At the close of each end, GB skip Murdoch was left with tricky shots to make, but often seemed as though he was trying to hard.

But while with each advancing end Britain's hopes sagged, the Canadians became more determined. Murdoch and teammates Mike Goodfellow, Scott Andrews and Greg Drummond found themselves with a mountain to climb and, every time they seemed make headway, they once again slipped on the ice.

After a disastrous first end, the second was more evenly matched, but David Murdoch's all-Scots rink were unable to come level with Brad Jacob's Buff Boys who made a blistering start.

The Canadians, clad in grey and black with their nation's characteristic maple leaf insignia, dominated the first part of the match, knocking GB's stones all over the ice.

Despite several good moves from Britain's skip Murdoch, Team GB, dressed in white found themselves in a tricky position after just five deliveries.

The second end was slightly better for
 Team GB, but they were unable to overcome the powerful and accurate 
marksmanship of the Canadians, despite clawing back a point.

Skip
 Murdoch was fast emerging as GB's stand-out player, making the only big 
shots that really stood a chance of threatening the Canadians' dominant 
performance.

In the third 
end it was clear that Canada was also benefiting from a large heap of 
luck, with several poorly delivered shots nevertheless coming in on 
target. At the same time Team GB's tension was showing, with repeated 
mistakes practically handing the game away.

Halfway
 through one awful shot knocked all GB's stones out of the house. But in
 the end Canada's bunched up stones proved a tempting target for 
Drummond, who was able to knock three reds out of the house.

The
 fourth end saw a better start for Team GB with a couple of well-placed 
guard stones forcing the Canadians to waste deliveries removing them.

But
 despite having the hammer Britain's men were unable to press the 
advantage, eventually losing another point to the Canadians who 
gradually tightened their grip on the match.

A
 demoralised Team GB was able to to claw back another point in the fifth
 end, but in the sixth Canada knocked out all the British stones to 
score another easy two.

The 
North Americans' whoops and roars in the Ice Cube contrasted markedly 
with the more conversational, workmanlike approach of Britain's 
all-Scots rink.

The result, in the end, matched the heaviest margin of victory in a men's Olympic final.

After
 starting the round robin 1-2, Jacobs' rink won eight straight games to 
live up to the lofty expectations of a country where curling is the No. 2
 sport behind ice hockey.

After
 the GB women's team had lost to Canada in their last-four game on 
Wednesday, the pressure had been on Murdoch's boys to take clinch curling 
glory.

They were already 
guaranteed silver after beating Sweden 6-5 in a nerve-jangling 
semi-final, matching GB's previous
 best medal haul from Garmisch 1936 - one gold, one silver, one bronze.

But
 a win would have made history by making Sochi 2014 Britain's best-ever 
Winter Olympics, with a never before achieved two golds.

Team
 GB haven't brought home curling gold since the very first Winter Games 
in Chamonix, France, in 1924 - a result which wasn't officially 
recognised until 82 years laters.

First
 invented in Scotland, the aim of curling, like bowls, is to get one of 
four stones closer to the centre of a target than your opposing team.

It was, then, fitting that Britain's men's finalists all hailed from north of the border.

Dave
 Murdoch had told the BBC in the run up to today's curling clash that, 
despite being the underdogs, he and his team were ready to fight to the 
very end.

'That we're 
finally here after putting in so much work with these guys is a dream 
come true. We'll go out there to win the game, our curling match. 
Knowing you've got the whole nation supporting you is just great,' he 
said.

'I hope today goes
 down to the last stone - we've won a couple already that went down to 
the wire. We'll do everything we can, we'll fight to the absolute last, 
and hopefully again we'll have that shot to win.'

Go Team GB!: Fans show support during the Men's Gold Medal match between Canada and Great Britain

Britain were matched against the the Canadians in 
the final after Brad Jacobs' rink beat China 10-6 in the other 
semi-final and on their current form they will fancy their chances.

Swedish
 captain Niklas Edin had made the first mistake of their sem-final clash
 with Britain's curlers in the second end, too strong with his final 
shot which gave GB a steal of one point to put them ahead.

However,
 the Swedes responded immediately with two and Murdoch had levelled by 
the halfway point but having passed the hammer – the final throw of the 
end – to the world champions.

Another mistake by Edin with his last throw in the sixth end – he went for a game-changing three instead of the easier one and ended up handing a point to GB – had Murdoch's side back in front again.

Edin again erred in the seventh when his penultimate stone left him only able to level and that suggested that things had turned in GB's favour. They forged ahead by one in the eighth.

Sweden grabbed a two in the ninth to go 5-4 up to set up a tense final end with Edin's last throw, slack again, leaving Murdoch a chance for glory by taking a two.

The GB skip, who had a thrilling last-stone win in the tie-break against Norway, was once again bang on target to the cheers of the small knot of British fans.
