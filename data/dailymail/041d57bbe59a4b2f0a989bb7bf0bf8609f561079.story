It was the moment two armies laid down their weapons in friendship for a single day before returning to the slaughter the following day.

Now, the Duke of Cambridge has paid tribute to the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914, describing it as 'a message of hope and humanity'.

William was speaking during a dedication ceremony of a monument to the moment at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Hope: The Duke of Cambridge described the Christmas Day truce as 'a message of hope and humanity'

Schoolboy Spencer Turner’s design for the monument was chosen from among hundreds of others by the Duke and England forward Theo Walcott  following a national competition.

The memorial shows the hands of an English and German soldier clasped in friendship inside a steel representation of a football.

'We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no man’s land on Christmas Day 1914 - when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts,' said the prince.

'It remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times. Football, then as now, had the power to bring people together and break down barriers.'

The winning entry was designed by the 10-year-old during lessons at his school, Farne Primary, which sits in the shadow of Newcastle United’s St James’ Park.

Spencer was told his design had been chosen to be the Football Remembers memorial by Newcastle players Steven Taylor and Adam Armstrong at a special assembly in October.

The Duke, who has been president of the FA since 2006, said he had captured 'the very essence of the Christmas Truce with his stunning design'.

He added: 'It is vital that 100 years on, we keep the Christmas Truce story alive - that moment captured so beautifully by Spencer when hands that had held weapons came together in peaceful greeting.

'For future generations, this memorial will help ensure that not just football, but also a nation, remembers.'

William also spoke about the large number of football events being staged to mark the memorable moment in 1914.

He said: 'This week, teams at every level of the game have been coming together before matches to unite for mixed team photos, evoking the spirit of the Christmas Truce.

'This weekend, young footballers from the nations who fought against each other in 1914 will come together in Ypres to compete in the Premier League Christmas Truce International Tournament.

'Next Wednesday, the British Army will take on the German Army in a special football match, which promises to be truly poignant as serving soldiers repeat this remarkable occasion 100 years on.'

Speaking ahead of the royal guest, FA chairman Greg Dyke told the guests, who included England manager Roy Hodgson, how he had visited World War I battle sites on the continent.

'Yesterday I was on the actual site of one of the events of the 1914 Christmas Day Truce, the kickabout between British and German soldiers,' he said.

'What I found interesting was that both British and German football supporters had been visiting the site for many years, leaving scarves and other mementos in remembrance of those who played and those who died.

'These unofficial gestures by fans have prompted UEFA to build a formal memorial which was opened yesterday.'

Mr Dyke added: 'We were told the stories of what had happened on that Christmas Day, how amid the despair and the destruction the human spirit still flourished. 

'How men from both sides were able to overcome the nightmare of mass warfare and celebrate Christmas together with a drink, a chat, a cigarette and famously a game of football.

Smiling, he added: 'Predictably, the story goes the Germans won on penalties.'

During the dedication ceremony for the Football Remembers memorial, Brigadier Steve Vickery, from the Army Football Association, read the famous verse from the poem For The Fallen, which begins with the line: “They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.”

The poignant ceremony ended with a rendition of the Last Post, played by a bugler.

Speaking after the ceremony, schoolboy designer Spencer praised sculptor Georgie Welch for her "really accurate" bronze of his design.

The 10-year-old, who helped to carve the year 1914 on the stone memorial last month, said: 'It was just an amazing experience and I will always remember the day. To think that the prince has chosen my design over the rest, I am really proud of myself.'

Spencer's headteacher, his parents and several other members of his family, including his eight-year-old brother Frazer and sister Maisie, two, were also present at the service.

His mother Stacey Bird admitted to feeling 'choked' as Spencer joined William to jointly unveil his work.

'Just to see the prince talking to my son, I was just choked,' she said. 'I don't think that image will ever leave me. It was an amazing service and I am immensely proud.'

Spencer's mother said he set his heart on winning the competition because of his passion for art, history and football, and because his great-great grandfather and great- great uncle both died in the First World War.

The 31-year-old added: 'Seeing Spencer's work come to life and people recognising his talent is every mother's dream.

'It also means a lot that the memorial is British-made. It honours those who fought and it's going to stay there forever.'

Virginia Crompton, of the British Council, also praised Spencer's winning entry, saying: 'What Spencer has done is to take the old-style football and make that into a kind of skeleton.

'In the middle there are two hands in a very muscular hand-shake and when you look at it, he has brilliantly brought together the story of the truce and football.'

'As President of The Football Association and Patron of the National Memorial Arboretum Appeal, I am delighted to be here today, and to welcome you all to the unveiling of this magnificent new Christmas Truce memorial. 

It really is the most fitting culmination of the Football Remembers programme, and will serve as a permanent reminder of one of the key moments of the First World War.

We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no-man’s land on Christmas Day 1914 – when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts.

It remains wholly relevant today, as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times. Football, then as now, had the power to bring people together and break down barriers.

In getting to this point 100 years on, I must pay tribute to the British Council for their work in creating a superb education resource which went out to more than 30,000 schools across the country.

The FA, the Premier League and Football League then used this as inspiration to put together a fantastic series of activities to bring the events of the 25th of December 1914 to life.

This week, teams at every level of the game have been coming together before matches to unite for mixed team photos – evoking the spirit of the Christmas Truce. 

This weekend, young footballers from the nations who fought against each other in 1914 will come together in Ypres to compete in the Premier League Christmas Truce International Tournament. 

Next Wednesday, the British Army will take on the German Army in a special football match, which promises to be truly poignant as serving soldiers repeat this remarkable occasion 100 years on.

Yet for all the undoubted power of these activities, it was felt - this year - that the Christmas Truce also story needed a permanent focal point: a place for people to pay their respects. So, to today’s ceremony and the creation of a lasting monument here at the National Memorial Arboretum.

I was personally delighted to join Theo Walcott in judging a design competition involving schools from across the country. We were both impressed with the creativity and thought put in by so many talented young people.

Ultimately, though, we were left with a stand-out winner. Spencer Turner from Farne Primary in Newcastle captured the very essence of the Christmas Truce with his stunning design. I know his family, friends, teachers and class-mates joining us today are extremely proud.

It is vital that, 100 years on, we keep the Christmas Truce story alive – that moment captured so beautifully by Spencer when hands that had held weapons came together in peaceful greeting. 

For future generations, this memorial will help ensure that not just football – but, also a nation – remembers.
