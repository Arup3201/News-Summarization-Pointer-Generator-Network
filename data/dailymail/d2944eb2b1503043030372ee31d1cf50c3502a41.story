Searchers have found the bodies of two U.S. mountaineers who perished on their way down from a 20,000 foot glacier-capped Peruvian peak in mid-July.

A three-man search team found the bodies of Gil Weiss, 29 and Ben Horne, 32, on Palcaraju in the Cordillera Blanca range on Saturday.

Rescue coordinator Ted Alexander says the men died in a fall off a ridge after summiting the 20,000-foot west peak. Alexander estimated the men fell nearly 1,000 feet.

He says it should not be too difficult
to remove the bodies of Weiss, from Queens, N.Y., and Horne, of 
Annandale, Virginia, and that can hopefully be done on Sunday.

Weiss wrote a chilling blog post about
losing his life just a day before the men disappeared on a 20,000-foot 
glacier-capped peak in Peru.

A rumination posted by Mr Weiss on mountaineering blog pullharder.org after the death of fellow climber Michael Ybarra suggests the New Yorker suspected the Peruvian conquest may be his last.

'I sit here in a coffee shop in Huaraz, Peru, planning another foray into the Cordillera Blanca,' Mr Weiss wrote on July 10, 'where the sense that one's life is in the hands of the mountains can be as blinding as the endless white glaciers, and a thirst for glory can darken our better judgment more than the blackness of night.'

Rescuers found the men's bright yellow tent at 16,700 feet next to evidence of an avalanche on Thursday.

An eight-man team from Peru's high-mountain rescue police unit was also involved in the search and the U.S. embassy and the men's families attempted to get a helicopter to join the rescue effort.

'The Peruvian government is cooperating in that they are trying to get some air support scrambled,' said Ben Horne's father, Gary Horne of Annandale, Virginia, before the men were found.

'We really need the Peruvian government involved in this. We can't do it ourselves.'

Commander of the mountain rescue unit, Major Marco Carrera, said police were attempting to secure a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter to join the search.

The two mountaineers had planned an excursion of between 7-10 days and their families contacted Mr Alexander after 13 days passed with no word from the two.

Mr Weiss's sister, Galit, told The Associated Press by phone from New Jersey that the two men were not carrying a satellite phone.

They had previously done a six-day trip that included summiting the north face of 6,162-meter Ranrapalca, according to an entry on pullharder.org by Mr Horne.

Mr Horne, an economics graduate student at the University of California at San Diego, wrote that it was his first time in the Cordillera Blanca, while Mr Weiss, who has been living in Bolder, Colorado, had visited before.

'He spent a lot of time here, did a lot of hard routes' said Mr Alexander.

Mr Carrera said Palcaraju is 'one of the most dangerous (peaks) to climb and it's not typical for people to climb it because the weather is difficult year-round, a combination of strong winds, avalanches and enormous crevasses.'

Even though it is in the tropics, nights are freezing in the Cordillera Blanca, a range popular with climbers but also among the world's most dangerous due to the instability of snow and ice caused by wide temperatures fluctuations.

Mr Alexander said the two men were aware of the risks.

'These guys are top-shelf climbers,' he added. 'This is not the first time they were on something of this caliber.'

Gary Horne said his son and Gil Weiss were experienced in the type of harsh conditions found in the Peruvian Andes.

'They've done first winter ascents on certain mountains,' he said.

The Cordillera Blanca climbing season runs from June to September and so far this year six mountaineers have lost their lives in the range and at least 40 have been evacuated due to medical problems, mostly altitude sickness and hypothermia, said Mr Carrera.

Many of the roughly 8,000 foreigners who Mr Carrera said climb the Cordillera Blanca annually do so without hiring local guides, whose absence can make ascents more perilous as snow and ice conditions can quickly change.
