Ukraine alleged today that a huge convoy of up to 100 Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers had infiltrated its territory.

If confirmed, the claim could destroy a new 'roadmap' to peace discussed by the two countries' leaders and EU officials at a Minsk summit less than 24 hours earlier.

The news comes as a column of Ukrainian tanks, trucks and heavy artillery was pictured massing near the town of Mariupol, close to where Pro-Moscow separatists began shelling today.

Earlier today Vladimir Putin 
faced anguished calls from soldiers' mothers and wives demanding that he
 brings home alive the men detained in Ukraine.

The emotional pleas from the women, and the disturbing account of an enormous new deployment of Russian firepower in Ukraine, raises searching questions on Mr Putin's aims in the dispute, hours after he informed the world he was committed to an end to bloodshed.

Kiev appealed for Nato's help yesterday over the new convoy, alleged to be travelling towards Telmanove, 50 miles south of rebel-held city Donetsk and 13 miles inside the border.

A Ukrainian military source insisted the convoy must be Russian in origin.

'You cannot buy 100 tanks at a market in Donetsk or Lugansk,' the source told French news agency AFP.

'Of course they have been moved from across the border.'

There was a second report of a border crossing by five armoured infantry carriers and one Kamaz truck at Amvrosiyivka, said security spokesman Andriy Lysenko.

Ukrainian premier Arseny Yatseniuk said his country needed 'practical help' from Nato, with which it has the status of a special partner, and demanded 'momentous' decisions at its summit in Wales in early September.

He also claimed Russia was set to turn off the gas supply taps to Europe this winters.

Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen vowed to create a new 'spearhead' force with 'very, very high readiness' to cope with what the alliance saw as Russia's new belligerence.

It came as the strategically important town of Novoazovsk, in the south-east of the country, was shelled by pro-Russian forces today.

The attack raised fears of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian forces.

In
 response to outgoing fire early this morning, pro-Moscow forces lobbed 
at least 10 shells at the Kiev stronghold, with plumes
 of black smoke rising above the town.

Mr Putin alleged the detention of 10 Russian servicemen came after they crossed the border 'by accident', a claim widely disbelieved in Kiev, which claims it has faced repeated attacks from Kremlin troops in a conflict which has seen almost 2,300 deaths.

A video was also released with a group of tearful mothers pleading for them to be returned, as some of the captives appeared at a press conference in Kiev.

However it received little play on major state-run TV channels.

'My child, Yegor Pochtoyev, is currently a captive in Ukraine. I beg you in the name of God - give me my child back,' urged his mother, Olga.

'Give him back alive. Him and all the other men that are captives with him.

'Son, and other boys - we are with you. We will take you out of it no matter what happens.

'If the military chief won't do it - we, your mothers, will get you out.'

The emotional wife of Alexey Generalov declared: 'We love you and we're waiting for you to come back home.'

She demanded of Putin and defence minister Sergei Shoigu: 'Help them, rescue them, bring them back home safe and sound.'

The relatives of other detainee soldiers Sergey Arkhipov and Sergey Smirnov also begged for their release.

Newspaper Vedomosti expressed a growing questioning of the Kremlin's policies in Ukriane.

'Silence or incoherent commentaries from official bodies only strengthen the atmosphere of suspicion and make us remember unpleasant episodes of Russian and Soviet history.'

Earlier, Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko said he was committed to a new roadmap to peace, and would work for a ceasfire in fighting.

Mr Putin - while accused of flooding eastern Ukraine with fighters and military equipment - said he had no role in organising a truce.

Novoazovsk lies on the Azov Sea on the road that runs from Russia to the major Ukrainian port of Mariupol and west to Crimea, raising fears the separatists are seeking to create a land link between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed in March.

On Tuesday, Mr Putin and Mr Poroshenko met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk for their first ever one-on-one meeting, which lasted over two hours.

Mr Poroshenko called the talks 'overall positive' and said Mr Putin had accepted the principles of his peace plan, which includes an amnesty for those in the east not accused of serious crimes and calls for some decentralisation of power to the region.

Mr Putin, however, insisted that only Kiev could secure a ceasefire deal with the pro-Moscow separatists, saying the internal conflict was 'Ukraine's business'.

Russia 'can only help to create an atmosphere of trust for this important and necessary process,' Mr Putin said.

'We in Russia cannot talk about any conditions for the ceasefire, about any agreements between Kiev, Donetsk, Luhansk [the two rebel regions].'

Kiev and the West have repeatedly accused Russia of supplying arms and expertise to the rebels in eastern Ukraine, something Moscow denies.
