Korean giant LG has become the latest television maker to offer Google's web TV service built in to its flatscreens.

Sony already offers the service on a small number of sets in America, and Samsung is to build televisions with the web-TV service, which offers  access to TV from HBO, CNBC and Netflix, as well as web, social networking, apps and games.

With backing from big electronics companies, Google's service could hit the mainstream this year - long before the rumoured Apple iTV service goes on sale.

The device could be a new version of Google TV, a web-streaming service which the search giant launched in 2010, but which has remained unpopular

Google TV will offers web access via its Chrome browser, and apps and games similar to the ones on Google's Android devices - but all redesigned to be easily usable via a remote control from the sofa.

The sets connect to a home internet network, and also offer access to YouTube's steadily increasing number of TV channels.

The service has yet to launch in Europe. In America, it has so far met mixed reviews, and widespread indifference.

Logitech, makers of one of the first Google TV devices - a set-top box - lost a reported $100 million on their gadgets.

Television channels such as NBC have blocked their web-TV offerings from appearing on Google TV devices.

But with an increasing number of major tech companies backing it, the service seems to be in with a chance again in 2012.

LG's offering will offer Google TV along with 3D.

Havis Kwon, LG's CEO  said, 'Through Google TV, LG has merged Google’s established Android operating system with LG’s proven 3D and Smart TV technologies.'

The televisions will also have a QWERTY keypad on LG's Magic Remote - making for easier web searches via Google's Chrome browser.

LG claims that the sets can also multi-task, running social networking such as Facebook in the backrground, or even putting web TV on pause to do a Google search.
