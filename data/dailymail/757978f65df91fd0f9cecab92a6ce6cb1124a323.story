Al Gore's only son has married his girlfriend in a formal ceremony in Washington D.C.'s main train station.

Albert Gore married Brittany Toscano, a friend he met while his father was serving as Vice President and they both were attending high school in D.C.

The couple did not date in school but reconnected at a New Year's Eve party in 2010.

The ceremony: Albert Gore, the former Vice President's youngest child, got married to Brittany Toscano at Union Station in D.C. on Saturday after four years of dating

Formal: The black tie affair was held at the train station because the couple said it played an important role in the start of their relationship as they were living apart in D.C. and New York

Intimate: The couple did not announce how many people attended the ceremony but a spokesman said that they kept it to close friends and family

Before the busy weekend: Albert, 31, and Brittany, 28, shared a quiet moment ahead of the formal ceremonies

People magazine tells how they started dating even though Albert, now 31, was living in New York City at the time and Ms Toscano, now 28, was in Washington for her non-profit work.

The couple chose to get married at Union Station because it was such an important part of the beginning of their relationship- helping them visit one another on the weekends.

Details about the event were sparse and the number of guests in attendance is still not known, but both of the bride's parents were there as were both parents of the groom.

The former Vice President and his wife Tipper announced that they were separating in 2010 and have led different lives ever since but they have not formally divorced. 

Stunning: The bride's lace dress was made by Monique Lhuillier and featured a peplum skirt

Rehearsal attire: Ms Toscano, who previously worked as a fundraiser for non-profits, wore a thematically-similar white lace dress to their rehearsal dinner the night before the ceremony

Prep: After being friends in high school, the couple reconnected at a New Year's Eve party in 2010

Every angle: Hair stylist Ky Walker Designs shared a photo showing the intricate updo

Father of the groom: Both Al and Tipper Gore were reportedly at the ceremony but they were not pictured, though the former Vice President did pose with one of his son's friends at their engagement party in New York in late April (pictured)

Prior indiscretions: Albert Gore was arrested in 2007 for suspected marijuana possession in California

Friends’ photos of the event show that the couple got married on a stage constructed in one of the event spaces with at five bridesmaids and at least four groomsmen.

The bride, who has since moved to New York City to be closer to her new husband, wore a Monique Lhuillier gown and the groom wore a tuxedo.

A family spokesperson said that they kept the guest list small.

'The couple wanted to create an intimate occasion and relied on family and friends for many aspects of the wedding,' the unidentified spokesperson told People.

Wedding planning has likely been a regular conversation among the Gore family in recent months since Albert's older sister Sarah tied the knot just two months ago.

Sarah Gore's nuptials were significantly more low-key than the Saturday reception held in Union Station.

Her wedding, which marked the start of her second marriage, took place outside a coffee shop in Montecito, California and they exchanged vows underneath a historic pine tree in April.

Relatively low profile: The former Vice President's son has kept out of the spotlight in recent years, and his decision to accompany his parents to the Academy Awards in 2007, when An Inconvenient Truth was nominated, was one of his last public appearances

Different approach: Albert wasn't part of the extremely small group who attended his sister Sarah's wedding in Montecito, California in late April (Al Gore seen walking her down the aisle)
