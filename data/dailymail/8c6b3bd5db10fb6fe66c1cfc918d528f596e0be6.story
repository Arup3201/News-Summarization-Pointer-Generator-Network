A gang of fraudsters who helped up to 250 Bangladeshi immigrants con their way towards British citizenship and a ‘gold mine’ of benefits was jailed for nearly 20 years yesterday.

Charging a minimum of £10,000 per person, they provided each with bogus paperwork suggesting they had been working in this country for five years.

One gang member worked at a branch of Barclays Bank from where he was able to fraudulently open accounts for  the ‘clients’.

Armed with their fake documents, the immigrants were able to secure UK citizenship and bring their families over from Bangladesh – and win entitlement to claim benefits and free NHS care.

Immigration officials believe as many as 250 ‘clients’ acquired fake paperwork, but so far just ten have been traced and face being deported.

Yesterday a judge jailed the seven-strong gang for almost 20 years, saying ringleader Ataur Rahman Talukdar ‘deliberately set out to undermine the immigration laws for his own profit’.

Sentencing the gang at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Blake described Talukdar as ‘the mastermind and puppeteer of the whole conspiracy’.

Afterwards, Detective Sergeant Jeff Taylor, of the Home Office team which exposed the gang, said the scam had given immigrants access to a lucrative ‘gold mine’ of benefits.

‘The scam was so good as it made you 100 per cent British – and legally entitled to every single benefit,’ he said.

‘Although £10,000 is a lot of money, it is nothing compared to what you can rake in when you are British, which was like gold dust or a gold mine to these people … they were claiming everything they could.’

Wahidur Rahman, 46 (left) was the chief executive of the Computer Skills and Development Agency. His signature appeared on nearly 1,000 passports. His brother Mohammes Habibur Rahman (right) was in the gang

23-year-old Haroon Miah was enlisted because he worked in Barclays bank and illegally opened accounts for his 'clients'

British-born Talukdar arranged false documents for more than 250 immigrants over a five-year period before his arrest in 2011, earning hundreds of thousands of pounds from the scam.

‘He was raking in more money than a drug dealer,’  Det Sgt Taylor added. Talukdar, 49, enlisted 23-year-old Haroon Miah, who worked at a branch of Barclays and would fraudulently open accounts for the immigrants, and Wahidur Rahman, 46, then chief executive of the Computer Skills and Development Agency, based in Oldham.

Bangladeshi immigrants would pay Talukdar between £10,000 and £14,000 for a package of fake documents in order to obtain a passport, the men’s six-month trial heard.

They travelled from as far afield as Aberdeen to open accounts through Miah, while Talukdar allegedly secured fake utility bills, employer references and even certificates of competency in speaking English.

Rahman’s signature appeared on 998 fraudulent passport applications, although investigators accept they were forged without his knowledge.

The Home Office was only tipped off about the scam when one of Talukdar’s ex-workers walked into a Manchester police station in  2011 and revealed all – otherwise they admit it might never have  been detected.

His business was raided while he was in the middle of finalising a naturalisation package for a new Bangladeshi customer.

Barclays said Miah had been sacked following his arrest in 2011. 

Talukdar was convicted of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and Proceeds of Crime Act offences and jailed for eight years.

Miah was jailed for three years after being convicted of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and Wahidur Rahman escaped with a suspended sentence after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

Other gang members, including three of Talukdar’s brothers, were jailed for between 12 months  and four years and three months  for crimes ranging from immigration deception charges, to  money laundering and identity documents offences.
