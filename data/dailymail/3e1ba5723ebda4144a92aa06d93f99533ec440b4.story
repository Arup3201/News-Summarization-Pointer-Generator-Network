Southampton showed no signs of a club in crisis as they cruised to a pre-season friendly win against Brighton on Thursday night.

Ronald Koeman's side has been dismantled over the summer, with Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers heading for the exit.

However, goals from Dusan Tadić, Steven Davis and James Ward-Prowse saw the Saints run out easy winners at the Amex, despite Kazenga Lua Lua's late consolation.

One player missing was Morgan Schneiderlin as speculation about his future rumbles on.

However, Koeman remains hopeful of keeping the wantaway midfielder.

He told the Daily Echo: 'The conversations are between us and not to the media because we like to keep those sort of things inside.

'He was not in a good shape to play because he has been training only for five or six days and normally he will play next week against Leverkusen at home.

'About his situation, we wait. He is a player of Southampton and I hope he will continue as a player of Southampton.'

The visitors took the lead on 19 minutes at the Amex.

Captain José Fonte burst forward and fed Tadić, who fired past debutant David Stockdale in the Brighton goal.

Southampton's 870 travelling fans had more to cheer just before the break when Davis popped up to double their advantage.

Looking on: Ronald Koeman watched his side ease to victory at the Amex

Ryan 
Bertrand, who signed on a season-long loan from Chelsea on Wednesday, 
was withdrawn at the break as Koeman rotated his squad for the second 
period.

Ward-Prowse
 put Saints out of sight on 64 minutes as he ended his goal drought in 
fine fashion, smashing the ball beyond a stranded Stockdale to make it 
3-0.

Substitute
 Lua Lua reduced the deficit late on, but the Seagulls couldn't find a 
way back as Southampton claimed bragging rights on the South Coast.
