A Florida man who won a contest to see the ‘Breaking Bad’ finale in a showing with the cast was arrested Wednesday in a major drug bust.

The San Carlos Park home of Ryan Carroll, 28, was swarmed by officers Tuesday in a massive operation that looked straight out of Hollywood. Mr Carroll gained a small amount of local notoriety after winning the nationwide contest in September.

He was arrested and hit with multiple felony drug charges. Officers have not disclosed which drugs were found.

More than a dozen police vehicles descended on the quiet neighborhood, a witness told NBC 2.Deputies could be seen bringing out large boxes most of the day.

‘It was crazy. There had to be like 15 cop cars,’ the witness said, ‘And they were bringing out box after box of something.’

Another neighbor described the scene to Fox 4.

‘I came home at about 6 p.m. and there were still about 10 cop cars and they had this big bread truck and they were bringing boxes and boxes of something out,’ said Peter Ryther.

Shock and awe: Neighbors were floored by the sheer number of police raiding the home, and surprised it happened in their nieghborhood

Neighbors told Fox 4 that Carroll had only been living in the house for six months, that he mostly kept to himself and never had problems with anyone.

‘I have never had any problems with the neighborhood. It's a family neighborhood, a nice neighborhood, so this was a big surprise,’ Mr Ryther added.

Mr Carroll was hit with multiple felonies including possession of synthetic narcotics and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, records showed.

He was also given a misdemeanor charge of keeping a shop of vehicle for drugs, as well as for violating probation.

The New Year’s Eve raid came as a surprise to most.

‘I was just shocked, especially here,’ Ruthanne Coyne told NBC 2. ‘This is such a good neighborhood.’

We just saw lots of cop cars and lots of undercover cops throughout the neighborhood,’ Jim Mielke told Fox 4.

Authorities are not saying which drugs were found in the home and a search of Florida criminal records did not show why Mr Carroll was on probation.

Mr Carroll became somewhat of a local celebrity after winning the September contest to go to Los Angeles and see the ‘Breaking bad’ premiere.

In an interview before the trip he told NBC 2 why he loves the show, in which lead character Walter White turns to cooking crystal meth to pay medical expenses after being diagnosed with cancer.

‘It's just so addicting. It's such a good show,’ Mr Carroll said. ‘I think its addicting because people can relate to the main character.’

It appears some people can relate more than others.
