Paul Lambert has admitted managing Aston Villa was the 'toughest challenge' of his working life but that he remains proud of his time at the club.

Lambert, 45, was sacked on Wednesday after almost three years with the club after Villa dropped into the bottom three of the Premier League.

The Scot said he had been tasked by owner Randy Lerner to overhaul the squad and cut wages, and warned as to the scale of the job.

Club owner Randy Lernerhad  tasked the Scot with overhauling the squad and cutting wages

Lambert said in a statement issued through the League Managers' Association: 'I am extremely proud to have managed Aston Villa, a founder member of the Football League, and this sentiment will always remain with me.

'My initial remit was to conduct a massive overhaul of the playing squad, lower the overall wage structure of the playing staff and achieve this whilst keeping the club in the Barclays Premier League.

'There was also a concerted effort to purchase and develop younger players who would provide a solid footing for the football club to move forward and enhance the value of the playing squad in the future.

Lambert, whose Villa side went 659 minutes without a top-flight goal, insisted he was proud of his time there

American owner Lerner had warned Lamber that the job at Villa Park would be a tough challenge 

'When I came on board the club's owner, Randy Lerner, warned me that I was embarking on the toughest challenge of my working life and he was not wrong.

'But I have never stepped away from hard work and I put my heart and soul into the job from my first day until my last.'

Lambert signed a contract extension after a good start to the season in September, however Villa's form deteriorated and included a dismal run of 659 minutes without a top-flight goal.

It ended against Chelsea on Saturday but Tuesday's loss at Hull saw them drop into the bottom three.
