Victims of the MH17 plane crash will be remembered at tonight's Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.

None of the 298 people on board the Malaysian Airlines flight survived when it was shot down over a rebel-held area of Ukraine last Thursday.

A large number of those were from Commonwealth countries and they, along with the other victims, will be recognised.

Tributes: people pay their respects to the victims of MH17 at Amsterdam airport, where the plane took off from

Speaking ahead of the opening ceremony, HRH Prince Imran from Malaysia, the Commonwealth Games Federation's president, said: 'I am from Malaysia and it's another sad occasion for our country, and for the airline.'

Referencing the MH370, which disappeared after leaving Kuala Lumpur in March, he added: 'It's a terrible thing to have two tragedies within months of each other. As I understand it there will be some recognition.'

David Grevemberg, chief executive of Glasgow 2014, added: 'We will be paying tribute.'

Grevemberg also said tickets do remain for some sports, but that sales from inside Scotland had been excellent.

He said: 'I can't give a figure (on total sales) but there is availability across some of the sessions.

'There has been fantastic demand and we have sold over 1.1million tickets, which is brilliant.'

The outgoing chief executive of the Commonwealth games Federation, Mike Hooper, said: 'This just shows how much the people of Scotland, Glasgow and the UK have embraced these Games. It's exceeded expectations.'

According to Grevemberg, Scots have bought 57 per cent of tickets, with 40 per cent sold in the UK and three per cent overseas.
