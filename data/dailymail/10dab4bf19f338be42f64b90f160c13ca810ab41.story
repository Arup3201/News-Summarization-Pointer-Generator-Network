Australian batsman dies aged 25 two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer

Andrew Strauss believes the game of cricket has never been safer, despite the death of Phillip Hughes on Thursday at the age of 25.

Hughes died two days after being struck on the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia against New South Wales but Strauss, who played with the Aussie at Middlesex, said a player no longer went out to bat 'worrying that his life might be on the line' and urged the powers that be not to consider banning short deliveries.

The former England captain admitted the natural response to such a tragedy was to assume 'massive changes' were needed, but said on Sky Sports News: 'The protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today.

'I don't think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line. I think in the old days, pre-helmet, that did used to take place quite often, these days it doesn't happen.

'I think it's really important we investigate this fully and see what can be done. I would hate to see a situation where bowlers can't bowl short balls. 

'That is the element of bat versus ball and there has got to be a little bit of an element of, not fear, but, as a batsman, you have to protect yourself and if you lose that I think it shifts the balance between bat and ball too firmly in the favour of the batsman.

'Let's look if we can do anything more on the protection side. I don't know the full details of it, it sounds like he got hit on the neck, which is not usually a particularly dangerous place to get hit. 

'I've been hit on the neck a number of times, I can remember twice by Brett Lee in the same Test match, so whether this is just one of those freak, tragic accidents or not remains to be seen.'

Another former England skipper Michael Atherton said Hughes' death would 'shake' batsmen into recognising the importance of safety.

He said: 'It's an incredibly safe game but I think this will shake batsmen slightly out of what might have been complacency.

'I wore the same helmet for 10 years. I never changed it. I didn't give it much thought really. If there is that kind of complacency that I was guilty of, then I think people will be shaken out of that.

'I'll be making sure my 12-year-old boy's helmet is up to scratch and the latest model. But fundamentally, it's a safe game with risk attached.'

Nasser Hussain added: 'You have to think about ways of improving the helmet all the time, balancing protection with being able to move and see the ball.

'Putting bits on the neck...is an area we've never thought about. We were always told to protect the temple but were never really concerned about the neck.

'The instinct to get out of the way of a bouncer is to turn away - this will send shock waves through every cricketer.'

Shaun Udal, who played alongside Hughes with Middlesex in 2009, said: 'Unfortunately the ball missed his helmet - if it had hit it he might still be with us.

'This highlights the need to keep progressing and moving forward. In the helmet industry this is being done.'
