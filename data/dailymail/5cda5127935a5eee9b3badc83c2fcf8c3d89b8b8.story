Day 1: On Monday Gusti Ratu Kanjeng Hayu was bathed by her mother Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Hemas, during the bath ritual, know as 'Siraman' Ritual, in Bangsal Keputren at Kraton Palace

The couple met at a high school reunion and 
became romantically involved when she went to university in Washington 
and he was in New Jersey.

Her mother asked him to take her to school and a romance was born. He now works for the United Nations in New York City.

Born Angger Pribadi Nugroho, he had 
been accorded the name Notonegoro for his marriage. He proposed to his girlfriend in June.

He is the oldest of three sons, and she is the fourth of five daughters.

They went to the same high school as 
one another, but ten years apart.

They met at an event for the school 
before reconnecting in the US.

The couple is to be each other's only 
spouse, a royal tradition of monogamy embraced by the bride's father.

Previously 
Sultans practiced polygamy, but Hamengkubuwono X has just one wife.

Born in 1948, the Sultan is not only 
the current monarch. He is also currently the elected governor, having 
won the seat in 1998.

The groom was similarly purified with water in the room filled with fresh flowers and pomp

father's feet for a traditional blessing.

Then both the bride and her 
groom went through the purification water bath, staying partially clothed and draped in flowers as they sat eyes closed being photographed. The groom is also from Indonesia.

The groom, 39, currently works for the United Nations in New York
