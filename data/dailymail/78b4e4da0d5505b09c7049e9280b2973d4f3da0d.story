Strolling through Liverpool, Paul Flowers appears nonchalant as he takes a trip to the cinema with fellow Methodist minister Ian Hu on Thursday night in these exclusive photographs.

He might have been able to put his troubles to the back of his mind for a while during a week spent in hiding from the media – but drugs squad officers from  West Yorkshire were waiting to arrest him shortly after these pictures were taken.

Flowers sought refuge with American-born Rev Hu, 51, an old friend, at his  house near Liverpool Football Club’s Anfield stadium after The Mail on Sunday’s revelations last weekend.

His companion was Reverend Hu, an ex-addict minister who has spoken about his battles with drugs and alcohol and has a house in the city

Rev Hu, who describes himself as a ‘California dude lovin’ life in Liverpool’ is open about his own past struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction and spends much of his time helping addicts in the North West.

Despite media pressure Flowers looked relaxed while he was on his night out

In an internet blog called Pastor Buddha, the openly gay minister wrote recently: ‘In March 2011 I acknowledged 18 years of living life clean and sober.

'I am to this very day confronting the demons of alcoholism and drug addiction which have taken such a powerful hold on many people to whom I minister.’

In September, he took over a unique ministry called Something Else in the centre of Liverpool. It is also known as the Bread Church because visitors bake and eat fresh bread on the premises.

Rev Hu will no doubt be astonished to learn that Flowers last week invited his dealer to stay at his friend’s Liverpool house, encouraging him to bring cocaine.

On Thursday, Flowers and Rev Hu watched the space movie Gravity. Flowers emerged into the foyer and loudly blew his nose on a monogrammed handkerchief.

According to friends, his nose-blowing has become more frequent as his cocaine habit has become more prodigious.

Apparently neither man had any inkling of what would happen when they returned to Rev Hu’s house shortly before midnight.

Within minutes, the police were knocking on the door to arrest Flowers and drive him 70 miles across the Pennines to Leeds.

Three hours later police arrived to arrest Flowers, who is thought to be cowering under a coat in the back of this car
