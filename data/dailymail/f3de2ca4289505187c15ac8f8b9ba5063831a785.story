Julie Middleton's son Regan died at six weeks but his brain was kept in a jar for 13 years by request of the police

Hundreds of body parts taken from victims of suspicious deaths have been kept needlessly by police for more than 50 years without their families knowing.

Relatives reacted with fury to the revelation that forces stored 492 body parts and organs, some taken as long ago as 1960.

Police chiefs disclosed yesterday that organs such as hearts, brains and limbs had been left in police stations, hospitals and mortuaries after being forgotten long after the criminal investigation concluded.

In a scandal that has revived painful memories of the retention of infants’ organs at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, police failed to inform relatives at the time that organs had been removed. In some cases, families are still being kept in the dark.

The true number of human tissue samples being kept is likely to run into thousands. Police have revealed only the number of whole organs and ‘significant body parts’ retained unnecessarily years after the case was closed. Those required for ongoing criminal investigations or appeals were not counted in the audit.

The calculation also failed to take  into account small tissue samples  and other material taken such as hair and fingernails.

Avon and Somerset Police said their records indicated that 110 victims had been buried without various body parts.

But the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) counted only two samples in its nationwide audit as the majority of the material did not constitute whole organs or ‘significant’ body parts.

Forces are now contacting hundreds of bereaved families and in some cases are paying for new funeral arrangements so that the organs can be interred with the original remains.

Stored: Brains, hearts and limbs were among the samples retained, ACPO found

But, controversially, some families may not learn the truth as forces can decide that the tissue sample is not significant enough if the case dates back more than five years.

When asked whether families were aware that tissue had been retained, ACPO spokesman Debbie Simpson, deputy chief constable of Dorset, said: ‘It may well be a case by case basis’.

She admitted that the true number of body parts could be far higher than the audit indicated, saying that the data was ‘just a snapshot in time’.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland retained the most body parts with 71 cases recorded. The Metropolitan Police kept 39, Merseyside 37, Cambridgeshire 35 and West Midlands 30.

The samples were taken following post-mortem examinations as evidence in cases involving suspicious or unexplained deaths.

Records: Body parts were kept by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, some body parts were disposed of without the consent or knowledge of their families. ACPO was unable to provide details of other forces.

Miss Simpson offered a belated apology to families after conducting a two-year review, although she insisted that forces had acted within the law. She said: ‘The police service has a duty of care towards the families of those who die in suspicious circumstances or in homicide cases, to ensure such cases are fully investigated while loved ones are treated with dignity and compassion.’

Helen Shaw of Inquest, a charity which advises the bereaved, said: ‘It’s outrageous that some families might not be told. This report will just make many families worried about whether their relatives’ organs have been kept.

‘The key issue in my experience is people feel very angry about not knowing and other people taking the decision for them based on whether the material retained is significant enough.’

Some body parts retained by police in Northern Ireland were disposed of without the consent or knowledge of their families, according to Northern Ireland's Justice Minister.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) kept human tissue samples relating to 63 suspicious and unexplained deaths between 1960 and 2005.

A helpline has been established for relatives of people whose body parts were kept.

Stormont Minister David Ford said: 'The state pathologist has clarified to me that there were, in the past, occasions when human tissue was taken without the families' knowledge and subsequently disposed of without family consent or knowledge.

'To many that may seem a shocking statement.'

The cases, including 23 attributed to the conflict, were discovered as part of a UK-wide audit.

The Commission for Victims and Survivors set up the helpline.

Mr Ford meets members of the Commission in a fortnight to consider matters raised by victims' families and any unanswered questions.

Chairman of the Commission Brendan McAllister said: 'It is important now for this situation to proceed in an atmosphere of calmness.'

He appealed to the community to remain sensitive to those who have lost someone through violence or in other tragic circumstances and who may be especially vulnerable to distress arising from this situation.

He added: 'With regard to the emergence of disturbing information about the retention of body parts by agencies of the state, it is important that we remember the motivation of those involved, to serve the public by helping to determine the cause of death or by providing forensic evidence to help secure justice.

'Nevertheless, ours is a wounded society which is still vulnerable to the long reach of a violent past.

'These new revelations about the retention of body parts may cause victims, families or individuals to suffer new distresses and even suspicions.'

Last week, Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton apologised for the distress caused to families but said the PSNI had acted within the law.

The body parts were retained as part of investigations and could include skulls and organs.

ACC Hamilton added that until 2006 police were under no legal obligation to inform relatives but said he was not defending what happened, when no mechanism was in place to review what material was held.

The Police Ombudsman, which investigates complaints against police, also stored body parts.

Officers have been visiting affected families to advise them of their options.

Mr Ford apologised for the distress caused to the bereaved families and confirmed that he will review support arrangements.

'I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations in today's national audit are implemented fully in Northern Ireland to ensure public confidence,' he said.

He has contacted the Human Tissue Authority, Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary to discuss the best approach and said the needs of the bereaved families must remain paramount.

He added: 'I deeply regret the fresh pain that families have had to suffer since this issue became known.

'I appreciate that this is a very difficult time for those families.

'Although the retention of human tissue following a post-mortem without informing the families was common practice prior to 2006, I share the view expressed by ACC Hamilton that there is a great difference in acting legally and doing what is morally and ethically right.'
