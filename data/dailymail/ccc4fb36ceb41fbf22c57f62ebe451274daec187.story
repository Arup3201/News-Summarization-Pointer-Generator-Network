It's only day two of Rosie O'Donnell's return to The View and she's already made an enemy of her conservative co-host, former George W. aide Nicolle Wallace. 

The fracas started off with the question of whether President Obama is a people person and devolved when O'Donnell took offense at the assertion by Wallace that he might not be.

'I'm not saying things all Dems disagree with,' insisted the Republican PR whiz, before O'Donnell went on the attack.

Acrimony already! Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words on just the second episode of The View's new lineup

The once-booted co-hosted compared Wallace's characterization of Obama with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people.

'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.'

O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her.

'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.'

Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree.

Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!'

Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being.

The season 15 premier on Monday, which also welcomed Rosie Perez to the panel, won the show its highest ratings in eight years.

According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series.

The argument began over George W. Bush's handling of the Katrina disaster, and O'Donnell ended up forcing Wallace to admit the president made a major mistake by taking so long to visit the ravaged southern city

Controversial: Here, Bush and his Cabinet members discuss a response to hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Many critics point to the administrations sluggish response in helping the city of New Orleans as one of the biggest mars on Bush's presidency

It likely didn't disappoint, at least not viewers interested in seeing Rosie O'Donnell up to her old (some say intentionally) irksome tricks. Complaining of sciatica, the comedienne did the entire show with no shoes on and at times rubbed her feet well above the table for all to see. 

Backstage, Goldberg said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics. 

That clearly wasn't the case Monday, either, as the four cast members dove right into a discussion about domestic abuse and the National Football League, along with changing attitudes toward corporal punishment. O'Donnell said that while she was able to look past abuse charges against Chris Brown and enjoy his work, she couldn't do that with Woody Allen and no longer sees his movies. 

Goldberg couldn't stifle giggles when talking to Wallace about Sarah Palin, with whom she clashed while working for the GOP's 2008 national ticket.

'When did you want to just pop her?' Perez asked.

Otherwise, Wallace struggled to get a few words in during her first show.

'I'm a Republican, we should get that out of the way,' she said in introducing herself. 

As for Rosie, she said she's expecting a smoother time than her previous eight months on 'The View,' which ended in 2007. In part that's because longtime producer Bill Geddie is out, replaced by Rachel Maddow's former producer, Bill Wolff.

'We had a different idea of what the show could or should be,' she said about her first tenure. 'But when someone invites you into their house for dinner, you don't rearrange the furniture. This is a new house with a new owner, and I was invited to consult on what the furniture should be.'

Unsanitary: Rosie O'Donnell immediately perturbed her co-hosts by insisting on doing the entire show without shoes on Monday

Back to their old tricks? Backstage, Goldberg said the hosts had been told the past few years to avoid political topics

Unimpressed: Rosie Perez voted to move on from the topic of Katrina and George Bush after Wallace and O'Donnell traded barbs

Nicolle Wallace helped stir the first of what could be a lot of major The View sparring matches.

Tuesday's fight, which should be noted came in just the second episode of the season, started when she argued that Obama isn't much of a people person.

'Are you implying that Obama doesn't (love people)?' O'Donnell barked.

'Yeah...I don't think so,' the former Bush aide replied.

'Oh, that's bull crap,' new host Rosie Perez snapped. 'You are so wrong.'

Things became truly heated when Rosie O'Donnell recalled rapper Kanye West's claims in the aftermath of Katrina that Bush ignored black people.

'Let me just ask you something, when Kanye West says "I don't think President Bush cares about black people" it's like an international incident,' she said. 'But you can say that you don't think Obama likes people?'

'George Bush, when he wrote his book, one of the most interesting things he revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' said Wallace.

O'Donnell pounced, to audience applause.

'I think he was very upset in the plane as he FLEW OVER Katrina.'

'We talked about that yesterday,' said Wallace.

'As African Americans, one could understand the righteous anger of [West's] statement,' Rosie said.

'Let me just answer your attack on president Bush and Katrina,' Wallace said. 'A lot of people were very happy with what got done to rebuild New Orleans. New Orleans is a safer place because of what it went through.'

'I did not attack him,' O'Donnell responded. 'I simply stated the fact that he flew over in a plane before he ever went to address the people who were there and it was a very long time before he showed up.

A nodding Wallace was forced to agree.

She's still got it! Despite her retirement, The View co-creator Barbara Walters showed up for a cameo as the forum's queen and proved she still knows how to produce controversy after Tuesday's fight and Monday's raked-in ratings

O'Donnell was the ringmaster during commercial breaks, taking a microphone and interacting with the audience. It created some moments funnier than what appeared on the air, like when one onlooker asked whether someone else might be added to the four-person cast.

'This isn't enough for you?' she joked. 'Get the (expletive) out.' 

Onscreen, she played a brief game with an audience member and Perez, asking them to guess which Rosie had said or done certain things. Also Monday, Kristin Chenoweth came on for a song in tribute to the late Joan Rivers.

Walters, who invented the format nearly two decades ago, watched the proceedings from offstage. She filmed an awkward show-opening segment seated in a 'throne' where the four hosts briefly approached and bowed before her. Wolff said he talked to Walters a couple of times a week to get advice.

The new executive producer, brought on midway through the show's makeover, said he was largely responsible for hiring Perez and Wallace.

'This is our chance to take our leap forward creatively,' Wolff said. He said he hoped the audience would recognize that the four cast members are all smart, accomplished, able to have vigorous conversations and disagree with one another while still liking each other at the end.

It's a work in progress: Except for one practice run-through, Monday was the first time all four women had been together. 

Rosie O'Donnell returned to The View today for what is being billed as a new version of the long-running show. But apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes.

Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has already become a terror, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi Goldberg and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show.

'She was at The View for several days last week, meeting with producers and telling them "how things are going to go". She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' a show insider told MailOnline

Last Wednesday, Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi Goldberg were present.

Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole.

'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered our source.

Rosie joined The View in 2006, replacing Meredith Vieira.

But the following year Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen, something that Rosie despised. She walked off the set that day and never returned to the show.

But Whoopi was clear after Rosie complained several times in recent days: 'I'm moderating and that's how it's going to be, so work with me babe!'

'Rosie actually said aloud, "This is taking forever! I know we're on tape, but should it take 4 hours?"

'No one responds when she makes snarky comments except Whoopi, because everyone else fears for their job,' detailed the source.

The sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were 'boring together' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today's show.
