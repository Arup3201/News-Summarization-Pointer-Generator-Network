The BBC’s Director General was at the centre of a conflict of interest row last night after it emerged that his wife’s company has landed the lucrative contract to recruit a new chair of the BBC Trust.

Tony Hall’s wife Cynthia earns a six-figure salary at headhunters Saxton Bampfylde, which is being paid tens of thousands to find a successor to Lord Patten.

Last night MPs reacted angrily, with one claiming it was a ‘catastrophic waste of public money’.

Lord Patten, the current Trust chair, announced a month ago that he was standing down, triggering speculation about his successor.

Tory peer Lord Coe has been identified as an early front-runner, while other sources have said the Prime Minister would ‘prefer a woman’ to fill the position.

The successful candidate, who will be paid £110,000 a year for the four-day-a-week job, will take over at a delicate point in BBC history – leading negotiations over the renewal of the BBC’s Charter while still dealing with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile sex abuse storm, in addition to scandals over executive pay and perks.

Lord Hall, previously chief executive of the Royal Opera House, became Director General in April 2013 on £450,000 a year.

He joined the BBC as a graduate trainee in 1973, becoming Director of News twenty years later.

His wife is former head of girls’ public school Wycombe Abbey and joined Saxton Bampfylde’s 18-strong team last year. The couple have two grown-up children.

The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has paid a five-figure sum for Saxton Bampfylde to ‘define the scope of the role and identify the best candidates’.

But critics say the appointment means Lord Hall could be privy to information about candidates – breaking down the ‘Chinese wall’ between the Trust, which represents the licence payer, and the rest of the BBC.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid’s team are already thought to have assembled a list of runners and riders after soundings from senior broadcasting figures.

Apart from Lord Coe, candidates may include Dame Marjorie Scardino, former chief executive of the company behind the Financial Times, and Colette Bowe, former chair of regulator Ofcom.

Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal the BBC spent almost £500,000 on headhunters to recruit senior staff from November 2012 to March 2014.

Tory MP Philip Davies, of the Commons media select committee – which must approve the new BBC Trust chairman – said: ‘I don’t see why they need to hire headhunters. It’s a catastrophic waste of public money – this is a job that people can apply for.

'And if they are going to hire headhunters, you’d think they’d be able to find a firm that didn’t have the Director  General’s wife working for it.’

A spokesman for Mr Javid denied a conflict of interest on the grounds that Lady Hall will not be involved in the recruitment process.
