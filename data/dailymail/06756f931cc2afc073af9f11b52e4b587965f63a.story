In the public eye, he is  a master of urbane eloquence.

But behind the scenes it is clear David Cameron’s language can be less than prime-ministerial, after it emerged that he labelled Nick Clegg ‘an idle f***er’.

The Tory leader is said to have used the term – in jest – as he urged a friend to tease his deputy for slacking off to go for dinner with his wife.

Frank friendship: It seems David Cameron's language is less than ministerial after calling Clegg an 'idle f*****'

But it is the second time this week that the Prime Minister has raised eyebrows with his language after allegedly privately expressed a desire for the Government to ‘ditch the green c**p’ on energy bills.

He previously got into hot water when dismissing Twitter with the phrase ‘too many tweets make a t**t’. Despite the language used, the latest incident seems to be a remarkable insight into the frank friendship Mr Cameron has with his deputy.

A senior Tory revealed how the PM used the profanity last week when he called a friend who by chance was dining in the same restaurant as the Lib Dem leader and his wife Miriam.

Mr Cameron urged his friend to tease his Coalition partner for ‘chillaxing’ while he was on an arduous foreign trip.

The source claimed he said: ‘Tell him he’s an idle f***er. I’m out here batting for Britain while he’s having a nice dinner.’

The friend, who works in the racing industry, was asked by Mr Cameron  for information about race horses owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.

The Prime Minister met the Sheikh last Saturday in a effort to persuade him to buy Eurofighter Typhoon jets for the United Arab Emirates.

Mr Cameron wanted information on Sheikh Mohammed’s horses so he would have some ‘small talk’. But when Mr Cameron called his friend, the man pointed out that he was dining near Mr Clegg – at which point he made the ‘idle f***er’ comment.

Mr Cameron visited Abu Dhabi after a four-day foreign trip that included two stops in India, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka and a brief layover in Dubai.

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the message from Mr Cameron was not passed on. ‘Nobody has approached Nick in a restaurant to pass on a message from the Prime Minister – and I’ve heard that from the horse’s mouth,’ he joked.

The spokesman also rejected claims that Mr Clegg is lazy.

‘Sometimes he is allowed to have dinner with his wife after working hard throughout the day,’ he added.

Mr Cameron is a regular restaurant goer with his wife Samantha. The couple regularly go out on ‘date nights’ around London.

Some will see it as ironic that Mr Cameron is criticising another minister for slacking off.

The most recent biography of the Prime Minister quoted a close friend as saying: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for “chillaxing”, he would win it.’ Mr Cameron has a penchant for playing mindless games like Fruit Ninja on his iPad and also enjoys singing My Way during  karaoke sessions.’

It is not the first time he has gently mocked Mr Clegg either. The PM likes to practise tennis at the weekend with a tennis machine he calls ‘the Clegger’. Mr Clegg is also a keen tennis player, but Mr Cameron has won their head-to-head matches.

It was revealed this week how the PM privately ordered ministers to ditch the ‘green c**p’ – a far blunter way to describe his public view that green taxes must be removed to cut fuel bills. A senior Tory source said: ‘He’s telling everyone, “We’ve got to get rid of all this green c**p”.’
