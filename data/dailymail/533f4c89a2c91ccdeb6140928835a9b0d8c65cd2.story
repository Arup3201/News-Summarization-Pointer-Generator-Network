Manchester City and Chelsea face off in a mammoth match between the Premier League champions and title favourites this weekend. 

Given the Blues’ perfect start, this is already a must-win for holders City if they’re to reclaim ground lost by defeat by Stoke and a draw at Arsenal.

But Jose Mourinho’s side – inspired by Diego Costa – are in rampant domestic form and it promises to be a scintillating showdown.

Here, Sportsmail plays judge and jury as we return our High Court verdict on those in the dock this Sunday…

Sergio Aguero, with three Premier League goals already this season, will be a threat for Manchester City

Diego Costa's blistering start to life in English football has propelled Chelsea to the top of the table 

MANCHESTER CITY

Joe Hart – Comes into the game buoyed by his heroics in Munich, albeit them ultimately being in vain. Still arguably the best goalkeeper in the league, although the man at the opposite end of the park on Sunday could soon be challenging him for that title.

Sportsmail rating: 8.5/10

Joe Hart was beaten by a late winner against Bayern Munich but had a very good match 

Pablo Zabaleta – Back in the side after missing Munich and his energy and endeavour down that right flank will make a huge difference. Best right-back in the division.

Rating: 8.5/10

Pablo Zabaleta is a rock at the back for Man City 

Martin Demichelis – It says something for the improved form of the much-maligned Argentine that new £32m signing Eliaquim Mangala isn’t getting a look in. Less conspicuous with shorter hair.

Rating: 6.5/10

Vincent Kompany – If Hart and Zabaleta are up there with the best in the league in their position, the captain is up there among the best in the world. The ultimate leader of a defence and, indeed, team. Kompany versus Costa could be one hell of a battle.

Rating: 9/10

Skipper Vincent Kompany is the rock at the heart of the champions' defence 

Aleksandar Kolarov – Likely to return to starting XI and he’ll have a point to prove having last started in the 1-0 home defeat by Stoke. Could have Eden Hazard to contend with if the Belgian pulls right.

Rating: 7/10

Man City left-back Alexsander Kolarov prepares to swing a cross in 

Fernandinho – Will do for City what Matic does for Chelsea, anchoring the midfield with minimum fuss but maximum effect.

Rating: 8.5/10

Fernandinho goes about his work with the minimum of fuss - but maximum efficiency 

Yaya Toure – A big game for the midfielder given the criticism he received in the wake of his casual performance against Bayern. Former City star Didi Hamann called him a ‘liability’ last season and was shot down – perhaps the German had a point after all.

Rating: 8/10

Powerhouse midfielder Yaya Toure disappointed against Bayern 

VIDEO We must support Toure - Pellegrini

James Milner – Enjoying a decent run of form and will provide the graft rather than the craft in City’s attacking midfield.

Rating: 7/10

James Milner's hard graft will be a crucial asset against Chelsea 

David Silva – The main man for City right now, his cunning will be crucial in unpicking Chelsea’s backline.

Rating: 9/10

David Silva - the main man for Man City in the early stages of the season 

Samir Nasri – Didn’t enjoy his best night against Bayern but remains a player capable of making the difference on an occasion such as this. More needed, though.

Rating: 7.5/10

Samir Nasri is another player with a point to prove after a poor performance in Munich 

Sergio Aguero – Only a substitute in Munich, he will return to lead the line and, with three goals from four in the league, Chelsea will have to be on their guard against the fit-again forward.

Rating: 8.5/10

Sergio Aguero is expected to lead the line for Man City 

CHELSEA

Thibaut Courtois – Has made an impressive start to life in the Premier League but won’t be happy with six conceded in the last three.

Rating: 8/10

Thibaut Courtois had had an impressive start to Chelsea - but has only kept one clean sheet 

Branislav Ivanovic – Arguably Chelsea’s best player this season – Costa apart. He will thrive in the high-stakes environment of Sunday.

Rating: 8.5/10

Branislav Ivanovic (right) has been his usual dependable self for Chelsea so far this season 

Gary Cahill – Didn’t enjoy a great night against Schalke but has matured into a top centre back for club and country in recent seasons. Aguero could prove a handful, though.

Rating: 8/10

Gary Cahill, getting up close and personal with Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis, has matured into a top defender

John Terry – Like Cahill, will want to bounce back from Schalke disappointment and he’ll rise to this occasion. Still one of best at his trade despite advancing years.

Rating: 8/10

John Terry is still going strong despite his advancing years 

Cesar Azpilicueta – Will keep new boy Filipe Luis out of the side and the Spaniard remains one of Mourinho’s favourites for his reliability.

Rating: 7/10

Cesar Azpilicueta's dependability is keeping new boy Filipe Luis out of the team

Nemanja Matic – Continues to grow in influence and stature and is just about one of the first names on the team-sheet. He’ll be responsible for patrolling the domain populated by the likes of Silva and Nasri.

Rating: 8.5/10

Nemanja Matic has become a key player for Chelsea since re-signing in January 

Ramires – Still to rediscover top form of a couple of seasons back but his energy will be key on Sunday in a game that is sure to be decided in the midfield.

Rating: 7.5/10

The energy of Ramires will be a key component of Sunday's crunch clash

Cesc Fabregas – What a reintroduction to the Premier League. The Spaniard having been sensational this season. But this is his first big test and a lot is expected.

Rating: 8.5/10

Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for Chelsea against Schalke in midweek 

Andre Schurrle – Has played his way into Mourinho’s XI but is yet to finish a game this season. The German needs to return more goals if he’s to keep his place in the side.

Rating: 7/10

Andre Schurrle needs to add more goals to his game to keep his place in the Chelsea team 

Eden Hazard – Another season of improvement is expected and the early evidence suggests the Belgian could again take his game to another level.

Rating: 9/10

Eden Hazard has had a strong start to the season and is Chelsea's man with the magic feet

Diego Costa – The Premier League’s best player so far this season with seven goals from four matches. There may be question marks over his fitness but the Spaniard would still score goals on one leg!

Rating: 9.5/10 

Diego Costa celebrating has become a familiar site for Chelsea fans already 

VERDICT: City 88 Chelsea 88.5 – What does that tell you? There’s almost nothing to separate the title contenders and our trial by numbers only has Chelsea marginally in front. But it is, of course, the small margins which make the difference in these mammoth games.
