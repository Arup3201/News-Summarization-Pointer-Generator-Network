A man that had been accused of committing numerous sex crimes against his nine-year-old son allegedly killed himself this week.

Defense attorney Adam Bollaert told Al.com that on Monday evening his client Carl Herold was found hanged inside a cell at Clay County jail.

At the time of his death, Herold had been in the middle of an extradition for federal child pornography charges in New York state, the website reported. 

Last year, authorities arrested Herold and his partner Charles Dunnavant in November and December, respectively, and in 2014 indicted them with 30 counts, according to Al.com.

Partner: The indictment counts for Charles Dunnavant, Herold's partner, are for conspiracy to commit child sex abuse, sodomy and sexual abuse of a child under 12, aggravated child abuse, and conspiracy to commit sodomy

Herold faced 18 counts for several alleged crimes: conspiracy to commit sodomy, conspiracy to commit sexual abuse, complicity, sodomy, sexual abuse of a child under 12, as well as aggravated child abuse, the outlet reported. 

It noted that both his child pornography production as well as distribution charges had been dropped. 

WHNT reported last December that a motion to increase bond said 'The victim in this was kept in Defendant’s home, without schooling or interaction with others outside the supervision on Defendant or his co-defendants, for eight months.'

The federal New York indictment from December 2013 'alleges that from August 2011 to about March 2013, Herold compelled a male child to "engage in sexually explicit conduct" to produce images and videos that were produced and transmitted via computer and other means,' AL.com reported.  

Herold offered 'Computer Science for Everyone' tutorials and had reddit and YouTube pages also meant for teaching, the media outlet earlier found. 

Dunnavant's counts were for conspiracy to commit child sex abuse, sodomy and sexual abuse of a child under 12, aggravated child abuse, and conspiracy to commit sodomy, the news outlet reported.

This past June, Al.com reported Dunnavant did not want the alleged victim's testimony heard -- and that defense attorney Brian White cited the boy's mental health and possible sway from authorities he spoke with.

An excerpt of a court filing about the boy - who is a psychiatric hospital patient - from the defense that was published by the website said 'There is a real likelihood that (the child) suffers from a mental condition severe enough to interfere with his ability to have observed events and to now remember and be able to relate those events and to appreciate the grave importance of telling the complete truth.'

Bollaert told the news outlet of his client's alleged suicide 'It's really shocking to me, when I met with Mr. Herold last week, in Cullman County, he had great spirits, he seemed up and was ready to continue fighting this case. So, we don't understand what happened.'

Speaking to AL.com on Tuesday, Madison County Assistant District Attorney Jason Scully-Clemons said 'My reaction to it, ultimately, is I wish that Carl Herold had been brave enough to face justice in Madison County rather than doing what he did. 

'Today above all else, I'm sad for the victim in this case, as I have been all along.' 

 

 Update November 6, 2014

A previous version of this article mistakenly stated in the fourth paragraph that Defense Attorney Adam Bollaert had been arrested and indicted in connection with this case. In fact Mr Bollaert has not been arrested or indicted. It is his client Carl Herold who was arrested and indicted, together with his partner Charles Dunnavant. We apologise to Mr Bollaert.
