A businessman who built his own £325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks is to close the shortcut after the local council invested £660,000 to finish repairs five weeks early.

Mike Watts, 63, claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after Bath and North East Somerset completed the work ahead of schedule. 

He became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century when a crucial road in Kelston, Somerset, was closed by a landslip, leaving locals with a 14-mile diversion.

The roadworks were scheduled to last until Christmas, which would have given Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, a healthy profit on their £325,000 investment.

But instead the A431 Kelston Road between Bristol and Bath will re-open tomorrow, meaning he couple will just break even after spending £150,000 to build the road and £150,000 on upkeep.

Mr Watts said he has received constant opposition from the local authority, which bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission. 

He also revealed that officials at Bath and North East Somerset Council had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official. 

'It feels like they may have raised the money to take me out of the equation.' he said. 

The businessman claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after Bath and North East Somerset council suddenly found extra money to repair roadworks

'It's quite astonishing that they found this extra cash in September. It's sped up the process to get the road open early. 

'It's a catch 22, I want the road back open but we had budgeted for the road to be closed till Christmas.

'Now myself and the farmer who let me use his land probably won't see a penny.

'I'm disappointed in the overall support from the council. If they had supported me things would have been so much better.

'People would have gotten everywhere quicker and the farmer and I would have made some money.'

His wife Wendy, 52, accused Bath and North East Somerset Council of deliberately trying to bankrupt them.

She said: 'The Kelston Toll Road is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in.

'We thought, stupidly with hindsight, that the council would be supportive. After all, we didn't want them to cough up any dosh for it - we wanted it to pay for itself.

The roadworks were scheduled to last until Christmas, which would have given Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, a healthy profit on their £325,000 investment

'We have used our home as a guarantee for the costs of the temporary road, which was a decision we came to with our eyes wide open.' 

The A431 Kelston Road was closed in February after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road.

So the couple asked their friend John Dinham if they could rent the field until Christmas and hired three workmen to help build the road in just ten days.

The toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit, which the couple thought was easily possible by Christmas.

More than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month. 

He charged motorists £2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings. 

But in September the council suddenly found a further £660,000 to complete the roadworks early and open the main road, meaning the toll road will be shut. 

Mr Watts has been hailed a hero for his entrepreneurial spirit and said the public have really taken the toll road into their hearts.

'People are coming over the road with beaming faces and I have had letters of support from all over the country,' he said.

'Well, I say all over the country, but it is actually all over the world, from Latvia and Germany, it has just really captured people's imaginations.'

But his wife said the whole experience has been a 'nightmare' because of the 'obstructive' behaviour of the council. 

'My husband and I have done lots of interesting things in our working lives, but I have to say that the Toll Road experience has been the single most stressful project we have ever been involved in,' said Mrs Watts.

'Kelston Toll Road Ltd has received a bill from the B&NES council for business rates to the tune of £3,500 and yet they do not recognise the temporary toll road as a community initiative.

'I just cannot believe how blatantly obstructive the council has been during this whole saga. They have done everything they can to hinder us.'

Bath and North East Somerset Council denies trying to block the couple, saying the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works.

It said in a statement: 'The council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and various officers and members have met with him several times.

'The Council has provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge.

'This road is open to the public and therefore, in the public interest, must comply with the normal safety standards for public roads.

'Councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £660,000 (for the A431 repairs) following further investigation works at the site, which discovered that below the land which had already moved, there was another layer of 'soft' rock, which was also at risk of sliding.

'The additional funding was needed for the necessary revised scheme which required two rows of deep piling to ensure that future land-slips are prevented.'
