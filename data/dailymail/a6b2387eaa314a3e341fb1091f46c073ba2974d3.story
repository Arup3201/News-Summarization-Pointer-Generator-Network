The tactical response team that staged a major operation in order to capture mass murder suspect Ron Haskell have praised the sole survivor of the shooting as the reason they were able to arrest him.

Cassidy Stay, 15, is believed to have played dead as her mother, father and four siblings were allegedly executed by Hasking at their home in Spring, Texas.

She reportedly lost a finger protecting herself from a bullet, which grazed her head, and called police as soon as Haskell left, warning them he was en route to her grandparents house.

'First of all and foremost the 15 year old girl is a hero, by all means,' Harris County Precinct 4 Assistant Chief Mark Herman told KHOU.

The operation was huge and included countless police units. After three hours, Haskell finally surrendered

'Had she (Cassidy) not verbally articulated to us who he is and where he's going, he would have committed more murders.

'No doubt in my mind.'

Following the phone call, Deputies were stationed on Anvil Drive - where Cassidy had said her grandparents live - three minutes before Haskell arrived, looking for his ex-wife, Cassidy's aunt.

Following a 20 minute car chase, Haskell was cornered in a cul de sac.

A Harris County tactical response team took over with a truck they call 'The bBear', which pinned down Haskell's using another truck, military MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected), at the rear.

Negotiations then began, lasting three hours.

'So we sort of had him trapped where we had him, to where we could force him to talk to us and negotiate with us,' said Sgt. Lonnie Tullos, who headed the operation.

A bomb robot took water to Haskell, and a second cell phone was also delivered to his car after his went flat.

Haskell, who at times held a gun to his head, eventually surrendered.

'Our main function is the preservation of life, and that's all life,' said Coleman.

'To try to get this remedy done in as peaceable a fashion as we can, I think we accomplished the mission the best way we could.'

'The guys are highly trained and dedicated and very patient.

'And using all the tactics we had learned, it just went in our favor because we took our time.'

The quiet suburban street became the scene of a major police operation following the shootings on Wednesday

Cassidy Stay was released from Children’s Memorial Hermann Friday afternoon in good condition and is expected to make a full recovery.

Statement from Children’s Memorial Hermann said: 'As a hospital team, we were honored to be able to help care for this brave young woman at her critical time of need. The entire staff at Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital has been profoundly touched by Cassidy’s resilient spirit, inner strength, and hopeful heart during this time of indescribable shock and grief.'

Also on Friday, the Associated Press reported that Haskell, a graduate of a suburban Anchorage high school, was voted both class clown and homecoming king

Ronald Lee Haskell Jr. lived in Alaska until 2004. He attended Chugiak High School and was part of a tight-knit Mormon community in Eagle River, about 10 miles north of Anchorage.

Drew Nevitt attended the same Mormon church as Haskell and says Haskell was an older peer he looked up to. Nevitt says Haskell was just 'a funny, red-headed, freckled guy with a good personality'.
