Making waves: The Academy elected it's first African-American president Tuesday - Cheryl Boone Isaacs

A veteran marketing executive is the new president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The organization's board of governors elected Cheryl Boone Isaacs to the position Tuesday evening, over Rob Friedman of Lionsgate.

She is the first woman to hold the post in three decades and the first African-American president in the academy's history.

Film industry insiders praised the decision on Twitter.

Alex Ben Block, senior editor and show business historian for The Hollywood Reporter, called Boone Isaacs a 'wonderful choice for movie Academy prez, smart, experienced, diplomatic, hard worker and her election makes history.'

The Academy has had two previous female presidents, actress Bette Davis for two months in 1941 and screenwriter Fay Kanin who served from 1979 to 1983.

Boone Isaacs' selection could be addressing a 2012 Los Angeles Times survey that found the organization lacked diversity. Most of the members were white, male and older.

The LA Times  surveyed 5,100 of the total 5,765 and found only 6 per cent of the members were not white and only 23 per cent were female.

Boone Isaacs was elected to a one-year term but is eligible to serve four successive terms. She succeeds Hawk Koch, who served for one year but was ineligible for re-election.

Boone Isaacs previously served as vice president of the film academy, which announced its new president via Twitter.

Issacs currently works as the head of CBI Enterprises where she has consulted on films including  'The Artist,' ' The King's Speech,' and 'Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire.'

Before CBI she was at New Line Cinema as the president of theatrical marketing. She over saw publicity campaigns for 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' and 'Rush Hour.'

She previously served as executive vice president of worldwide publicity for Paramount Pictures, heading the publicity campaigns for 'Forrest Gump' and 'Braveheart.'
