Dr Nikki Goldstein says that our busy lives are one of the main reasons why couples end up having less sex and time together

Around 90 per cent of Australian couples are having less sex than when they first met, according to new research. 

Sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein told Daily Mail Australia that busy lives are one of the main reasons couples end up having less sex and time together. 

Couples need to build up their emotional connection and because Australian men are not taught to talk about their emotions it makes it difficult, she said. 

'People need to have fun, you need to be able to laugh with your partner to make your sex life better. 

'You don’t need to renovate your house into a dungeon into something like out of Fifty Shades of Grey. 

'Couples just need to implement one thing into your behaviour to change things. 

'Not everyone is going to do a sex tape but it's something different and fun and that is what sex should be about. The emotional connection will grow with communication' she said. 

The survey revealed that despite 70 per cent of couples still feeling a deep attraction towards one another, they were still unable to have regular intimacy.

Dr Goldstein said: 'It is very normal for intimacy to fall by the wayside when life gets busy. 

'Time seems to speed up each year with kids at school, long days at work and all of a sudden it has been days, weeks or months since you last shared some alone time with your partner.' 

The research conducted by Universal Sony Pictures comes as new movie Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal releases on DVD.

Dr Goldstein says three in five Australians love talking about sex with a third of survey participants admitting to using 'naughty banter' to compare notes with friends.

'We're naturally competitive and it's our instinct to run, out drink and out do one and another, and that extends to the bedroom also,' Dr Goldstein said.

She explained that the movie was a good example of how modern day life was getting in the way of people being intimate with their partners.

The research is based on theDVD release of Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal

Dr Goldstein says the movie is a good example for couples to try and spice up their sex lives 

'I thought it was a really clever an example of what the modern couple is, both of them have careers, have they kids and sex is on the bottom of the list. 

'Doing something like a sex tape was that couple's way of trying to get the spark back.

'We have lost the intimacy and we are in this constant fight to want to spice things up.' 

Sex Tape is released on DVD on November 27.
