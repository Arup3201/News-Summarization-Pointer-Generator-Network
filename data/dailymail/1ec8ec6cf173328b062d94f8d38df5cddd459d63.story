Tim Howard's popularity in the United States has led to a White House petition being lodged requesting the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is renamed after him.

Howard played a starring role in goal for the United States against Belgium on Tuesday night, but he could not stop them losing 2-1 after extra-time and exiting the tournament in the last 16.

Howard's amazing string of saves which kept the Belgians at bay has sparked a string of photoshopped images of the goalkeeper saving the day in various iconic images from American history.

Howard's popularity during the World Cup led to a White House petition being lodged requesting that Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport be renamed after him

Blocked: The United States goalkeeper set a new record for most saves in a World Cup game

Full stretch: Howard couldn't keep the United States from losing 2-1 to Belgium and exiting the World Cup

Honoured: There has now been a petition set up to have an airport named after the goalkeeper

Howard's Wikipedia page was also edited to show the goalkeeper as the United States' Minister of Defence.

But now things have gone one step further thanks to the petition being lodged on the 'We the people' website.

The request reads: 'Tim Howard has shown himself to be a national treasure, Minister of Defense, Friend of Joe Biden, and the holder for the record of most saves in a World Cup match; Therefore, we politely request that we rename the airport to recognize his accomplishments, and meritorious service to the United States of America.

If a petition receives 100,000 signatures the White House administration will formally respond to the request.

However, Howard will have to call upon all of his new supporters if he is going to have an airport named in his honour. Less than 2,000 people have currently signed the petition, meaning he needs another 98,000 by July 31.
