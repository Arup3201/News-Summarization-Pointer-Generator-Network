Schoolchildren dressing up as Nazis and a billboard advert showing Hitler were just the start.

Thailand's obsession with so-called 'Nazis chic' just won't go away - and now a fried chicken takeaway called Hitler - complete with a logo showing the Nazi leader in a bow tie - has opened its doors.

The bizarre restaurant opened last month in Thailand and images of it are doing the rounds on Twitter as shocked customers take photos of the offensive eatery.

Among the grub on sale includes fried chicken and chips, burgers and kebabs.

Londoner Andrew Spooner, who spotted the takeaway, tweeted: 'Very bizarre Hitler Fried Chicken shop in Thailand. I kid you not. Complete with pic of Hitler in bow tie.

Alan Robertson, 43, who lives in Bangkok, said: 'The place opened last month and nobody quite knows what to make of it.

'I went in for a bite last week and got some fried chicken, which was pretty good, and asked the guy behind the counter why it was called Hitler.

'He just shrugged his shoulders and said the owners had thought it was good image.'

Cartoon pandas, Teletubbies and Ronald McDonald have all been spotted on show around the capital Bangkok.

The craze has seen more and more teenagers strutting around in T-shirts bearing cartoonish images of the Nazi dictator.

'Nazi chic': A shocking new trend has seen Bangkok flooded with cartoonish images of Hitler - including a popular design in which the dictator is merged with red-haired McDonalds mascot Ronald McDonald

Incongruous: Cartoon pandas and Teletubbies are 
among the characters merged with Hitler in the bizarre fashion trend. 
The designs feature a characteristic vicious expression and variety of 
Nazi symbols.

In a particularly popular design, Hitler is transformed into a cartoon Ronald McDonald, the fast-food chain's clown mascot, sporting a bouffant cherry-red hairdo and a stern look.

On another T-shirt the Führer is shown in a lovely panda costume with a Nazi armband.

In September 2011 in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a group of high school students showed up for sport day in homemade Nazi uniforms, complete with swastika armbands and toy guns.

Leading them was a teenage girl dressed in a faux SS uniform with a fake Hitler mustache.

Locals cheered the students merrily from sidewalks as foreign tourists reportedly looked on aghast.

In 2009, a waxworks museum in the 
seaside resort town of Pattaya advertised itself with a giant billboard 
featuring the Führer with the legend in Thai: 'Hitler is not dead!'

In 2007, hundreds of students at a Bangkok school staged a similar Nazi-themed costume parade.

Following international outcries, teachers at both schools apologised, saying they had no idea the students had planned to dress up as Nazis.
