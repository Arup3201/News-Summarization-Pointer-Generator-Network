With her body racking up even more media coverage than her romances with various super-buff men, it is little surprise that Kelly Brook has topped a ‘best celebrity cleavage’ poll.

Kelly’s breasts are those most admired by British women, garnering 35 per cent of votes, followed by soap star beauty Michelle Keegan (25 per cent) and Katy Perry (20 per cent).

Surprisingly Man Men’s Christina Hendricks’ cleavage came in last place (3 per cent) despite her gloriously curvaceous 50s-pin-up body.

We wonder if Kelly is one of the quarter of women who give nicknames to their breasts...

Happily, it seems we are pretty content with our own lot when it comes to our cleavage: the survey, conducted by Ann Summers in celebration of National Cleavage Day revealed that the majority of us (69 per cent) are pleased with our cup size.

In fact, so affectionately do we feel about our breasts, that 25 per cent of British women even have a pet name for them.

‘Pinky and Perky’, ‘The Twins’, ‘Owl and Pussy Cat’, 'Smidge and Smudge’ and ‘Puppies’ were voted most common pet names for breasts.

But not all pet names are welcome: ‘jugs’, ‘bangers’, ‘knockers’ and ‘fun bags’ were voted the worst ways to refer to women’s breasts.

British women, in particular women in North East (55 per cent) and East Midlands (30 per cent), have used their cleavage to impress a man, and 20 per cent of women from Yorkshire admit to bagging a free drink on a night out by flashing their décolletage.

A further 10 per cent of Scottish women claim that their cleavage helped them bag a job promotion and 5 per cent of women from South East says they’ve used the power of the cleavage to get a parking ticket written off.

The survey also discovered that 73 per cent of women own a push-up bra and over a third reveal that they wear a cleavage-enhancing bra every day, a further 25 per cent wear one on a weekly basis.

Over half of the women surveyed said they feel empowered when they wear a push-up bra (54 per cent).
