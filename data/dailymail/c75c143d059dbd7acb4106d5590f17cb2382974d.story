Britain and the West should start arming Ukrainian troops to help them fight back against heavily-armed Russian-backed rebels, ex-Defence Secretary Liam Fox has said.

Dr Fox raised fears that the credibility of the entire Nato alliance was now at stake, claiming that the bitter battle in eastern Ukraine had raised the ‘shadow of conflict’ in Europe for the first time since the Cold War ended.

The Conservative MP said it was now crucial that Kiev had the means to defend itself against the separatists who used state-of-the-art Russian weapons to overrun the key town of Debaltseve, despite a ceasefire brokered by Germany and France.

He said: ‘Specifically, what we should be giving them is encrypted communications, because at moment the old systems they are using make them a sitting target for the Russians whose technology is much better.

‘They need anti-tank weapons because the Russians are using new, better-armoured vehicles against which the Ukrainians have no defence. Thirdly, they need UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] for targeting.

‘We should be giving them the weapons they need to defend themselves against an external threat. This is about their territorial integrity.’

European powers have so far drawn back from arming Kiev, amid fears it could fuel the conflict, although US president Barack Obama has indicated he would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if the Russians do not pull back. Nato chiefs have also warned that escalating tensions with Russia could explode into all-out war.

Formidable: Putin vowed to step up an ambitious military modernisation, with hundreds of new combat jets, missiles and other weapons Despite an economic downturn caused by low oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, Russia's military budget has risen by one-third this year

But Dr Fox echoed a warning last week by current Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that there was a ‘real and present danger’ that Russian president Vladimir Putin could use similar tactics to destabilise the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – which, unlike Ukraine, are members of Nato – unless the alliance stood up to him.

Dr Fox said the Ukrainian conflict ‘has actually brought the shadow of conflict to the European continent, certainly for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This is a very serious issue. It is also about the credibility of Nato and the Western alliance. I think the defence of the Baltic, for example begins in Ukraine.’

He added: ‘Here is an alliance where only four of its members meet its defence obligations in terms of spending. They all want to have the insurance policy but they don’t want to pay the premiums. We now need to examine exactly what Nato is going to be doing in this crisis, what its credibility is.

‘Will we now step up to the mark, will we put a military presence in the Baltic states and recognise we are getting close to a position where Russia will threaten Nato in its own territory?’

Yesterday, US secretary of state John Kerry warned Russia the west will not tolerate its 'unacceptable' actions in Ukraine - as thousands of pro-Kremlin supporters took to the streets of Moscow.

Speaking during a visit to London, he accused Moscow of 'craven behaviour' in its support for the rebels, undermining the ceasefire 10 days ago.

He warned deeper sanctions are set to be imposed against Russia's 'landgrabbing in Ukraine,' at the talks with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.

'We are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game, not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation,' he said.

'This is behavior that is completely counter to everything that the global community has worked to achieve and put in place ever since World War II, and I'm confident that the United Kingdom, the United States and others are prepared to stand up to it.' 

The warning follows the fierce separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of Debaltseve which saw a chaotic withdrawal by Ukrainian soldiers this week. 

Kiev and the rebels have accused each other of keeping up the attacks with Ukrainian forces  reporting attacks that killed one serviceman and wounded another 40 on Saturday, as mortars hit the outskirts of Mariupol.

Rebels claim Ukrainian forces shelled 15 locations overnight, including parts of its stronghold Donetsk. 

Mr Kerry also blasted Moscow's repeated denials that it is involved in arming the separatists and sending its own troops over the border saying satellite technology meant there is 'no secret' over what was happening. 

'We know to a certainty what Russia has been providing to the separatists, how Russia is involved with the separatists,' he said.

Despite the ceasefire seeming on the brink of collapse, a prisoner exchange is being carried out on the front line, with Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko announcing the handover had began on Twitter.

Ukraine's military and pro-Russian separatists began exchanging scores of prisoners each had taken, in the first stage of one of the key points of the peace deal.

'In the near time, 140 of our heroes will be free,' he wrote on Saturday.

It has been reported the rebels are swapping 140 Ukrainian soldiers for 52 of their fighters held by the other side.

Today's exchange is being carried out as part of a UN-backed truce that has been violated many times since coming into effect a week ago. 

Meanwhile, an estimated 40,000 Russians gathered in a central square in Moscow for what they call an 'anti-Maidan' rally to show their support for Putin and condemning the 'coup' in neighbouring Ukraine.

The latest developments come as military chiefs warned yesterday that Britain has entered a new Cold War with Russia, as Vladimir Putin threatened anyone who tried to pressure his country.

The Russian leader said 'no one should have any illusions that it's possible to achieve military superiority over Russia or apply any kind of pressure on it'.

Adding that his forces would always have an 'adequate response', he vowed to step up an ambitious military modernisation, with hundreds of new combat jets, missiles and other weapons. 

Ukrainian President Petro Porosheno on 20 February had accused Russia of masterminding the killings of more than 100 protesters in Kiev one year ago.

His comments sparked renewed concern about the UK's capability to cope in the event of a conflict with Russia. 

RAF fighter jets were scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles off the Cornwall coast. Russian military planes, ships and submarines have made at least 17 incursions close to the UK since the start of 2014 as Moscow tests Western response times. 

Britain's top military commander in Nato, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, spoke of an 'era of constant competition with Russia', while a former RAF chief Sir Michael Graydon said the UK was in 'a different sort of Cold War.'
