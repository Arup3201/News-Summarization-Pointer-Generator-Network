The New York Cosmos have announced the signing of former Real Madrid striker Raul.

The club, which plays in the North American Soccer League beneath Major League Soccer, said the 37-year-old Spaniard had signed a multi-year contract, starting from the 2015 season, and would also serve as a technical advisor for the club's new academy, which is due to open next year.

'Everyone throughout the soccer world knows the Cosmos name and the legacy of the players that played for this team previously,' Raul said on the club's website.

'They helped establish soccer in America and I'm honoured to follow in their footsteps. I believe in this club's vision and I'm excited to be a part of that.'

Raul won six league titles, three European Cups and scored the most Champions League goals for Real Madrid

Born: June 27 1977 (age 37)

1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls)

2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28)

2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11) 

1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) 

The Cosmos made their name in the original version of the North American Soccer League when the likes of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto signed up to play in the fledgling league.

Pele now serves as the honorary president of the current Cosmos, a club reborn in 2010 with the intention of securing a place in Major League Soccer.

However, in one of the most recent rounds of MLS expansion they were trumped by the newly formed New York City FC - a team backed by Manchester City and the New York Yankees that is due to begin play next year with another Spanish striker, David Villa, spearheading their attack.

Brazil legend Pele played out the twilight of his career at the Cosmos. Following 18 sublime years at Santos, Pele headed to New York for two seasons, winning the 1977 NASL title. His number 10 jersey has since been retired by the club.

FRANZ BECKENBAUER 1977-80 and 1983 (132, 21)

Beckenbauer headed to New York Cosmos after a glittering career at Bayern Munich and West Germany. Having accumulated four Bundesliga titles and three European Cups, alongside winning the 1974 World Cup, Beckenbauer enjoyed two successful spells in the NASL with the Cosmos before retiring in 1983.

GIORGIO CHINAGLIA 1976-83 (213, 193)

The Italian forward actually started his career in Swansea before making his name in Serie A. His goal scoring exploits guided Lazio to the Serie title in 1974 before Chinaglia headed to New York. The striker scored for fun with the Cosmos and fired them to four NASL titles, prompting his number nine shirt to be retired when he left the club in 1983.

But that has not dented the ambitions of the Cosmos owners, as the addition of Raul is intended to demonstrate.

'We're obviously thrilled to add a player of his quality to the team,' head coach Giovanni Savarese said. 'Raul's skill and ability is world renowned. He's a world-class player and he adds a whole new dimension to our attack.

'He also brings immense passion and knowledge that he can share with our team and with the next generation of Cosmos players in our youth academy. He'll help set the academy training curriculum, structure and establish our player development pyramid.'

Raul's deal with the Cosmos allows for him to take over the running of the club's academy after his retirement from playing.

Raul spent 16 years with Real Madrid, winning six La Liga titles, four Spanish Super Cups, and three Champions League crowns before moving on to Schalke and most recently Al-Sadd Sports Club. He remains the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 71 goals.

'Raul's long list of accolades speaks for itself,' Cosmos chief operating officer Erik Stover said. 'He's recognized worldwide as one of the greatest players of his generation and we are now thrilled to welcome him to New York.'

The 37-year-old has had a trophy laden career, including three Champions League titles with Real Madrid
