He calls himself 'The Owl Whisperer'.

Proving that mops aren't just for mopping, Colton Wright managed to edge an owl of his kitchen window using only a Swiffer Sweeper.

But it's safe to say Wright was freaked out as the feathered intruder stared him down.

Clever: Colton Wright angled a Swiffer Sweeper under the owl, coaxing it to sit on the mop

Wright posted two expletive-filled videos to YouTube documenting his showdown with the owl he found hanging in the blinds of his kitchen window.

The first video shows Wright hysterically screaming as the bird flies around the room before perching on top of the window.

After '40 minutes of hysterics', Wright busted out the Swiffer (the second video), angling it under the bird and delicately lowering it out the window.

'Please don't give me that look,' Wright said as he filmed the creature giving him the hairy eyeball.

Wright managed to edge the bird out of the window, begging it not to take flight, before tossing it.

'Yeah! F*** yeah!' he shouted.
