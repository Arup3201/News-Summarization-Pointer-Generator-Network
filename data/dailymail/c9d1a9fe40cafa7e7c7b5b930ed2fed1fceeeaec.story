Motorists in a Scottish city were caught up in a real bottleneck today after a lorry carrying recycled bottles shed its load over a busy commuter route.

The lorry was driving down a main road in Aberdeen when the bottles suddenly crashed off its left side and onto the road.

About 30 stacks of crushed milk bottles and coke cans from the vehicle â€“ owned by haulage company RT Keedwell - covered the North Esplanade West in Aberdeen.

Chaos: Stacks of flattened plastic bottles were strewn across the busy road

But the hapless driver failed to notice the containers had come loose and carried on driving for over half a mile before pulling over.

Police closed the outbound lanes following the incident around 2.30pm today, causing long tailbacks.

Westbound traffic was diverted while arrangements were made to remove the debris. However the road has now been cleared and the road reopened.

Littered: The driver continued on for over half a mile before he realised the containers had come loose and he pulled over

Clean up: Police took charge of the situation, closing the outbound lane while arrangements were made to remove the debris

Transporting: The lorry was carrying a load of plastic bottles, which were due to be recycled
