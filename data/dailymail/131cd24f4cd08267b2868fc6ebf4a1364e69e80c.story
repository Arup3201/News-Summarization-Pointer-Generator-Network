The NFL's involvement in Breast Cancer Awareness month has come under fire after claims the league is profiting from the cause.

Players have been wearing pink caps, shirts, elbow pads, and boots and flashes of the color have adorned towels and parts of the field throughout October across the U.S.

Fans can buy pink items from the National Football League shop, or bid in auctions for products seen during games.

Piece of the action: Items worn by star players on the field are auctioned off later to football fans

Just for show? Critics claim most of the money raised from the sale of the special merchandise goes straight back to the NFL rather than to charity

The proceeds ostensibly go to help support the fight against breast cancer, but critics now allege that most of the cash ends up in the pockets of NFL owners.

The website tells fans they can 'support the fight against breast cancer with pink NFL breast cancer awareness gear.'

However,Â Business Week discovered that only 5 per cent of the sales are being donated to the American Cancer Society.  If the products have a typical 
100 per cent mark-up at retail point, that means the NFL is keeping 90 per cent of the profit 
from the sale of the items.

Of the money the ACS receives, only 70.8 per cent goes towards research and cancer programmes and a significant portion has to be spent on administration.

This would mean that for every $100 in sales of pink products, $3.54 goes towards research while the NFL keeps approximately $45.

Although the proliferation of pink merchandise clearly helps awareness, these figures may raise some eyebrows when you consider that NFL had $9.5billion in revenue in 2011.

An NFL spokesperson said that while they did not dispute the numbers 
above, the NFL does not profit from the sale of 
pink merchandise. Any money that is not donated to ACS is used to cover 
the costs of its breast cancer awareness programme, A Crucial Catch.

The spokesperson said the NFL has donated 'more than $3million' or 
approximately $1million per year as a result of the programme that began 
in 2009.
