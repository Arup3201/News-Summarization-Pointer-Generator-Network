A father who had to make an emergency delivery after his partner went into labour on their living room floor has revealed he knew what to do after watching One Born Every Minute.

Charlie Willcocks, 24, acted quickly when Kirsty Reynolds went into shock following the birth of son Teighlun, who wasn't breathing and had started to turn blue.

The father said he recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 series, as he watches every week as it's Kirsty's favourite programme.

When Kirsty, a mother of six, began having contractions, she simply thought it was Braxton hicks, or a false labour, and decided to wait it out until she was sure it was the real thing. 

But as the contractions began to get more intense a couple of hours later, her niece phoned for an ambulance - which only came 15 minutes after Kirsty and Charlie's son had arrived.

As Kirsty began to feel the baby's head starting to emerge, she moved to the couple's sitting room floor and told Charlie to fetch clean towels.

The delivery wasn't a smooth ride and required Charlie to act quickly when the birth took a dangerous turn.  

Moments after he delivered his own son, Charlie realised the tiny baby wasn't breathing and was starting to turn blue.

Panic-stricken Kirsty went into shock but Charlie began to recall scenes from a recent episode of One Born Every Minute.

He started to firmly rub the newborn's entire body until he choked up mucus and finally began to breathe and change to a healthy colour.

Charlie, who works full-time at Fishers Services, recalls being shocked by his own actions and says the documentary saved their son's life. 

'I think adrenaline just kicked in after initially being terrified. I just went into speed mode. If I hadn't seen that programme I wouldn't have known what to do,' he said.

'I would have just been doing what Kirsty was telling me to do. We watch it every time it's on as it's one of Kirty's favourite programmes. I'm still quite traumatised by it all.'  

After delivering his own son Charlie ran into complications when his baby began to turn blue from not breathing but the new father recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 documentary and his actions saved their son

Kirsty, who has six children, Skye, nine, Shanae, eight, Charlie, six, Irelyn, five and Larae-Esmae, 16 months and now baby Teighlun, said she was in shock when she realised that she was in labour and the pair had to act quickly. 

'I sat on the toilet and tried to feel for the baby's head and it was right there! 'I shouted at Charlie to get towels,' she said.

'Once my waters break, the babies don't take long to follow. I started to feel scared because I knew it wouldn't be much longer.

'When the baby came out he wasn't breathing and I just went into shock. I think Charlie is still traumatised from the whole experience!'

Kirsty said despite her partner's shock, his quick reactions made the difference between life and death.

'The only thing he knew was from me watching One Born Every Minute. He just did the right things because he'd heard it on TV and knew what to do when the baby wasn't breathing.'

Despite the difficult birth, the couple say they were extremely lucky that there were no more serious complications.

Kirsty said: 'There is just so much that could have gone wrong.

'We feel incredibly lucky that everything worked so well. We'll be watching One Born Every Minute next Tuesday, that's for sure.'
