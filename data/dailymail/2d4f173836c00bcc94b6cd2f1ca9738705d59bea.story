Australian mothers, wives and sisters may not have served on the frontline, but they played a crucial role back home - often as they were dealing with the tragedy and grief of loved ones lost on the European battlefields.

'Australia was unusual, close to unique, among combatants in the war in that women had the vote', historian and University of Melbourne researcher Professor Stuart Macintyre told Daily Mail Australia.

The politicians at the time paid a great deal of attention to the women's opinion as they had the potential to seriously influence the conscription laws, and many were against conscription all together.

'There was a lot of concern that the women would be reluctant to vote if their sons and husbands were being sent away,' Professor Macintyre said. 'The issue with gender and women featured more prominently in Australia's role in the war that it did in other countries.'

60,000 Australian lives were lost in battle, which meant one in ten men who was sent overseas never returned home. Hundreds of thousands more came back as casualties of war, with serious physical and debilitating mental scars.

'The [initial] rush to enlist was in light of they thought it would be a war that would be over so quickly.' Professor Macintyre said. Little did they know the battle would continue for years.

The local press would report on the proceedings of the war, but their information was often delayed by days. Ministers of religion were the ones burdened with delivering the news of a death of a soldier to his loved ones.

Professor Macintyre told of the fear and heartbreak those mothers and wives experienced, always in wait for bad news.

'If the minister or priest turned up in your street, there would be a sort of foreboding', he said.

Women would stand at the front of their houses, waiting, and praying that the letter was not coming their direction.

Back home, the Australian mothers and wives played a very different roles to their counterparts around the world. While it was common for women to assume different roles in absence of the men, Australian women had less opportunity to actively participate in the war.

Professor Macintyre revealed: 'There were many patriotic women who wanted to play a part but found it difficult to do so.' Unlike in WWII where women had the chance to carry rifles, during WWI mothers and wives fell into 'comfort' roles.

They worked for charities in volunteer roles - collecting funds for soldier's relief, and knitted socks and balaclavas to send to the troops. ANZAC biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting.

As they didn't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war, women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops

Women enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields

In the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles, and had a greater sense of autonomy within society.

'In many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men', Professor Macintyre said. However when, or if, the men returned, there was a strong push towards restoring traditional gender roles.

Professor Macintyre, who is one of Australia's most influential public intellectuals, whose most widely known work is the History of Wars, which focuses on various aspects of war history in Australia but also worldwide.

However they were expected to move back in to traditional gender roles once, or if, the men returned

The Red Cross was one of the charities which many women volunteered for

Post-war, despite the expectation for women to assume their gendered roles, some war widows would not have that opportunity and would be raising their children as single parents.

Small towns were left with gaping holes in their populations when men didnâ€™t return and people often lost many men from the one family.

There were also the husbands and sons who returned from battle so damaged that they simply couldn't cope with the demons from war and were unable to care for themselves, let alone their offspring.

Many men who returned suffered deep physical and mental scars from the war

Reunions were held at the end of the war, like this one in Georgetown, South Australia
