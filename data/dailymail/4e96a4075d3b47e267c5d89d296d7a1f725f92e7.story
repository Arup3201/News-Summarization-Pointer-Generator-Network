Police were told a suspected illegal immigrant who was caught shoplifting could not be detained on immigration offences as the Home Office was already aware he was in the country.

The 19-year-old Moroccan admitted he was homeless and living in the UK illegally when he was stopped by police after stealing two bottles of coke from Sainsbury's in Ipswich.

According to police, the man admitted the theft but was not charged. He was given a low-profile community resolution after the town centre store manager accepted his apology and a promise that he would not return to the shop.

But when police contacted the Home Office, they were told he should not be detained for immigration offences if the shoplifting matter had been resolved as they were already making a decision on his stay in the country.

Ipswich Tory MP Ben Gummer has now vowed to investigate the incident.

Mr Gummer said: 'I shall endeavour to rapidly find out the detail of this.

'If this is true it shows how much work we have still got to do in fixing our immigration system.

'We have never said it would be working in a few months, but immigration is down significantly.'

He added: 'There is still a huge amount to do and this case shows how our UK border force is not measuring up yet to what it should be.'

The teenager, who is believed to be called Imad Touri, was stopped at 12.30pm on Sunday.

Police said a store security officer spotted him taking the soft drinks and hiding them under his clothing before fleeing. Touri admitted the theft to police and apologised.

Suffolk Police have said they had spoken to immigration officials about Touri.

Police spokesman Richard Jones said: 'On Sunday, September 8, police officers were called to reports of a shoplifter at a store in Upper Brook Street where a man had tried to conceal two bottles of drink under his clothing and leave without making an attempt to pay.

'The man was spoken to by officers and admitted the theft. Following enquiries by officers the Home Office was contacted who stated they were aware of the man and were currently making a decision on his stay in the country. The officer was advised the man need not be detained.

'As a result the matter was dealt with via community resolution with the man being banned from the store.'

In cases where a decision is being made on an individual's stay in the country, Home Office immigration services may choose to detain them. Alternatively they could be required to regularly report to one of several centres across the country.

Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, but Home Office officials may choose to detain an individual if it is feared they will abscond or their details are missing.

The number of times they are required to report to immigration officials is also decided on a case-by-case basis after the person's circumstances and immigration history have been taken into account.

Touri is believed to have been in the UK for about five years.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We are determined to crack down on immigration offenders.

'Where people are found to be in the UK illegally we will take steps to remove them.'

Last week the Daily Mail reported how officials were warning crippling staff shortages and a failing system to screen criminals had left Britain's borders in a state of chaos.

Westminster's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, highlighted security flaws at the country's ports and airports.

In a report, the organisation found the database used to stop terrorists, dangerous criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain – the Warnings Index system – was deeply ‘unstable’.

The report said border security was being undermined by staff shortages, while personal details on one third of the 106million people entering Britain every year are not handed over in advance, meaning nearly 40million do not undergo background checks before they land.

The audit’s results came as MPs warned border checks in Britain were so lax that the country was at the mercy of ‘easyJet criminals’ who fly in and out on the same day without detection.
