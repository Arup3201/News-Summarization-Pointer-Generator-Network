These fascinating photos of one of the most gruelling challenges on Earth were captured by a British volunteer who says Alaska’s unforgiving wilderness provided the perfect break from London life.

Emma Watson Mack endured freezing temperatures, whiteout conditions and powerful wind gusts while providing vital support to teams of mushers and huskies in the Iditarod trail sled dog race.

Billed as ‘The Last Great Race on Earth’, the annual competition sees some of the world’s best sled dog mushers travel 1,000 miles across Alaska in a treacherous contest that lasts more than a week.

Emma provided logistical support to the sled teams as they participated in the long-distance race from Anchorage to Nome.

Her snapshots of mushers, dogs and the elements provide an insider’s view of the event, held every year in March since 1973 in temperatures that can plummet to -50 C.

The 44-year-old said it offered a welcome break from the pace and stresses of life in London, where she worked as a marketing manager, before moving to Aberdeen.

It provided so much inspiration that she one day hopes to become a musher with her own team of dogs.

She said: ‘The mushers go through months of training, all for one race. It's incredibly tough. The route, which has 26 checkpoints, is 1,000 miles long.

‘The fastest teams complete the course in eight days. That means they cover more than 120 miles a day in extremely punishing conditions.'

Some teams take three weeks to get to the finish line.

'There is huge pride to be had in finishing, even if it takes a long time.’

She added: ‘There's a huge sense of competition between the mushers, because they've trained their dogs to such a high level. But there's also a huge amount of respect for each other. They're doing what no one else can.’

It’s especially gruelling for the huskies which pull the sleds across the frozen terrain. Each dog burns up to 10,000 calories a day and requires a high-energy food specifically-designed for the demands of a performance athlete.

The competition is so extreme that the mushers suffer from hallucinations. The most common one causes them to dodge and duck tree branches that aren’t even there.

Emma, a veteran of the Royal Artillery regiment, said she had dreamed about volunteering in the race for years.

She said: ‘After eight years of working in marketing and events management I finally decided to pack my bags and go.

‘Day-to-day life in Alaska took some getting used to. My biggest fear was that I would get stomped on by a moose. On my commute to work they would walk around Anchorage like they owned the place. Fortunately, all of the bears were in hibernation.’

One of her biggest thrills was being asked to usher legendary four-time Iditarod winner Lance Mackey to the starting line.

She said: ‘I couldn't believe it when I was asked to work with Lance. Despite losing teeth to throat cancer, and the amputation of his left index finger, he's won the Iditarod time and time again.

‘It was my job to make sure his dogs stopped right at the starting line before they embarked on the race. The dogs were incredibly eager to get going and if they crossed the line, there's no way they would have been able to reverse back.’

‘I would love to go out there again for the Iditarod trail sled dog race. One day I hope to be a musher myself with my own team of dogs.’

This year’s race, which begins March 7, will include Worcester's Rob Cooke, 48, and his wife, Louise, who will be braving the bitter cold with their main race team.
