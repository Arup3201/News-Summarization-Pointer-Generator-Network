Fast food giant McDonald's has suspended purchases of meat from a scandal-tainted US slaughterhouse after animal rights activists revealed alleged abuse of cattle in a horrifying undercover video.

The harrowing footage prompted officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to shut down the California plant operated by Central Valley Meat Co., which also supplied beef for regional chain In-N-Out Burger and the National School Lunch Program.

Officials say nothing they have seen so far in the covert video shows meat from apparently sick cows made it into the food supply.

However, In-N-Out Burger, the federal government and now McDonald's have all suspended purchases from the facility.

'McDonald's cares about how our food is sourced and we have a long history of 
action and commitment to improve the welfare of animals in our supply chain,' McDonald's said in a statement.

'There are behaviors in the video which appear 
to be unacceptable and would not adhere to the standards we demand of our 
suppliers.'

The percentage of meat purchased from the slaughterhouse was in the single digits, the chain added.

The
video was shot in June and July by an undercover operative for the 
group Compassion Over Killing who worked at the plant and also gave a 
written statement to the USDA about events not on tape.

It appeared to show workers bungling the slaughter of cows struggling
to walk and even stand. Clips show workers kicking and shocking cows to
get them to stand and walk to slaughter.

"We do know 
that workers were trying to make non-ambulatory cows not eligible for 
slaughter go to slaughter," said Erica Meier, executive director of the 
animal welfare organization. "We believe red flags are raised for sure 
with our video, but it's up to the USDA to decide."

It's against the 
law to slaughter a non-ambulatory animal - one that cannot walk by itself - for food out of concern it
could be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as 
mad cow disease.

The Hanford slaughterhouse is in the same city where
a dairy cow at a rendering plant was discovered in April to have mad 
cow disease. The USDA said earlier this month it was an isolated case 
and didn't pose a threat to the food supply.

Central Valley Meat Co. primarily slaughters dairy cows that have lost their value as milk producers.

The
USDA bought 21 million pounds of beef from the company in 2011 for the 
national school lunch and other federal food programs.

USDA spokesman Justin 
DeJong said he did not know to which government food programs the beef 
was allocated. The meat generally goes to the National School Lunch Program and food distribution on Indian reservations, and is available 
for discount purchases by community food banks.

In-N-Out Burger had previously suspended purchases after learning of the allegations of inhumane treatment.

The
New York Times reported that Costco Wholesale Corp. also suspended 
purchases.

Central
Valley Meat Co. has referred all questions to a public relations firm 
that issued a statement saying Central Valley Meat is cooperating with 
investigators and developing a plan to remedy any potential violations 
of USDA guidelines.

"Based on our own investigation and 30 years of 
producing safe, high-quality US beef, we are confident these concerns 
pose no food safety issues," the statement said.

The video shows one 
man standing on the muzzle of a downed cow. Other footage depicts cows 
struggling after being repeatedly shot in the head with a pneumatic gun.

Federal regulations say slaughterhouses must be successful with a single shot.

Other
clips show cattle with udders so swollen they are unable to keep their 
legs under them to walk, and workers trying to lift downed cattle using 
their tails.
