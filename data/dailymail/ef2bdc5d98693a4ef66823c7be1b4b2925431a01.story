Alan Tait was on a golfing holiday with a group of friends when he was drugged and attacked by the gang

A BBC sports presenter was left in a 'coma-like state' after being drugged and attacked by thugs while playing golf in Spain.

Alan Tait, who presents The Golf Show on BBC Radio Scotland, was on a three-day golfing holiday in the Costa del Sol when a gang spiked his drink with the horse tranquiliser ketamine, robbed him and left him for dead, on Friday night.

The 45-year-old, who is also the golf pro at Edinburgh's Marriot Dalmahoy Hotel and Country Club, had hundreds of pounds, his iPhone and his watch - a 40th birthday present from his parents - stolen in the mugging.

Mr Tait issued a stern warning to tourists heading out to similar destinations. He told Scotland's Daily Record: 'I’m a 6ft 2in guy who can look after myself. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.

'The Spanish police said they hear about this sort of thing all the time – but we rarely hear about it.'

He added: 'At least I came home alive. I just want people to know about it and be careful.'

He had spent the evening drinking in a bar with seven friends in the town of Puerto Banus, near Marbella, on Spain's popular Costa del Sol.

According to his friends, Mr Tait vanished shortly after 10.30pm and the golf pro has only snatches of memory before coming to at 8.30am the following morning, covered in blood with his clothes badly torn.

He took a taxi to the airport, where he was able to contact the police and his girlfriend, Katernia. After failing to show up at the golf course the following morning, his friends scoured the exclusive marina town before reporting him missing to the police.

The Costa del Sol, on the southern coast of Spain, is a popular destination for the 1million UK ex-pats living - at least part-time - in the country.

It is also a bustling tourist spot for UK holidaymakers, with 2.5million Brits visiting Andalusia, the region of Spain where the Costa del Sol is located, each year.

The golf pro and BBC presenter has warned people to be wary when visiting the area on holiday

There have been a number of high profile crimes in the sunny region over the last few years. The recent murder of British millionaire Andrew Bush, 48, took place at his Costa del Sol villa.

Just days before that, the body of Francis Brennan, 25, who fled the UK after stabbing a man at a pop concert, was found murdered having last been seen in the Costa del Sol town of Javea.
