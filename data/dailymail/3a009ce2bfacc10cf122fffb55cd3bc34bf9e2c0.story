'Drunk': Radu Cristea, 38, was carrying out pre-flight checks on his Airbus plane at Heathrow

A drunk airline pilot turned up to the cockpit of his jet to fly a plane, a court heard today.

Radu Cristea, 38, was carrying out pre-flight checks on his Bucharest-bound Airbus plane when he allegedly tested positive for alcohol.

Police swooped on him just half an hour before he was due to take off on the three-hour flight at 7am from London Heathrow earlier this month.

State-run Romanian airline Tarom was forced to cancel the flight, with 33 passengers on board, Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in Middlesex heard.

Appearing in a blue shirt and black overcoat at court today, the father of two spoke only to confirm his age and date of birth.

‘Police were called to the boarding gate at Heathrow Airport on February 6 this year,’ Sally Peters, prosecuting, said. ‘The defendant was about to pilot a plane. It was a Romanian airplane.'

She added: ‘I would invite you to commit this matter to the crown court.’

The captain, who lives in Romania with 
his wife and two daughters, aged three and 12, is an experienced pilot 
who has flown ‘many thousands of flights’, his barrister Neil Fitzgibbon
said.

Cristea, who has been grounded by his 
airline until the outcome of the case, was bailed to attend Isleworth 
Crown Court next month.

Bench
chair Brian Davis said: ‘The bench does agree that our powers are not 
sufficient and we will be committing this matter to Isleworth Crown 
Court on March 21.

'We are also happy to continue with unconditional 
bail.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
