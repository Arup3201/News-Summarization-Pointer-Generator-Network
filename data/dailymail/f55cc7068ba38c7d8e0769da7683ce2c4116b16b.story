On Saturday police in the small Central American country of El Salvador were not called upon to attend a homicide.

The Pacific Ocean country, which is sandwiched between Guatemala and Honduras, has been plagued by violence for years as rival drug gangs fight to gain control.

However, this weekend's murder-free day may be an indication that recent attempts to crackdown on the violent clashes may be paying off.

It is the first 'clear day' since President Mauricio Funes took office in June 2009.

Below is a list of the countries with the highest murder rates per 100,000 of the population in 2011:

1. Honduras - 86

2. El Salvador - 71

3. Saint Kitts and Nevis - 68

4. Venezuala - 67

5. Belize - 39

6. Guatemala - 39

7. Jamaica - 39

8. Bahamas - 36

9. Colombia - 33

10. South Africa - 32

In a statement released on Sunday the
left wing leader revealed the news.

He said: 'After years when the number of 
murders reached alarming levels of up to 18 per day, we saw not one 
homicide in the country.'

At the beginning of Mr Funes's term in
office there was an average of 12 murders a day, but that figure rose 
closer to 18 a day in early 2012.

Rival gangs operating in El Salvador 
called a truce last month and bloodshed between the country's two most 
powerful criminal groups, Mara Salvatrucha and Mara 18, has for the time
being at least abated.

El Salvador is one of a glutch of Central and South American countries that experience high murder rates.

Guatemala, Honduras and Belize also have some of the highest murder figures in the World and much of the blame for El Salvador's problems is being laid at
the door of Mexico's drug cartels which use the country as a transit 
point.

Poverty, lack of education, corruption in different areas of society and lack of money are also seen as possible causes.

Mr Funes, who attended this weekend's 
Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, hasÂ  claimed credit for 
the reduced levels of violence arguing that his government's security 
measures are responsible.

The president has recently ordered the military to pick up routine security duties.
