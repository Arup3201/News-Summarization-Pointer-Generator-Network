A state prosecutor in Florida has come under fire after offensive posts dating back months were found on his personal Facebook account.

Kenneth Lewis wrote about 'crack hoes' should get their 'tubes tied', how a young man who broke into a Florida home deserved to be killed by the homeowner, and how Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was an example of the dangers of affirmative action. 

The Orlando-based prosecutor has not publicly commented since the offensive posts were revealed but his boss, the state attorney, has put out a statement hinting at their veracity.

Under fire: Kenneth Lewis, who is believed to be 47, wrote controversial statements on his Facebook account but likely won't face any blowback from his job because of the First Amendment

Offensive: Lewis posted this rude note earlier this month and still has not taken it down

Outrageous: Lewis did not let his role as a lawyer and a state's attorney stop him from criticizing one of the country's highest judges

Lewis, who is married and believed to have at least one teenage son, does not seem bothered by the attention and his profile remains publicly open in spite of the scrutiny.

Weighing in on cases: 'Stand your ground' laws are particularly sensitive in Florida but that didn't stop him from speaking definitively on a new case

Jezebel reported that he has taken down at least one post- but it was not an offensive one: he posted a link to a local news story about his Facebook musings with the caption 'apparently a slow news day in Orange County' on Wednesday but it is no longer visible on his profile.

A collection of offensive posts remain, however.

One of the most controversial came two weeks ago on Mother's Day, when he took aim at women who he believes are neglecting their children.

'Happy Mother's day to all the crack hoes out there. It' [sic] never too late to turn it around, tie our tubes, clean up your life and make a difference to someone out there that deserves a better mother,' the post read.

Another of his posts attacks women, but this time taking aim at one of the most respected in the country: Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

On May 3, he posted a photo of Justice
 Sotomayor and wrote the following caption: 'Reason enough why no 
country should ever engage in the practice of Affirmative Action again. 
This could be the result. Where would she be if she didn't hit the quota
 lottery? Here's a hint: "Would you like to supersize that sir?"'

As if that did not get enough attention, he shared it with his 220 friends again three days later.

Lewis, who is believe to be 47 years old, regularly shares links to news stories and adds his take on the story in the caption.

Hot topic: Angela Corey was the special prosecutor for the Trayvon Martin case and was the one to push for a murder charge, which some cited as a reason why George Zimmerman was found not guilty

In action: Lewis works as a state prosecutor in Orlando and regularly tries murder cases

One example of that came in January when he shared a report about a then-19-year-old who was arrested for attempted robbery and was restrained by the homeowners with a taser and 'brute force' until police arrived.

'They should have shot him in the head, anyone that invades another home in a violent manner should be executed on the spot,' Lewis wrote.

Self defense and Stand Your Ground issues are particularly sensative issues in Florida especially in light of the Trayvon Martin shooting.

Lewis, who is employed by the state's 
attorney's office, didn't hold back from commenting on that case either,
 writing at one point that he thought Florida residents should be 
calling for the resignation of Angela Corey, the special prosecutor in 
the Zimmerman case.

Non-denial: He has not spoken publicly since the news broke but his office condemned his posts, making it clear that they were true

Free speech: Lewis regularly posted about people's right to free speech- even citing Donald Sterling and those who were outraged over homosexual NFL recruit Michael Sam's kiss as examples

In spite of the controversial statements, it does not appear that Lewis will face and formal reprimands as his supervisor already put out a statement both condemning and protecting Lewis' statements.

'I do not agree with the political sentiments expressed by (Kenneth Lewis) and I find some of the words he chose to be both offensive and dehumanizing. Political speech is protected by the first amendment of the United States Constitution and I do not police the private thoughts, views, or expressions of those in my employ,' state attorney Jeff Ashton said in a statement to local station WKMG.
