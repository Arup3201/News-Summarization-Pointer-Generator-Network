The world’s tallest man, 8ft 3in Sultan Kosen, has married his soulmate at a ceremony in Turkey, bringing a happy ending to his search for a bride.

Mr Kosen looked a picture of true happiness and pride as he walked hand in hand with his new wife, Merve Dibo yesterday. The besotted pair tied the knot in the southern Turkish city of Mardin.

The gentle giant had previously despaired of finding a soulmate who would prove a perfect fit.

So when the 30-year-old finally met, and fell in love with, Merve Dibo, he said it was nothing short of a miracle that she was just as taken with him.

In a bespoke suit and shoes, to fit his world-record sized body and feet, Mr Kosen and his wife were grinning ear to ear throughout their day of celebrations.

Towering 2ft 7in above his new wife, the part-time farmer was pictured without his usual walking stick as he danced the night away.

The couple were mobbed by well-wishers all eager to get a picture on their phones

Before meeting Miss Dibo, Mr Kosen 
had spoken of his difficulties in finding a partner, as most potential 
girlfriends were put off by his size.

But
yesterday the part-time farmer, who had ordered a custom-made suit and 
size 28 shoes for his wedding, said he was thrilled to have found ‘the 
person for me’.

Kosen, 30, has long been searching for a woman to share his life with, and had reportedly given up hope - until he met Ms Dibo

He added: ‘It was unfortunate that I could not find a suitable girl of my own size. But now I will have my own family and private life.’

Mr Kosen, who is one of only ten people ever to top 8ft, suffers from a rare disorder called pituitary gigantism, which causes his body to continually produce growth hormones..

Kosen also holds the Guinness World Record for the size of his 27.5cm hands and feet, which are recorded 36.5 centimetres - a massive size 28

He began shooting up at the age of ten, became the tallest man in the world in 2009 and finally stopped growing in 2011.

The all-time record holder was Robert Wadlow from Illinois, who died in 1940 measuring just over 8ft 11in.
