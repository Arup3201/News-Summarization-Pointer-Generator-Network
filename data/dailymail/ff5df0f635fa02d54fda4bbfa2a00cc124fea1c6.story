The Harvard student son of a Chinese power couple embroiled a murder scandal today hit out against claims of a lavish playboy lifestyle.

Bo Guagua spoke out for the first time since his father lost his job as a top Communist Party boss after his mother was accused of killing a British businessman.

The 24-year-old, who had been studying for a master’s degree at the Kennedy School of Government but is now in hiding, declined to comment on the probe.

Speaking out: Bo Guagua, Mr Bo and Mrs Gu's, son has publicly commented
for the first time since his parents came under investigation to deny 
rumours about a hedonistic lifesyle he is said to have enjoyed at Oxford

Party boy: Bo Guagua embraces two young friends in a series of snaps posted on the internet

One of lads: Bo Guagua, 25, centre takes part in
the kind of crude stunt with fellow students that is said to have 
heaped embarrassment upon his ambitious father

Prestigious: Mr Bo had been studying for a masters degree as Harvard Kennedy School of Government, above

But he hit out at claims that he had cashed in on his parents’ wealth and influence by spending more partying than studying while he was at Oxford University.

He became renowned for hosting champagne and shisha parties in his room at Balliol College, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics.

It was also claimed that his performance fell short of what was expected and he was made to sit ‘penal’ exams.

But in an extraordinary twist – and in an astonishing example the influence of his parents before their spectacular fall from grace – Chinese officials tried to intervene to prevent tutors from disciplining him over his lack of work, it is understood.

Accused: Gu Kailai is said to have confessed to and Neil Heywood are said to had an affair due to her husband's 'lack of passion'

However, Mr Bo – the son of former 
Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai and his lawyer wife Gu Kailai – did not 
refer to all these allegations.

In a statement published by the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, he:

In the statement, he said he felt 
compelled to provide ‘an account of the facts’ in response to 
speculation about his private life and family.  

He wrote: ‘Recently, there has been 
increasing attention from the press on my private life. As a result of 
these speculations, I feel responsible to the public to provide an 
account of the facts.

‘I am
deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no 
comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation.

‘It
is impossible to address all of the rumours and allegations about 
myself, but I will state the facts regarding some of the most pertinent 
claims.’

Claims: Former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, fled the city in February, is said to have revealed to American diplomats that Mrs Gu confessed 'I did it' three times

Questions: Chinese officials are investigating 
whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr 
Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left)

Allegations last week claimed that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial dealings with his lawyers in Britain

He also sought to 
dampen speculation about financial improprieties over his costly 
overseas tuition, explaining the fees had been covered by ‘scholarships 
earned independently, and my mother's generosity from the savings she 
earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer’. 

Before
Oxford, Mr Bo attended Harrow, the same the prestigious private school 
near London that murder victim Neil Heywood had studied at.

Mr
Heywood, 41, a business ‘fixer’ who had known the Bo family for a 
decade, was found murdered in a hotel in Chongqing in November.

Today, it was claimed that Mrs Gu, who was allegedly his mistress, had confessed ‘I did it’ to a former Chinese police chief.

She is said to have told Wang Lijun she was in the hotel room during the ‘gruesome’ poisoning, according to American diplomats.

Mr
Wang, who ran the city’s police force fled there in February, 
apparently in fear of his life, to the U.S. consulate in nearby Chengdu.

He is said to have told diplomats that
Mr Heywood was held down in a Chongqing hotel room in 
November and forced to drink cyanide.

Afterwards, Mrs Gu – the wife of 
former rising star Bo Xilai, who has been has been stripped of all his 
roles within the party - allegedly confessed to the crime.

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood 
was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but 
details of his demise are sketchy

Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan 
Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil
Heywood was found dead

‘Gu said ”I did it” three times to Wang,’ a diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph.

‘It was a gruesome scene. Heywood spat the cyanide out and they had to give him more.’

Mr Wang reportedly gave an almost 
identical account to the Chinese authorities after he left and these 
accounts have spread in official circles within and outside China.

Mr Heywood had, before his death, been 
raising cash to build an £80million shopping centre dedicated to British
goods.   

Mrs Gu is alleged to have started an 
affair with him after she was denied ‘any normal passion’ from her 
husband, Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar with contacts inside Mr Bo's 
circle, told The Times last week.

They are even said to have 
occasionally shared an apartment in the British seaside resort of Bournemouth, which was registered to Mrs
Gu, when he visited Britain.
