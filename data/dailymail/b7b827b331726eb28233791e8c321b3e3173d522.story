Troubled Hollywood star Charlie Sheen has launched a bizarre, racist Twitter rant at Barack Obama where he calls the President 'Barry Satera Kenya'.

Sheen, who starred in Platoon, Young Guns and The Three Musketeers, sent the tweet after President Obama chose Kansas for the NCAA college basketball tournament live on ESPN's SportsCenter.

The actor wrongly accused President Obama of failing to send official representation to the funeral of Major General Harold Greene who was killed in Afghanistan in 2014. In reality, the administration was represented by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Offensive: Charlie Sheen launched a bizarre twitter rant against US President Barack Obama

Prediction: The President was making his annual selection for the NCAA Men's basketball tournament

Bizarre: Sheen claimed the President refused to attend the funerals of soldiers but had time to talk about basketball

The bizarre tweet said, 'Barry Satera Kenya u won't attend a soldier's funeral uhkros da street that u kild yet u hav time 4 brackets? s a d'

Mr Obama's father, Barack Snr, was born in Kenya but met his mother while a student in Hawaii, where the future president was born.

One Twitter user defended the President, suggesting that Sheen 'avoid drinking the bong water'.

Others suggested that mentioning Kenya in his tweet was racist. 

Sheen, who famously entertains a number of conspiracy theories, has been a vocal critic of President Obama, criticizing his failure to sponsor armed guards in schools to prevent future massacres.

Last month, Sheen admitted that he would like to run for President himself, despite his well-chronicled problems with drugs, with his father Martin - who played the President in the well-known television show The West Wing - as his vice-President.

He said: 'I conducted a poll - it was like ten guys. In every situation - it doesn't matter the ethics scenario or the social scenario - when I say, "Hey, what if I ran for president?" It's a hundred per cent.'

'Guess who my vice president is? My dad.

'It would be Sheen and Sheen 2016. Running on a platform of truth and transparency. Seriously.'

Love: President Obama is an avid basketball fan and has been making his annual NCAA selections since 2009

The actor is a so-called 9/11 'truther' who believes in a range of implausible conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks 2011 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.

President Barack Obama predicted that Kentucky will remain undefeated during the NCAA tournament and will win the title.

The President is a massive basketball fan and has delivered his NCAA selections live on ESPN since taking office. 

However, despite the President's familiarity with basketball, he has not picked the correct national champion since his first year in office when North Carolina won in 2009. 

In 2010 he backed Kansas, who went out to North Iowa. 

In 2011, the President once again backed Kansas, who were defeated in the south west final. 

In 2012, Mr Obama switched to North Carolina, who were defeated by his previous team Kansas. 

In 2013, he backed Indiana, who were defeated by Syracuse

In 2014, the President threw his support behind Michigan State who were defeated by Connecticut in the eastern regional final 

2015: Kentucky

'I think Kentucky is going to take it,' Obama said later in the day. 'But, you know, I haven't won since my first year in office. ... So I wouldn't necessarily take my bracket and copy it.'

In 2009, he accused the US government of being involved in the attacks which claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people. 

He said that President Obama should reopen the investigation into the attacks.

Sheen accused the commission established to investigate the atrocity as a 'whitewash', claiming that 'the official 9/11 story is a fraud'.

He said the attacks were being used 'as the pretext for the systematic dismantling of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.' 

Sheen argued that former President George W Bush used the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to justify his subsequent invasion of Iraq.

He also accused the CIA of being in league with the then al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. 

He said: 'We cannot allow governments to continue to advance their political agendas by exploiting forged pretexts... the establishment is upset that the population is waking up to false flag terror.'

Sheen first questioned the events of 9/11 in 2006 when he said: 'It seems to me like 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 per cent of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory. It raises a lot of questions.'

In 2011, he voiced doubts about whether President Obama was born in the United States.

'For starters, I was f***** born here, how about that? And I got proof! Nothing Photoshopped about my birth certificate,' he said.
