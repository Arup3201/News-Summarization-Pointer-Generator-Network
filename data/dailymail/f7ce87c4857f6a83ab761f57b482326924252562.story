An exclusive coastal resort in Dorset has become so popular with Russian millionaires that a local estate agent has set up a branch in Moscow.

Until now, rich buyers from the former communist country have tended to snap up luxurious properties in central London.

But the exclusive seaside resort of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, is fast becoming a property hotspot for wealthy Russians.

To meet the demand, one Sandbanks estate agent has set up an office off Moscow's Red Square.They have also printed 10,000 glossy sales brochures in Russian to be distributed there.

Appealing to foreign buyers: Lloyds Property Group has opened a Moscow branch to handle the increasing number of wealthy Russians looking to buy property in Sandbanks, Dorset

Going all out: Lloyds has also produced 10,000 glossy sales brochures in Russian which will be distributed at its new office in Moscow

And at their office on Poole Harbour, Lloyds Property Group have employed a Russian-speaking member of staff to handle inquiries from the former Soviet Union.

Sandbanks is a sandy peninsula that measures just half a square mile yet has more than £80million worth of property currently up for sale.

It already has its own Russian oligarch - billionaire Maxim Demin who moved in after buying a 50 per cent share of Bournemouth's football club in 2011.

The famous Russian singer Valeriya, who has sold more than one million albums, has been seen house-hunting in the area as well.

Tom Doyle, managing director of Lloyds, said: 'There is definitely a market for Russians, there's no question about it.

Harbour Watch: This £7.45million property has a seven-car underground garage, a digital cinema system and six bedrooms

'Normally areas like the South of France and Dubai are popular with Russian buyers, but England is seen as a safe place for them and it's all about selling the dream.

'We are trying to encourage Russian people to move a bit further south than just London or St Georges Hill in Surrey.

'Most of our magazines in Russia are online but we have also shipped around 10,000 over there. They are also in hotels out there like the Ritz-Carlton.

'We have opened an office in Moscow and now have a Russian desk in Poole and already there has been an awful lot of interest, which has been growing for around five years.

'Sandbanks is a great location and ticks all the boxes for the Russians, they like boats for example, and you have Poole Harbour on the doorstep.

Harbour Edge: This property used to be a fifties-style bungalow, which was bought by John Lennon in 1965 for £25,000 for his Aunt Mimi

'Areas like the Cote d'Azur are very popular places for them to visit and the area has some fantastic beaches, we have our own Cote d'Azur in Dorset.

'Sandbanks also has some lovely architectural style on the waterfront properties and some wacky houses too, and its those sorts of trophy homes the Russians look for.'

Sandbanks is the fourth most expensive place in the world to buy real estate after New York, London and Tokyo.

The average house costs 522,242 pounds, although some of the harbourside mansions can seel for up to 12 million pounds.

Celebrities who live in the area include football manager Harry Redknapp, his son Jamie and cricketer Geoffrey Boycott.
