Boris Johnson is under increased pressure to declare a return to the Commons after senior ministers declared it would be 'wonderful' to have the London mayor back as an MP.

Speculation has been rife that Mr Johnson will make a pitch for a safe Commons seat in the 2015 general election – a year before his term as London mayor expires.

Allies of Mr Johnson have suggested he could return as a backbencher and continue as London mayor because running the capital was as much work as one of the great offices of state.

'Soap opera': Senior ministers have declared it would be 'wonderful' to have Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, back in Parliament

Backbench Tory MPs have been frustrated by the endless 'soap opera' about Mr Johnson's ambitions, warning it was a distraction from the local and European elections.

But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Foreign Secretary William Hague both said he would be a welcome addition to the Conservatives in their fight to win an outright majority in 2015.

Asked if Mr Johnson could return to the Commons to lead the Tories, Mr Hunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'Well that would be wonderful. But the point is of course it takes longer than people would like, but I think the British people understand that Rome wasn't built in a day and we will get there but we have to have patience.'

A source close to Mr Hunt insisted he had misheard the question and was simply welcoming the prospect of Mr Johnson coming back to Parliament rather than speculating on him replacing David Cameron.

Mr Hague also hailed Mr Johnson as 'one of the great figures of our party' but signalled he would expect Mr Johnson to abide by his pledge to focus on being London Mayor.

'I have always been a tremendous fan of Boris Johnson and the rest of us in parliament would welcome his return to parliament as well as his continued commitment to the great job that he does as Mayor of London but that is for him to decide when and how he does that,' the Foreign Secretary told Sky's Murnaghan show.

Mr Johnson has told friends he will declare whether he will stand in the general election this summer.

He is expected to pledge not to take a Cabinet post for the year he remains London Mayor if he makes a comeback as an MP.

Running the capital is the equivalent of holding a big Cabinet post, his allies have said.

David Ruffley, a Conservative MP (Bury, St Edmunds), said he believed Mr Johnson would return to fight the next election. 'He should because he's done a great job running London. I think he could come back in a Cameron Cabinet after 2015...you want your stars in your government,' he told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics.

Mr Ruffley added however that Mr Johnson should not just be seen as a rival leader to Mr Cameron. 'I think he could occupy any number of cabinet posts. This idea that it's either Cameron or Boris is a false logic. You could have Boris back in the Commons running a big department of state, why not?'

But ahead of being re-elected mayor, Mr Johnson pledged not to hold down two jobs.

He said: 'If I am fortunate enough to win I will need four years to deliver what I have promised. And having put trust at the heart of this election, I would serve out that term in full.

'I made a solemn vow to Londoners to lead them out of recession, bring down crime and deliver the growth, investment and jobs that this city so desperately needs. Keeping that promise cannot be combined with any other political capacity.'

He has been advised by his former spindoctor and the PM's current spin chief, Lynton Crosby, that he needs to stick to his word if he wants to be taken seriously.

Mr Johnson's friends have said the way to square that is to have him ruling out taking on any big Cabinet jobs while running London.

They told the Sunday Times: 'That will go down well with people and it won't look like he is breathing down Cameron's neck. Boris can see that makes sense.'

The Prime Minister has already said he would be happy to see Mr Johnson back in the Commons at the next election.

But MPs have urged Mr Johnson to stop dithering. Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, said: 'Undoubtedly, he would be a great addition to parliament, but he needs to get on and decide what he is doing if he is to be taken seriously.'

A spokesman for the Mayor would not be drawn on speculation about his future.He told the Mail: 'The mayor is concentrated on three things: delivering for London, campaigning to return Conservative candidates in this May's elections and helping to return David Cameron as Prime Minister of a majority Conservative government in 2015.'
