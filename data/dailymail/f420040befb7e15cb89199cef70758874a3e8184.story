Plants could be given ‘passports’ under radical proposals to stop the spread of disease and prevent a repeat of the ash tree crisis.

Government scientists want every plant sold in Britain and the EU to be inspected and provided with labels to guarantee they are free of pests and blight.

Staff in garden centres would be responsible for issuing the ‘plant passports’, with Government inspectors visiting twice a year to conduct audits of random batches.

If the legislation is passed, it would mean any nursery failing to comply with the passport system would not be allowed to operate.

The proposal came as emergency talks in Downing Street yesterday failed to produce a strategy to deal with the ash tree dieback crisis.

As reports emerged of the fungal disease spreading to Kent, the environment secretary emerged from the Government’s Cobra crisis committee meeting and stated that more analysis was needed before a solution could be found.

Last night, critics dismissed the plant passport proposal as ‘academic’ and called for the Government to take urgent action to save Britain’s ash trees instead.

Gardeners would foot the bill for the passport scheme, which would see all safe plants issued with a label to certify they are healthy, and all unsafe plants destroyed.

The idea was outlined at another meeting of scientists by David Slawson, leader of the tree health programme at Defra’s Food and Environment Research Agency.

He said: ‘Plant passport involves nurseries issuing a label which would then be stuck to the plant pot. If we protect plants this way, we will be in a better place in the future than we are now.’ He added the passports would be issued for all specimens that are ‘for planting’ – referring to potted plants rather than cut flowers and fruits.

If the proposal is adopted, every country in the EU would be asked to have inspectors overseeing the issue of passports.

Plants coming in from outside the EU are already required to have a certificate to prove they are safe, and a European plant passport system already exists for high-risk plants such as fruit trees, rose trees and rhododendrons.

Mr Slawson said the new plan would simply mean rolling this out further – with the cost of the extra bureaucracy passed on to the customer via the grower.

But Tim Briercliffe, of the  Horticultural Trades Association, said: ‘Even if you have a plant  passport, you can only sell the  plant in a pest-free area or else it may be re-contaminated.

‘It’s a bit academic at the moment, although it’s a possible help once pest-free areas have been created.

‘As for passing the cost on to the gardener, it’s not an effective way to raise funds. The Government needs to take responsibility for it.’

Yesterday’s Cobra meeting of ministers, experts and officials heard  that a mass survey of 3,000 areas in Britain would be carried out to produce a clearer picture of the extent of the threat from ash dieback. Environment secretary Owen Paterson said afterwards: ‘We have had an assessment of the state of the disease.

‘We also had an assessment of the current survey, where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the United Kingdom.

Scientists are warning that the disease, which has destroyed 90% of all the Ash Trees in Denmark, could repeat the catastrophe that struck the nation's elm tree population in the last century, from which it has still not recovered.

‘We also had a presentation  on possible solutions – at the moment we do not have a cure  for the disease – and also measures we might take.’

The Forestry Commission will report back to Mr Paterson next week with a final report on how far the blight has already spread.

Thought to have originated in Japan, the disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to ash tree death. It has already wiped out up to 90 per cent of ash trees in some areas of Denmark.
