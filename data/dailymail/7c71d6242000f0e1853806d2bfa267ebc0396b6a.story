Muhammad Ali was sent back to hospital on Thursday for follow-up care related to a severe urinary tract infection, his second stint in the hospital in the past four weeks.

The three-time former world heavyweight champion was admitted to an undisclosed hospital earlier this week, Ali family spokesman Bob Gunnell revealed on. Ali is in stable condition.

Ali was hospitalized on December 20 with what was initially believed to be a mild case of pneumonia. Doctors later determined Ali was suffering from a urinary tract infection, not pneumonia, Gunnell said.

'There were still issues with the urinary tract infection,' he said of the latest hospitalisation.

The man known worldwide for his boxing prowess and humanitarian work has been spending his time listening to music, reading and watching old movies, Gunnell said. Ali is expected to be released Friday.

Ali turns 73 on Saturday and hopes to spend it at one of his homes with family, Gunnell said. Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Paradise Valley, Arizona; Berrien Springs, Michigan; and in Louisville.

The 72-year-old former boxer has suffered from Parkinson's since the mid-1980s

Gunnell said he expects Ali's birthday to include watching the Louisville-Duke men's college basketball game. Ali is a Louisville native, and the Muhammad Ali Center - which showcases Ali's humanitarian causes and boxing career, including his epic fights with Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman - is a popular attraction in Kentucky's largest city.

Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he wages his long-running fight against Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and devoted himself to social causes. He has travelled the world on humanitarian missions, mingling with the masses and rubbing elbows with world leaders.
