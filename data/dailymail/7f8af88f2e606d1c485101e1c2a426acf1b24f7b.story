One name will continue to dominate Formula One this weekend as hopes and prayers sit with Jules Bianchi, who remains in intensive care.

The Marussia driver suffered a horror 110mph accident into a recovery tractor in the Japanese Grand Prix last Sunday and remains in a stable but critical condition inside Mie Hospital in Yokkaichi.

And the Formula One circus hasn't forgotten the French driver, with the 25-year-old's name taking a place above the garage in Sochi where Bianchi would have otherwise expected to have been this weekend for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix.

Bianchi's absence from the Russian Grand Prix means Marussia could field just one car with Max Chilton

All teams have their drivers' names above the garage at every race, but organisers have decided not to remove Bianchi's from the pitlane as Marussia weigh up whether they will replace the Frenchman for the event.

Alexander Rossi could jump into the cockpit for the team who could also send out one car driven by Max Chilton, Bianchi's team-mate, while Marussia could even pull out of the event.

Marussia Manor Racing GP3, which competes in the GP3 Series and is part of the Marussia F1 Team Young Driver Programme, will not participate in this weekend’s event in Sochi - although the team insist it is for commercial reasons.
