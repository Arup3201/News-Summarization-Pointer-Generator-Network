A woman who kept a book about female murderers next to her bed stamped her boyfriend to death when she become fed up with his messy habits.

Maxine Oliver, 45, was jailed for life for murdering 37-year-old Carl Jones after he came home drunk and spilled beer on the carpet of the flat they shared.

On the night he was killed, neighbours of the apartment in Ash Vale, Surrey, heard Oliver screaming: ‘Do you want me to kill you? Do you? Do you?’ followed by a loud banging noise.

The court heard how Mr Jones, who walked with a stick following a previous injury, suffered brain damage, broken ribs and a crushed larynx – injuries police said were consistent with being repeatedly stamped on.

Oliver was jailed after being convicted at Guildford Crown Court and was told she must serve a minimum of 17-and-a half years behind bars.

She had denied murder and throughout her trial insisted someone else must have been responsible for Mr Jones’ fatal injuries.

She complained to the court that Mr Jones had been stumbling around inside the apartment and spilled beer on the carpet after she had cleaning up.

Sentencing the defendant, Judge Critchlow said Mr. Jones was a heavy drinker who consumed strong lager on a daily basis.

‘You became less and less tolerant of him and wanted him out of the flat.

‘It is clear that you were in a temper when you carried out the assault from which he died.’

Judge Critchlow added that the victim was 11-and-a-half stone, while his murderer was 16 stone.

Richard Button, defending, said that there had been genuine affection between the couple.

He said: ‘My client became less and less tolerant of him and more and more frustrated at his excessive drinking.

‘The situation culminated in a terrible loss of temper by my client.’

Neighbours
testified that they heard Oliver berating Mr Jones for coming home in 
an drunken state, hours before he met his death on the night between 
March 1 and March 2 this year

Scenes
of crime officer, Nicola Devlin, said a book called ‘Deadlier than the 
Male: Ten true stories of women who kill’ had been found in the 
defendant’s bedside drawer.

Mr
Jones was found dead and naked in the hallway of the flat and his 
clothes were found in a washing machine still damp - an analysis found 
traces of blood on them.

When
the sentence was announced members of Oliver’s family shouted abuse at 
the relatives of her former boyfriend, and ‘are you happy now?’.

Oliver was sentenced to life at Guildford Crown Court after a jury found her guilty of murder

During the trial it was revealed that a police officer, Richard Phillips, was dismissed after failing to follow proper procedures.

At one point Mr Phillips was said to have stepped in a pool of blood which was then tracked outside the flat as Mr Jones’ body was removed.

The Court was told that there was a failure to ensure that no blood ended up on the floor and that Mr Phillips had neglected to change his soiled overshoes because there was not another pair available.

In addition, Jurors heard that items found by the investigating team were not dealt with correctly - leaving open the possibility that they were contaminated by other factors.
