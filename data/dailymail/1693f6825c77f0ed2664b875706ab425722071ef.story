One 92-year-old man proves it's never too late to tell someone you love them.

Last year, Howard Attebery of San Diego married Cynthia Riggs, the woman he spent a summer working with in 1950 and instantly fell in love with. 

The two never got together during that summer because Riggs had a boyfriend, but Atterbery continued to think about what could have been. 

They reconnected 62 years later when Attebery sent Riggs a love letter out of the blue.

Now the husband and wife live together in Riggs' home on Martha's Vineyard, making up for lost time.

Young love: 92-year-old Howard Attebery (left) and 82-year-old Cynthia Riggs (right) met in 1950 but never ended up dating. The two reconnected more than 60 years later when Attebery sent a coded love letter to his former crush. Pictured above at their wedding last year

Correspondence: Attebery and Riggs worked one summer in 1950 and would write notes to each other in the office in code, on sheets of paper towels. Attebery sent Riggs a letter in February 2012 in the same code, saying 'I have never stopped loving you'

Age gap: Riggs (left) and Attebery (right) pictured around the time they met in 1950. Riggs was 18 and Attebery was 28 

However, Riggs was hesitant when she first received the love letter in February 2012.

Popping the question: The couple met again in person in May 2012 and within an hour Attebery had asked Riggs to marry him. She agreed and they were married a year later (one of their two ceremonies pictures above)

It was written in code and on paper towels, but she soon remembered the way she used to pass notes with Attebery that summer, when she worked at a geology lab sorting plankton.

At the end of that first note, Attebery wrote that he had 'never stopped loving' Riggs, according to the Boston Globe. 

Unsure of what to think of the gesture after more than six decades apart, she showed the letter to her writing group who mostly agreed that it was romantic.

So Riggs started writing Attebery as the two caught up on their lifetime apart.

Both had married and had children, but ended up single. Riggs divorced her husband and father of her five children several decades ago. Attebery divorced his first wife and his second wife died.

He worked as a microbiologist as well as a dentist and photographer.

Before becoming a mystery novelist, Riggs worked as a science journalist, boat captain and was the seventh woman to set foot on the South Pole.

They also talked about their first summer together, with Attebery revealing that he fell for Riggs from the first moment he saw her.

She admits that she always thought of him as an older brother, since she was 18 at the time and he was 28.

By May 2012, they both organized a trip to meet in person, with Riggs flying out to Southern California.

But before the trip, Riggs expressed worry about whether he would be disappointed with her older body.

'Of course I remember the THEN Cynthia, but is it the NOW Cynner [her nickname] that is with me. You are the one,' Howie said. 'NOW is the person I love and not the shadow of the past . . . but she sure set the stage and what a beautiful introduction.'

Happy ending: The couple now live together at Rigg's home on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts 

Dedicated: The couple admit that their time together is limited, so they keep their romance alive with little gestures 

Attebery met Riggs at the train station, holding a single red rose and within an hour, asked Riggs for her hand in marriage and she agreed.

The next year, Attebery had moved out to Martha's Vineyard and the two were married in both a Buddhist and church ceremony. 

This summer they took a paddle-wheeler down the Mississippi River as a honeymoon.

Since they are both getting on in years, they make sure to keep their relationship alive with little gestures, like Attebery writing 'I Love You' on his wife's banana peel for breakfast.

'We realize we have limited time,' Riggs told the Globe. 'It’s unrealistic to think too far ahead. And so all the things that would have bothered me as a young woman don’t bother me anymore.'
