Turkey's defiant prime minister gave a speech from the top of a bus today making it clear he has no intention of backing down in the face of 10 days of anti-government protesters.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again condemned his opponents as ‘looters’.

However, he also asked his supporters not to engage in any violence, predicting that his party would defeat those who oppose it during local elections in March.

Tension: Mr Erdogan appealed to his supporters on Sunday: 'Don't allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so'

Erdogan blamed the anti-government protests on forces that oppose Turkey’s progress.

Still by far the country’s most popular politician, Erdogan has pressed ahead with government business as usual.

'My beloved brothers, we’re walking towards a better Turkey. Don’t allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so,' he told a crowd of supporters at the airport in the southern city of Adana.

Three people, including a police officer, have died in widespread protests that erupted May 31, after a police crackdown of a small sit-in by environmentalists in Istanbul.

Yesterday protest organisers called for demonstrations to keep up pressure on the government to sack those responsible for a violent police crackdown and to abandon plans to redevelop a central Istanbul square.

'Islamist agenda': Protesters say that Mr Erdogan is becoming increasingly authoritarian

Tens of thousands of Turks massed in Taksim Square late on Saturday, where riot police backed by helicopters and armoured vehicles first clashed with protesters a week ago, some chanting for Erdogan to resign.

What began as a campaign against government plans to build over Gezi Park in Taksim Square, spiralled into an unprecedented display of public anger over the perceived authoritarianism of Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party.

Police fired teargas and water cannon at protesters night after night in Istanbul and Ankara last week, in clashes which have left three dead and close to 5,000 injured.

The organisers of the initial protests in Taksim, calling themselves Taksim Solidarity, repeated their call for the redevelopment plans to be abandoned, police use of teargas to be banned, those responsible for police violence to be dismissed and bans on demonstrations to be lifted.

“The demands are obvious. We call on government to take account of the reaction (on the street), act responsibly and fulfil demands being expressed by millions of people everyday,” the group said in a statement.
