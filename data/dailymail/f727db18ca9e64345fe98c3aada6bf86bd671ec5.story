A Family Feud contestant left host Steve Harvey and fellow competitors reeling when in answer to the question 'Name something you know about zombies', she slammed the buzzer and blurted out: ‘Black.’ 

‘They're black. Okay…,’ said African-American presenter Harvey who was barely able to suppress his laughter as he turned to the board.

'I don't know if they're white... or... 
I... just... probably,' Christie fumbled perhaps sensing that her 
bizarre answer could be construed as racially charged.

Family Feud contestant Christie shocked host Steve Harvey in the latest episode when she gave a bizarre racially charged answer to a question about zombies

As the audience howled, the camera panned over to Christie's laughing competitors, the Pierce family - also black.

Christie attempted to break the tension by clapping while looking up at the board. 'It's up there! It's up there!' she said. 

Harvey, with his back to the camera, deadpanned: 'You shut up, lady.'

The
 host then laughed and yelled: 'The black zombies!' as a big red X 
signaled that 'black' was not one of the top six responses among those 
surveyed.

Comments on 
the Family Feud YouTube video range from 'that's uncomfortable' to a 
defense of Christie's answer based on the belief that zombies are rooted
 in Haitian voodoo culture.
