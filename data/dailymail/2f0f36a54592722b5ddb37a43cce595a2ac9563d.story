Facing life: Former NFL star Sam Hurd was arrested by undercover police after trying to buy large amounts of cocaine and cannabis to distribute around the Chicago area

A former NFL wide receiver faces a possible life sentence in a federal courtroom today for his role in a cocaine and cannabis distribution scheme.

Sam Hurd pleaded guilty in April to one count of trying to buy and distribute cocaine and marijuana after being arrested in a police sting outside a Chicago steakhouse.

Authorities say that while NFL teammates and friends knew Hurd as a hardworking player and married father, he was fashioning a separate identity as a wannabe drug kingpin with a focus on 'high-end deals' and a need for large amounts of drugs despite being on a $5million contract.

Hurd claimed in an interview published yesterday that he sold marijuana to his Dallas Cowboys teammates, but didn't ask for any profit, and smoked during the last three to four years of his career 'all day, every day.'

'I'm in the NFL, and I'm gonna ask people for a few hundred dollars on top of what I paid for it? Nah,' Hurd told Sports Illustrated. 'Slide me what I got it for and take it. Enjoy it.'

Today, Hurd will enter a Dallas courtroom with his future in tatters as he faces possibly spending the rest of his life in prison.

The charge carries a minimum 10-year sentence, but prosecutors may push for a sentence up to life.

His December 2011 arrest outside a Mortonâ€™s steakhouse in suburban Chicago came after he tried to buy a kilogram of cocaine in what turned out to be a sting.

According to a federal complaint, Hurd told an undercover agent that he wanted 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine for $25,000 per kilogram and 1,000lbs of marijuana per week to distribute in the Chicago area.

He claimed he was already distributing 4kg a week, according to the complaint. A kilogram is about 2.2lbs.

At the time, Hurd was a wide receiver with stints for the Bears and Dallas Cowboys who had played most of his five seasons on special teams. He was in the first year of a three-year contract reportedly worth more than $5 million.

The Bears soon cut him. Hurd was 
released on bond and returned to Texas, where he grew up, but soon fell 
into trouble again, according to court documents.

He allegedly tried to buy more cocaine and marijuana through a cousin, Jesse Tyrone Chavful, and failed two drug tests.

That led a magistrate judge in August 2012 to revoke his bond and order him returned to jail.

In
April, when the tall, lanky Hurd stood before a judge in an orange 
jumpsuit and pleaded guilty, he asked to address the court.

'I'm sorry for everything I've done,' he told the judge.

Cowboys
coach Jason Garrett, asked Tuesday about Hurd's claims he sold drugs to
teammates, declined to comment 'because I just don't know anything 
about that.'

Cowboys defensive tackle Jason 
Hatcher, a former teammate of Hurd's, called Hurd a 'great guy in the 
locker room' and a 'great teammate.'

'It's very shocking to hear,' Hatcher said. 'But as far as everybody smoking in the NFL, I don't know.

'As
long as you keep your business, whatever you do off the field is your 
business. I really don't know what to say about that situation.'

Intent to distribute: Hurd wanted to purchase up to 10kg of cocaine each week

One of Hurd's attorneys, Jay Ethington, has said that Hurd was given no promise of leniency for pleading guilty and avoiding trial.

Sentence recommendations from prosecutors and Hurd's attorneys are sealed, though attorneys for both sides are expected to make their case before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis today.

Chavful and another co-defendant, Toby Lujan, have both pleaded guilty to being involved in the conspiracy.

Solis, who will sentence Hurd, gave Chavful eight years in prison for a much smaller role in the scheme. Lujan will be sentenced in January.

There is no parole in the federal system, though inmates can typically apply for early release after completing 85 per cent of their sentences.

According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the average sentence handed down for drug trafficking cases in Texas' Northern District, where Hurd is being prosecuted, was about nine-and-a-half years between October 2011 and September 2012, the most recent period for which statistics are available.
