The future King could be visiting the former home of The King of rock and roll this weekend – as Prince William and a newly single Prince Harry are expected to jet into Memphis for a close friend’s wedding.

The royal brothers are reportedly flying to the US to attend London nightclub owner Guy Pelly’s nuptials on Saturday to American-born Elizabeth Wilson - the granddaughter of Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson.

After a successful three-week trip to New Zealand and Australia, it’s believed Kate and Prince George will be staying in the UK.

Double trouble: William and Harry are expected to jet off together to Memphis this weekend

Wedding venue: The Memphis Hunt and Polo club where Guy Pelly is to marry Elizabeth Wilson on Saturday

Close friends: The royal brothers are expected to attend the wedding of Guy Perry and Elizabeth Wilson

And Cressida Bonas, who was expected to attend, will no longer be joining the brothers after her split from Prince Harry was revealed yesterday.

Taking place on Saturday, the high-society wedding ceremony is being held at the private Memphis Hunt and Polo Club in Tennessee - in 200 acres of landscaped countryside – which is close to the bride’s family home.

However, the three-day celebrations – of which William and Harry are said to be attending two – are expected to start on Friday night, with a visit to the former home of Elvis Presley, Graceland.

The iconic property, which has been a tourist attraction for 32 years, has helped transform the city into a top destination for music fans, with more than 18 million visitors through its doors.

Legend: Elvis belts out one of his hits during a performance in 1972

The royals will have the chance to have a tour of Graceland, wandering the Jungle Room, with its green shaggy carpets, the Trophy Building which houses all The King’s awards, as well as the luxury living room – all decorated with furnishings from the eras Elvis lived in the property.

They will wander the nine-bedroom colonial revival-style mansion, where the All Shook Up star lived with his family for 20 years – buying it for his parents for $100,000 in 1952.

Elvis died on August 16, 1977, and by the early 1980s, Graceland had become a burden on his estate, but his wife Priscilla Presley secured an investment, promising to keep the singer’s legacy alive.

William, Harry and the Pelly wedding party are also expected to head to Beale Street in downtown Memphis to dine and have drinks. 

The road, which had been known for the blues since the early 1900s, is now a bustling tourist attraction, featuring music-themed bars, shops and restaurants.

The princes have reportedly been told to keep a low profile during the trip. Nightclub entrepreneur Guy Pelly is reportedly considered a ‘bad influence’ on Prince Harry, and even arranged the Duke of Cambridge’s stag do. 

Other royals who will attend the wedding include Princess Beatrice and Eugenie.

Although Prince William and Harry are only staying in Memphis for two days, there's a host of bars, restaurants and attractions they could visit.

Memphis Mayor A C Wharton said the city was gearing up for the Royal affect.

'We are working on the presumption that the Royals will be here in Memphis this weekend,' he added. 'We are taking all precautions to be prepared.'

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said it did not comment on private engagements.

MailOnline Travel has put together its pick of top choices for holidaymakers thinking of following in the princes' footsteps and heading to Memphis...

As the royal brothers head to Memphis this weekend, MailOnline Travel and Virgin Holidays look at the tourist attractions they should be visiting...

Shop like The KingIf you know your Prada from your Gucci, your Armani from your Versace, chances are you’re a style guru, so before you head out on the town, shop in style, just like Elvis did, at the Lansky Bros. Here you’ll find the best in high-end menswear (and maybe even the perfect wedding suite) plus see styles that were designed for Elvis himself.

Place your bets: Head over to Horseshoe Tunica in Memphis to play in the casino

Eat like a prince...Fancy winning a free meal to soak up the night ahead? Then stop by the Kooky Canuck for big burgers, beers and some of the best hearty food around. And for those feeling brave, take on the ‘Kookamonga Challenge’. If you can chow-down the 7.5 pound, 12,387-calorie strong ‘Kookamonga Burger’ in under 60 minutes (with no help!), the meal‘s free, as is a place on the wall of fame.

Dine on the best ribs...If a burger doesn’t cover it, double up and head for Charles Vergos’ Rendezvous which many argue offers the best charcoal ribs in town (since 1948). Fans include Memphis’ second son Justin Timberlake, rocker Mick Jagger and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush. 

A right royal drinking session...Swap the traditional American sports bar for The Flying Saucer Draught Emporium in downtown Memphis to sample the likes of Chocolate Truffle, Dark Side of the Moon and Hummingbird Water  - they’re just a few of the 200 beers available on tap.

Royal tour: Visit the Sun Studio in Memphis where Elvis recorded

Put on those blue suede shoes...For the best after-hours fun, try The Silly Goose Lounge, where accepting shots from staff and singing along to power ballads are official bar rules. Or try the Lamplighter Lounge, a dive bar with Fifties-style booths, then hit the dancefloor at Paula & Raiford’s Disco on Second Street.

Bets please...Feeling the urge to throw some dice and try to win a round or two? For the best casino in town, try Horseshoe Tunica.

Breakfast like a king...Indulge with an All-American breakfast. Stop by retro diner The Arcade for breakfast and if you can brave getting there early enough, you might even be lucky enough to bag Elvis’ favourite booth at the back. For a taste sensation, try the southern favourite, sweet potato pancakes.

It's all about the blues...It's all about the music in Memphis, so head for Beale Street and visit BB King’s Blues Club, all while keeping an eye out for the urban acrobatic sensation, the Beale Street Flippers, who can often be found standing on one hand wowing the crowds with their moves. For the ultimate slice of music heaven, stop by the legendary Sun Studio, the birthplace of Rock n’ Roll, where Elvis and Johnny Cash both recorded.
