Paul Pogba's elder brother Mathias has signed for Crawley Town.

Former Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra striker Mathias was a free agent after leaving Serie B side Pescara and has joined on a deal until the end of the season.

The 24-year-old Guinea international, whose brother Paul is starring for Juventus, also has a twin, Florentin, playing for St Etienne .

Mathias' brother Paul, pictured playing for current side Juventus, is one of the world's best midfielders

Paul (Juventus and France) - Serie A: 2012–13, 2013–14, Italian Super Cup: 2012, 2013

Mathias (Crawley and Guinea) - No major honours  

'Mathias can play anywhere across the front or out wide so he gives us options,' interim boss Dean Saunders told Crawley Town's website.

'He’s got all the attributes and he has proved before he can score goals at this level. I think he could make a big contribution for us over the next few months.' 

Pogba is in contention to make his Crawley debut at Yeovil Town's Huish Park on Saturday while his brother takes on Italian giants AC Milan just hours later - and the forward has been given the club's No 28 shirt.

Mathias has decided to keep it in the family by joining Crawley as the League One outfit share the same nickname as Paul's former side Manchester United. 

Paul joined Juventus in 2012 after failing to break into then manager Sir Alex Ferguson's first team plans 

Paul left United for Juventus in 2012 after failing to hold down a first team spot at Old Trafford.

Crawley themselves were extremely active on their own Twitter account on deadline day.

One tweet, accompanied with a photo of the chairman's car-parking space and a taped-on 'SERGIO AGUERO' name badge, read: 'Close to getting our man! Hopefully the Chairman's car parking space seals it... #DeadlineDay.'
