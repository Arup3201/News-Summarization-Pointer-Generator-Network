Rupert Penry-Jones has just come back from Hollywood.

Brits are having a bit of a moment over there on critically acclaimed shows like The Americans, Suits and Masters Of Sex, and Rupert has the sort of leading man good looks and posh accent that should have them rolling out the red carpet for him.

The only problem is, well... it didn't go brilliantly.

Rupert Penry-Jones says that living in California can make you feel like a failure

'I went to meet up with a few people but it's put me off for another few years,' says Rupert.

'I don't like the way that place makes me feel. When you go out to California, unless you're a movie star, you feel like a failure and I don't want to feel like a failure. If they call me, of course I'd do it, but I'm not going to go banging on doors. It's too demeaning and humiliating. I do want to work on an American show; the best of their TV is the best in the world at the moment. But I'm not going to beg.'

He didn't come away from LA completely empty-handed - he won a small part in the second series of a pirate drama called Black Sails - but he seems a little underwhelmed by it.

'I like to go into a series from the beginning and this is the second series,' he shrugs. 'I don't know what's going to happen to my character but it was fun to film; I got to spend a few weeks in Cape Town with my friend Toby Stephens, who's also in it.'

Normally at this time of year Rupert, 43, whose mother is To The Manor Born's Angela Thorne and whose father Peter Penry-Jones was an actor too, would be filming Whitechapel; but that was axed by ITV at the end of last year. He admits he's still surprised and a little bit angry that the channel didn't let the gory detective drama have a fifth and final series.

'There was such a great storyline in the last series that it was a shame not to let us finish it off properly,' he says. 'Even if it was just a two-parter to explain what series four was all about it would have been good.'

When it began in 2009, Whitechapel attracted ratings of over 8 million but series four last year got just over 3 million, and Rupert wonders whether it was simply because people didn't want to watch grisly goings-on while it was sunny outside.

'ITV put the last series out at the end of the summer holidays; if I was a viewer I wouldn't want to watch Whitechapel then,' he says. 'So we didn't get off to a great start and with ITV it's all about the viewing figures.'

We meet not at ITV, but at the BBC's swish central London HQ to discuss the new series of courtroom drama Silk. It's Rupert's first day at work for a while - he's been 'resting' as they say in the business.

Not that it sounds that restful. He's taken over childcare duties while his wife Dervla Kirwan appears in West End play The Weir, which means doing the school run for their children Florence, ten, and Peter, seven, every day. 

When I last spoke to him he told me he can be a little obsessive about tidiness, saying, 'I enjoy cleaning and tidying, Dervla's more chaotic. I think anyone would have OCD if they lived with my wife.' Today he admits he struggled to adapt to the way she ran the house.

'To begin with it was a nightmare. It took me about two or three weeks to get into it and now I feel like the house is running correctly. What was wrong before? Well, we have completely different styles of running the house. I just didn't understand how she did it that way. Let's leave it at that.'

On to Silk, the third series of which got off to an explosive start last week when Rupert's character Clive finally made QC and then declared his love for his rival Martha, played by Maxine Peake.

Clive's changed a bit over three series, and Rupert says he approves. 'He's a bit more grown up and doesn't want to go to bed with everything that moves. He spends the first half of the new series in love with Martha, then he starts to realise it's not going to work and he has to get on with his life. He also gets more emotionally involved with some of his cases; it's something I asked for. I felt that if Clive never gets involved with them there's not much drama in it. He's a little bit less cut-throat but he still has that edge to him.'

This year there are two new characters; his old Spooks friend Miranda Raison plays strong-willed office manager Harriet Hammond, who's determined to conflict with clerk Billy, and bright new trainee barrister Amy Lang, played by Jessica Henwick.

There's also a real battle going on within the chambers; between those who want it to become a prosecution-only practice and those who want it to retain its defence work.

Rupert was surprised and angry when Whitechapel was axed by ITV last year

The intelligent courtroom drama regularly attracts audiences of over  5 million but - perhaps bitten by his Whitechapel experience - Rupert says he worries this could be the last series.

'I love the show - the cast members and the fabulous dialogue - but it feels a bit like the writer Peter Moffat has thrown a bomb in at the end. It could go on, but it feels like everyone is blasted in different directions and no one knows where each other is. We don't know whether it's been written this way because he wants to finish it off, or whether he thinks it can still continue. None of us knows.'

'If you stay in the same show for too long
 you might never get another one because people will only think of you 
in that role. It's taken years for people to stop calling me Adam Carter'

But Rupert says that, regardless of the writer's intentions, he isn't sure whether he'd come back for a fourth series.

'It would depend partly on what Peter says, but three years is a long time to stay in one role. If you stay in the same show for too long you might never get another one because people will only think of you in that role. It's taken years for people to stop calling me Adam Carter (his Spooks character, and the role that made his name) and it can hold you back.'

He sits back and mulls over the dilemma all actors face; whether to take the job and risk being pigeonholed, or not take the job and struggle financially.

'I'm holding off for something different and new and good,' he sighs. 'When offers come in your insecurity comes through, especially when you have a family. You need to make sure you can pay the bills. But I'd like to play something completely different. I'd like to not have to wear a suit.'

Silk, Monday, 9pm, BBC1.
