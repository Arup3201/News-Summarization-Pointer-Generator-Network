A leading climate change scientist had been banned from driving for two years after she got drunk and drove at an oncoming police car while on her way to a New Year's Eve wedding.

Lecturer Dr Cath Waller, an ecologist  who has spend eight weeks in a tent in the Antarctic wilderness, got behind the wheel while three-times over the drink-drive limit, the court heard.

Police, who were forced to swerve when she drove them 'at speed', pulled her over and said she was too drunk to stand and had to 'cling' to the passenger door of her Vauxhall Astra.

She then told officers: 'I have been stupid. I have had a drink and I should not have done it', the court heard.

Banned: Lecturer Dr Cath Waller, an ecologist who who has spend eight weeks in a tent in the Antarctic wilderness, cannot drive for two years after she got behind the wheel while three-times over the limit

Dr Waller of Scarborough, admitted drink-driving at Scarborough Magistrates' Court, but in mitigation said she had been struggling with depression after the break-up of her marriage. 

She was banned from the roads for 24 months with her licence revoked and placed on curfew for 16 weeks.

But her plea to take a group of students on a research field trip to Scotland in March was ignored by magistrates. 

The court heard she was more than three times the drink drive limit when she set off to attend a friend's wedding in a Yorkshire village on New Year's Eve.

Evidence: Police pulled her over and said she was too drunk to stand and had to 'cling' to the passenger door of her Vauxhall Astra

She was spotted driving her Vauxhall Astra 'at speed' in the middle of the road by the officers coming the other way.

The 49-year-old global warming expert made no attempt to get back onto her side of the road, Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard.

Prosecutor Catherine Turnbull said: 'The officers were driving and noticed the Vauxhall Astra ahead. It was driving at speed in the middle of the road.

'The police officer driver had to take action and drove close to the kerb to avoid the vehicle hitting them. They followed the Astra along the road. It speeded up and slowed down and was weaving across the road.'

The patrol car crew then pulled over Waller who 'looked tired and was speaking slowly' and they told her to get out.

Ms Turnbull continued: 'She was unable to stand alone and was clinging to the passenger door to support herself.'

She then told the officers: 'I have been stupid. I have had a drink and I should not have done it. I was going to friend's wedding but turned around when I realised I could not do so.'

Waller, a lecturer at the Scarborough campus of Hull University, had been stopped only a short distance from her home at 9.20pm on New Year's Eve.

A breath test revealed 109 microgrammes of alcohol - 'just over three times' the legal limit of 35,

Caroline Wyatt, defending, said: 'She was held over night and released the following morning - quite a daunting experience.

'She is thoroughly ashamed to find herself before the court and has now lost her good name.'

Ms Wyatt said Waller had planned to spend New Year's Eve alone and had been drinking from the afternoon into the evening.

Incident: The academic was spotted driving her Vauxhall Astra 'at speed' in the middle of the road by police officers coming the other way

A colleague was getting married on New Year's Eve and wanted Waller to come. At first, she said 'no' because she had been drinking - but then changed her mind for reasons she 'could not explain'.

Ms Wyatt said that Waller had already realised 'it was a foolish thing to do' and has already turned around before she was stopped on Deepdale Avenue, Scarborough.

'She is a lecturer at the university. They are fully aware of what has happened and are fully supportive of her,' Ms Wyatt continued.

Pleas: The court heard the university wanted Waller to take a students on a field trip to Scotland in March - but magistrates rejected their request

'She is managing to hold onto her employment and there is no suggestion of any wrong-doing at work in respect of alcohol.

'There is no suggestion she will lose her employment. I have to accept there are aggravating features, especially the level of the reading.'

Waller made a name for herself as a woman scientist who did not flinch at spending eight weeks living on the Polar wilderness in a tent.

But Ms Wyatt said Waller had suffered depression following her marriage break up.

She was trying to patch things up with her estranged husband and spending a lot of time at his address in her home town of Keighley, West Yorkshire. 

The court heard the university wanted Waller to take a students on a field trip to Scotland in March.

But presiding magistrates Pam MacFie said: 'We are not making any dispensation for the time set aside for your trip.'

Waller did her PhD with the British Antarctic Survey.

Her doctoral research investigated the ecology of the Antarctic intertidal zone, the animals that live there and the adaptations they have developed in order to survive in the face of climate change.

She has made several further trips to Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands where she spends upto eight weeks at a time in a tent.

She spent three years as a lecturer in Ecology at Brighton University before moving to Scarborough in March 2010 to take up a post as a lecturer in Marine Biology.
