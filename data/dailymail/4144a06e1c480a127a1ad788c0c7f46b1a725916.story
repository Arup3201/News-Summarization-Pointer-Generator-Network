If Argentina do confound what would appear to be growing opinion and lift the World Cup for the third time on Sunday, do not expect to find coach Alejandro Sabella in the middle of the post-match party.

Sabella, 59, is not the type to get too close to his players. He is a tactician, a coach, rather than a  gregarious man of the people.

More pertinently, by the time the final whistle blows on this tournament, Sabella will no longer be Argentina’s boss, having announced his decision to resign on Saturday after a campaign he feels has been hampered by interference from his own FA.

‘He has just had enough,’ said a source in Argentina on Saturday. ‘He just wants to coach but with Argentina it’s not always that easy. There is too much meddling.’

Sabella — a quiet man known to suffer from self-doubt — has certainly cut one of the more peculiar figures of this World Cup.

So far, his most memorable moments have been one which saw him squirted in the face with water by Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Ezequiel Lavezzi during a break in play against Nigeria and when he almost stumbled backward into his own dugout after seeing Gonzalo Higuain hit the bar against Belgium.

Both incidents added apparent credence to a popular view that Sabella is a rather comical figure, a patsy at the head of a squad that is actually controlled and organised by star player Lionel Messi.

Sunday’s final, however, affords ‘Alex’, the former Leeds and Sheffield United midfielder, the opportunity to prove his own credibility once and for all.

Juan Sebastian Veron, the former Manchester United midfielder who played for Sabella at Estudiantes de la Plata, said: ‘If we win this then everybody will have no choice but to become Sabellistas. Never mind the score on Sunday, Sabella has done his bit and he will leave an important part of himself in this team.’

The fact that Veron found it necessary to speak up for his former coach on Saturday says much for Sabella’s image issues.

The notion that Messi effectively runs the team is a popular one and the Sabella’s doormat image was certainly not helped by his failure to punish Lavezzi for embarrassing him on the touchline.

However, sources close to the Argentina squad insist that the Messi theory does not stack up. Not only did Sabella cut one of Messi’s friends, midfielder Ever Banega, from his final 23 for Brazil, he dropped another, Fernando Gago, after the laboured last-16 win over Switzerland in Sao Paulo.

The change of team shape and tactics that followed that unconvincing extra-time victory flew in the face of the attacking formation that Messi is supposed to have insisted on. But the changes bore the hallmarks of a thinking man’s coach simply doing his work.

‘He transmits quality to the team,’ Veron added. ‘He is very concerned with detail, preparing for each match by going over anything that could happen. He is really intelligent and has managed to get Messi operating to his potential levels after the highs and lows of before.

‘But, importantly, that has not come at the group’s expense.’

Known as ‘The Slowcoach’ during his playing days — a reference to his lack of pace — Sabella did not become a coach in his own right until 2009, by which time he was already 54.

Previously, he had served as assistant to former international team-mate Daniel Passarella with Argentina and then clubs in Italy, Uruguay, Mexico and Brazil.

Taking over at Estudiantes five years ago, there were doubts over whether his dour public persona would lend itself to the role of  figurehead. He immediately won the Copa Libertadores (South America’s Champions League), following up with the Argentine Primera Division a year later.

Estudiantes were also one minute away from winning the FIFA Club World Cup against Barcelona in 2009, only to concede an equaliser in the final minute and an extra-time winner to none other than Messi.

In Rio on Sunday, Sabella can make the ultimate statement, to leave a mark that can never be erased. Cult figure Maradona, leader of a haphazard Argentina campaign in South Africa four years ago, said just 10 days ago that ‘things look bleak for Argentina’.

That comment came just after the Switzerland match. Since then a coach’s coach has made his mark, whether people wish to believe it or not.
