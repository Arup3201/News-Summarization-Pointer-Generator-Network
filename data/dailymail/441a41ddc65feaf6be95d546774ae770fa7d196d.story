A disgraced accountant who was given a second chance as a church treasurer after he claimed to have 'found God' has been jailed after stealing £30,000 from parish funds. 

David Barras, 61, was appointed treasurer at St Christopher's Church and St James Church in Bradford, West Yorkshire - despite having been jailed for 12 months in 1992 for stealing £10,000 from the Citizens Advice Bureau.

Members of the Tong and Holme Wood Parochial Church Council decided to give him a second chance because he was a Christian and had been a member of the congregation for eight years.

But after he was appointed thousands soon began to go missing from the church coffers. 

A court heard Barras took a £10,000 bequest from a former church organist and  scores of donations from parishioners where two thirds of congregation earned the minimum wage.

The qualified chartered accountant, a father-of-three,  then spent some of the stolen money on a car.

Barrat's deceit was exposed when he was confronted by vicar Rev Steve Davie after his predecessor found a parish bank statement with large cash withdrawals showing on it.

Barras initially claimed he had 'borrowed' the money but it emerged up to 83 illicit transactions had taken place.

He later said started taking small amounts from the church account as 'a temporary loan' but the amounts increased and, in May alone, he pocketed £8,300. At the time Barras lived on benefits. 

Bradford Crown Court was told the stolen money was badly needed by a struggling parish that ran at an annual deficit of up to £8,000. 

In an area where two thirds of the 179 parishioners had incomes of under £10,000 a year,  Rev Davie said people saw the church as a trusted refuge, and that trust was now compromised by the thefts.

Barras who has diabetes and mobility problems pleaded guilty to theft and was jailed for two years and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. He said he 'spiralled into debt' after his previous conviction left him unable to work as a chartered accountant.

His wife Wendy, 49, pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after she transferred £500 from the church group's bank account to the personal account of her husband at a time when he was in hospital. She was conditionally discharged for 12 months and was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge.

Passing sentence Judge Peter Benson said: 'This church is in a community that is deprived and has a high crime rate. 

'People turn to the church feeling that they can mix with people they can trust and it was a refuge from the harsh realities of life in the immediate area. You breached the trust of parishioners, who had made sacrifices to give money to the church.'

After the case, the Rev Davie who campaigns against payday loan companes said: I was very pleased about what the judge said about finding the victim impact statement very moving and I was pleased that I was able to express, on behalf of the churches, the impact of the breakdown of trust that I am sure can be rebuilt.

'We are very sorry that this has all come about and sorry for Mr Barras's family, who knew nothing about this.'

Barras' son Jonathan Barras, 25, said: 'He brought all this on himself.

'We can't support him after what he's done. He duped mum into it and she has to be our priority now, making sure she will be okay.

'Dad betrayed the church and us - he has no excuse.'
