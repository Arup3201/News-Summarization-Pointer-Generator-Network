Alan Pardew was always confident the day would arrive when calls for him to be sacked would quieten - and he has likened Newcastle United’s revival to building IKEA furniture.

The United boss - whose wife is Swedish - says that he went back to basics amid a seven-game winless start to the season which saw fans protest against his employment.

Pardew, though, has since led the Magpies to three straight victories and will bid to extend that run when they entertain Liverpool in front of the live television cameras at lunchtime on Saturday.

And the 53-year-old has given an insight into his thinking during the perilous period in which his side were stuck to the bottom of the table.

‘You've got to box it down. It's a bit like one of those IKEA furniture packs you buy,’ he said.

‘You can't try and get to the end, you've got to do all the little bits to get there and it takes time. I've done a few of them because my wife's Swedish.

‘It's about doing that little bit first, and if you get that wrong, the second bit doesn't work. If you get the second bit wrong, the third bit definitely isn’ t working and the tabletop is all over the place.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew believes his side now have serious 'momentum' going into Liverpool clash

‘I think it's very important, if you're in the managerial world, that you actually segment it down and just say, “Right, what's our problem, what do we need to do, what needs to happen at this football club to turn us from what we are to a better team?”.

‘We did a review of how we were getting at teams and how they were getting at us. That helped us and I think we've put some blocks in place that gives us something to hinge on to.’

It speaks volumes that Pardew is able to offer such light-hearted metaphor, for just four weeks ago there was no scope for levity.

A website - SackPardew.com - had attempted to mobilise fans into forcing the manager out of the club.

As one supporter on social media joked this week, perhaps they will change the domain name to BackPardew.com in light of the turnaround.

Pardew, though, never lost faith in his own ability.

‘As an experienced manager, I’ve had times like that before,’ he said.

‘Not perhaps with the scale of the media criticism that I was receiving, but I’ ve had results like that at Charlton and West Ham, and you have to try to find a solution.

‘If you don’t believe you’re strong enough as a character to find a solution, then don’t do the job. I’m confident I can do this job, and I was always confident I could turn it around.’

The 2-0 victory at Manchester City in the League Cup in midweek arrived on the back of wins at home to Leicester City and at Tottenham Hotspur. Another maximum return in Saturday's early kick-off would take them into the top half of the Premier League.

And Pardew went on: ‘I’ve always thought the same since I first became a manager - momentum is the key to success in sport.

‘I give the example of Andy Murray. You can see at the moment that he’s entered tournaments that might not normally be on his agenda, but he wants to win them because there’s a big one coming up at the end of the season and he wants to be in form for it.

‘I think that’s how managers approach every game. You want to build momentum, and we have great momentum at the moment. There’s no way we could have won at Manchester city if we hadn’t won at Spurs. I honestly believe that.’

From Scottish tennis players to Swedish flat-pack furniture, Newcastle’s recent rally has certainly turned the table for their boss.
