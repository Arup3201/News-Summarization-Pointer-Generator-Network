A daughter who reportedly abandoned her mother in deplorable living conditions has been arrested and charged with abuse. 

Melissa Self, of Louisville, Kentucky, was taken into custody after her 63-year-old mother was found covered in 'bedbugs, fleas, feces and urine.'

The woman claims she had been left alone for days, and was discovered by a neighbor as she was crying out for help from inside her home.

Unlivable: The home (above) had trash covering almost all of the floors

Unsanitary: What's more, authorities found dirty diapers and waste everywhere

Teams were forced to then enter the home in HazMat suits to remove the woman, and noted that the 'living areas were covered in trash, bugs, dirty diapers and feces.' 

'It was just real deplorable conditions in which she was living,' Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Dwight Mitchell told WAVE.

Self, 42, has now been charged her with neglect of an adult.

Self's daughter however, Ashley Wagner, is disputing these claims, and demanding that her mother be released from jail. 

Wagner says her mother was always present and that the home was not as 'filthy' as authorities are claiming, this even though photos from the scene seem to back up their claims.

Trash is everywhere, there is no room to walk, and the conditions to not look at all livable for anyone, let alone an elderly person.

Hard to get by: The 63-year-old woman, who has not been named, was covered in fleas, feces, bedbugs and urine

Unimaginable: She was found after calling for help and said she had been alone for days

Can't breathe: Authorities had to wear HazMat suits in order to remove the woman

None of that seems to make a difference to Wagner though, who continues to play the role of dutiful daughter.

'My mom is not responsible for what a grown woman does. Ya'll need to let her out. She didn't do anything,' pleaded Wagner.

'She's got a bond for $5,000. Look where we live at. We can't afford that.'

Denying claims: Ashley Wagner (above) the victim's granddaughter, claims that they are the victims of her grandmother's mistreatment

What's more, Griffin claims she and her mother were the victims of mistreatment from her grandmother.

The two woman will no longer have to worry about that however, as the elderly victim has been placed in a nursing home. Self, meanwhile, remains behind bars.
