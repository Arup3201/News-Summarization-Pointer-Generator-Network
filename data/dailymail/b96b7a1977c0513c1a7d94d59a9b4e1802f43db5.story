Steven Pienaar has revealed Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta is the most skilful player he has played with.

The Everton wideman singled out his former Toffees team-mate for praise during a question and answer session on the Merseyside club's Twitter page.

The Midfield duo spent four years together on Merseyside before Arteta departed for Arsenal in August 2011.

High praise: Everton's Steven Pienaar has revealed Mikel Artets is the most skilful player he has played with

Full of tricks: Arteta spent six years at Goodison Park before moving to Arsenal in the summer of 2011

Asked by a fan 'Who is the most skilful player you have played with at Everton, past or present?', Pienaar joked: 'Myself! No, I'll say Arteta. Everything seemed to come so naturally to him.'

Arteta dazzled the Everton faithful after joining from Real Sociedad in 2005 while Ross Barkley and Kevin Mirallas, members of the current Blues squad, love to show off their skills.

Pienaar, who has a few tricks of his own, has forged an almost telepathic partnership with left back Leighton Baines down the wing at Goodison Park and helped Roberto Martinez's side finish fifth in the Premier League last term.

The 32-year-old, who made his name at Ajax, also revealed he used to share a room with Zlatan Ibrahimovic during their time together in Amsterdam.

Asked how good the Paris-Saint Germain frontman was, Pienaar said: 'He wasn't bad! And I think he's got better as he's got older. He's one of the best I've played with. He was my roommate!'
