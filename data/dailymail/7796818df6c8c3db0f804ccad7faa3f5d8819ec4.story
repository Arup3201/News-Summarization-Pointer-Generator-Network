A 'talented' teenager who stood up at a council meeting to speak out against gun crime has been shot dead at a house party.

Ravon Jordan, 19, made a speech to local officials in Fayetteville, North Carolina, about gun violence and the crime-riddled apartment complex Cambridge Arms.

Just six weeks later, he was  killed during a vicious gun battle between rival gangs just four miles away from the violent property.

'Talented': Ravon Jordan, 19, spoke up against gun at a council meeting in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Six weeks later he was shot and killed during a shootout between gangs outside a house party 

Scene: He was shot along Raeford Road, just four miles away from the violent Cambridge Arms 

According to the Fayetteville Observer, he was hit while sitting in a car with friends outside the party.

Police are now searching for a number of suspects who are said to have fired 70 shots between them during the confrontation.

They have released CCTV footage of a group of men standing in a petrol station  hours after the shooting. 

Ravon spoke softly to local officials during his two-minute public forum spot in May. 

The youngster approached the podium, after being welcomed by the city clerk, and said: 'I came to speak on behalf of Cambridge Arms. 

'I feel that due to lack of security and lack of care for people who pay their bills and have to live there, I believe that Cambridge Arms should be shut down.

'I don't think as a resident you should be paying for your grave site. You shouldn't be paying to be killed or murdered in your own house.

'When you move into a house you shouldn't expect to die. Since I have known about the Cambridge Arms, there have been four murders due to gun violence.

'It's crazy. Security guards notice you playing music or standing outside. But they don't notice gun shots or broken windows

'It is just very backwards in the mind. If I heard gun shots, first thing I am calling the police.

'If I hear music, it is probably just someone in the house cleaning up, probably taking a shower.

Suspects: Police have released CCTV of men in a petrol station believed to be connected with the shooting

'I feel like it was a great loss for our family and those who have lost someone because of a lack of security at Cambridge Arms.

'The lack of the thought given to the people who pay their bills and people who live there. I just wanted to say, I think they should be shut down.

'It's no excuse for you to have as many problems in your apartment complex as they have had.'

The audience in the chamber started to laugh when he concluded by saying: 'Like my sister said, changing the name is not going to change the violence at all. 

'You could still put lipstick on a pig but it is still going to be a pig at the end of the day.' 

Councilman Larry Wright has said the teenager's words resonate around the community. 

'The violence can spread quickly from one neighborhood to the next neighborhood, and I don't think we can pinpoint one area,' he said.

'But we need to pinpoint those few that [are] making it bad for the many.

'Now I feel we're obligated and responsible as community leaders and the community at large to hear that young man's voice from the grave, if you will.' 

The Fayetteville Police Department said they have already received information in relation to Jordan's death, but they do not have anyone in custody.
