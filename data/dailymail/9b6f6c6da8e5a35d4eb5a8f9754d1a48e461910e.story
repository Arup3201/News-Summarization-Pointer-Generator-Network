Kevin Pietersen has insisted his offer to play against England during their tour of Australia next week is a serious one.

England are due to face a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra on Wednesday as a warm-up to the tri-series against India and Australia, and Pietersen said he was keen to replace Mike Hussey, who has been forced to withdraw with a calf injury.

"In the Prime Minister's game on Wednesday, Mr Michael Hussey's missed out. Jeez, I fancy that," Pietersen said on the players' microphone while playing for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League, screened by Sky Sports 2.

Commentator Adam Gilchrist, the former Australia wicketkeeper, asked: "Are you telling us you're available?"

Pietersen replied: "Mate, I'm always available."

As if to prove a point, Pietersen went on to hit a run-a-ball 49 in his team's nail-biting victory over the Melbourne Renegades.

Andrew Flintoff, who is playing for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash, responded to Pietersen's comments on Twitter.

"If @KP24 plays for the primeministers XI they'll need a turnstile at the bowlers end, they'll be queuing up," he tweeted.

Former England teammate Andrew Flintoff is clearly keen on granting former captain Pietersen his wish 

Later, responding to comments on Twitter that his offer to play was "banter" with the commentators, Pietersen said: "No it wasn't. I want to play. I'd smash it! End of!"

He then tweeted Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, saying: "Dear @TonyAbbottMHR - I'm available x."

The 34-year-old was sacked by England almost a year ago, but has been on hand with regular barbs ever since a confidentiality agreement between the two parties expired.

His explosive autobiography included many unhappy reflections on his international career, not to mention claims of a bullying dressing room culture.

Pietersen supposedly covets an unlikely Three Lions recall, but the South African-born batsman again used the press conference as a chance to settle scores with his former team-mates.

He claimed his lucrative Indian Premier League contract caused resentment and he prefered playing in the BBL, where many players participate in franchise cricket in other countries.

"There's no jealousy here. That's the fact," he said of life with the Stars.

"None of these guys are jealous of anything. We're just good guys, hanging out and playing cricket. All these guys play in franchises around the world, they've all benefited from the IPL.

"The England lads - too much jealousy. I was the only one profiting - very, very well - out of India and in an auction, if you don't get picked up, it's pretty demoralising."
