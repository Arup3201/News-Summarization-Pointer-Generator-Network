The mother of Two and A Half Men star Angus T Jones 
has spoken out to say he is being 'exploited' by his church after he branded his hit show 'filth' in an extraordinary religious rant.

Carey Jones, 42, told MailOnline she was worried for her famous son. 'I'm concerned he's being exploited by the church,' she explained, but refused to comment further. 

The 19-year-old - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake - was seen urging fans to 'turn off' in a new video for the Forerunner Chronicles.

In Angus Jones Testimony, he says: 'If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching. I'm on Two and a Half Men and I don't want to be on it.'

Bizarre outburst: Angus T Jones calls his hit show Two and a Half Men 'Filth' in a video clip posted online

In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult'

Jones has been on the show since he was 10 and It is unclear if he has tried to quit the show. The exact details of his contract have yet to surface.

His comments are likely to attract ire from the show's co-creator Chuck Lorre and his bosses at Warner Brothers, who are yet to comment.

The teen's outburst continued: 'Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say itâ€™s just entertainment.

'Do
 some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I 
promise you youâ€™ll have a decision to make when it comes to television 
and especially with what you watch on television ... it's bad news.'

He adds: 'If I am doing any harm, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be contributing to the enemy's plan.

'You
 cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like 
that. I know I can't.

'I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the bible 
says and being on that television show.'

Chronicles in his trailer on the Warner studio lot, where his series is 
filmed.

In the video the young star laughs nervously as
 he admits his worried family have likened his recent 'awakening' to 
the Seventh-day Adventist movement to joining a 'cult'.

'Of course all my family, not all my family, but some of my 
family were like "he's going to a cult" trying to tell me to get out of 
there,' said Jones.

'But I didn't feel like I was being fooled, I could study it for 
myself. Its there in the bible and there's no evidence for the opposing views.'

Found a home: Jones' search for religion has seen him become a member of the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church in California's San Fernando Valley

Jones' comments are just the latest 
crisis for the show, which was put in jeopardy when its original star 
Sheen was fired and replaced by Ashton Kutcher after attacking Chuck 
Lorre amidst a storm of bizarre behaviour.

The show has since struggled to maintain its high ratings.

Jones talks about his education in the 'basic messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church', a Protestant Christian denomination which is marked by its observance of the Sabbath on a Saturday.

Members are discouraged from purely secular activities on the Sabbath, instead spend the day worshiping. Preparations begin on the Friday night at sundown.

The official teachings of the denomination are expressed in its 28 Fundamental Beliefs, which Jones revealed he was studying.

Jones' 'testimony' was released by the ForeRunner Chronicles.

According to a tweet for The Forerunner Chronicles Jones is now a 'soldier for truth'.

They
 state on their Facebook page: 'The Forerunner is dedicated to 
proclaiming the truth that you need to know. "To live and die for the 
truth" is the moto [sic] and Jesus Christ is our general.

'He gives the orders... we put in the work! No questions asked.'

The
 ForeRunner has previously released a series of 11 videos entitled the 
Jay-Z Deception, which chronicle the 'darkness' of pop stars like the 
Rihanna and argue that they are 'antagonistic to Christianity'.

Having peeked at 28.7million viewers when
 Kutcher made his debut, ratings have slipped hitting a recent series high of 13.6million when 
Miley Cyrus guest starred in an episode.

Jones has appeared on Two And A Half Men since 2003 and received a pay rise in May when the show was renewed for a tenth series.

But he complained of reduced storylines, telling E! Online last month: 'My character does Skype calls. He only 
does one scene Skype calls... It's easy
 but it's boring.'

In a further testimony on the 
Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy, Jones revealed that he felt his role in Two And A Half Men was an opportunity to spread his beliefs to a wider audience.

'I am confident I am there for a reason,' he said.

'I don't think I would
 be on the show this year if God hadn't pushed me into it because 
otherwise I genuinely didn't want to do another year of the show.

'I'm so
 thankful to be there its a lot of fun and God will get the glory out of
 it.'

Jones also revealed that he found the 
church during a difficult period in his life.

With
 his parents going through a divorce, he began spending as much time as 
possible out of home and admits he experimented with drugs.

'When
 I look back now I see that... the enemy was trying to push my in a 
different directions but God... pulled me out right at the last second,'
 he said.

'I was running away from that situation. Slowly that led to drugs. I never drank. And I'm still a virgin so God protected me from those things.'

He described how the Holy Spirit spoke to him through a friend and he accepted Jesus into his life. He then went about the process of finding a church.

In his ForeRunner Chronicles video Jones explained that a schoolfriend 
introduced him to the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church, where he felt at home.

'I really started to get into reading
 the bible and I started to look for a church to go to. Every Sunday I 
was going to like three or four churches, I was just looking for the 
right church,' he said.

And he added: 'I was looking to go to
 a church with an all-black congregation,' explaining that he had 
imagined himself as a member of a gospel church.

'The first day I went there I went by myself and I walked in and
 sat down at the back... It was just like, that was my church.

Special guest: Angus T Jones gives his testimony in a video posted online on Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy

Speaking out: Angus describes how his parents divorce, coupled with doubts about his future, led to his life heading in a difficult direction until he was saved by finding religion

'Then I started the bible work at the
 church. And I was like this is really awesome, it seems so much more 
appropriate and it was right from the bible.

'I just kept learning the basic 
messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and every single time I was
 learning all this new stuff and I was just loving it.'

Jones also explained that he had begun observing the Sabbath.

A spokesperson for Jones was not available for comment on the status of Jones' contract when contacted by Mail Online.

While he may have raised eyebrows with his outspoken views, by finding religion Angus T Jones has avoided following in the criminal path of close family members.

The young actor's uncle, Eric Eugene Claypool, is currently serving a
 99-year prison sentence for murder after shooting a man he claimed had 
sexually abused him.

According to prison documents on 
November 16, 1994, Claypool, now 38, stole a .357-magnum from 
31-year-old Jay Harlan and shot him in the back of the head.

Criminal past: Police mugshots show Angus' parents Carey and Kelly Jones

And Jones' family made headlines when mugshots emerged of his parents, Kelly and Carey Jones, taken in their former home of Travis County, Texas.

His mother Carey, Claypoolâ€™s sister, was arrested in 1992 for ripping the meter out of a taxi and then punching a police officer in the face while she was drunk.

Then in 1997 she was arrested on a burglary charge after a woman woke to find Carey in her living room.

Jones' father Kelly, now 50, was arrested in 1986 for possession of marijuana and carrying an unlicensed .45-caliber handgun after he created a disturbance in a bar.

In 1997 Carey had Kelly arrested on an assault charge after he allegedly pulled her out of a car and pushed her to the ground. 

She later dropped the charge, but Kelly was ordered to complete an anti-violence class.
