A father spent nine days in a coma with his skin blistering and peeling off his face after taking ibuprofen for flu. 

Jason Ryan, 28, from Washington, near Sunderland, suffered the severe allergic reaction which is believed to have been sparked by taking the over-the-counter drug.

The bizarre condition is known as Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake's.

Jason Ryan, 28, from Washington, near Sunderland, suffered a severe allergic reaction which is believed to have been sparked by taking the over-the-counter drug ibuprofen

The disorder affects just two people in every million, but can be fatal if left untreated.

The traumatic series of events started when Mr Ryan who works as a Nissan production worker was suffering from flu-like symptoms in May last year.

Having taken ibuprofen in the past and suffered no reaction, Mr Ryan and wife Claire had not made the link to the drug when he began to develop blisters.

Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It was named after two U.S paediatricians who described it in 1922.

It affects around two people per million and is more common among women.

Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids.

If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage.

Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug.

Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas  to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable.

Mrs Ryan said: 'He already had this rash, like shingles, and he was taking ibuprofen every four hours. It was all over his legs and his back, I knew it wasn't a sweat rash.

'He was taking the ibuprofen and the next day his feet came up in blisters like tennis balls.'

Mrs Ryan, mother to seven-year-old Brooke, immediately called for an ambulance but was told to head to her nearest walk-in centre.

'We should have known then,' said she said. 'We were then told to go to the hospital.We could see it progressing; his skin was blistering.'

The couple rushed to hospital where Mr Ryan was diagnosed with the potentially fatal condition.

One in three who suffer from a severe reaction dies.

The rare illness starts with a burning rash on the face and torso which quickly worsens.

Various
 triggers have been identified by medics, and the drug ibuprofen, used 
everyday to treat pain and inflammation, is one of those thought to 
occasionally spark the reaction.

'There is no cure for it so it just has to run its course,' said Mrs Ryan. 

Having taken ibuprofen in the past and suffered no reaction, Mr Ryan and wife Claire had not made the link to the drug when he began to develop blisters

'Jason's body looked like a horror show, whenever he moved more skin would fall off. He was screaming, it was so raw. Nobody could tell us what was happening because nobody knew.

Mr Ryan is now on the road to recovery although he says his progress has been slow

'I would have preferred him to have had cancer because when I heard one in three die I thought he has no chance.

'We were told it would last for 14 days and he was in a coma for nine days, It was the worst time of my life. I kept thinking, 'What am I going to tell our daughter Brooke?' Jason is our world. '

Mr Ryan said: 'The funny thing is Claire can remember everything and I don't remember anything. All I remember is waking up with my body changed.

'I went to sleep weighing about 13st and woke up being about 9st.

'I couldn't move my arms or legs, all I could move was my head.I thought my life, like my wife and daughter, were just a dream.'

Mr Ryan pulled through and is back at home with is family, although the syndrome can return.

She has become Mr Ryan carer full-time and is unable to continue her work showing and breeding dogs.

'We are all suffering,' she said. 'It isn't good.

'Jason is like a little old man but he is getting stronger and stronger all the time. It is more the mental side. He has post traumatic stress disorder but he is getting better. He is still my Jason.'

Mr Ryan said: 'I have lost interest in all my hobbies but right now is the best I have ever been since I was ill.

'I haven't been able to get up for months.I get up and I have to go and lie down at 12pm.

'Claire has been brilliant, I couldn't ask for anything more from her.

'I want to thank my wife, if it wasn't for her I would be dead.I probably wouldn't have gone to hospital and it could have gone very differently.'
