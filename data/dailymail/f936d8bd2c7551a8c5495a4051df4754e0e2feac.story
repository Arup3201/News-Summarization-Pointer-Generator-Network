Seemingly discontent with being one of the world's best tennis players, Rafael Nadal is undergoing some extreme training to turn himself into a poker expert too.

In a new YouTube advert for online poker company Poker Stars, the Spanish star is given a crash course in learning to bluff while on a golf course in Majorca.

Told to sit on the ground and pretend he'd been hit on the head by a ball, Nadal tricks unsuspecting golfers by acting like he'd lost his memory.

The world No 3 tricks unsuspecting golfers that he has lost his memory in the video

The world No 3 claims he doesn't know who he is or where he is with three men as each try desperately to remind him of his star status.

The trick is only revealed when Nadal's phone rings and the Poker Stars ringleader eventually explains what's going on.

Although Nadal passes his bluffing test with flying colours, his current form has been less positive.

The 28-year-old was dumped out of the Shanghai Masters last week, losing in straight sets - 6-3, 7-6 - to his compatriot Feliciano Lopez in the second round.

Roger Federer emerged victorious in China, beating Gilles Simon in the final to jump ahead of Nadal and into the No 2 spot in the world rankings.
