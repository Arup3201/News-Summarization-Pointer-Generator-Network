A South Florida man who weighs 385 pounds and stands 6-foot-8 is facing an animal cruelty charge after authorities say he bit his mom's lapdog on the face, seriously hurting its eye.

Palm Beach County deputies responded to a Lake Worth animal hospital around 4:30am Friday morning and found a Shih Tzu named Cujo with his eye hanging out of the socket.

The dog's owner Michele Etzel told deputies that her son, 36-year-old David Etzel, had been drinking and teasing the dog, prompting the dog to bite Etzel.

She said Etzel then bit the dog back. A veterinarian told deputies the injuries were comparable to being hit by a vehicle or attacked by another dog. 

Mrs. Etzel said she never intends to speak to her son again.

'I'm feeling sick,' Michele Etzel told the New York Daily News. 'I can't go to sleep. I'm holding my dog 24/7.'

The 2-year-old dog weighed about 10 pounds, according to the Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 

Deputies later found Etzel asleep at his home. He told them he would never hurt the dog.

Etzel was being held on $10,000 bail. Jail records didn't list an attorney.
