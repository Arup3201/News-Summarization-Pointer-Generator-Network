Addressed to 'Mrs Symonds', the letter from Lewis Carroll explains his 'disliking' for 'strangers hearing of my real name'

His classic tales have been loved by generations of children the world over.

But Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll once revealed he wished he had never written his popular books, because he hated the fame their success brought.

In a previously unseen letter to a close friend, the famously private author, whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, discussed his ‘intense hate’ of being recognised by strangers.

The handwritten note was penned in 1891, almost 30 years after the publication of his most celebrated literary work.

It is addressed to Anne Symonds, the widow of eminent Oxford surgeon Frederick Symonds, and was written in his rooms at Christ Church college where he was a mathematics don.

A prolific letter writer, he told Miss Symonds how he hated his correspondence falling into the hands of collectors, who might identify him as Lewis Carroll.

‘All that sort of publicity leads to strangers hearing of my real name in connection with the books, and to my being pointed out to, and stared at by strangers, and treated as a 'lion'.

‘And I hate all that so intensely that sometimes I almost wish that I had never written any books at all.’

The letter, written in November 1891, was penned 26 years after the publication of Alice in Wonderland, when he was 59.

It is owned by a private collector and is expected to fetch up to £4,000 when it is auctioned at Bonhams next month, 116 years after the author’s death.

Dodgson was notoriously shy and often refused to sign autographs. In the later stages of his career, he would send collectors who contacted him about his work a printed note denying any connection with Lewis Carroll.

The letter will be auctioned alongside this picture of a girl known as Winnie Johnson which was taken by Lewis Carroll and is eerily similar to his photos of Alice Liddel, who his book was based on

He wrote Alice in Wonderland  after telling stories to a girl named Alice Liddell while on picnics and boating trips with her family. 

Her father was Dean of Christ Church college and Dodgson was a close friend of the family until there was a mysterious cooling of relations in 1863, when she was 11.

In 2008, another letter from  Dodgson came to light in which the lifelong bachelor appeared to address speculation about whether he was a paedophile.

In the missive, he discussed his fondness for children. The author hated anyone knowing about his private life and never gave interviews.

Following his death aged 65 in 1898, pages from his diaries were censored or destroyed, and none of his ten siblings ever spoke about him to outsiders.

The pictures, along with a note which discussed Dodgson's fondness for children, has lead to speculation that he was a paedophile

Details of the latest letter have come to light ahead of the auction in London on March 19.

Bonhams is also selling a second note from the author, in which he thanks Miss Symonds for an invitation to tea, and adds that his teenage companion Isa Bowman is forbidden to drink tea or coffee, but will take cocoa.

Also being auctioned are two photos by Dodgson, expected to fetch up to £800 each.

The first shows a young girl believed to be Eleanor Howes, in a bathing costume at Eastbourne in 1883. The second is a portrait of three-year-old Ethel Hatch, taken in 1894.
