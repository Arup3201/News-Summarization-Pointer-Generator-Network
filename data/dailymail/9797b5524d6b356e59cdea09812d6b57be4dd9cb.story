If all hope for the future of this England team revolves around Raheem Sterling, perhaps it’s best if the whole team revolves around him, too.

Roy Hodgson is a careful man and can be expected to resist the urge to pile greater responsibility on to a 19-year-old with eight caps. He is also an experienced coach with an expert eye which must be telling him that Sterling is developing at an accelerated rate into an exceptional attacking force.

Hodgson will cogitate, for sure, but for anyone watching England toil to a 1-0 win against Norway at Wembley on Wednesday it was clear the Liverpool starlet is the team’s most exciting and threatening player.

Flying start: Raheem Sterling has impressed for Liverpool and England in his fledging career so far 

With his turbo speed and ability to jink past an opponent in a heartbeat, a brief moment from Sterling can destroy the most meticulous defensive planning.

In a world where even ordinary teams are fit and well-drilled, his unpredictability is priceless.

Hodgson is not blind to this, which is why he fast-tracked Sterling ahead of the World Cup. He also knows he is most lethal when used centrally, which is why he played him in the central role against Italy in Manaus.

If he gets on the ball and jinks instinctively past the first man, he will be attacking the centre halves, in front of goal, able to dart either way going into the penalty box, daring defenders to make the tackle and concede a penalty, or a free-kick in range of goal.

Star man: Sterling has become an integral attacking player for his club Liverpool and for England

Out wide, he can still wreak havoc, but there is more chance he will run into cover, or be smothered or forced into a corner. And the free-kicks he wins out wide are not likely to result in direct efforts on goal.

He is not only a dribbler. He is aware of others and links up with them. He can slide a pass.

Sterling in the centre makes sense. The big problem is, of course, that it threatens the captain. To free Sterling is to shackle Wayne Rooney, at least to some extent.

England cannot afford to jettison someone of Rooney’s calibre at a time when they are desperately short of players, let alone those of rare quality and experience.

Hodgson, having made Rooney his captain, must find a way to keep him in, while making Sterling more integral. The starting point may be the shape which finished the friendly against Norway, with Sterling at the top of a midfield diamond behind two strikers.

Shackled: Moving Sterling to a central role for England could effect the role of captain Wayne Rooney in the side

It will be a system unfamiliar to anyone not from Liverpool but they are intelligent enough to learn if Hodgson puts the right players in the right areas, and he insists finding round pegs for round holes is one of his strengths.

As it stands, it would be a pick of two from Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. The most obvious flaw to the plan is the absence of a natural holding midfielder with a defensive instinct, especially if full-backs are expected to provide attacking width.

Hodgson will watch closely how Chelsea’s Nathaniel Chalobah develops on loan at Burnley this season, and if Calum Chambers is used in this role at Arsenal.

Much promise: England manager Roy Hodgson will want Raheem Sterling to continue his fine progress

Aside from this, the manager must experiment until he finds the balance. There can be no better environment to find a solution than a lame qualifying campaign with safety nets at every turn.

Sterling is raw and makes mistakes. There was the red card against Ecuador in Miami, for instance. He will frustrate his manager, his team-mates and fans as he progresses. ‘It doesn’t always come off but he’s an exciting player,’ said Rooney as everyone else gushed uncontrollably after the Norway game.

This tame campaign is a gift for Hodgson. It is the perfect place for Sterling to learn about international football before launching into Euro 2016 at the age of 21, and for England to learn more about him and discover the best way to maximise this special talent.
