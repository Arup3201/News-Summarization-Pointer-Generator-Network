Gary Barlow and his wife Dawn have announced the devastating news that their fourth child was delivered stillborn on Saturday.

The pair broke the news in a statement as they revealed they are now planning a 'beautiful funeral' for their daughter Poppy.

'Dawn and I are devastated to announce that weâ€™ve lost our baby,' their statement began.

'Poppy Barlow was delivered stillborn
 on August 4th in London. Our focus now is giving her a beautiful 
funeral and loving our three children with all our hearts. Weâ€™d ask at this painful time that our privacy be respected.'

The couple - who have been married for
 12 years - revealed in April this year that they were excited to be 
expecting another girl.

According to The Sun, the pair are 'in pieces' following the tragic news eight and half months into the pregnancy.

Gary and Dawn are no doubt spending 
this difficult time with their three children, Daniel, 11, and daughters
 Emily, nine, and Daisy, three.

And while the British star is expected to make a public appearance at the Olympic closing ceremony this Sunday, it is at the moment unclear whether or not these plans will change.

Gary first announced the pregnancy via his Twitter page in February, saying: 'My wife and I are expecting our 4th child #Anotherowngoal.'

As

'What a lovely bunch you are.Thank you for all your kind messages.We are
 a very excited family.'

The tragic news comes less than two weeks after Gary's bandmate, Mark Owen, welcomed his third child into the world with wife Emma.

The couple were spotted out and about with Fox India just 12 days after she was born.

The pair have no doubt sent their condolences to Gary and Dawn, along with his fellow Take That bandmates, Robbie Williams, Jason Orange and Howard Donald.

Famous friends of the couple have taken 
to Twitter to ensure that their thoughts are with Gary and his family at
 this difficult time.
