Until very recently, TV chef Lorraine Pascale refused to delve too deeply into her complicated past. When you look at the bare facts of her early life – given up by her birth mother as a baby, fostered, then adopted, then ricocheted back into the foster system, all by the time she was eight – you can understand why.

Since she burst into public consciousness, first as a model then as a potential successor to Nigella, Lorraine (herself the mother of a 17-year-old daughter) has answered questions about her childhood honestly but with a degree of vagueness.

She admits she didn't know half the story herself. There was, she says, an unwillingness to 'take a brick out, in case the whole wall falls down'.

In a new TV documentary about fostering, Lorraine uncovers the dark secrets of her past

Now, as part of a BBC programme Lorraine has made about fostering, she got access to her own fostering and adoption records for the first time and from there she set about tracking down the people responsible for bringing her up. It's an astonishing programme, but a harrowing one for the viewer, never mind for Lorraine.

'I thought I knew my own story,' she admits. 'But I underestimated how difficult it would be.'

What she uncovers is the stuff of nightmares. The biggest question had always been why her adoptive parents, Audrey and Roger Woodward, had actually allowed her to go back into foster care.

Lorraine discovers, via social workers' records, it was because when the Woodwards' marriage broke up (Lorraine was three at the time), Audrey began drinking heavily. Lorraine became the subject of her rages – to the point where she was placed on the at-risk register.

In the programme Lorraine, 41, reads reports of how her mother had physically attacked her and even fantasised about throwing Lorraine under a lorry.

The first reports are dated 1976. By 1981 her records state, 'The mother was in an agitated state and demanded we take her daughter into care as she could not stand her any longer. She said she dreaded the school holidays and was sure she would do Lorraine some damage.

'She said she had already tried to strangle her and suffocate her, and had hit her before she went to school this morning. She said the only way she could keep from hitting Lorraine was to keep her locked in her bedroom.'

While Lorraine remembers things being very wrong at home, she did not have any inkling of this. 'I always got the feeling I didn't belong, that I was in the wrong place, tip-toeing around, trying to be as quiet as I could be, not feeling good enough,' is how she puts it.

'But that was devastating to read.' For most of the programme she's remarkably composed, but here she cracks and has to leave the room. Later, she explains, 'I was reading it as if it was someone else. I don't want to sound "Poor me", but it's not nice.'

Audrey Woodward, Lorraine's adoptive mother admitted trying to strangle and suffocate Lorraine

Lorraine's story starts in November 1972 when she was born in The Mothers' Hospital in Hackney, London. There had never been any question of her birth mother – who was unmarried – keeping her.

It was a place, she explains, for 'destitute mothers, which she thought she was'. As soon as she was born she was placed into the care of a couple called Marian and John – their first foster child. She only tracked them down after a radio appeal asking listeners if they remembered a white couple in Leytonstone caring for a black baby.

Lorraine lived with them happily for 18 months, along with another little girl. She was, she learns from Marian, 'a chunky little child' but an adorable one. There was talk, she learns, of the home becoming a permanent one. 'I wanted to adopt you,' says Marian, starting to cry. 'But we had only signed up to be temporary foster carers. And by then I was pregnant myself.'

Marian and John met Audrey and Roger, the then prospective adoptive parents. 'They were smitten with you,' says Marian. 'And they were middle class. We were working class. We thought you'd get a good education with them. But handing you over was the most difficult thing I've had to do.'

Lorrine was adopted as a baby and later went into foster care

By rights, the rest of her life should have been more settled. In reality, it was anything but. Her relationship with her adoptive parents at their Oxfordshire home has always sounded warm and supportive (they have featured in her cookery programmes), but the reality was much more complex.

Audrey now has dementia so is not a part of the programme, but Roger is. Lorraine confronts him, gently, about his memories of what happened. After he and Audrey split he lived apart from the family – in a boat, it seems – and has scant knowledge of what his daughter was going through.

'I wasn't aware what was going on,' he says. Even when the idea of Lorraine going back into care was raised by the social workers? 'I was the obvious alternative, but I was living in a one-berth boat.' He wonders if he could have done more. His daughter doesn't reply.

Lorraine retraces some of her old, temporary homes, and has to steel herself for a meeting with Stella and Warren Eccles and their daughter Ruth – 'the only foster carers I was anxious about'.

Lorraine had lived with them for six months, and not happily. Former missionaries, it is suggested that they were paired with Lorraine simply because they had some experience of black people. Lorraine was, by then, an angry child – resentful of having to go to church, and desperate to go home to her mother Audrey.

They recall happy times, she less so. 'They're friendly people,' she says. 'They had a home and I needed a home. What was the problem? It would probably be different now because there's all sorts of training.'

Outwardly, Lorraine triumphed. After her spell in emergency foster care she went back to her mother, although the subsequent years were not easy. She's said in the past that her difficult upbringing made her determined and self-sufficient.

But she does open up here about the difficult years in between. Speaking to one troubled teen she says she recognises the mix of 'toughness and vulnerability' youngsters in care show, saying she got involved with a gang who were drinking and stealing. 'I was on the fringes of that,' she says. 'I could have gone down a dark route.'

That she didn't seems all the more remarkable as the credits roll on her extraordinary story, which she sums up as 'enlightening and daunting and sad'.

There are no regrets, however, that she went looking for the truth. 'I'm lucky to have such a history written in black and white,' she says, in reference to her social work records. It's a sober reminder of how even difficult answers about who you are can be better than none at all.
