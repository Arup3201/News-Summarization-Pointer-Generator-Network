Arsenal fans will be buoyed by the news that midfielder Jack Wilshere has returned to light training. 

The England international has not appeared for his club since sustaining an ankle injury following a challenge from Manchester United's Paddy McNair in November last year.  

And Wilshere was not the only player making a return to the Arsenal set-up. FC Goa winger Robert Pires, who played for The Gunners between 2000 and 2006, has been training with the club in order to maintain fitness levels during the Indian Super League's close season.

Wilshere's initial prognosis had been bleak with the midfielder expected to be sidelined for up to four months. 

But his rehabilitation has gone so well that Arsenal fans can look forward to welcoming back their man ahead of schedule. 

'Jack should be in full training in ten days,' confirmed Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger at his weekly press conference. 

Earlier this week, Wilshere expressed his own excitement that his injury nightmare was nearing an end and posted a picture of him celebrating a goal on his official Instagram account. 

He captioned the picture, 'Can't wait for this feeling again.'
