Dangerous: A drawing pin in Richard Cooper's front tyre during the Wiggle New Forest Spring Sportive on Saturday

Saboteurs angry at bicyles 'taking over' country roads targeted a cycling event by scattering nails, putting lives of riders in danger.

Nails were strewn along the road in a New Forest village as more than 2,000 cyclists took part in an 84-mile ride which has angered locals.

Police are investigating the incident in Bransgore, Hampshire, which saw more than 20 participants in the Wiggle Sportive suffer punctures.

Opponents of the event had put up posters listing 15 villages and towns on the route and urging residents to raise the alarm if entrants caused trouble.

New Forest East MP Julian Lewis today condemned the sabotage as 'absolutely reprehensible' and vowed to raise the matter in Government.

Dr Lewis said: 'It does not help anyone when people, however frustrated they feel, do something that could lead to a nasty accident or at the very least a nasty confrontation.

'I'm hoping the cause of the provocation will sooner rather than later be sorted out, but taking the law into one's own hands is not the way forward.

'Doing something illegal and dangerous is never the right thing to do.'

Dr Lewis said talks were taking place with Government ministers and national park chiefs to resolve tensions between residents and cyclists.

He added: 'This whole issue is absolutely being focused on by local elected representatives right up to Government ministers.

'I would appeal to the community to disassociate themselves from these actions.'

Martin Barden, director of UK Cycling Events which organised the Wiggle Spring Sportive, criticised the vandalism.

He said: 'There were a handful of locals who tried to disrupt the event, and marshals had to clear that up.

'It is something nobody wants to see but we do not have much control of that. We are surprised and saddened to see it happen.'

Mr Barden added he hopes the event - which raised more than £3,000 for Oakhaven Hospice in Lymington, Hampshire - will return in October.

Dr Tony Hockley, chairman of the New Forest Equestrian Association, said he took part to see how cyclists affect animals in the national park.

He described seeing one incident where a herd of cattle was 'spooked'.

Mr Hockley said: 'There are a few cyclists who had that 'hell for leather' mentality - but that was a minority.

'I did see some cyclists overtake on blind bends and narrow lanes and one even overtook me on a right hand turn on the wrong side of the road.

'Most of the riders rode in single file, and nearly all of them behaved very well.'

Last spring's Wiggle Sportive was disrupted when drawing pins were scattered across the road and motorists formed a roadblock to slow competitors down.

And at a second event in October, in the dead of night, wreckers pulled down signage and sprayed mud across the road.
