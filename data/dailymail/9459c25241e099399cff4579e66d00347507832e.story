Queens Park Rangers will hold a key summer strategy meeting on Friday, with a potential permanent move for Ravel Morrison a key point of discussion.

Co-owner Tony Fernandes will head the meeting, which will also include manager Harry Redknapp and chief executive Phil Beard.

Rangers are interested in taking Morrison, who joined on loan from West Ham in January, on a full-time deal ahead of next season.

Talent: A potential permanent move for Ravel Morrison will be a key point of discussion during QPR's summer strategy meeting on Friday

All smiles: QPR's co-owner Tony Fernandes , pictured celebrating Saturday's play-off win, will head the summer strategy meeting

The former 
Manchester United forward has 12 months left on his deal at Upton Park 
and the Hammers could look to sell the youngster this summer rather than
 lose him for nothing next year.And if the price is right, QPR are likely to move for the England hopeful.

The futures of the club’s current players will also be decided in Friday’s meeting.

Big-earners
 such as Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Jenas, Bobby Zamora, Stephane 
Mbia and Andy Johnson are all out of contract this summer.

Likewise,
 players like Loic Remy, Esteban Granero and Adel Taarabt are all due to
 return to Loftus Road following loan spells away.

Remy is set to leave this summer, while Granero and Taarabt are unlikely to feature in Redknapp’s plans for next season.

Changes: QPR manager Harry Redknapp knows he has work to do to keep his club in the Premier League

Sales: Both Esteban Granero (left) and Adel Taarabt (right) are unlikely to return at the end of their loan spells
