Had circumstances been different, Ronny Deila would have spent this week crawling around the cutting room floor seeking to lay his hands on the out-takes from last season’s ignominious League Cup exit to Morton.

When things are so fragile and uncertain in the here and now, however, there is no need to rake throw the annals for examples of how it can all go so horribly wrong. Celtic presently have sufficient examples on file.

If Sunday’s uninspiring display against Motherwell was perhaps understandable given its close proximity to a fine 2-2 draw in Salzburg, then the sequence it continued – just won win in seven competitive games – is a long way from what’s regarded as acceptable even in a period of transition.

It’s not hard to have a degree of sympathy with the Celtic manager’s current dilemma. Caught in the middle of a blizzard of games, the Norwegian’s instinct is to mix and match in the hope the burden can be shared with no adverse effect on results.

The reality though – as the aforementioned results have underscored – is that even Deila’s first 11 barely stands up to scrutiny at this juncture. Far less when it relies heavily on the make-weights and the jersey-fillers.

Hearts, like Morton a year ago, come to Glasgow’s East End tomorrow as a Championship club but that’s where the similarities end. The undefeated leaders and top scorers in the second tier, Robbie Nielson’s side would not cause the earth to stop spinning on its axis were they to win the tie.

The Glasgow club suffered a humiliating 1-0 cup defeat to lower-league Morton exactly a year ago, and want to avoid a repeat against Scottish Championship side Hearts

For Deila, then, the only way to approach a potentially tricky chicane on what’s proving a difficult journey is to press the foot firmly to the floor. The experiments, such as initially omitting Scott Brown and Kris Commons as he did on Sunday, can wait for now.

‘We try to do that every time,’ Deila replied when asked if he’d field his strongest team. ‘This is an important game.’

Many of Deila’s predecessors uttered those same words ahead of games in this competition without truly believing them. Yet where the Norwegian differs from Martin O’Neill, Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon is that those men had the safety net of domestic and European success to fall back on if their fourth priority of the season came unstuck.

Deila can ill-afford to be so choosy. For all he is being granted a degree of understanding by Celtic fans – with his eventual record at Stromsgodset being the sole basis for that faith – he appreciates that the promise of ‘jam tomorrow’ has a hollow ring at the club who now employ him.

Celtic's players look relaxed in training, but they have struggled to click as a team this season

‘This is the first trophy we can win and, as I’ve said all the time, both (domestic) cups are important,’ he added.

‘I know the League Cup is sometimes used for playing younger teams but we have used a lot of our squad the whole time.

‘I said when I came here this (the Treble) was a big goal for me and it’s a huge goal for the players as well. I think it has only been done three times before in the history of Celtic. Martin O’Neill the last in 2001? It would be fantastic if we could achieve that.’

In a league without Rangers, it’s by no means inconceivable that even this inconsistent, unconvincing Celtic side could yet come good and sweep the boards. But for that to happen, a radical improvement from all concerned would not come a minute too soon.

‘Some have done well, some have had ups and downs,’ Deila said of his fringe players. ‘Consistency is important and when we’ve changed a lot we’ve had some bad performances.

‘It’s much easier when you have the central line together (the spine of the team) then put players on.

Deila has rotated his squad constantly this season, and has not yet settled on a regular 11

‘But against Inverness and Motherwell there were maybe too many changes. You saw it – when they are staying far back it’s hard to open them up when you don’t have the leadership from the centre. So that’s important. But if we play with more consistency it’s easier for them to adapt and get a good performance.

‘We want to (change the approach) but there are a lot of reasons why we do it. We’ve a long hard match programme and you have to give some players the opportunity to get match fit. That’s something we’re thinking of all the time. But this game (against Motherwell) there were maybe too many changes, you could see that in the first-half.’

That it’s taking time for Deila’s methods to take root should come as no surprise to anyone who studied his fortunes at Stromgodset.

Winning the title with the little known side from Drammen was miraculous but it did not happen overnight. For the first two of Deila’s six years there, avoiding relegation was the priority. It goes without saying that Glasgow isn’t quite so tolerant.

‘Every day we get to know one another better and every day we work on improving one another individually and collectively,’ Deila said.

‘It’s not starting now, it’s a process all the time. I think the second-half on Sunday was a good performance. The defence was very good and we opened them up as well. But we needed the second goal and we didn’t do that. We made it difficult for ourselves in the first-half.

‘I want us to play even more together and be even better physically. Some of those players are coming in and some have been injured for a while. So they need to adapt and get fit and that’s taking more time than I would’ve wanted.’

If his own side have only impressed in fits and starts thus far, Deila appreciates that Hearts already have the look of a well-oiled machine. Genuine title and cup contenders without question.

‘I saw the game against Hibs on television and they played well that day and we had people at their match on Saturday to watch them,’ he said.

‘We have a good knowledge over how they are playing and they are doing very well this season so far.

‘It’s going to be a tough game - the players and I know it - but I’m looking forward to playing another game so we can bounce back from the result on Sunday.’
