Don't let the size of this tiny 6lb pooch fool you.

Michelle Petty filmed her feisty Yorkshire Terrier named Puppies scaring off a herd of deer at a ranch in America.

Footage shows him bravely approaching one of the mammals - more than ten times his size - before it instantly flinches away in terror.

At the beginning of the clip, Puppies is seen standing in front of the deer for around ten seconds.

Then, breaking the silence, the dog runs forward causing his audience to flee.

As they scarper away, the deer are heard bleating in alarm.

Petty said that the antlered beasts appeared to think Puppies was 'a wolf or something'. 

Throughout his herding adventure Puppies didn't appear to issue a bark and let his fearsome guise do the talking instead.
