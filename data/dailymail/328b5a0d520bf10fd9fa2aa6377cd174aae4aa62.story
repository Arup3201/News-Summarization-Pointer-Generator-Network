Four days after 22-year-old Elliot Rodger killed six people on the University of Santa Barbara campus, authorities seized seven guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition from another student who accidentally fired a bullet into his neighbor's apartment. 

Sheriff's Sgt. Mark Williams says the cases are unconnected.

Kevin Tym, 21, told authorities he was 'playing' with his Glock 17 handgun when he accidentally fired, and the bullet went through a wall, narrowly missing his neighbor on the other side.

Road, on the edge of campus. His arrest came four days after Elliot 
Rodger's rampage

When police arrived on the scene they found Tym was in posession of 1,000 rounds of ammunition and seven firearms - including high-capacity assault rifles.

All of the weapons were legally owned, but police confiscated them none the less.

Tym was arrested Tuesday afternoon at his apartment on the 6500 block of Pardell Road, and charged with negligently discharging a firearm and possessing high-capacity assault rifle magazines which are illegal in California unless they were purchased before January 1, 2000.

The student has since been released from jail on $2,500 bail.

Tym's arrest came just two hours before a memorial service to honor the six killed and 13 injured in Rodger's Friday rampage on the campus.

Twenty thousand people filed into Harder Stadium for the ceremony - just a few blocks away from Tym's apartment.

Richard Martinez, father of one of the victims, gave a moving speech supporting a change in gun-ownership legislation.
