The death of a Pennsylvania college student whose body was pulled from a river near his home was likely an accident, his family are now saying.

The disappearance of 21-year-old Shane Montgomery in Philadelphia on Thanksgiving Day caused a widespread search and led to a $65,000 reward for information about his whereabouts.

On Saturday, volunteer divers discovered the West Chester University senior's body in the Schuylkill River near Kildare's Irish Pub in Philadelphia, where he had spent the night drinking until 1.45am on November 27.

The medical examiner's office has conducted an autopsy to determine a cause an manner of death, but has not yet released the results.  

Found: The body of Shane Montgomery, pictured, was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on Saturday, close to where he was last seen on November 27

Bittersweet: His heartbroken parents, Karen and Kevin Montgomery,spoke with the media after their son's body was discovered today

Search: Teams had been searching the nearby canal for the last month but turned up no signs. Montgomery's body was found Saturday in the water behind the Manayunk Street Brewery

However, Montgomery's uncle Kevin Verbrugghe told the Allentown Morning Call that investigators believe his nephew's death was accidental. 

Verbrugghe did not elaborate on how they think Montgomery died. 

The young man's body has been released back to the custody of his grieving parents, Karen and Kevin, who are planning the funeral on Friday at their Catholic parish in the Philadelphia neighborhood of Manayunk. 

'Today we have done what we have promised,' Karen Montgomery told NBC Philadelphia on Sunday.

'We have found and we brought Shane home.' 

Two weeks earlier divers found a set of keys belonging to Montgomery in the same section of water after they were tested on his parents' house. 

Montgomery was last seen leaving a bar in Manayunk in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day, having returned home from college for the holidays, and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot.

Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters

The search predominantly focused on the nearby Manayunk Canal, with police not suspecting foul play. 

His heartbroken parents were sure something unfortunate had happened to their son. 

'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home,' Karen Montgomery previously said. 

Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in Manayunk - a neighborhood of Philadelphia  -at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table.

Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, had a distinct Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder

He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. 

It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. 

The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it.

One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave.

Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning.

The footage has been withheld by authorities. 

The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him.  

His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.'
