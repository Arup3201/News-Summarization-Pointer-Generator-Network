Britain's biggest bank has been attacked by US authorities for 'turning a blind eye' to large-scale money laundering by drug cartels, terrorists and rogue regimes.

The US Department of Justice yesterday accused HSBC of an 'astonishing record of dysfunction' in allowing hundreds of millions of illicit dollars through its branches.

The bank is said to have had such a 'ringing endorsement' from Mexico drug gangs that it became known as the 'place to launder money'.

The revelations put renewed pressure 
on trade minister Lord Green for his former role as boss of HSBC. The 
Tory peer was chief executive of the bank from 2003 to 2006 – and US 
authorities say the worst wrongdoing took place between 2002 and 2010.

The blistering attack in the US was 
launched as HSBC was forced to pay a record £1.2billion settlement for 
money-laundering activities and breaching sanctions against regimes 
including Cuba, Iran, Libya, Burma and Zimbabwe.

In a further humiliation HSBC agreed 
to spend £430million on a 26 point 'know your customer' plan to ensure 
it doesn't do business with terrorists or drug gangs in future.

HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank is 'profoundly sorry' for the failings.

Yesterday, Lord Green, who left the 
bank with a £19.1million pension pot, was urged by Labour's Chris Leslie
 to clear up 'lingering' doubts about his failure to stop the scandal.

The shadow Treasury minister said Lord Green should reveal 'what he knew and when'.

An email published in a probe by the 
US Senate suggested Lord Green was warned about wrongdoing as far back 
as January 2005 by the bank's former compliance chief, David Bagley.

Lord Green, 64, has previously claimed 'he has no case to answer' but refused to comment yesterday.

Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney 
general of the US Department of Justice's criminal division said: 'HSBC 
is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight – and 
worse. The record of dysfunction that prevailed at HSBC for many years 
was astonishing.'

Mr Breuer said one transaction with Iran involved 32,000 ounces of gold that went directly to the Iranian Central Bank.

In a further damning detail, he 
revealed that Mexican drug gangs used the bank so often they built 
special boxes to fit into the HSBC teller's slots.

He added that the bank was not being 
stripped of its licence to trade in the US because it would mean 
'innocent' people in America would lose jobs.

The Department of Justice said at 
least £550million in proceeds from drugs trafficking from Mexican and 
drug cartels was laundered through HSBC in the US.

It also accused the bank of helping 
countries evade sanctions, with £410million from Sudan, Libya and others
 sent to HSBC accounts in the US.

Loretta Lynch, US Attorney for the 
Eastern District of New York said that the 'woefully inadequate' 
compliance systems meant that HSBC became known as 'the place to launder
 money'.

The client list included Sinaloa, 
Mexico's most powerful gang, which has been behind over 20,000 killings 
since 2006. Murders by the cartel often involve beheadings. Some are 
filmed and put on the internet to warn rivals.

The extent of the scandal emerged in 
July when senior HSBC executives were hauled before a powerful Senate 
committee. The bank has been braced for a fine ever since, putting aside
 £930million to cover a settlement.

A UK Government spokesman said: 'At 
the time of the report's publication HSBC expressed its regret that 
there were failures of implementation and Lord Green has said that he 
shares that regret.'

HSBC said it increased spending on US anti-money laundering ninefold to £150 million between 2009 and 2011.
