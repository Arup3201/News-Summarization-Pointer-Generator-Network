Several U.S. Olympians are crying foul over a few violent incidents in competition, arguing that some of their opponents should be awarded a gold medal for cheap shots.

It's part of a grueling back-and-forth between American athletes and their international rivals, particularly in men's basketball and women's soccer.

Forward Carmelo Anthony was shooting a three-pointer in the closing seconds of a game against Argentina on Monday night when guard Facundo Campazzo struck him in the groin.

The ball landed in the basket, but Anthony, who plays for the New York Knicks stateside, hit the floor.

Speaking at a team practice on the day after the Americans' 126-97 victory, Anthony said: 'It was definitely a cheap shot. 'Something like that, I don't play like that, I don't agree with that.'

He added: 'If you're going to foul 
somebody ... foul them hard, but you don't take a shot like that. So I 
don't agree with that, but at this point there's really nothing that 
nobody can do about it.'

The play happened in front of the U.S. bench, and Anthony's teammates were irate as he fell to the court in pain.

Anthony said they were angry because they knew it was 'uncalled for' and wouldn't happen in the NBA.

'Nobody takes cheap shots like that,' Anthony said. 'That was a cheap shot. He got one, he took it, he got away with it. There's nothing we can do about it.'

Campazzo said after the game he apologized to Kobe Bryant but not to Anthony, because Chris Paul hadn't apologized for punching him earlier in the game.

Anthony and coach Mike Krzyzewski said they hadn't watched a replay but were putting the incident behind them and looking toward Wednesday's quarterfinal game against Australia.

Also on Monday, the U.S. victory in the 
women's soccer semi-final against Canada was marred by a similar cheap 
shot when a Canadian player appeared to stomp on midfielder 
Carli Lloyd's neck.

It was the latest in a string of incidents that have created bad blood between the U.S. team and their neighbours to the north, as Canadian forward Melissa Tancredi made the startling assault.

The attack came after numerous pre-game remarks by Canadian players and their coach, John Herdman.

Prior to the match, which the U.S. won 4-3, Herdman accused the U.S. of using 'highly illegal' blocking tactics on their corners and free kicks.

The Canadians claimed it was Team USA 
who were playing dirty and Tancredi herself addressed a referee 
when she said: 'I hope you can sleep tonight and put on your American 
jersey because thatâ€™s who you played for today.'

It's wasn't the first time the U.S. has been accused of playing dirty during the London games.

Colombian soccer player Lady Andrade, who was suspended last month after 'sucker punching' Wambach, said that it was the Americans who struck first.

'The whistle always goes in their favour,' she insisted. 'They were hitting us and hitting us, but there was never a whistle.'
