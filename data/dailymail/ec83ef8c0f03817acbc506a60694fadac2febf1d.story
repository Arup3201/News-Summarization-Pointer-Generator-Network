A 38-year-old Dutch man killed a grandmother in a head-on collision while driving on the wrong side of the road.

Michel Vandenburgt had reverted to driving on his 'normal' side of the road for a minute before he crashed into Jacqueline Emmott, who was driving in the right direction in the same lane.

Bradford Crown Court today heard that Mr Vanderburgt had been driving his Opal Astra in the wrong lane in West Yorkshire when he crashed into Jacqueline Emmott, 67.

Bradford Crown Court today heard that Michael Vandenburgt's (left) driving fell 'not far short' of dangerous when he drove on the wrong side of the road, killing retired police welfare officer, Jacqueline Emmott, 67.

Mrs Emmott died at the scene from head 
and abdominal injuries and her husband Tony, who was driving the car last September, is still receiving treatment for his injuries.

Judge Robert Bartfield said that Mr Vandenburgt fell 'not far short' of dangerous driving.

The judge suspended his six-month prison sentence for 12 months, telling him he did not think a few weeks in jail would do 'any good'.

Mr Vanderburgt was also given a 12-month driving ban, but this does not apply in the Netherlands. He was ordered to pay £500 towards court costs.

He had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing at Ilkley and Bingley Magistrates Court.

Mr Vanderburgt was visiting Yorkshire with his wife Sally, whose family live here.

After leaving Mrs Vanderburgt's sister's home in Ilkley, the couple drove towards Hull, using Sat Nav directions.

Judge Bartfield said the Sat Nav 'may have distracted' him.

'Whether it did or not you took up the wrong carriageway, driving on the right hand side of the road which investigations show you did for something like 60 seconds,' he said.

'I have concluded that you must have set off and reverted to your normal direction of travel.'

The court heard that Vanderburgt did not see markings on the 50mph road, which would have appeared upside down to someone travelling in the wrong direction.

He drove in the rain for around half-a-mile down what the judge called a 'narrow, lonely piece of road with little traffic on it at that time'.

Investigations showed that Mr Vanderburgt was travelling about 33mph, while Mr Emmott was driving between 25 and 30mph.

The cars collided on a bend in the road. Retired police welfare officer Mrs Emmott suffered injuries to her head and abdomen.

Vanderburgt suffered various wounds and bruising, and had to stay in hospital for three days.

His wife also suffered wounds and bruising.

Judge Bartfield said, 'The reality of this was that this was a much loved wife, mother and grandmother, retired for only one month.

'Her family are completely devastated by the loss of this remarkable lady.

'In a victim impact statement, her daughter Josephine's desperate wish is for her back but that can never be.

'You have to accept your responsibility because had you concentrated on what you were doing instead of being distracted by something else, this would not have happened.

'You will wake up every day and when you open your eyes you will have a recollection of what you have done.

'That will be your greatest punishment. I'm satisfied your remorse is genuine.'

The court that Mr Vanderburgt is a "decent, hard-working, family man", who was "mortified" by the accident.

Road Safety Charity Brake criticised the sentence following the case.

Senior campaigns officer Ellen Booth said: 'This sentence does seem to be on the low side of the sentencing options a judge has when facing a charge of death by careless driving.

'We have to send out the right message to other drivers that if you kill or seriously injure someone through bad driving you can expect really serious consequences, so that members of the public do take their responsibilities as a driver very seriously.'
