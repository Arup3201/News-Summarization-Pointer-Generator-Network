A poodle named Ricky has won Crufts.

The two-year-old beat six other best-in-group winners in the final of the competition, which attracted more than 21,000 entrants from Britain and overseas.

Ricky and his co-owner, Jason Lynn from Preston, were given the nod by judge Jack Bispham last night after being assessed for overall health, condition, coat, character, temperament and movement.

Speaking after the result was declared at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre, Mr Lynn said: ‘I couldn’t have asked for anything more. He gave an absolutely beautiful performance.

'He was top dog all breeds last year and we decided that this would be his last show - and he has ended it in the most wonderful way possible.’

Standard poodle Ricky triumphed over six other best-in-group winners in the final event of the annual competition, said to be the world's most prestigious dog show.

Competing under his official name of Afterglow Maverick Sabre, he fought off competition from a Pomeranian, a wire fox terrier, an Irish Wolfhound, a Samoyed, a Rottweiler and an American Cocker Spaniel.

Ricky was described earlier this week by his co-breeder Mike Gadsby as "a regular dog that we can take to the park and let off the lead".

Despite his magnificent and well-groomed coat, it was by taking first prize in Crufts' utility dog category that he earned his place in the Best-In-Show ring.

Runner-up was Dan the Man, the Samoyed, who was being shown by Sue Smith from Upwell in Norfolk.
