Britain's top female surfer has faced her biggest challenge yet after giving birth to a baby son two months early - just two days after a special photo-shoot to raise awareness of pre-natal health.

Pro surfer Hannah Harding 27, posed for a special set of pictures of her baby bump to raise awareness of the importance of keeping fit and exercising during pregnancy.

The pictures were designed to raise awareness of the issue, as part of Hannah's work for the charity Wave Project, which runs surf courses for socially isolated children.

But before the photos could be published, Hannah went into labour, and Reggie was born eight weeks early.

The tiny tot - whose dad is pro surfer Russell Winter - weighed just 4lb 1oz when he was delivered by emergency C-section at the Royal Cornwall Hospital on 25 February.

Hannah, who lives in Newquay, Cornwall said: 'It was one of the scariest yet overwhelmingly special days of my life, because we unexpectedly got to welcome our gorgeous little son into the world.'

Hours earlier, she had been showing off her pregnancy bump.

She said: 'Since I've been an ambassador for The Wave Project I've had the privilege to work with all sorts of different young people.

'I know how important it is for parents to be good role models to children, and that starts with looking after yourself.

'When I became pregnant I was really keen to raise awareness of good pre-natal health, to encourage other mums-to-be to stay fit and active throughout pregnancy.'

The pictures of Hannah and her baby bump were part of Hannah's work for the charity Wave Project, which runs surf courses for socially isolated children. She gave birth just two days later
