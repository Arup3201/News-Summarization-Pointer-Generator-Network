Scroll down for a full table which shows what each club will earn in their current position.

It is the final round of fixtures in another Barclays Premier League campaign, and there is little at stake for clubs not involved in issues at either end of the table. So the theory goes, anyway, but try telling that to Hull City’s bank manager, with a win at home to Everton potentially raking in a near-£5million bonus for the FA Cup finalists.

TV revenue is the big money-spinner in the Premier League, but merit payments are not to be sniffed at. There’s £1.2million for the bottom-placed club, with the amount rising by the same amount as you go up the table.

So, if you climb one place on the last day, it is worth £1.2million. Leap four places, as Hull conceivably could, and it’s a cool £4.8million.

In the money: Hull City will be celebrating again if they can pick up £4.8 million on the final day

With that in mind, we’ve worked out how much is theoretically up for grabs for each team, heading in to Sunday’s games. Don’t forget, the calculations do not take into account what might happen to teams around them. Also, we are discounting any team winning by a cricket score to overturn a massive goal difference deficit.

Cardiff v Chelsea

A win or draw could be worth £1.2million to Cardiff. Chelsea need to win to have a chance of an additional £1m.

Plenty to play for: Chelsea may be out of the title race but a win for Jose Mourinho's side could earn £1m

Fulham v Crystal Palace

Fulham need to win for an extra £1.2m. Palace cannot go any higher or any lower.

Hull v Everton

If Hull win and manage a four-goal swing on goal difference with West Ham, it could be worth £4.8m. Even a draw could be worth £2.4m. Everton stay same.

Liverpool v Newcastle

A win could be worth £2m for Liverpool. Newcastle cannot go higher, but if they fail to win and Stoke pick up three points then the Magpies will slip to 10th, losing £1.2m.

Plenty at stake: A Premier League title for Liverpool would also see them pocket an extra £2m

Manchester City v West Ham

Neither side can go higher. Defeat for West Ham though could cost them up to £4.8m, with Swansea, Sunderland, Aston Villa and Hull all poised to pounce if they slip up.

Norwich v Arsenal

Neither side can go higher. A draw will all but guarantee Norwich 18th place and £3.6m windfall to soften the blow of relegation.

Southampton v Manchester United

Southampton stay same. A win could be worth £1.2m to United.

Not over yet: The last act of United's interim management team could be to earn an extra £1.2m for the club

Sunderland v Swansea

A win could be worth £2.4m to Sunderland. A draw or win could bring Swansea an additional £1.2m.

Tottenham v Aston Villa

Tottenham cannot move up. A win for Villa could be worth an extra £3.6m, a draw £1.2m.

Crucial cash: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert will be hoping he can boost his club's coffers by £3.6m

West Brom v Stoke

A win for West Brom could bring them an extra £3.6m. A win for Stoke could bring them £1.2m.
