Gabby Logan will be the only female member of the BBC's presenting team at the World Cup

Gabby Logan wants to hold her tongue about sexism in football today. Really she does. Which is just as well given she's outnumbered, at a rough count, by about 100 to one.

We're here in the Royal Institute of British Architects' swanky London HQ to meet the team the BBC will be sending to cover the World Cup in Brazil in less than a fortnight's time.

The 'we' is largely a throng of sports hacks, while Team BBC includes, among others, Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Chris Waddle, Robbie Savage and, er... Gabby. She's the one in the little ra-ra skirt and T-shirt style top, looking rather like the cheerleader.

Now, this is the same Gabby who said of the last World Cup, 'I've experienced sexism in my career - comments and situations that are specific to me being a woman. It was quite apparent during the World Cup in South Africa. I was staying in quite an isolated place in a high-testosterone environment. I just wanted to go back to my hotel and read a magazine.'

Fast-forward four years and Gabby says, 'Now you can look at this room and think, "Yeah, I see what she means."' See it? You'd better believe it, these are some very blokey blokes. Gabby shrugs.

'That's the way it is. There isn't lots of room for women. No gaps have been created,' she says. 'The same people are doing the job so you're not going to move somebody on just for the sake of it. Do you know what I mean?'

Not really. This is, after all, the BBC - that great champion of equal opportunities and diversity. Surely they could have rooted out one or two other women with a grasp of the beautiful game to even up the odds from 13 (the number of blokes on parade for Team BBC) to one (Gabby)?

'With the pundits, you're talking about men who play football, so it's a man's world there,' she says. Well, it certainly is here. You could bottle the testosterone. But what about the 29 million women playing football worldwide or, for that matter, those competing in the Women's World Cup in Canada next year?

I suspect England captain Casey Stoney might beg to differ with Gabby. 'I guess while Gary Lineker's still a presenter, how is a woman ever supposed to come in?'

Gabby is not threatened by her male comrades and is often found teasing them - once describing Gary Lineker as a 'crisp salesman'

She sounds a little restrained, rather than outspoken. God forbid she's been told to button it. Not our Gabby. She is, after all, at 41 still a trailblazer for women in sports broadcasting who, along with the wonderful Clare Balding, helped bring the Olympic Games alive. We like her forthright views. We like her sharp tongue. We like her wit.

Remember her recent hilarious talk at Leeds Trinity University when she teased Lineker about becoming 'a crisp salesman', joked about Ryan Giggs' affair with his sister-in-law and said Andy Murray was the 'moodiest, most miserable b****** I've ever met in my life' after he lost the mixed doubles final at the Olympics?

I last saw Gabby a few months after that spectacular London 2012. She was reeling from her post-sports-extravaganza high, saying, 'I even found it difficult to get excited about football. Everything felt a bit anti-climactic.'

Now she says, 'I think a lot of people felt that deflation. It was such an amazing thing to have been a part of. Everyone got so excited about it. Afterwards, it's hard to go back to regular work. It doesn't seem as exciting, but life moves on. The memories start to disappear a bit.'

Gabby had the honour of presenting the 2012 Olympic Games

When Gabby worked on the Olympics the games dominated the Logan household, with her twins Reuben and Lois, now eight, attending many of the events.

She'll be leaving them at home with her husband, former Scottish rugby international Kenny Logan, when she travels to Brazil. Given that her role on Team BBC will be to follow England, whose odds of winning the tournament are up there with the ratio of blokes to girls in this room, she might not be away for too long. Gabby adores her children, who were conceived with IVF.

'When I was at the World Cup in South Africa they came out for a few days,' she says. 'But I felt a bit bad for the other guys who were missing their kids. At that point I thought, "I shouldn't have done this." You're there to work.

'But I think it's hard for anyone when they're away from the family. You miss your kids. You miss your husband. I'm sure there are a lot of times I'll think, "Oh, I'm missing sports day today." It's normal. You do the job to the best of your ability but you can't help but miss your family. But it's a job. You just have to keep all the balls in the air.'

Gabby is some juggler. Since the 2012 games she's been keeping several balls in the air. Last year, as well as hosting the World Aquatics Championships and covering the Athletics World

Championships from Moscow, she replaced Sue Barker on BBC Sports Personality of the Year. She's also dipped her toe into primetime TV, hosting BBC1's comedy panel series I Love My Country and presenting ITV1's Splash! alongside Vernon Kay (the first series was a ratings winner, the second made more of a plop than a splash with two million fewer viewers). Will she be returning with a third series?

'I don't know yet,' she says. 'Entertainment TV is really very...' She plasters on a smile. 'Hopefully it will, because I did really enjoy it.'

Gabby was brought up on football. Her father, Terry Yorath, was the former Welsh international footballer and manager whose life fell to pieces along with the rest of the family's when Gabby's brother Daniel, who was signed for Leeds United, dropped dead in the garden while kicking a ball in 1992. He was only 15 and suffering from an un-detected heart condition.

Gabby now has a fear of everything falling to pieces when the going gets good. In fact, eyebrows were raised recently when it was revealed she had invested in the same tax-avoidance scheme as Gary Barlow, but she moved swiftly to point out that like many others she'd been misled, and that since 2012 she's been working with the Inland Revenue to repay any money owed.

She says she tends to ringfence her fears by pushing herself on and on. 'This summer we've got the World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and then the European Athletics Championships so it's going to be a fantastic - though busy - work period. Then in two years we're back in Brazil for the Olympics.' Has she been confirmed as part of Team BBC? 'Yes,' she says.

'Look, when I was saying that as a woman in a man's environment when you've been on the road for three weeks with blokes all the time, you kind of think, "Oh I wouldn't mind a coffee with a girl today," it's not because they're behaving badly. They're just being themselves and being men.

'I'm kind of bored talking about it. I'm busy doing my job. You never know if this is going to be the last time they ask you, do you? Or when your time's up. I never take any of this for granted.' And, with a swish of that flirty little ra-ra skirt, she's up and off, pushing her way through all that testosterone.
