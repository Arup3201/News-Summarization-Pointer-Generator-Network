A grandfather who murdered his ex-wife and hid her body inside her bed where it lay undiscovered for three weeks has been jailed for life.

Daniel Spencer, 59, will have to serve at least 16 years behind bars after he beat and strangled his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on July 24 last year.

He then placed the petite grandmother’s body inside her bed, with pillows and blankets tucked around her, before telling friends and family she had gone on holiday.

Concerns began to grow when Ms Wiggett failed to turn up for appointments and a search party gained entry to her home two days later.

They looked round the property but did not spot the body because Spencer had hidden it so well beneath the 'carefully' made bed.

Spencer, from Cheltenham, told Ms Wiggett’s relatives that she was on holiday in Penzance, Cornwall and in contact with him by phone.

However, as weeks went on, people began to grow suspicios of Spencer and Ms Wiggett was reported missing to police on August 15.

Officers finally found her body the following morning.

Grandfather Spencer, who denied a charge of murdering Ms Wiggett, attempted to flee the country but was arrested in a hotel by Birmingham Airport.

He denied having any part in Ms Wiggett’s death during a 12 day trial at Bristol Crown Court but a unanimous jury convicted him of murder following three hours of deliberations. 

Spencer remained emotionless as the verdict was returned.

Prosecuting, Richard Smith QC, previously told the jury Spencer was a 'jealous' and violent man, who repeatedly lied to cover up what he had done.

'On Wednesday July 24 last year, this defendant visited his then ex-wife in her flat in Cheltenham,' Mr Smith said. 'Something happened to anger him and upset him.

'There was something of a struggle. Jane Wiggett resisted, it seems, his attack upon her. But the defendant took her by the throat and this time it culminated in him taking her life.

'He put and left Jane’s body lying in her own bed, positioned on her back. Her face was covered with a pillow, her quilt was then carefully put over her as if to hide the fact that she was dead inside.'

Spencer and Ms Wiggett were married for 30 years, during which she twice reported him to the police for grabbing her by the throat, before their divorce in 2005.

Ms Wiggett, who weighed just seven-and-a-half stone, was last seen on the evening of July 24, after which her phones and credit cards were not used.

Spencer also immediately ceased all phone contact with his ex-wife after that date but told relatives and police she had gone to Cornwall for a break.

Friends and family decided to visit Ms Wiggett on July 26 and gained access to her flat.

'They didn’t notice Jane’s body lying under the quilt and blanket, covered over with pillows, in her bed,' Mr Smith told the jury.

Police were called at 7.48pm on August 15 and attended her home at 3am the following morning. 

An officer pulled back the duvet of the bed and spotted Ms Wiggett’s foot. 

A post-mortem examination found Ms Wiggett had been hit before her death, which was caused by strangulation. Traces of Spencer’s blood were discovered under her fingernails.

Police contacted Spencer, who promised to hand himself in but actually fled up north before staying at a hotel in Birmingham airport under a false name.

A member of staff at the hotel recognised Spencer from a police appeal published in the national papers and called officers, who arrested him on August 19.

Representing Spencer, Andrew Langdon QC said his client suffered from diabetes and poor blood pressure control.

'Given his health he perhaps takes the view that the prospect, given this verdict, of him ever enjoying any liberty in the future is remote,' Mr Langdon said.

Members of Ms Wiggett’s family gasped and sobbed loudly as the verdict was returned.

The conversation took place on August 15 last year.

Police: Hello, not to alarm you, my name’s Lisa, I’m calling from Gloucester Police. I’ve just had a call from a Lin Wiggett, she’s really concerned for her sister-in-law, Jane. She said that you may’ve been in contact with her?

Daniel: Urm, she’s supposed to be phoning me tonight at about 10 o’clock.Police: She’s going to speak to the family tonight at around 10?

Daniel: No, she’s going to phone me at 10 o’clock tonight.Police: Oh, she’s going to phone you at 10 o’clock. Where is she?

Daniel: In Penzance.Police: She’s in Penzance. And why is it that she’s not speaking to everybody else?

Daniel: Urm, I don’t really know.Police: You don’t really know. OK so, have you got a telephone number for her?

Daniel: No she’s going to phone me.Police: She’s going to phone you. Because obviously, because she’s going to be, she’s been reported as a missing person to us. Which means we need to see her in person to make sure she’s OK and everything else.

Daniel: OK well if you give me a contact number, then obviously when she phones me, I’ll get her to phone you. How’s that?

Police: That’ll be wonderful. It’s going to be 101.Daniel: Right, OK.

Police: OK, she needs to listen to the options, and listen out for Gloucestershire Police. If that’s not a surrounding force for her, then she needs to wait to the end to speak to the operator, and then tell the operator ‘I want to be put through to Gloucester.’ OK? And her incident number with the police is going to be Incident 457 today.

Daniel: 457, OK that’s fine.Police: OK?

Daniel: OK then, thank you.

Police: That’s fantastic thanks very much Robert.. uh Daniel, sorry, that’s your middle name isn’t it? I do apologise. Thank you ever so much for your help Mr Spencer.
