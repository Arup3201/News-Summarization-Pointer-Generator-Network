When a car accident results in two four-year-olds and their father being flung out of the vehicle, the result is not usually a good one.

However, that was not the case for the Krapova twins Nikita and Sasha and father Igor, 38, who were involved in a high-speed collision in the Russian city of Orekhovo-Zuyevo.

Police reported that Yulia Krapova, 36, crossed lanes of traffic without looking to see if the coast was clear.

Yulia Krapova, 36, in the green car crossed lanes of traffic without looking to see if the coast was clear

Mrs Krapova’s car collided with one driven by Ivan Zhuganov and the impact flung her husband and sons from her vehicle.

Both cars were write-offs but the Krapovas and Mr Zhuganov escaped without a scratch.

Shockingly rather than being concerned for her family, Mrs Krapova’s first thought was for herself.

Her first concern was ‘What is going to happen to me because of this? Will I go to jail?’

A policeman said of Mrs Krapova: ‘It shows what was most important to her at time. It was not the reply that officers had expected.’
