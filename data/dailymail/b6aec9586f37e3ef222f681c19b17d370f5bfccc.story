Savvy shoppers are adding niche books and old CDs to their orders to beat Amazon's delivery price hikes

Savvy shoppers have found a novel way to beat Amazon's delivery price hikes - by adding bargain basement books and unfashionable CDs to their order.

The online retailer now requires customers to spend a minimum of £10 on some items in order to qualify for free delivery, but any order with a book still qualifies for free postage regardless of the price.

Consequently, unusual book titles and albums by old X-Factor contestants that cost less than a stamp are proving popular after shoppers discovered they can be used to slash delivery costs.

Book titles including 'AQA Anthology Study Guide Poems from Duffy, Armitage, Pre 1914', Blackstone's 'Statutes on Contract, Tort and Restitution 2010-2011' and 'Towards a Post-Fordist Welfare State?' have proved surprisingly popular, after bargain hunters shared their tips on a money saving website.

Amazon announced last week that customers must spend a minimum of £10 on certain items to use its 'Free Super Saver Delivery' option.

Electronics costing less than £10 incur a delivery charge of £3.99, while products from the retailer's clothes, DIY, groceries, health, sports, home and jewellery ranges will set shoppers back £4.28 for delivery plus a charge of £1.73 per item, equivalent to £6.01.

For example, under the new rules, a £6.75 mug that previously qualified for free postage, will now cost an additional £6.01.

However, customers can cut the overall cost of their order if
they add products that are exempt from the new charges, including 
books, DVDs, CDs and video games.

Many second-hand or severely discounted items in these ranges cost significantly less than the new delivery charges.

As
a result, customers are scouring the site for these bargains and adding
them to their orders, even though they do not want them.

Several
exam revision guides cost less than 50p and adding the 32p book 
'AQA Anthology Study Guide Poems from Duffy, Armitage, Pre 1914' will 
allow any order qualify for free delivery, saving £5.69 on the delivery
of the mug.

A mug selected on Amazon.co.uk costs £6.75 but incurs a whopping £6.01 delivery charge following the retailer's shake-up of which items qualify for its 'Super Saver Delivery' package

Savvy shoppers also identified two books - Blackstone's Statutes on Contract, Tort and Restitution 2010-2011 and Towards a Post-Fordist Welfare State at 42p that would reduce the cost of orders substantially.

However, there is often a limited supply of such niche titles as shoppers try to take advantage of the delivery charge loophole.

Consequenly, bargain hunters are 
trying to identify more readily available mainstream titles to reduce 
the overall cost of their online shopping.

Possible helpful CDS include titles by Air, Phil Collins and old X-Factor contestants.

'Everybody Hertz' by French electronic duo Air costs just 94p and 'The Impossible Dream" by X-Factor runner-up Andy Abraham was just £1.27 at the time of writing.

There are also albums that were 
former number ones by Phil Collins and Jamie Cullum that are 
substantially cheaper than paying some delivery charges.

Collins' hit record, 'But Seriously' costs just £1.37 and 'Catching Tales' by the jazz pianist is available for £1.66.

By adding bargain books or CDs to a basket - such as the law book that costs 42p in this order, shoppers can once again qualify for
free delivery again and save over £5 in delivery charges

Customers have taken to the money saving 
website hotukdeals.com to discuss ways of beating the price hikes, which
came into effect on July 23.

User JPS wrote: 'You can add a really cheap CD to your order to gain free delivery once again.

'There are plenty around...This would then get you free delivery on cheaper products - a nice saving on the 6 pounds odd Amazon want for delivery now.'

Others used the forum to complain about the new pricing policy, with member lucyferror writing: 'Oh dear that's horrible news.

'Free delivery was always one of main reasons to buy on Amazon. It looks like they are trying to save lots of money and lose lots of customers.'

A user called unreality said: 'This is a disgraceful backwards step by Amazon. They make enough money. Vote with your wallets people and they'll soon reconsider.'

A message on Amazon's website about the new charges reads: 'Orders that include books, DVDs, 
Blu-rays, music, video games and software products continue to qualify 
for free Super Saver Delivery with no minimum spend threshold.

'Whilst the change will affect only a 
very small proportion of orders, it will allow us to offer you a 
significantly expanded selection of lower priced products.

'We continue to work hard every day to improve the delivery services that we offer.'
