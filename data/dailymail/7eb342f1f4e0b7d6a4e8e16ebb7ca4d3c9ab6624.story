We may soon be able to virtually explore our local universe in the same way we explore Earth -  thanks to a new map of space that plots the location and flow of our nearest galaxies.

The Cosmography of the Local Universe was created by Helene Courtois from the University of Lyon and a team of researchers.

It attempts to map the universe up to around 3,000 million light years away from Earth including the the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.

The Cosmography of the Local Universe was created by Helene Courtois from the University of Lyon and researchers from the University of Hawaii. It attempts to map the universe up to around 3000 million light years away from Earth including the the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.

The Local Supercluster, also known as the Virgo Supercluster contains the Virgo Cluster and the Local Group.

This Local Group is centred around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.

At least 54 galaxy groups and clusters have been found within its diameter which is thought to be around 10 mega-light years wide.

In 1982 astronomer R. Brent Tully published research explaining the basic structure of the Local Supercluster.

His findings said the Supercluster consists of two components: a flattened disk containing two-thirds of the supercluster's  galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining third.

Courtois, along with researchers Daniel Pomarede, Yehuda Hoffman and Denis Courtois, has now produced a 17-minute video explaining what the mapping shows us.

R. Brent Tully is also listed as a contributor and it was his 1982 paper that first presented the basic structure of the Local Supercluster of galaxies.

Tully is an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The video is part of the Cosmic 
Flows project.

It is made up of various 
3D representations of the local universe that the researchers animate, rotate, pan and zoom around during the video.

The flat plain of galaxies is turned into a 3D representation in the video by French astronomers. Each galaxy is colour-coded to signify distance from Earth. The nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the Virgo Cluster 'equator' and the Formax Cluster in the lower-left quadrant

Our local galaxy is visualised around the Virgo Cluster equator - centred at the Milky Way. The galaxies nearer this equator are densely populated, while empty spaces around these stars are called voids

Courtois also provides a commentary of what each graphic represents and points out areas of interest. 

Each galaxy in the video is colour-coded to signify distance from Earth.

The nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the Virgo 
Cluster 'equator' and the Formax Cluster in the lower-left 
quadrant.

The most significant structures highlighted are the Pavo-Indus Supercluster next to the Local, or Virgo, Supercluster. 

Another graphic taken from the Cosmography of the Local Universe video map shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies. High density regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue. In the video the region around the Centarius and Fornax Clusters are densely populated so have many velocity flows

The Local Supercluster contains the Local Group; made up of around 54 galaxies including the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies.

Its gravitational center is located somewhere between Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy.

The Local Group covers a diameter of 10 megalight-years.

The video then zooms in to show the galaxies nearest to Earth, including the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.

By rotating the galaxies, the researchers were able to see that most of our nearest galaxies lie on a flat plain.

In one graphic, rows
 are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from Earth.

Galaxies that move in a deviant or 
peculiar way towards Earth are shown with dark blue arrows and 
deviant motions away from Earth are shown in red.

In this cosmography graphic, rows are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from Earth. Galaxies that move in a deviant or peculiar way towards Earth are shown with dark blue arrows and deviant motions away from Earth are shown in red

Galaxies to the right of the Milky Way tend to have blue arrows while the ones to the left have red ones.

The researchers claims this is evidence there is a flow of movement that picks up speed from right to left across our local galaxies.

Another 3D representation created by the researchers for the video shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies.

High density 
regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue. Voids are large spaces in the universe that don't have any, or contain only a handful, of galaxies.

In the video the region around the Centarius Cluster is densely populated so is shown in red with many velocity flows travelling into it.

The film then ends with a 'fanciful view of the supergalactic equator.'

The left-hand image from the Cosmography of the Local Universe map shows the layout of our closest galaxies with the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies highlighted. The right-hand graphic shows the surrounding galaxies that make up a proportion of the Local Group within the Local Supercluster

This cosmography represents around 0.32 per cent of the entire universe and scientist claim the visible universe extends 93 billion light years away.

This doesn't include parts of the universe that are not visible.

According to the video, our local universe is full of clusters of galaxies and filaments that form the edges between large voids.

'The complexity of what we are seeing is almost overwhelming,' said Courtois during her commentary.

The cosmography film ends with a 'fanciful view of the supergalactic equator,' pictured. This cosmography only represents around 0.32 per cent of the entire universe and scientists claim the visible universe extends at least 93 billion light years away

The video below is a three minute edit of the Cosmography of the Universe.

The full length, 17-minute version is available from the Cosmic Project website.
