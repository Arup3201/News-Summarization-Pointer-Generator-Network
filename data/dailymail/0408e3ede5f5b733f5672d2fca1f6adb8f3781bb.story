A hidden 'back door' in a computer chip could allow cyber-criminals a way to override and control computer systems on Boeing 787s.

The vulnerability is in an Actel chip used in their computer systems, and seems to be hard-wired into the devices.

This could mean the vulnerability - in chips used in Boeing's  flagship Dreamliner - is near-impossible to eradicate.

The security researchers who found the vulnerability have alerted governments around the world to the 'back door' - which could leave critical aircraft systems vulnerable.

This sort of vulnerability is unusual - most hacks use software, but a 'back door' in such a critical system could allow malicious attackers a way 'past' computer protection systems.

'Back doors' are commonly built into computer systems by programmers to allow quick and easy access - but on a chip of this sort, represent a dangerous vulnerability.

Security researcher Chris Woods of Quo Vadis Labs told The Guardian, 'An attacker can disable all the security on the chip, reprogram 
cryptographic and access keys … or permanently damage the device.

'The real issue 
is the level of security that can be compromised through any back door, 
and how easy they are to find and exploit.'

Security researchers have previously suggested that Chinese companies build vulnerabilities into chips that are exported to the West for use in military systems.

In this case, however, the 'back door' may be innocent - although now it has been discovered, it remains a threat. 

Rik Ferguson of Trend Micro security, told The Guardian, 'This kind of flaw that gives somebody access right into the device has inherent flaws. The fact that it’s in the hardware will certainly make it harder – if not impossible – to eradicate.'
