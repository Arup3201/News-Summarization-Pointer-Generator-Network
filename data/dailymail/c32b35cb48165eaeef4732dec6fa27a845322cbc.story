A Los Angeles police officer who was charged with smuggling a Mexican man into the United States in the trunk of an SUV is being held on a $20,000 bond.

Carlos Quezada Jr appeared in US District Court in San Diego on Monday afternoon after he was arrested on Saturday night trying to enter the US at the city's Otay Mesa port of entry. 

A federal complaint said Quezada, 34, was stopped after an X-ray machine alerted border inspectors to a man hiding in the spare tire area of a Nissan Juke.
