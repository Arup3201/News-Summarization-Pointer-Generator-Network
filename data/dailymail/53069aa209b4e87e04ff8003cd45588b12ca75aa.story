A front in the Yukon has caused mountain ash berries to ferment, and as an unfortunate result the birds that feed on them are nearly drinking themselves to death. 

The berry is a particular favorite of the Bohemian waxwing. 

The alcoholic berries leave them so intoxicated they may even have difficulties flying and avoiding obstacles.

'There are many, many records of waxwings drinking themselves almost to death,' Derek Matthews, chair of the Vancouver Avian Research Center,said, according to AOL. 

Still others have been killed or injured by flying drunk into windows and walls. 

To help deal with the tipsy birds, the animal health unit of Environment Yukon is putting together an avian drunk tank to help sober them up.

Birds who might be intoxicated are put into a hamster cage to sleep it off. 

For those with an advanced berry binge problem, there's even a 'rehab' program at the Yukon Wildlife Preserve.

According to a 2012 study, the birds have an abnormally large liver and therefor a higher tolerance.

The binges are a seasonal Yukon occurrence in November and December as the berries ferment.
