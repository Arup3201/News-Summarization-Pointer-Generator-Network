Football pundits are now a permanent part of the TV scene, dispensing their thoughts and theories in stadiums, studios and, at this World Cup, rather inventively on Copacabana Beach.

For many recently retired footballers it has become a lucrative second career, while for others it’s a useful buffer between finishing playing the game and going back to it.

So, it is fitting during a World Cup in Brazil to look back on the men who helped start the ‘experts’ ball rolling - in the year we saw Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho and Co triumph in such glorious fashion.

Good old days: ITV's 1970 World Cup punditry team which included Jimmy Hill (third from left)

It is 1970 and the front cover of the Radio Times World Cup edition sports a photograph of revered England captain Bobby Moore standing proud, TV Times chooses a glamorous blonde model in an England shirt. Vive la difference!

Their differences didn’t end there. BBC had Joe Mercer and Don Revie in Mexico, while ITV put together their famous World Cup panel in London: Manchester United and Scotland’s Paddy Crerand, Wolves and Northern Ireland’s Derek Dougan (The Doog), and the gloriously extrovert Malcolm Allison. They would regularly wind each other up and Allison became the star turn.

He had an answer for everything - or almost everything and Arsenal left back Bob McNab, left out of Sir Alf Ramsey’s World Cup squad, was armed with a bell to ring when he wanted to get a word in edgeways.

Outspoken, irreverent, argumentative, occasionally bang out of order and good telly, the ITV panel created a real stir. And while the BBC still won all the big head-to-head battles, the viewers often turned to ITV on the final whistle to hear what the four musketeers — in kipper ties, flares and wide lapels — made of it all.

They were a smash hit and with Brian Moore and Jimmy Hill firing the questions, things always got lively.

Controversy was never far away. England midfielder Alan Mullery, fresh home from having been knocked out of the World Cup, went to the live studio and gave his chief critic Allison both barrels.

He fished an England cap out of a plastic bag, thrust it in Allison’s direction and said: ‘I’ve got 30 of these and this one’s spare’. For once, the uncapped Big Mal was speechless.

These days, World Cup punditry has become a little more ordered (plastic bags are at a premium!) with greater immediate analysis of the action, more camera angles and technical gizmos to help illustrate a point more clearly.

The current choice of individuals on both channels reflects the wider world of football and there are still plenty of characters.

But wouldn’t it have been fun to hear the most famous World Cup panel’s take on England’s super-early exit, Robben’s diving, the magnificence of Messi — and a certain Luis Suarez and his wandering teeth?

Bob, time to get the bell out mate!

Confident: Brian Clough as ITV pundit

Having watched football on TV for more than 50 years and worked at the top of the business for BBC and ITV Sport, I have listened to some great pundits — and gave some of them their break in broadcasting. Here are five who made the viewers sit up and take notice.

Jimmy Hill

An absolute one-off. He starred on The Big Match and when he did Match of the Day, he presented the programme and did the analysis! Awash with ideas, he has always had the integrity of the game at heart. I once told him he had finished top of a popularity survey among football presenters.

‘Great,’ he said. I then told him he had also finished top of an ‘unpopularity’ poll. ‘Great as well,’ he said. ‘The place not to finish in that type of thing is in the b****y middle!’

Brian Clough

Irreverent, awkward, and self-opinionated, Clough was not short of self-confidence. It all made for compelling TV, even if it tripped him up — for example when he famously called the Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a ‘clown’ a few days before he had the game of his life against England.  As a young viewer I hung on his every word.

Class act: BBC pundit Alan Hansen

Martin O’Neill

Quirky, curious, independent, occasionally left-field and with a great career as a player and manager to back up his views. He’s now the  manager of the Republic of Ireland but I gave him an early break in TV when George Best failed to show up for the BBC’s coverage of the 1986 World Cup. O’Neill is currently providing interesting thoughts on the World Cup for ITV from Copacabana Beach.

Gary Neville

Fresh out of the dressing room, bright, opinionated and articulate. He was interesting and forthright as a player and took all that enterprising thinking into a new career on Sky Sports.

Alan Hansen

Took the class he showed as a player at Liverpool into his long career at the BBC. Hansen was nervous when he started but soon found his feet and has spent two decades dissecting goals and making perceptive comments. He retires after this World Cup and will be missed.
