Chelsea have suspended three people from Stamford Bridge following the racism incident on the Paris Metro.

A group of the club's supporters were filmed chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the underground system in the French capital on Tuesday.

The club believe they have since identified a number of people from the footage and have taken steps to punish them.

Three people have been suspended from Chelsea's stadium and will be banned permanently should there be enough evidence against them. 

An official statement on the club's website read: 'Chelsea Football Club is suspending three people from Stamford Bridge as a result of investigations into the incident on the Paris Metro on Tuesday evening.

'If it is deemed there is sufficient evidence of their involvement in the incident, the club will issue banning orders for life.

'We have received substantial information to date following our witness appeal and we are grateful to the many Chelsea supporters who have provided information so far.

'Our investigations are on-going and we would request any further information is sent to customer.services@chelseafc.com.

'We also continue to cooperate fully with the Metropolitan and Paris police forces who lead the ongoing criminal investigation.'

Paris prosecutors confirmed that the alleged victim, identified in media reports as Souleymane, had made a formal complaint.

The French authorities were working with their British counterparts and anyone convicted could face a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to 45,000 euro (£33,000).

In an interview with Le Parisien on Thursday, the man named by the newspaper as French-Mauritian Souleymane S called for those involved to be jailed.

He says he could not bear to tell his wife or children about what occurred on Tuesday afternoon at the Richelieu-Drouot Metro station.

The man, reported by Le Parisien to be a chief operating officer at a business close to the Metro station, told the newspaper: 'These people, these English supporters, have to be found, punished and should be locked up. What happened shouldn't go unpunished.'

Chelsea released a statement describing the incident as 'abhorrent' and vowed to take the 'strongest possible' action if supporters are found to be involved.
