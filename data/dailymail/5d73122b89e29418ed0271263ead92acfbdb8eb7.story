Charged: Miriam Keren Contreras is facing child endangerment charges after accidentally leaving a child on her bus Tuesday in Houston, Texas

A Houston bus driver was arrested for leaving a child on the bus to while she attended a Zumba class.

Miriam Keren Contreras was charged with felony child endangerment following the incident on Tuesday.

The child was discovered after school administrators at Fonwood Early Childhood Center called the child's parents to report an absence for the day.

The parents, however, had put the child on the bus.

The child was soon found in the bus which was parked at a gym where Contreras was taking a Zumba class.

She says she dropped off the children at school and thought they had all gotten off the bus.

However, she did not check the bus thoroughly to make sure all the children had gotten off and so the child was able to stay on.

Contreras works for Garcia Bus Co and not the school district. It was uncertain Thursday afternoon whether she was still employed by the company.

Contreras's bail was set at $2,000.

MailOnline's calls to Contreras were not returned Thursday. The school has refused to comment.

Fired? It was unclear as of Thursday whether Contreras still had her job at Garcia Bus Co
