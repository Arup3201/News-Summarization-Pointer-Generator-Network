Brazen: The T shirt worn by a gun gang which carried out violent crimes in Halton and Merseyside over a number of months during early 2013

A drug-running gun gang felt so untouchable they wore custom made T shirts boasting: 'Uzi Does it' during a reign of terror, a court heard.

Jamie Barnett, 23, Brady Cole, 24, Dean Kenton, 29, and Lewis Gandy, 22, were all jailed yesterday at Chester Crown Court after
pleading guilty to a string of firearms and drug offences.

The bragging hoodlums proudly showed off the slogan next to a picture of an Uzi sub machine gun as they carried out shootings to enforce drug deals.

Their black shirts were found amongst an arsenal of guns during a raid on the gangs fortress HQ at a first floor flat in Widnes, Cheshire.

But the members of the deadly armed drugs gang are now behind bars after a dramatic raid where police officers battered down a reinforced door to find a stash of drugs and firearms.

Policemen who stormed the gangsters' flat in March this year found a Skorpion sub-machine gun, a loaded Colt .45 pistol and an old-fashioned revolver, along with over 100 rounds of ammunition, stashed in their loft.

They also recovered a stash of heroin and crack cocaine with a street value of £7,100.

Gang leaders Cole and Barnett received 12 years in prison while Kenton and Gandy were handed six-year sentences.

Judge Elgin Edwards QC said: 
'Dangerous dogs, a pistol, submachine gun, weapons, body armour, masks, 
it was an absolute nightmare scenario.

'These men were glorifying violence, 
like designer macho American gangsters. They revelled in gun violence. A
message has to be sent out to people like you and the public at large 
that drug violence will not be tolerated.'

Their criminal activities started early this year, and ‘brought fear to the streets’ according to investigating officers.

This dangerous, fully automatic Skorpian sub-machine gun was the most deadly item in the haul

The gang was based in the Halton area of Cheshire, and used a flat in Widnes, Merseyside as their base.

When officers raided the first-floor flat after a lengthy investigation, they had to break their way through a door which had been reinforced with half-inch-thick steel bars to reach the criminals inside.

Police arrested the four men before finding the array of guns and drugs stashed in the loft of the flat.

Forensic investigations were later able to unpick their criminal activities even further as tests linked the seized pistol to previously-reported shootings in the area.

Police also found money, and a stash of drugs which included heroin and crack cocaine

The drugs haul from the flat included 48 batches of heroin and 23 batches of crack cocaine, enough for more than 700 individual deals.

Officers also found £400 cash, mobile phones, balaclavas and a bulletproof vest used by gang members.

The evidence helped convict the men, whom officers said had stockpiled an arsenal previously unheard-of in the area.

Detective Inspector Simon Blackwell of Cheshire Constabulary said: ‘This is a significant conviction for Cheshire Police.

'Today′s sentencing sees 4 members of an organised crime gang behind bars for a substantial period of time.

The criminals were storing the drugs in what appear to be jars meant for sweets

'This was a lengthy and complex investigation into the criminal activities of a number of individuals who brought fear to the streets of Halton and Merseyside.

'The discovery of weapons of this kind on this scale within Cheshire is unheard of. Never before have we seen firearms of this type - or ammunition of this quantity - on the streets of the county.

'We hope that the sentences handed down to the defendants will allow them time behind bars to reflect upon their actions - and the implications upon the local community in Halton.

'It is clear that the four men believed they were above the law and now they are paying the ultimate price for their criminal activity.'

Maria Corr, senior prosecutor from the 
Crown Prosecution Service Mersey Cheshire, said: 'These men were 
prepared to use guns and violence to pursue their criminal trade and 
used those firearms as they expanded that trade into Cheshire.'
