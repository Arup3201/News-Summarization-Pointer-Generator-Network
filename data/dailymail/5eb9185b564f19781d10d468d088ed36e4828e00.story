These amazing novelty cakes were modelled on characters from children's films and television adverts - and took up to a staggering 50 hours to bake and decorate.

Ceramic designer Vicki Smith, 26, creates the spectacular 'super-cakes', featuring designs such as Finding Nemo, Betty Boop, the Corpse Bride and Wallace and Gromit, at her home in Flintshire, north Wales.

She sketches an image of each cake design on to a board and chooses a variety of tin sizes to suit it - before baking around 15 to 20 smaller, individual cakes.

She then sandwiches the bits of cake 
together using jam or butter cream, carefully carves them with a knife and finally 
starts the lengthy process of decorating the entire cake.

The talented designer has won a string of prizes for her work - with her cakes becoming so 
popular she has even received messages of support from U.S. pastry chef and TV personality Duff 
Goldman on Twitter.

One of Ms Smith's most impressive creations is a detailed sponge cake featuring a baby meerkat named Oleg from the Compare The Market television adverts.

The cake, which took 50 hours to create, scooped top prize in the 
decorative exhibit category at Manchester’s Cake International show last year - while her stunning Coca Cola polar bear creation, which took 40 hours to make, won gold in the sculpted novelty cake category.

Vicki Smith has a successful - albeit, time-consuming - routine she follows for each of her spectacular novelty cakes.

Firstly, she sketches an image of her chosen design on to a board, before selecting a variety of tin sizes to suit the cake.

She
 then bakes around 15 to 20 small cakes, sandwiches them together with 
jam or butter cream and carefully carves them with a knife.

Next, she covers the cake with butter cream to ensure there are no cracks or bumps, before either spraying the cake with pre-mixed colouring or icing it.

She adds smaller features - such as her turtle cake's fins - using fondant icing or props.

If the cake is tall, she fixes dowels in the middle of it to prevent it from collapsing.

And her brown-and-yellow turtle cake 
with fondant fins - dedicated to her grandmother, Bella, who died last 
year aged of 91 - was
 also awarded a top prize at the festival.

'The
 idea for the meerkat
 baby came after I finally had time to catch up on Coronation Street,' 
said Ms Smith, who spends at least 40 hours making each of her novelty 
cakes.

'Compare the Meerkat sponsors the show and when I saw the new character, baby Oleg, I fell in love with him instantly.

'He
 was so cute and I instantly wanted to design him for my next cake. He 
took me 50 hours to make, it was such a long process. When I applied to 
the Manchester’s Cake International, I was in the decorative exhibit 
which means you can be much more adventurous with your designs.

'I
 had already started a Coca Cola polar bear by then, but I had enough 
time to enter my meerkat as well and I took gold for both of them.'

She
 added that her polar bear cake had even won praise from Coca Cola, 
which tweeted her saying the furry white cub ‘looked good enough to 
eat’.

Ms Smith, who studied
 Art at college, started baking and decorating cakes in 2011 after she 
ordered a large white cake for her lorry driver boyfriend Lee Timmin's 
27th birthday.

Disappointed
 by the cake that arrived, she decided to give put her ceramic skills to
 good use - and created her own two-part HGV lorry cake.

But the designer said she had always had a 'keen eye' for detail - saying: 'My teachers were always impressed by my intricate detailing, especially in ceramics.

Music-inspired: 'At college, I really got to dabble in a lot of different arts,' she added. Above, a cake based on Electric Light Orchestra's Out Of The Blue album cover

'I
 have an art background as I have done art all my life. At college I 
studied all types of different creative fields, where we looked at life 
drawing and sketching to name a few - so I really got to dabble in a lot
 of different arts.'

Ms 
Smith, who lives with her parents, said she could only design and bake 
cakes on evenings because of her full-time job - meaning some of her 
creations took several weeks to produce.

'Now that I make cakes I understand how 
much time and money goes into it,' she said. 'Because I work full time 
as well, I only get to do cakes now and then and can only do them at 
night and it can literally take me all night which sometimes I can end 
up resenting it because I am so tired.

'I
 do all of my baking and decorating at home, my mum and dad want to make
 me a little workshop in the garden with a kitchen and a little washing 
and drying machine.

'At the moment it is a nightmare as my mum is so pristine and because I work through the night she wakes up to a really messy kitchen! I’m an artist so I am really messy anyway.'

She added: 'Designing the cake can take weeks but the baking is done one week before to ensure freshness.'

Ms Smith's next big project is part of 
collaboration of bakers working on an installation of an edible Indian 
jungle for this year's Cake and Bake show in Manchester.
