The casting of the most anticipated screen couple of the year was only announced on Monday and fans of erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey have been quick to express their disappointment.

Fans of the best-selling book took to Twitter to blast the author and producers' choice of actress Dakota Johnson and British actor Charlie Hunnam in the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.

But the film-makers shot back on Monday via the social networking site to defend the casting of Sons Of Anarchy star Hunnam and the little known The Social Network actress Dakota.

So postmodern: Fifty Shades author E.L. James took to Twitter for the big reveal

One fan tweeted regarding the leads: 'Who the heck are these people who got casted 
for fifty shades?…'

Another Fifty shades readers groaned out: 'Of all the people, they pick those
2 to be the characters for fifty shades of grey? ugh why?'

But one fan was utterly devastated, writing: 'Ok…. they kill it they 
freaking kill it. The movie has been totally ruined. Fifty shades will 
suck now.'

But one Twitter commenter went so far
as to compare the casting choices to the controversy surrounding Ben 
Affleck as Batman: 'First it was Ben Affleck as batman& now they 
have 
cast Charlie Hunnam as Christian Grey in 50 SHADES OF GREY…that’s so 
wrong! #FiftyShades'.

The backlash inspired producer
Dana Brunetti to explain the casting process and what informed the decision to pick both actors.

'There
is a lot that goes into casting that isn’t just looks. Talent, 
availability, their desire to do it, chemistry with other actor, etc.

'So if your favourite wasn’t cast, then it is most likely 
due to something on that list. Keep that in mind while hating and keep 
perspective.'

Fifty Shades author E.L. James, had her own message to share with fans, as she tweeted:'To
all the supporters, lovers and haters – thank you so much for the 
passion that you have for this project. You all rock. All of you'.

And 80s pop novelist and screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis blasted to his followers: 'Talked
to E.L. James at a party over the summer: her first choice for 
Christian was Rob Pattinson.'

Adding: 'E.L. James and I were at Rob Pattinson's house when 
she admitted that Rob was first choice for Christian.

'When E.L. James asked me who I thought should be Christian I 
said "James Deen, of course," and then she shoved me. We were both very 
wasted.'  

Meanwhile, Dakota,
23, is a relative unknown having previously appeared in The Social Network - in which she shared a 
love scene with Justin Timberlake - and had small roles in 21 Jump 
Street, The Five-Year Engagement and Beastly.

She
is the daughter of Don Johnson, best known for TV shows Miami Vice and 
Nash Bridges, and his actress ex-wife Melanie Griffith.

It's
thought producers cast Dakota because they wanted a young, 
up-and-coming actress to play the role of virginal Anastasia, who 
embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery with her S&M-loving
boss Christian.

Show it off: Charlie Hunnam has starred on FX's Sons Of Anarchy since 2008

Charlie, who is 33 years old and British, stars in the dark biker thriller Sons Of Anarchy as Jackson 'Jax' Teller and also appeared in Guillermo del Toro's robot epic Pacific Rim.

He gained fame on the UK drama Queer 
As Folk, on which he played gay teenager Nathan Maloney; the show ran 
from 1999-2000 and was remade for American audiences by Showtime (under

same title).

The castings caused waves of rumours about
who would take on the roles - Emma Watson, Imogen Poots, Armie Hammer 
and Ian Somerhalder, among many others, were at one time tied to a main 
role on the film.

Producer Michael De Luca tweeted on Monday that Dakota and Charlie showed great promise when they auditioned for the roles together: 'Auditions were stunning, incredible chemistry!' he wrote.

The duo had to do a 'chemistry read,' meaning a scene on video, and Charlie also had several tests with various actresses; he seemingly wanted to know who his co-star was before committing to the project, according to The Wrap.

Fifty Shades Of Grey will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy), based off the adapted script by Kelly Marcel (Terra Nova).

The novel is the fastest-selling paperback of all time and has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide.

Controversial for its depictions of sadomasochistic sex and more, Fifty Shades Of Grey marked the rise of 'mummy porn,' or racy reading intended for mainstream, often middle-aged women.

The film is currently scheduled for release in August 2014.
