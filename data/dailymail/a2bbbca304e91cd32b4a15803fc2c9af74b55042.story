Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has posed for a series of self-taken photographs just hours after she was charged with supplying class A drugs.

The star posted the photos of herself laying down wearing large headphones on Monday evening on her Instagram account, and gave each photograph a different title from the saying: 'Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.'

The star took inspiration from the modern day idiom which tries to teach people to make decisions for themselves rather than judging before all the facts are known.

Number one: Tulisa started with a photo on Instagram that was captioned 'See no evil'

The second picture: The singer then posted a second picture saying 'Hear no evil' with her hands near her ears

Shhh: Tulisa captioned this photograph 'SPEAK NO EVIL'

Although the singer hasn't tweeted since the charges were announced, she has posted several photographs on her Instagram account where fans have left comments of support.

A user called Lucy Brook said: 'Never let anyone bring you down carry on being The TFB [The Female Boss] xx'

It was announced on Monday that the singer was to face formal charges over the incident in the summer. 

The 25-year-old singer, who issued a 
defiant statement that she is innocent, now faces trial over claims she 
arranged an £800 cocaine deal.

She
 was arrested in June after being secretly taped allegedly bragging that
 she could get cocaine for an undercover reporter in a national 
newspaper sting.

Last one: The final picture the star put on her Instagram account was one with her tongue out, captioned 'Hear, see, speak..MUSIC'

She is said to have put the reporter 
in contact with a friend, rapper Mike GLC, real name Michael Coombs, who
 is accused of selling half an ounce of cocaine worth £800 in a meeting 
at the Dorchester Hotel in central London.

Prosecutors announced yesterday that they had sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

Coombs, 35, has also been charged with supplying class A drugs. The pair will appear in court in London next week.

Last night the singer insisted she was innocent.

Miss
 Contostavlos’s lawyer Ben Rose said: ‘Tulisa has been charged with a 
serious criminal offence to which she will plead not guilty.

Charged: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured in a recent social media picture, is accused of supplying Class A drugs

‘This entire case has been manufactured by The Sun On Sunday and Mazher Mahmood, sometimes known as the fake sheikh.

‘They
 spent a large amount of their readers’ money in flying Tulisa and a 
number of her friends first class to Las Vegas. There Mahmood posed as a
 film producer offering her a £3million film contract.’ 

‘In due course Tulisa will give a full answer to these allegations in court.’

A
 Sun spokesman defended the article, saying: ‘The Sun On Sunday’s 
investigation into Tulisa Contostavlos was entirely justified in the 
public interest.

Ms Contostavlos is a self-described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities.

'Throughout
 our investigation, our team followed the Press Complaints Commission 
Code and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police.

‘It is right that this matter  should go to court and be decided by a jury.

‘Allegations about the conduct of this newspaper made by Ms Contostavlos’ lawyers are entirely without foundation.’

Miss
 Contostavlos first found fame with hip-hop group N-Dubz and became a 
household name when she joined the X Factor judging panel.

A lawyer representing Contostavlos (pictured last month) said the entire case has been manufactured by the Sun on Sunday and she is the latest celebrity to be used as 'fodder by greedy newspapers'

She was dropped from the line-up just days before her arrest after earning £1million over her two years on the show.

The
 singer, who left school without any qualifications after a troubled 
childhood on a north London council estate, has claimed that she is an 
‘inspiration for Broken Britain’.

She also faces a separate police probe over claims she punched a showbiz blogger in the eye at V Festival in Essex this summer.

A
 spokesman for Essex Police said: ‘Two people attended voluntary 
interviews at Chelmsford Police station on Thursday, November 28. 
Inquiries are continuing.’
