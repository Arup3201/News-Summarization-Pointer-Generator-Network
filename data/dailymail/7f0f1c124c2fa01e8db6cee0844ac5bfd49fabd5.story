America's richest Indian tribe has 99.2 per cent unemployment -- and it's all voluntary, tribal leaders boast.

There's little need for any member of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Tribe to work. Each adult in the 460-person American Indian nation receives more than $1million a year - for doing nothing.

The payouts are the windfall from lucrative casinos and resorts that the tribe runs on its reservation in Scott County - about 45 minutes southwest of Minneapolis-St Paul.

Wealthy: Members of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Tribe are the richest American Indians in the nation, thanks to $1million annual payouts to each member

The New York Times reports that the payments, $84,000 a month to each adult, were revealed in divorce filings involving one of the tribal members.

The Shakopee keep modest homes on the reservation, but nearly every driveway sports at least one luxury car.

Tribal members usually have multiple homes and have been known to take vacation for months at a time. 

Many choose to take up expensive hobbies. They are big game hunters and breeders of thoroughbred horses. All of the children attend private schools.

Lucrative: The Mystic Lake Casino Hotel includes five restaurants, a 600-room hotel, convention center, 2,100 seat showroom, 8,350 seat amphitheater and a golf course.

It's a remarkable turnaround for a group once hunted down by US Army soldiers -- before finding refuge in Minnesota.

The source of the almost unbelievable 
wealth is a pair of luxury casinos and resorts the tribe has built on 
its land - drawing tens of thousands of gamblers from the 
Minneapolis-St Paul region, and across the state.

The Mystic Lake Casino Hotel is build on a man-made lake. It includes five restaurants, a 600-room hotel, convention center, 2,100 seat showroom, 8,350 seat outdoor amphitheater and a top-notch golf course.

The theater venue competes for major touring acts with venues in Minneapolis and St Paul.

Weak: Some tribal elders worry that the money is making the Shakopee complacent and soft

The Mystic Lake Casino is the fourth-largest Indian casino in the nation.

Combined with the tribe's Little Six Casino, revenues reportedly make up the lion's share of Minnesota's $1.4billion gambling profits, according to the Times.

The tribe has used the money to generous donations to other Indian tribes - lending money and giving grants. It's always used the money to gain clout in the community.

The Shakopee people have donated more than $243million since 1996 and lent out nearly $500million.

Among the major grants is a $12.5million gift to the University of Minnesota to build a new football stadium and endow scholarships for American Indian students.

Not everyone sees the windfall of money as good. Some tribal elders worry the $1million salary is making members complacent.

'Why dig a hole when you don’t need to dig it -- when you can pay someone to dig a hole?' Keith B Anderson, the tribe’s secretary and treasurer, told the Times.

'Instead of budgeting a dinner and movie, you can go to dinner and a movie and have dinner again and see another movie, but you can’t see enough movies and dinners to spend all your money.'
