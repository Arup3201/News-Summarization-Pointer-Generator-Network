The mother of Guma Aguiar, the missing Brazilian-born, Jewish philanthropist, has said that her son may still be alive, wandering the streets of Fort Lauderdale after experiencing a nervous breakdown.

In a petition filed to a Florida court to seize his $100 million fortune, Ellen Aguiar stated that Aguiar 'may be in a delusional state
or be suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.'

Submitting documents to the Broward County Clerk of Courts, Mrs Aguiar is seeking to  become the conservator and guardian of Aguiar's estate following his disappearance on Wednesday after his empty motorboat washed ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach.

Ellen Aguiar pictured with her missing son Guma's boat, has filed a legal petition in a Florida court to control his $100 million fortune independent of Mr Aguiar's wife

In her petition, Mrs Aguiar claimed that, 'The Absentee disappeared as the result of mental derangement, or other 
mental cause, or, in the alternative, disappeared under circumstances 
indicating that he may have died, either naturally, accidentally, or at 
the hand of another.'

Court documents seen by ABC News show that on May 11, Aguiar amended his declaration which designated guardianship over assets 'in the event of my incapacity' from his wife Jamie 
Aguiar to his mother.

A version of the document from March had his wife listed as the primary guardian, but in the May version her name has been removed altogether.

The legal petition to control his assets lists a $50 million investment portfolio, $15 
million in cash and $35 million in Israeli real estate.

Mrs Aguiar has even raised the possibility that her son may have been kidnapped.

'I would be delighted to hear that he was kidnapped and being taken 
great care of, and I believe in miracles and would hope for a miracle. I
think, realistically, what happened is pretty clear,' she told ABC News.

'The likelihood is that he was tossed off the boat into the
waves. The boat was found, but the body has not been found.'

Without a trace: Guma Aguiar went missing last Wednesday night after leaving his family home

Having searched 1,523 square miles, or 
roughly an area the size of Rhode Island, the search for 35-year-old 
Guma Aguiar, the founder of a Texas-based energy company worth billions 
was called off at 9.p.m on Thursday.

Mrs Aguiar, of Pompano Beach, Florida claimed that her son's cellphone and wallet were found on the boat by police according to the files submitted to court reported the Sun Sentinel.

The petition filed at Broward County Clerk of Courts also states that Aguiar is on probation 
after pleading no contest in February to charges that relate to a domestic 
violence case.

Mrs Aguiar is looking to control his 
fortune to support his wife and son's, to manage his properties and to 
pay his employees salaries.

'There is an imminent danger that 
the property of the absentee is in danger of being wasted, 
misappropriated or lost unless immediate action is taken because the 
absentee has disappeared … and assets must be protected from waste 
and/or dissipation,' the petition states.

His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at $5 million, he has seven 
cars valued at $1.1 million, and a yacht that is valued at $2.1 million states Mrs Aguiar's petition.

Speaking to CNN this morning, Mrs Aguiar was unequivocal that her son was having difficulty coping with life.

'He was struggling, he was under tremendous pressures that would not cease,' said Mrs Aguiar.

'And those of us who were very concerned reached out to parties essentially begging them to mitigate him from some of the pressures and allow him to take a break.'

The T.T. Zion, the boat that Guma Aguiar was thought to be piloting when he went missing is now being held at a police warehouse in Fort Lauderdale

In 2006, Aguiar sold his company, 
Leor Energy, for a reported $2.55billion. Since the sale of the company,
he and his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, have been in a bitter legal battle.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, Kaplan
accused Aguiar of believing he was the Messiah. His nephew shot back, 
saying the allegation was slanderous and that he never made such a 
claim.

‘People have said what an amazing 
accomplishment it was that I started a company at 26 from nothing, and 
built it up to be so successful,’ he told the Sun-Sentinel in 2009.

‘When I sold the company, I gave credit to God.’

He was also forcibly admitted to an 
Israeli psychiatric ward in 2010 after he fell victim to what his family
would later call ‘psychological terrorism.’

They released a statement at the time
saying he ‘has been subjected for a prolonged period of time to 
intensive emotional pressures caused by malicious court cases in the 
United States concerning past business deals with his uncle.’

Keeping kosher: Aguiar embraced his Jewish heritage after being raised as an Evangelical Christian

The 35-year-old energy magnate is 
believed to have left his home at around 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday night to 
take his private boat out and has not been seen since.

According to Rabbi Moshe Meir Lipszyc
of Chabad Lubavitch, Aguiar’s family is ‘completely devastated.’ He 
told WPTV: ‘We are hoping and praying for a miracle. We are hoping if he
fell off the boat, that he was able to swim to shore.’

Included in the Coast Guard’s search were two boats, a helicopter and ground crews.

News of the mogul’s disappearance has
travelled to Israel, as Aguiar once donated $8million to Nefesh 
b’Nefesh, an organisation that helps Jews fund their move to Israel. He 
is also a major sponsor of an elite Israeli soccer team.

Aguiar was born to Jewish parents but was raised as an Evangelical Christian, he explained in a 2009 Lubavitch article.

‘I came here because I wanted to try something authentic,’ said Aguiar.

Guma Aguiar has gone missing after his empty boat washed up ashore at Fort Lauderdale, Florida

Guma Aguiar's vessel washed up here on the sands of East Las Olas Boulevard at around 1.15 a.m. with its navigation lights still on and its engines still running.

When the yacht was first found by police, 
they immediately traveled to Aguiar's Fort Lauderdale home where his 
wife Jaime Aguiar informed officers that she thought he was in his 
office.

The U.S. Coast Guard, Broward 
Sheriff's and Fort Lauderdale Police marine units shortly afterwards 
launched a massive search for the missing businessman when he was found 
to be unaccounted for.

The
missing father-of-four's wife told Fort Lauderdale police that she 
has massive concerns for his safety, Detective Travis Mandell said on Wednesday.

'We're all out there, coordinating a search of the waterways, as well 
as the ocean, to try to locate if he's possibly in the water,' said Mandell.

'We had 
officers scouring the beach on ATVs, searching if he may have come 
ashore there.

'Anything's possible at this point, and investigators are pursuing all 
leads, so we're hoping that if anyone out there has seen Mr. Aguiar, to 
please contact their local law enforcement.'

The T.T. Zion was towed up to the boat ramp on 15th Street in Fort Lauderdale and to a police warehouse in the city where it is awaiting police inspection.

A friend of the family, Fred Haddad, expressed his confusion, telling the Sun Sentinel that Aguiar was extremely knowledgeable on boats.

'I'm just kind of dumbfounded,' said Haddad. 'I really like the guy. He's as nice as they come.'

The local Rabbi, Moshe Meir Lipszyc of Chabad Lubavitch of Fort Lauderdale said that he was devastated for Aguiar's family.

'They are all very, very worried about him,' said Lipszyc.

'We are hoping and praying for a miracle. We are hoping if he fell off 
the boat, that he was able to swim to shore. He is massively special and
with God's help and all our prayers, we hope he will be OK.'

A known philanthropist, the Brazilian born millionaire has donated $8 million in the past to Nefesh b'Nefesh, an organisation that helps American and British Jews move to Israel.

Aguiar is also a large supporter of the 'March of the Living' which is an educational program in Poland and Israel designed to continue public awareness of the Holocaust in those countries.

He also became a regular on Israeli sports pages when he invested $4 million into Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar 
Jerusalem in July 2009.

In September 2009, Aguiar also purchased Jerusalem's leading basetball franchise Hapoel Jerusalem for $1.5 million.

Despite his family and business 
interests, Aguiar has a history of mental illness and was admitted to an
Israeli psychiatric hospital after claiming to know a soldier in 
Israel who had been abducted by the terrorist group Hamas.

And court documents indicate that in 
2011, Aguiar's wife Jaime and his mother, successfully petitioned a 
Miami-Dade judge to appoint an emergency guardian for him.

In
addition, Aguiar and his uncle, Thomas Kaplan have been locked in 
litigation over the $2.55 billion sale of an energy company they 
co-founded called Leor Exploration and Production LLC which was involved
in gas extraction in Texas.

Kaplan brought a January 2009 lawsuit against his nephew in which he said Aguiar claimed he was the Messiah.

Aguiar denied making this claim.

'People have said what an amazing accomplishment it was that I started a company at 26 from nothing and built it up to be so successful,' Aguiar told the Sun Sentinel in 2009.

'When I sold the company, I gave credit to God.'

In the same year, Aguiar pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor drug charges after he was stopped by Broward Sheriff deputies at a  traffic stop.

He avoided any jail time for this by tried to level unproven charges of anti-Semitism against the arresting officers.
