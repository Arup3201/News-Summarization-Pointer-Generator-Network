A restaurant employee has been arrested after stabbing his boss to death with a meat cleaver after he posted a picture of the man online.

Tilus Lebrun has been charged with murder after he told police that he was upset by his boss Dimitrios Karaloukas' decision to post a photo of him on Facebook.

The attack occurred at Jimmy The Greek Taverna Restaurant in West Boca, Florida on Thursday night as customers watched in horror.

The Sun Sentinel reports that diners said Mr Karaloukas, 61, was seated in his restaurant when Lebrun, 42, stabbed him three times on his left side and then another time in the back.

There are conflicting reports over whether the weapon was a meat cleaver or a large knife.

Palm Beach police officers responded to the scene at 7.30pm and Lebrun began speaking to them in Creole.

'I killed him because he took my photograph on March 2 and posted it on the internet,' Lebrun reportedly said.

All smiles: Lebrun (right) told police he was angry over a photo posted on March 2 but this photo of Lebrun, Mr Karaloukas and celebrity chef Robert Irvine has been online since April 2012

Proud: Karaloukas was proud that Irvine was a regular at his restaurant, Jimmy The Greek Taverna

'They need to learn how to respect people. I have three kids in Haiti. I know they will suffer, but they will survive,' he told officers at the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office when he was taken in for questioning.

The specific photo taken on March 2 has not been found, but there is another photo of Lebrun and Mr Karaloukas was posted on the restaurant's Facebook page years ago.

The photo in question shows Lebrun, Mr Karaloukas and some of his relatives posing with celebrity chef Robert Irvine when he stopped in the restaurant.

Scene: The Greek restaurant is located in a strip mall in West Boca, Florida

Heartbreaking: Karaloukas, a 61-year-old grandfather, died an hour after the attack at a local hospital

The photo was posted in June 2012 making it unclear why he snapped now.

Mr Karaloukas, a grandfather, was rushed to a local hospital but died as a result of his injuries an hour after the attack.

He was not the only one injured in the incident, however, as Lebrun also stabbed a different male co-worker but that man's identity and the extent of his injuries have not been released.
