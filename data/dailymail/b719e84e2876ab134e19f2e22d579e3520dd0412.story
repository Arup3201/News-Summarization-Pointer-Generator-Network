A lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of a three-year-old Cherokee girl at the center of an adoption dispute has asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents.

It comes as a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31st.

Angel Smith filed a motion in Cherokee County District Court in Oklahoma on Friday asking the judge to suspend the right for Matt and Melanie Capobianco to see Veronica pending a hearing.

The Capobiancos have filed a motion objecting to the stay.

Veronica's birth father, Dusten Brown, is a member of the Cherokee Nation. Her birth mother is not.

Brown is pushing for custody of the girl under the Indian Child Welfare Act.

The court document comes after the biological father of the girl turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina.

That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl.

'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.'

Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office.

Brown was charged with custodial interference after failing to appear at a court-ordered meeting in South Carolina.

He was refused extradition without a governor's warrant from South Carolina.

Brown's lawyer, Robert Nigh, said his client was caught between competing jurisdictions and is 'making every effort to do the right thing for himself and his daughter.' Nigh refused to say where Brown is currently. He's due in court again on September 11.

The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years.

But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth.

On August 12th, the Capobiancos called on federal law enforcement to help them 
bring the child to South Carolina, saying they'll take the matter into 
their own hands if necessary.

'Send
someone to the location our daughter is being held and work with us to 
bring her home. No more delays and no more excuses,' Matt Capobianco 
said during a news conference.

'Our daughter has been kidnapped, and I expect the situation to be treated as such.'

Brown
had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother 
rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and 
paid no child support after the girl was born.

The
legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be 
adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the 
girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions.

The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl.

South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption at the end of July, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos.

South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest on August 10, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th â€” a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.
