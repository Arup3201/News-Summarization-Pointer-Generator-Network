In its quest to bring home the last remaining captive solider from Afghanistan, the Obama administration reportedly did not follow standard detainee release procedures and ignored concerns voiced by the intelligence community that the inmates selected for the trade may be too dangerous.

The release of Islamist militants from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was orchestrated by President Barack Obama's national security team comprised of Pentagon, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff officials.

'There was no dissent on moving forward with this plan,' National Security Counsel Deputy for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes told Time Magazine.

However, members of the intelligence community and Pentagon officials in the past had successfully prevented the release of the Afghan nationals labelled too high-risk to be set free, according to Time. 

An official familiar with the interagency discussions told the publication there were members of the Obama administration and the State Department who argued that the military should 'suck it up and salute’ on this controversial issue. 

By all accounts, President Obama was determined to secure Sgt Bergdahl's release after five years of captivity.

The idea to swap the kidnapped soldier for enemy combatants first came about in January 2009, when then-newly elected President Obama ordered the Justice Department to assess all 240 Guantanamo Bay detainees and select candidates for a potential prisoner exchange.

The review found the five Taliban fighters too high-risk to be released because they were likely to return to the fight against U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

'These five are clearly bad dudes,' an official told Time.

The Obama administration has formed the Guantanamo Transfer Working Group to debate and handle the release of detainees from the military prison in Cuba.

Over the past five years, the group made up of Pentagon, State Department, Homeland Security and the Joint Chiefs of Staff officials has signed off on 82 detainee releases.

The fate of the five Taliban militants, identified as Mohammed Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Haq Wasiq, has been the subject of heated and recurring debates in the intelligence community.

The White House and some officials in
 the State Department saw the release of the high-risk detainees as the 
cornerstone of a possible peace agreement with the Taliban more than a 
decade in the making. 

Those
 who opposed the plan, however, pointed to top secret intelligence 
showing that the Islamists posed a serious threat to American interests, Time reported.

In
 the months leading up to the prisoner swap, the Obama administration 
and its supporters allegedly pressured officials on the other side of the debate 
to come up with evidence proving that the Guantanamo inmates were, in 
fact, dangerous.

Until this
 year, a law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress required the 
Obama administration to meet a set of stringent conditions in order to 
release anyone from Guantanamo Bay.

But
 a few months ago, Democratic Senator Carl Levin was able to weaken the 
certification standards, allowing prisoners to be set free if it benefited national security.

This week, the
 Guantanamo quintet were shipped off to Doha, Qatar, where they are 
expected to remain for a year before being allowed to return home to 
Afghanistan.

President
 Barack Obama promised Tuesday that the U.S. will be keeping an eye on 
the Afghans' movements, but a Gulf official stated that the former 
inmates will be allowed to roam the country free.

Following the deal that freed Sgt Bergdahl, the last American soldier held in Afghanistan, concerns have 
been expressed by some U.S. intelligence officials and congressional 
advisers over the role of the Gulf Arab state as a bridge between 
Washington and the world of radical Islam.

The
 Gulf official said the Taliban men, who have been granted Qatari 
residency permits, will not be treated like prisoners while in Doha and 
no U.S. officials will be involved in monitoring their movement while in
 the country.

‘Under the 
deal they have to stay in Qatar for a year and then they will be allowed
 to travel outside the country... They can go back to Afghanistan if 
they want to,’ the official said.

Speaking during a press conference in Poland Tuesday, President Obama defended the prisoner swap, saying that the U.S. had an obligation not to leave any of its service members behind.

'Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' Obama told reporters. 'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.'

But he then added: ' I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security.'

The five traded Guantanamo inmates include former ministers in the Taliban government, commanders and one man who had direct ties to the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

The prisoner exchange has been scrutinized by Republican leaders, especially in light of revelations that Sgt Bergdahl may have deserted his post in 2009 before he was taken captive.

Senator John McCain described the Taliban militants as the 'hardest of the hard core.'

‘These are the highest high-risk people. Others that we have released have gone back into the fight,’ said McCain.

Days after his rescue, Bergdahl (pictured in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany

The Pentagon concluded in 2010 that Bergdahl walked away from his unit, and, after an initial flurry of searching, the military curbed any high-risk rescue plans

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he hoped the exchange might lead to breakthroughs in reconciliation with the militants and rejected accusations from Republicans that it resulted from negotiations with terrorists, saying the swap had been worked out by the government of Qatar.

‘We didn't negotiate with terrorists,’ Hagel said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press. ‘As I said and explained before, Sergeant Bergdahl was a prisoner of war. That's a normal process in getting your prisoners back.’

Bergdahl, 28, was handed over on Saturday to U.S. forces who had flown in by helicopter. The Taliban said they had released Bergdahl near the border with Pakistan in eastern Afghanistan.

U.S. officials said the restrictions placed on the five Afghan militants included monitoring of their activities. Those assurances were greeted with scepticism by U.S. Republicans and some Afghan officials, who voiced concerns that the men would rejoin the insurgency.

In Washington, some Republicans 
suggested the administration had bypassed a legal requirement to notify 
Congress 30 days in advance about prisoner releases from Guantanamo and 
said the deal amounted to a negotiation with terrorists.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called it a ‘dangerous price’ to pay.

But
 Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said the administration 
was concerned about Bergdahl's health and did not have 30 days to wait in light of the urgent situation.

Some members of
 the U.S. Congress worried even before the prisoner exchange took place 
over the release of the five.

Pentagon 
documents released by WikiLeaks said all five were sent to Guantanamo in
 2002. They were classified as ‘high-risk’ and ‘likely to pose a threat’
 to the United States, its interests and allies.

President Barack Obama defended his decision to release five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, saying today that the country had an obligation to not leave military personnel behind

Republicans in Congress criticized the agreement and complained about not having been consulted about the terms of Bergdahl's release.

Members of the House Armed Services 
Committee said the Pentagon notified the panel by phone on Saturday that
 the exchange was occurring in the next five hours.
