Two soldiers claim that they attempted suicide after they were sacked from the Australian Army for their role in the ‘Jedi Council’ affair, according to News Corp reports.

The insist that they were used as scapegoats in a public campaign to stop sexist behaviour in the ranks.

Six members of the Army were sacked in November 2013 for distributing emails with demeaning and explicit videos and messages of women.

‘The Knights of the Jedi Council’ was an email group with seventeen members who swapped footage of sex acts of women and left misogynist commentary, demeaning up to 10 women who were not aware that they were being filmed.

Two men have spoken out anonymously about how they tried kill themselves after they were sacked from the Australian Defence Force, for their involvement in the 'Jedi Council' sex scandal

When the explicit emails were exposed in June 2013, Army chief David Morrison warned the troops to ‘respect women or get out.’

‘I will be ruthless in ridding the army of people who cannot live up to its value,' said Lieutenant General Morrison in a YouTube video is response to the online sex scandal.

‘Those that thing that it’s okay to behave in a way that demeans or exploits their fellow colleagues have no place in this army,’

But two men say they were not given due process and believe an example was made of them, because they did no worse than make ‘stupid comments,’ just like ‘thousands of other soldiers’, according to News Corp.

Reports say the men believe they were used as a scapegoat so the ADF could take a harsh stance against sexist behaviour in their ranks

They claim that they were used to make to make a strong statement against inappropriate conduct in the army.

The two men claim the Army Chief at the helm of the ranks did not even bother to talk to them, according to News Corp.

‘I take full responsibility for the stupid comments on my emails, but I should have got a kick in the pants, not the loss of my career,’ one of the men anonymously told News Corp.

The two men both claim to have tried to kill themselves, after the decision to release them from the army ‘ended our careers and ruined our lives,’ according to News Corp.

The two men reportedly say their careers are over and their lives have been ruined after their sacking from the Australian army

It is reported that it was a ‘one-man club’, and the other people involved were dragged in.

This month the purported ringleader, Commando Hastings Frederickson, 40, pleaded guilty to three charges of using a carriage to cause offence, for circulating the pornographic images.

Lieutenant General Morrison has said that these actions are in ‘direction contravention to every value that the Australian army stands for.’
