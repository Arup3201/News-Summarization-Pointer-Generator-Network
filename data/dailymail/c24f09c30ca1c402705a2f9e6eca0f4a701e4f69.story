Samantha Brick-wannabe Katie Hopkins has been attacking other women. Again.

The outspoken blonde - who appeared on The Apprentice in 2006 - slammed Kelly Brook for being 'a chubster', and criticised working mothers who are physically larger than a size eight.

Speaking to Closer magazine, the mother-of-three, 38, who claims to be a size eight herself, said: 'All working mums could be a size eight like me if they put in a bit of effort. They’re just lazy. It’s not that hard!

'I believe in "eat less, move more". There are loads of celebrities who need to try harder too. Take Kelly Brook for example… Kelly is quite a chubster. She could work harder for her body.'

The former reality TV contestant enjoys stirring trouble.

She once remarked that she could never love a ginger child, and she came to blows with usually unflappable This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby earlier this month after saying she judged children based on their names, and wouldn't like her own children - India, Poppy and Max - playing with youngsters named Tyler or Chardonnay.

She said: 'I think you can tell a great deal from a name. For me, there's certain names that I hear and I think "urgh".

'For me, a name is a shortcut of finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: "Do I want my children to play with them?"

'When I hear screeched across the playground: "Tyler! Come back 'ere." It's the Tylers, the Charmains the Chantelles, the Chardonnays.'

Mother-of-three Katie Hopkins appeared on ITV recently to say she judges children based on what their names are

She added: 'There's a whole set of things that go with children like that, who are quite a disruptive influence in 'chool and that's why I don't like those kind of children.

'I tend to think that children who have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they make much better playdates for my children.

'We are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions. It's very effective.’

Miss Willoughby, 32, was flabbergasted, responding: 'Listen to what you are saying. You judge children on names. That’s extraordinary.'

Co-host Phillip Schofield was then forced to intervene, asking the women to speak one at a time as the argument threatened to boil over.
