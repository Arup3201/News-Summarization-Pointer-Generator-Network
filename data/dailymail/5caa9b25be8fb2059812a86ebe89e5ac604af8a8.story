Aruba sounded familiar. Could this be anything to do with the Beach Boys' jingly song Kokomo, where the island's name is sung in the chorus. You know how it goes: 'Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya...'

As it was, we would be hearing this tune many times on this fascinating Caribbean island. Aruba is a Dutch protectorate. Once part of a group of three islands that fell under Dutch rule (Curacao and Bonaire are the others), it has been independent since 1986.

From the moment you touch down at Queen Beatrix Airport, you sense there something special is going on.

Home for the week: Enjoying the sunset at the Bucuti & Tara beach resort in Aruba

Yes, it has white-sand beaches and clear, blue waters packed to the brim with every fish you could hope to see and of course the bars ooze rum punch. But there's also the grandeur of the architecture in the capital, Oranjestad.

The Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort is a low-lying hotel on the quiet Eagle Beach, on the western coast. It is adults only. Our room was simple, though luxurious, all dark-wood furniture and linens.

It overlooked a pretty garden, the lawns stretching out to the beach half a minute's walk away.

The capital city of Oranjestad is home to many grand Dutch-style buildings in a myriad of beautiful colours

On our first day, we headed inland to explore some rock formations thought to have healing powers.

My wife Rose swore she felt a tingle, touching the rocks. Then we adjourned for lunch with local fishermen at the Zee Rover, a cafe perched above the landing stage for their boats.

We decided next day that we would take a snorkelling tour boat to get a close look at a wreck.

Tickled pink: Flamingos are easy to spot on Renaissance Island in Aruba

It was something neither Rose nor I had ever done before and we set off in a packed boat for the site, which was about a third of a mile from the shore. We spied some elegant flamingos on the way. 

The wreck loomed out of the gloom 20 ft below us and suddenly we were confronted by thousands of colourful fish flitting here and there. 'They were so close. I felt like a fish,' said Rose.

One day we decided to make a late-afternoon visit to Oranjestad's historical museum. Beautifully laid out in the cool of one of the town's oldest buildings, and packed full of everything from the antiquities made by the island's native people to clever, interactive installations.

Beach life: Most holidaymakers park themselves on the fabulous white sand beaches

Our guide, a young history buff, told us gripping tales about the traders, pirates, invaders and other colourful characters. 

He, and the whole island, is especially proud of one inhabitant, Boy Ecury, who fought with the Dutch in World War II, one of the few black soldiers. He died a hero, executed by the Nazis.

This connection to European history was brought home to us later, touring a nearby park, where there is a lovely statue of Anne Frank.

Colonial colour: Oranjestad blends Latino and Dutch influences with a myriad of colourful buildings

Colourful iguanas stroll protectively around her feet, and we thought how right it was to see her in such a beautiful place, under the Aruban sun.

We had arrived in Aruba feeling like foreigners; we left feeling very much that we had known the place for years.
