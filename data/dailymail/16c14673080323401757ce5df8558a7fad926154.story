A high-speed crash on a major motorway in Queensland has left eight people in hospital and four cars damaged, including one vehicle being set ablaze.

Paramedics were called to the northbound lanes of the Pacific Highway, near Coomera Police Station on the Gold Coast at 9.25am after reports of a fiery crash.

A southbound truck collided with another vehicle after it veered across the median strip, causing the car to burst into flames and swerve into the bushes.

Three other vehicles were involved in the collision, while images have surfaced of the truck, which had its cabin completely demolished.
