The Pentagon dispatched a shadowy veteran of their 'dirty wars' in 1980s Central America to train the sectarian militia units in Iraq that allegedly tortured and killed tens of thousands of people.

Colonel James Steele, a 58-year-old veteran special forces retiree was sent by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2004 to utilize his expertise in counter-insurgency a special investigation by The Guardian newspaper of the UK claims.

Accompanying Steele, who worked as an advisor in El Salvador's bloody civil war of the 1980s was retired Colonel James H. Coffman, who reported directly to former CIA director and retired General David Petraeus.

Allegedly inseparable, Steele and Coffman both oversaw operations at Iraqi detention centers, and Coffman described himself as the decorated general's 'eyes and ears out on the ground'.

Colonel Coffman reported directly to General David Petraeus - seen here in Iraq with U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney in 2006

It is the first time that Petraeus - who
 resigned in November from the CIA after a sex scandal - has been 
implicated through a subordinate to torture in Iraq, which was brought 
to the brink of all-out civil war by the sectarian Shia commando units 
who ran amok across the country after the U.S. invasion of 2003.

The 15-month long joint BBC Arabic/Guardian examination was launched after reporters trawled through the classified U.S. military documents released by Bradley Manning which ended up as part of Wikileaks.

Manning, 25, is likely to be sentenced to 20-years in jail after he confessed to leaking the documents.

According to the probe, in 2004, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld picked 58-year-old retired special forces veteran and counter-insurgency specialist Colonel James Steele to assist in creating Shia militia's to crush Sunni insurgents backed with millions of U.S. dollars.

Keen to exact revenge against Sunni's who backed Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, the U.S. backed Special Police Commando (SPC) units set up secret detention centers where bloody and gruesome sectarian torture was acted out.

Colonel Steele answered directly to Rumsfeld and his right hand man was Colonel Hoffman, who reported directly to General Petraeus, who was at the time training the post-Saddam Iraq security forces.

But according to American and Iraqi witnesses interviewed for the explosive piece, the two military consultants and Petraeus either saw or knew about the deadly daily torture of detainees who were in SPC custody.

'They knew everything that was going on there,' Iraqi General Muntadher al-Samari, who worked with Steele and Coffman to organize the commandos according to The Guardian.

Claiming that Steele and Coffman worked 'hand in hand', al-Samari said that he never saw either them alone and came into contact with them about 50 times.

'They knew everything that was going on there ... the torture, the most horrible kinds of torture,' said al-Samari to the British newspaper.

Apparently, the investigation uncovered no evidence at all that Steele or Coffman tortured prisoners themselves, but still claims they were present at detention centers where it happened.

One witness, photographer Gilles Peress, said that he encountered Steele while on assignment for the New York Times at one of the detention centers in the Iraq city of Samarra.

'We were in a room in the library interviewing Steele and I'm looking around I see blood everywhere,' said Peress to The Guardian.

New York Times reporter Peter Maass accompanied Peress and said,'while this interview was going on with a Saudi jihadi with Jim Steele also in the room, there were these terrible screams, somebody shouting: 'Allah, Allah, Allah!' But it wasn't kind of religious ecstasy or something like that, these were screams of pain and terror.'

Steele, who now works as a motivational speaker did not respond to any questions put to him during the course of the report and Coffman declined to comment.

An official, who spoke on behalf of General Petraeus said, 'During the course of his years in Iraq, General Petraeus did learn of allegations of Iraqi forces torturing detainees. In each incident, he shared information immediately with the US military chain of command, the US ambassador in Baghdad ... and the relevant Iraqi leaders.'

The Guardian newspaper discovered that the Shia Muslim 'death squads' were so out of control that they used to parade suspected Sunni Muslim's on a television program called 'Terrorism in The Hands of Justice.'

The premise of the show was to display suspected insurgents on television but began to be seen as distasteful.

Regardless, Samari is reported to have remembered being in the home of General Adnan Thabit â€“ head of the special commandos - when a representative of Petraeus phoned to demand that tortured men ceased to appear on the program.

'General Petraeus's special translator, Sadi Othman, rang up to pass on a message from General Petraeus telling us not to show the prisoners on TV after they had been tortured,' said Samari to The Guardian.

Othman has denied that his former boss endorses torture and called any suggestion to the contrary 'horses**t'.
