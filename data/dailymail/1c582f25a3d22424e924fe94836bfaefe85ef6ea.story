Two men dressed as Oompa Loompas for a night out brutally attacked two passers-by before starting a drunken street brawl.

Louis Gelinas and Matthew Wright, both 20, were dressed as the fictional characters from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, known for their green hair, orange skin and moral behaviour, when they started a fight in Norwich city centre.

The pair shouted abuse at their victims, calling one of them 'gay', before pushing one of them to the floor.

Prosecutor Stephen Spence said that 'somewhat ironically' the men had targeted their victims because of their appearance.

He added: 'The two defendants together with another man were in fancy dress as Oompa Loompas - fictional characters from Loompa Land which end up being preyed upon by Whangdoodles, Hornswogglers and Snozzwangers.

'They are in fact peaceable characters who Willy Wonka employs in his factory to keep them away from trouble.

'Far from keeping out of trouble, these men got into what was initially a verbal altercation, were abusive, calling one of the men ‘gay’, and ended up pushing the men resulting in facial injuries to one of them.'

A 28-year-old man suffered cuts and bruises in the attack which was caught on CCTV at 3am on December 27, 2012.

Gelinas and Wright, both from Norfolk, pleaded guilty to affray at an earlier hearing.

'My client’s braces were hanging down so it is easy to tell on the CCTV which of the Oompa Loompas he was. He did not start the violence and is seen walking away.'

The pair opted for a more suitable attire as they arrived at Norwich Crown Court dressed in shirts and ties for the sentencing.

Judge Nicholas Coleman ordered Gelinas to complete 240 hours of unpaid work for the community while Wright was sentenced to 10 months in a young offenders institute.

Jonathan Morgan, mitigating on behalf of university student Gelinas, said: 'Clearly they were not dressed for trouble.

Wright’s barrister, Ian James, 
described his client as a 'hard-working and busy' young man who was 
training to become an electrical inspector.

Mr
James added: 'He had taken drink and believed that one or other of his 
friends, by way of the unusual way they were dressed, was involved in a 
confrontation and he involved himself.

Oompa Loompas featured in the children’s
novel Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and are known for their 
moralising songs advising people on what they should and should not 
'Oompa Loompa doompadee do'.
