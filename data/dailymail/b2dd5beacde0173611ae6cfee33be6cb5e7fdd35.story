Tragic: Rachel Hollibaugh (right) and her teenage daughter Tanessa were killed after their truck rolled over in the median of a snowy highway

A woman and her 14-year-old daughter died when a pickup truck loaded with seven passengers flipped on a snowy Idaho highway.

Rachel Hollibaugh, 38, and her daughter Tanessa were both pronounced dead at the scene after Hollibaugh lost control of her Ford F150, according to authorities.

Around 11am Hollibaugh was driving south on Interstate 15 with her six children in the truck when she swerved into the median in Pocatello.

Idaho State Police say the Ford rolled over and came to rest upside down.

Five of Hollibaugh's children were taken by ambulance to Portneuf Medical Center with minor injuries.

The National Weather Service put a winter storm warning into effect for eastern Idaho beginning Christmas Eve.

As of 3 p.m., travel advisories were still in place for the southeastern most corner of the state, warning about heavy snow and blowing snow that would make driving hazardous.

Authorities said that Hollibaugh's next of kin had been notified.
