A couple who have been married for 70 years say the secret to their happy marriage is one argument a day - that's 25,550 disagreements to date.

Kath and Bill Shevels, both 91, are preparing to celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary and say they have had lots of laughs along the way too.

Mrs Shevels said: 'You have got to get everything out in the open and take the bad with the good.

The big 70: Kath and Bill Shevels, both 91, from Darlington, are set to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary tomorrow and say the secret to their long lasting relationship is having one argument every day

'You have to be able to have a laugh. We've lasted 70 years, we must be getting something right.'

The couple, who both worked in the RAF, met in Liverpool during the Second World War.

Kath, aged 20, was serving up food to Bill and his colleagues.

They will be returning to Liverpool to the place where they met to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary.

Mr Shevels said: 'I was first attracted because she was a cook, of course.

'We will be spending our anniversary in Liverpool where Kath is from.

Tit for tat: Although they've had a grand total 
of 25,550 arguments during their marriage, they will be returning to 
Liverpool, where they met, to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary 
and have never been happier

'We spent our last anniversary in Darlington, where I am from, so this is her turn.'

They married in 1943, following a whirlwind romance, and their church wedding was in keeping with austere war times.

Mr Shevel's best man was international Scottish footballer Bobby Beattie.

The couple, who live in Darlington, have one son, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
