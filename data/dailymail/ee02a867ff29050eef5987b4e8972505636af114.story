Leon McKenzie, the Premier League striker turned delivery driver, added another chapter to his remarkable story as he won his first title as a professional boxer by claiming the international masters belt at the iconic York Hall.

It was 10 years ago next month that McKenzie scored for Norwich in a famous 2-0 win over Manchester United at Carrow Road. It has been a decade of ups and downs since for 'Big McK', who endured crippling depression which culminated in a suicide attempt in a Bexleyheath hotel room.

But, in boxing, the former Premier League star has found redemption and has been building to this moment since turning professional in June 2013. And, after making a living from taking his chances on the pitch, McKenzie did not let this one pass.

The 36-year- dominated the 10-round super-middleweight contest against Croatian Ivan Stupalo, winning ever round on referee Marcus McDonnell's card, to claim the strap which makes him the mandatory for the southern area title.

He said: 'Look at how far I've come. If you look where I was five years ago, I'm lucky to even be here. I want to thank my team, this is a journey not just about me but about so many other people. I want to thank God – this is my second chance, my second career.

'It was my first 10 rounder and I enjoyed it in there. I had to be cautious, I had to move around and use my jab. I stuck to the game plan and now I've got this belt and the journey continues. I'm 37 in May – how many 37-year-olds do you know who could do that?'

Boxing talent McKenzie has made the venue is home having fought all but one of his fights there

Boxing talent is very much in the blood for McKenzie. His father Clinton, his trainer and cornerman here at York Hall, is a former British and European light-welterweight champion. His uncle Duke, meanwhile, remains Britain's only modern three-weight world champion.

In fact his father made his professional debut in this very ring in Bethnal Green in October 1976. Then, in 1981, Clinton won his British title here too. It was also a happy hunting ground for uncle Duke, who won both of his fights in this famous corner of the East End.

Now Croydon-born McKenzie has made this his home with all but one of his previous fights happening here while his opponent was beaten on his only other outing here, when he challenged Andreas Evangelou for the vacant international masters light-heavyweight title.

Stupalo, of Split, has since dropped down seven pounds to the super-middleweight division and represented a real step up in class for McKenzie, who, for the first time, was facing an opponent with a winning record.

But operating from behind his stiff southpaw jab, McKenzie dominated a cagey first round and occasionally found a home for his straight left to body. He maintained a composed pace in the second, evading Stupalo's rare forward forays.

McKenzie forced the Croatian on to the ropes and ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory

In the fifth, McKenzie began to let his hands go and opened up a cut on his opponent's head with intelligent use of his backhand. It was not until the seventh road that Stupalo got through, but McKenzie just flashed a grin and got back to his business.

By the eighth the man from Croatia was spending a lot of time on the ropes but McKenzie was unable to find a finishing blow and instead ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory.

The fight was part of a Goodwin Boxing Promotion shown live and exclusive on Matchroom Fight Pass.
