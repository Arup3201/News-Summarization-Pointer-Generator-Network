Yet another winter storm bore down on the East Coast on Wednesday, threatening to dump up to a foot of snow, causing treacherous travel conditions and leaving nearly a million people without power.

Around 120 million Americans were in the path of the storm as it moved from the lower Great Lakes eastward to central New England, where residents can expect to see ample snowfall before the system moves out to sea by Wednesday evening, meteorologists said.

'It's
 going to be a mess,' Rich Thompson with the National Weather Service 
said. 'The heavy snow is going to be up toward Boston and inland from 
the Coast.'

A day after the storm pounded the 
nation's mid-section, there was a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain 
hitting a swath north of Washington, D.C. through New York City, with 
growing snowfall in Boston and parts of New England. In New Jersey, a 
state of emergency was declared.

Residents in Chicago - where the economy has been hard hit by this year's winter storms - are set to endure their 31st day of snow.

More than 120 million people in 32 states
 were in the path of the storm, which threatened to cut power, cancel 
flights and snarl traffic, NBC reported. Already, 900,000 people are without power.

More than 3,000 flights have been canceled as slushy snow and ice blankets runways, with New York-area airports and Boston's Logan International Airport hardest hit, FlightStats reported.

The
 National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for New York 
City lasting until 6 pm on Wednesday, while Con Edison warned residents 
that the snow and freezing rain could spark power cuts across the city.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 
declared a state of emergency and ordered state offices closed on 
Wednesday for all non-essential workers.

'I
 encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully and remain off the roads
 if possible so that our first responders and public safety officials 
can safely respond to any emergency situations,' Christie said in a 
written statement.

the country by Tuesday afternoon, and more than 1,640 that were canceled, 
according to Flightaware.com, a website that tracks air traffic.

A
 second patch of snowfall that was approaching Cleveland and Detroit 
would likely move across to the New York and New England areas later in 
the day, Thompson said.

New
 York issued a hazardous travel advisory for Wednesday and Mayor Bill de
 Blasio told residents to prepare for a difficult commute.

The storm set up Monday night over 
southwestern Kansas and was peaking over Kansas City on Tuesday. More 
than 7 inches (18 cm) of snow had fallen in the Kansas City area by the 
early evening.

 event is uncommon, said NWS meteorologist Dan Hawblitzel, as only about

 inches of snow.

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback declared a state of 'disaster emergency' on Tuesday. Authorities in Kansas and neighboring Missouri advised residents to stay in their homes and the National Weather Service (NWS) warned of 'extremely difficult travel conditions'.

'Kansas
 City and eastern Kansas is going to get a lot of snow,' said Greg 
Carbin, meteorologist for the NWS Storm Prediction Center. 'It's 
remarkable weather. Winter is entrenched. It doesn't appear to be 
wanting to go anywhere.'

Numerous additional accidents were reported in Missouri as cars skidded off slick highways. Icy
 conditions were wreaking havoc in Arkansas, with 
multiple accidents reported on major traffic arteries, said Arkansas 
highway officials.

Also on Tuesday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy postponed his state of the state address.

He said the impending storm was also causing state legislative leaders to push back by a day the start of the joint legislative session.

'While I hope the storm is not as bad as predictions suggest, I also don't want to put anyone in harm's way,' Gov. Malloy said in a statement announcing the delay.

The incoming snow comes after a fast-moving winter storm hit the Northeast on Monday, forcing flight cancellations throughout the region and tying up road traffic the day after the NFL's Super Bowl.

On Sunday, the famed groundhog 'Punxsutawney Phil' emerged from his burrow in the small Pennsylvania town, saw his shadow and - as the legend goes - predicted six more weeks of winter.
