A judge has pleaded for an end to the ‘untold misery’ of a wealthy family  tearing itself apart over ownership of a £50million business.

The divorce of engineering and property tycoon Richard Shield, 72, and Susan, 63, has set mother against son and brother against sister in the High Court.

Lawyers have already clocked up £1million in fees in what Mrs Shield says is her principled fight to make sure that her ‘old-fashioned patriarch’ husband does not financially favour their son, Christopher, 36, over herself and their daughters.

Judge Nicholas Francis QC said:  
‘No-one could fail to observe, and to be dismayed and saddened, by the 
fact that, after 43 years of marriage, this couple’s divorce has 
involved not only themselves but their adult children.’

And
 Mr  Shield’s mental health had gone into such decline that he had at 
one point been compulsorily committed to a mental hospital.

Daughters
 Alexandra, 40, and Nicola, 39, had tried to play down their brother’s  
success in running the Leicester-based business, R.A. Shield Holdings, 
said  the judge.

And Mrs Shield had suggested that her son was being ‘opportunistic’ in supporting his father’s case against her.

In
 a preliminary success for Mrs Shield, the judge ruled that her 
husband’s controlling shareholding in the company – by far his largest 
asset – must go into the pot for division between them in their divorce.

Despite paying tribute to father-of-four Christopher for his role in 
rescuing the company from a crisis in 2002 and re-building it, the judge
 ruled that, primarily for tax reasons, Mr Shield had never 
categorically agreed that he held his shares in trust for his son.

Mr Shield, the court heard, is now being cared for at his home in Queniborough, Leicestershire, but did not testify in court.

Lamenting
 that his ruling did not signal the end of the dispute, Judge Francis 
said it was ‘a matter of deep regret’ that such a bitter ‘family 
squabble’ had not been resolved by agreement.

He
 added: 'It must be hoped that ... the family can yet find a way to 
resolve the  dispute without further bitterness and haemorrhage of 
costs.’

Christopher Shield has told the MailOnline he is looking at fighting the decision.

He said: ‘I’m obviously disappointed in the result and, together with my legal team, am considering an appeal.

'I
 would like to stress that the company will not be affected by what is 
effectively a private, family dispute that has unfortunately been played
 out in public.’
