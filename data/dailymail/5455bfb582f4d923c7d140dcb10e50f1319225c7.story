The bond between two brothers documented in dozens of letters dating from World War Two have today given a fascinating insight into life on the frontline, battling the Hitler's Nazi force.

Separated by thousands of miles, brothers Douglas and Clarence Dover sent dozens of letters to one another throughout the conflict, determined not to let distance come between them.

Douglas, an infantryman, was stationed in northern Africa and Italy while Clarence, a devout Christian and pacifist, helped manage medical supplies in China.

Throughout his time fighting on the frontline during WWII, Douglas Dover, left, wrote dozens of letters to his pacifist brother Clarence, right, telling of brushes with death, bouts of boredom and thoughts of home

Describing day to day life on the frontline, Douglas also recalls attacks by the German enemy. In one letter he tells Clarence: 'Our guns and planes finished off nine of them. But we lost one man and a lorry through them'

The brothers both married, Douglas tied the knot with Barbara in 1953, 
while his brother Clarence wed his bride Mary Flintoff after meeting her
 at a church youth group

The series of letters were unearthed by Clarence's daughter June Cobley, at her home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire - six decades after the conflict.

They tell of gun fights, aerial attacks and swarms of
 locusts plaguing troops while bouts of boredom and thoughts of home made
 soldiers long for the end of the fighting.

While Douglas took up the call to arms and fought for his country, his brother Clarence, a devout Christian, travelled to the Far East with Quaker-run organisation the Friends Ambulance Unit - to help in a warehouse handling medical supplies flown in by planes during the war.

In the letters, Douglas, who served with the Royal Army Service Corps, describes with remarkable good humour the daily fight against the Nazis in the harsh desert battles of northern Africa.

Now, 68 years after the end of the war, 
Mrs Cobley, 61, has discovered the correspondence in a dusty cardboard 
box in the loft, after her father passed away in 2002. However the 
letters her father sent back to Douglas did not survive.

The letters continued until May 1946 when Douglas began his final journey home

Douglas shares with Clarence the freezing conditions and downpours the Allied troops faced

Retired midwife Mrs Cobley, said: 'Dad (Clarence) never talked about the letters but I think they were precious to him as he adored all his family.

'I did know he had letters but he only showed me one when he was alive.

'It has only been in the last two years when I had time to go through them properly and type them up.

'It took ages but I enjoyed going through them. They make me laugh and cry. Despite Douglas fighting the war and my dad being a pacifist, the letters show just how close they were.'

In his first letter, sent from Egypt 
in May 1943, Douglas sets the scene for his brother. The
 soldier, who worked as a driver in the army, said: 'We are getting a 
good bit of bathing in the Med, and it’s lovely to swim and lay in the 
sun.

'You almost forget there’s a war on so near. But you can’t forget for long. In a bit the whistle goes and it starts up again.

'It is almost unbearable in the lorry cab. We were without water for two days. And is it agony to be really thirsty and not be able to get anything to drink. Your lips and the tongue go like leather.'

Dozens of heart-felt letters written by June Cobley's uncle to her father during World War Two were discovered in a dusty cardboard box at her home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire

In another letter Douglas describes 
attacks by swarms of locusts and frogs before adding: 'The cup of char 
is the mainstay of the 8th Army.

'I remember in the push there was a sign which said, "When in dowt brew-up".'

Describing an attack by German Stuka dive bombers in another letter, Douglas added: 'We saw about 20 planes high up and they slowly peeled off one 
by one. We soon got down when we knew it was us he was after.

'All of them come down in a dive and let their bombs go. The
 fourth one must have been hit as it went right down with smoking 
engine, and hit the deck at full speed. Then our Hurricanes came in and 
did Jerry run.

'Our guns and planes finished off nine of them. But we lost one man and a lorry through them.'

In August 1943 Douglas and his comrades formed part of the Sicily invasion force in Italy. His correspondence tells of a sense of relief after escaping the intense African heat.

In one touching exchange, Douglas reveals his sadness at not being able to see his brother while on leave from the frontline. Clarence was working for a Quaker-led organisation in China

Another, written at Christmas of the same year, Douglas shows his humourous side by saying: 'We look like having a good Christmas.

'But there is one thing, we cannot possibly have a worse time than last year. When we (sic) was out in the rain all night and day and had bully and biscuits for dinner.

'One of my pals is making a pretty lousy noise on a small accordion. Never mind, he’ll get fed up of it soon.

'By the way I hope you are behaving yourself with the girls. Cheerio for now, old man.'

As the war in Italy drew to a close, 
Douglas’ letters revealed he had visited Rome, Florence and Venice 
before moving into Austria.

In
 one remarkable letter dated May 7, 1945, Douglas described the 
end-of-war celebrations and said his colleagues have filled up their 
water tanker with wine.

He 
wrote: 'Dear Clarence, Here’s wish you well, I hope you are as glad as 
we all are at the news today (from German sources) that the war in 
Europe is now over.

'Churchill is expected to be giving a speech any hour now to give the official statement.

'PS, our water tanker (capacity 250 gallons) has gone out today to fill up with vino for peace celebration.'

As well as worrying about attacks from their enemy, Douglas and his comrades faced swarms of locusts, frogs and sand flies

The letters give a fascinating insight into life on the frontline for the Allied troops fighting in Italy and northern Africa

In August 1945, after spending time sightseeing and walking in the Italian mountains, Douglas was granted leave to return home.

But in a poignant letter to Clarence, he wrote: 'Only one thing is missing and that is that you will not be there, but maybe will we be together soon.'

And on his arrival back home in Nottingham, he sent another letter telling Clarence: 'Nottingham looks very much the same as when we left, but the girls seem to have lost all sense of moral control.'

The letters continued even though Europe was at peace until May 1946 when Douglas began his final journey home.

And the remarkable collection ends with the lines: 'Well C, I will not make this a very long one.

'For the folks do not know I’m coming... cheerio for now, my next letter will most likely be from home.'

Douglas emigrated to Australia in 
1960 and had four children with his wife Barbara before he died aged 67 
in August, 1989 in Maryborough, Queensland.

After the war, Clarence became a successful export salesman and married Mary, who he had met through church youth groups. He died in March 2001, at the age of 81.

The letters show Douglas's determination not to allow distance get in the way of the brothers' relationship. Clarence's letters to his younger brother did not survive

Mrs Colby, a mother-of-three, is hoping to type her uncle’s letters and produce a book for the family to keep as a memento.

She said: 'I am really proud of my dad for refusing to fight. I could not have done that at the age of 20.

'We
 never quite knew what his family’s reaction was at the time but I have a
 letter from his mother in which she said she was standing by him.

'She wrote to him: "I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you have laboured for the benefit of peace".

'My father did not talk about it much. In some ways, I think he was braver not to fight because of the pressure that was on him.

'I am quite happy for people to know. Too little is known about conscientious objectors, they kept their history to themselves.'

Just a year before he died in 2000, Clarence spoke about registering as a conscientious objector.

He told his local newspaper, the Nottingham Post: 'I was getting regular Christian teaching and I was able to think more deeply about it and apply it to my life.

'By the time war came in 1939, I had made up my mind. You had to convince them of your sincerity and how far you were prepared to go.

'They realised there was no point in pursuing conscientious objectors very hard because they could not win.'
