Patients could one day 'grow' new organs from their own stem cells to replace failing body parts, a leading transplant surgeon says.

It could offer a solution to the donor shortage crisis in the UK, which will only get worse as the population ages.

At least 1,000 Britons die each year while waiting for a new heart, 
kidney or liver, while others are forced to pay for black market organs 
bought in other countries.

Professor Paolo Macchiarini who performed the first transplant of an organ grown from the patient's own cells in 2008, said scientists were now on the verge of using regenerative medicine to treat a far wider range of conditions.

The pioneering technique involves inserting a patient's own stem cells into an artificial scaffold.

It requires no human donors and as there are no problems with organ rejection patients will not need to spend a lifetime taking immuno-suppressive drugs.

Explaining Claudia Castillo's treatment

Writing in The Lancet, Prof Macchiarini from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm,  said: 'Such
 an approach has already been used successfully for the repair and 
reconstruction of several complex tissues such as the trachea, 
oesophagus, and skeletal muscle in animal models and human beings.

'Guided
 by appropriate scientific and ethical oversight, (this) could serve as a
 platform for the engineering of whole organs and other tissues, and 
might become a viable and practical future therapeutic approach to meet 
demand after organ failure.'

Prof Macchiarini said patients involved in early clinical trials should only be chosen if they have social support and are willing to cope with media interest.

In 2008, 30-year-old Claudia Castillo hit the headlines after becoming the first person in the world to have a trachea transplant grown from her own cells. She had contracted TB which had damaged her windpipe leaving her breathless.

Prof Macchiarini, leading a team from Barcelona University, stripped a donor trachea of its living cells and reseeded it with Claudia's cells before transplanting it.

In 2010, he led a British team at Great Ormond Street Hospital to perform a similar operation on a 10-year-old boy born with a narrow windpipe.

The trachea is a simple organ compared to a pair of lungs or the heart, however lung tissue has already been developed and transplant into mice.

However, Prof Macchiarini said more needs to be done to address ethical questions raised by the new technology before it goes any further.

'The pressure to advance this technique, driven by 
demand, the race for prestige, and the potential for huge profits, 
mandates an early commitment be made to establish the safety of various 
strategiesâ€¦ particularly when there are so many potential patients and 
doctors who are desperate for any remedy that offers hope,' he said.

He called for policies to address issues including transparency about the techniques involved and costs to patients.
