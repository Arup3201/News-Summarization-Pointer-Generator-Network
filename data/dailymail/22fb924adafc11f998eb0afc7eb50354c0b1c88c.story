The FBI believes it knows the identities of the thieves who stole art valued at up to $500 million from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990 they announced today in a stunning new development in the greatest art heist in modern history.

Richard DesLauriers, the FBI's special agent in charge in Boston, said the thieves belong to a criminal organization based in New England, though did not offer any names.

He added that authorities believe the art was taken to Connecticut and the Philadelphia region in the years after the theft, and offered for sale in Philadelphia about a decade ago.

During the infamous heist, rare works from masters such as Rembrant, Degas, and Vermeer were stolen, sometimes cut from their frames.

The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces

In progress: Left, Degas' Three Mounted Jockeys, and right, a self-portrait of Rembrandt

Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter 

During the 1990 robbery, thieves 
disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St. 
Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by 
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet.

While the FBI has had several promising leads in the 23 years following the heist, no one was ever charged with stealing the works.

According to an FBI release sent out today, investigators believe that the original thieves transported the stolen art to parts of Connecticut and Philadelphia.

‘Some of the art was taken to Philadelphia, where it was offered for sale by those responsible for the theft,’ DesLauriers said in a statement.

‘With that same confidence, we have identified the thieves, who are members of a criminal organization with a base in the Mid-Atlantic states and New England.’

Landscape: Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck

Heist of the century: The thieves also made off with Degas' 'La Sortie du Pelage,' a watercolor and pencil sketch

Black and white: Two Degas sketches from 1884, entitled 'Program for an Artistic Soirée'

Monochrome: Degas'  'Cortège aux Environs de Florence'

Proud: This bronze eagle-shaped finial from c. 1813 originally sat on the top of the pole support of a silk Napoleonic flag in the Short Gallery; the thieves likely thought it was gold

The FBI said that following an attempted sale of one of the works more than a decade ago, they could only piece together small bits of information on the whereabouts of the masterpieces – and the thieves.

Because of the high-profile nature of the case, the government agency released as much information about the heist as they could, in hopes that someone would flag a suspicious art purchase.

They also continue to highlight the $5 million, no-questions-asked reward.

Last year the FBI has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum

Anthony Amore, who is the Gardner museum’s chief of security, said that anyone could claim the reward, even if they did not have the paintings. ‘We hope that through this media campaign, people will see how earnest we are in our attempts to pay this reward and make our institution whole,’ he said in a statement.

When the thieves, disguised as two security officers, sneaked into the Boston institution, they cut some of the works of art right out of the frames.

The empty frames continue to be hung in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces.

The thieves, once publically identified, will be prosecuted by a special FBI department, the Art Crime Team, which is comprised of 14 special agents.

The team of agents, along with trial lawyers, investigates art theft, fraud, and lootings in both national and international scope.
