Signed prints, car parts and umbrellas were among the items up for auction from former Formula One team Marussia on Tuesday.

The Banbury-based firm went out of business on November 7 with the loss of over 200 jobs and were forced to miss the final three races of this year's championship.

A two-day live webcast auction started at 10am, with one of the highest prices being £15,000 for a nose section of racing driver Max Chilton's car.

Other items to sell so far included a 2010 steering wheel, which fetched £2,200, and a Timo Glock driver's suit and boots on a display mannequin, which raised £700.

Four umbrellas sold for £100, although door signs for race bays failed to attract any bids.

Two sales, on Thursday and January 21, will feature furniture, computer equipment and this year's F1 cars, minus their engines which have been retained by Ferrari.

The webcast takes the form of a traditional auction with an auctioneer accepting bids. There was no reserve price on any of the items.

Marussia became the second F1 team to be placed in administration this autumn after the Caterham team also folded in October.
