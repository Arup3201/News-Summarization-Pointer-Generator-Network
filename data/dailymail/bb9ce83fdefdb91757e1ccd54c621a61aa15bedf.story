Motorists are being charged at least $2 extra per tank according to new analytics that reveal petrol retailers are overcharging Australian drivers at the gas pumps.

A three year examination by the Australian Automobile Association found that the average retail petrol margin for unleaded across the country has grown by 35 per cent since 2012.

'Retailers have been quietly and steadily lifting their margins while the retail price is low,' AAA Acting Chief Executive James Goodwin told Daily Mail Australia.

A three year analysis of the petrol market by the Australian Automobile Association found that the average retail petrol margin for unleaded across the country has grown by 35 per cent since 2012

'We're deeply concerned that the full impact of lower international oil prices has not been passed on to motorists in full.

'It's very simple; prices have not been as low as they should have been. An average driver has been paying about an extra $2 a tank more than they would have if margins had stayed at 2012 levels.'

The analysis revealed that in the 12 month period ending February 12, 2012, the unleaded retail petrol margin was 8.9 cents per litre.

This year, in the week ending February 8, the 12-month average retail petrol margin was found to be 12.3 cents per litre.

However average weekly margins have reached as high as 18 cents per litre in the periods of June and July in 2012, while in the last few months they have been sitting at about 15 cents per litre.

'A motorist in a passenger vehicle travelling the average annual distance (13,200 km) using the average annual fuel consumption (11.1L/ 100km) will be paying nearly $50 more than they would had margins remained at 2012 levels,' the report by AAA stated.

'We're deeply concerned that the full impact of lower international oil prices has not been passed on to motorists in full,' AAA Acting Chief Executive James Goodwin said

'A motorist driving Australia's top-selling car, the Toyota Corolla, is paying $1.87 per tank more than they would had average margins remained at 2012 levels.

'People driving a Holden Commodore are paying an additional $2.41, while those driving a Ford Ranger are paying $2.72 more than they would have in 2012.'

Diesel margins have also been significantly high, recorded at 24 cents per litre in the last six months before settling to 11.1 cent per litre recently.

'Every little bit helps for most drivers and they will be annoyed to learn that they have been paying about three cents a litre more than they should have been,' Mr Goodwin said.

The findings come after Minister Bruce Billson appointed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor and analyse the prices and profits of the fuel market to provide greater transparency.
