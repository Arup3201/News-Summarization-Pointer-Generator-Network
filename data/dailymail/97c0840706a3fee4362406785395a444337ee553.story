A man from Florida who was sick of cars in his street being broken into decided to take things into his own hands by using zip-ties to cuff a couple of crooks that he caught. 

James Ridgewell from Orlando managed to catch two teenagers who had broken into his SUV and allegedly taken some of his belongings.

He chased them down the street and when he eventually caught up with them he used a couple of the plastic ties that he had in his pocket, left over from work.

'I happened to have a couple in my pocket still from doing work earlier and just put them to use like I've seen on TV,' said Mr Ridgewell.

Ridgewell was working on a boat on Wednesday afternoon, then went for a dinner cruise, only to return at night to find his belongings missing from his SUV.

'Our doors were open and we got hit. I lost my iPad, iPhone, wallet and credit cards,' he said to WKMG.

After searching for the culprits by driving up and down some nearby streets, he found the alleged duo pinned in at the end of a cul-de-sac.

Mr Ridgewell said he then held them there, using zip-ties on their hands, until police and a K-9 deputy arrived. 

Officers arrested 18-year-old Dylan Boon and a 16-year-old boy. 

Ridgewell said while chasing the teens wasn't the safest thing to do, he'd do it again.

'It wasn't one of my smarter moves maybe, but at some point, we got to take the streets back too,' Mr Ridgewell said.

Boon and the 16-year-old are charged with two counts of burglary. 

Boon was also being held without bail at the Volusia County Jail on a probation violation.
