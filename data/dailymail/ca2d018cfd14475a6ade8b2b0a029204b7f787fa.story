Ministers are drawing up secret plans to sweep away energy quangocrats appointed by Ed Miliband in an increasingly bitter battle over how best to keep down spiralling gas and electricity bills.

The plan to shake up energy regulator Ofgem comes as the Tories seek to up the pressure on the Labour leader, blaming him for price rises that have hit consumers in recent years.

Senior Tories also want to rein in some of the green levies that Mr Miliband introduced as Energy Secretary to help cut prices, though they face a fierce battle with their Liberal Democrat coalition colleagues.

David Cameron told MPs yesterday that Mr Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election is nothing more than a gimmick, claiming his plans to set yet more environmental targets would add £125 a year on to bills.

The Daily Mail has learned that Energy Minister Greg Barker is now preparing plans for a fundamental overhaul of Ofgem, which has been criticised for failing to get tough with the big six energy companies as they have hiked up prices.

Government sources said that six of the nine current members of the Ofgem board were appointed by the last government, and only one has a consumer background.

Those appointed by Mr Miliband when he was Energy Secretary include John Howard, formerly at the BBC; David Frisk, former Departmental Chief Scientist at the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions; Jim Keohane, former non-executive director at the Civil Aviation Authority and director at East Midlands Electricity and Sarah Harrison, former director of corporate affairs at Ofgem and previously at telephone services regulator ICSTIS.

The Labour leader has now pledged to scrap Ofgem and replace it with a new regulator.

But one Government source said: ‘Ed Miliband appears to be saying he doesn’t trust his own judgement and now wants to change the nameplate on the door of Ofgem. We need to sweep away all of the Labour appointees and bring in people that actually understand the consumer.

‘They are in the main professional quangocrats and industry insiders. When Ed Miliband had the chance, as Energy Secretary under the last government, he did absolutely nothing to advance the interests of the people paying energy bills.

‘We need people from Which?, people with a supermarket background, people who’ve worked at the retail end of the sector. We don’t need technocrats, we need people who will really take action.’

In the Commons, the Prime Minister attacked Mr Miliband’s promise to freeze prices for 20 months after the next general election, telling MPs that even the Labour leader admitted he may not be able to keep to his commitment because no Government could control the wholesale energy markets.

He claimed that if Mr Miliband did introduce the price freeze, it would only lead to higher energy costs for households and businesses in the long-term.

‘This isn’t a policy, it’s a gimmick and the reason it’s a gimmick is that you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £125 to everybody’s bill. It is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living, because you do not have an economic policy.

‘Energy prices doubled under Labour, electricity prices went up by 50 per cent. And let me say this to you - there is one thing governments can’t control and that is the international wholesale price of gas.

‘I know you would like to live in some sort of Marxist universe where you can control all of these things but you need a basic lesson in economics.’

Mr Miliband insisted the Government had no answer to Labour’s policy to freeze energy prices, which was unveiled last month at the party’s conference in Brighton.

The Labour leader said the Government’s policy to force firms to switch consumers to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population because it would only apply to those on so-called ‘closed tariffs’, those that are no longer available.

He told Mr Cameron: ‘What is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to Labour’s energy price freeze. You have no idea. You say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £300 since you became Prime Minister?

‘We have a cost of living crisis in this country. Energy bills are rising and you support energy companies and not the consumer. We have a Prime Minister who always stands up for the wrong people.’

Mr Cameron replied by reviving the Tories’ 1992 election warning that a Labour victory would mean tax rises and higher mortgage bills: ‘We know what your cost of living policy is. It is more spending, more borrowing and more debt and that would lead to higher taxes and higher mortgage rates. That is the double-whammy that would hit every family in this country.’

A spokesman for the Energy Department claimed Mr Miliband’s figures were ‘misleading’.

‘Before the end of the year, energy suppliers will be forced to offer no more than four core tariffs per fuel,’ he said.

‘As these changes take effect, more people will be on tariffs closed to new customers, and suppliers will need to move these customers on to the best deal for their preferences.

‘Suppliers will also be required to tell all their own customers if there is a cheaper tariff for them, and people will benefit from clearer information to help them compare and switch suppliers.’

The Government is preparing further measures on the cost of living in the coming weeks. Yesterday, ministers promised to cap rail fare increases and there is speculation that they may order a real-terms freeze next year.

Other proposals to limit bank charges and water bills are expected.

An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on speculation.’
