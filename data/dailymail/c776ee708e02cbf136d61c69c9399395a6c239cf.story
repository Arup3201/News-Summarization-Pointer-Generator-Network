The son of celebrated architect Richard Rogers and River Café chef Ruth Rogers has drowned in a bath while on holiday in Tuscany.

Bo Rogers, 27, died at the home of a friend in the coastal 
town of Lido di Camaiore, near Lucca, as revealed by the Daily Mail's Richard Kay.

Italian police believe the death was from natural causes.

Lord Rogers is considered one of the great architects 
of the age, and his designs have included the Millennium Dome, the Lloyd's 
Building and Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport.

Bo, who attended the American School in London from the age of six, at one stage worked for his father's architectural practice.

He had been staying in a house in Vernazza in the north of Italy, which was recently hit by severe flooding.

As a result of the floods, he went to stay instead with friends in Lido di Camaiore. 

Italian police said: 'The
body has been released to the family but as a matter of course, in the 
unusual circumstances, toxicology tests have been taken and the results 
will be known at the end of next week.'

Lord Rogers, 78, has three sons from his first marriage and two by Ruth: Bo and his elder brother Roo, 35, an ecological entrepreneur who lives in New York.

According to friends, the family will not be bringing Bo's body home to Britain and he is expected to be buried in Italy.

There is to be a private funeral followed by a 'celebration of his life'.

Lido di Camaiore is 50 miles from Florence 
where Lord Rogers was born and where he is now creating a 
£29million shopping and arts complex.

This family tragedy comes less than two years after the death from cancer of Lady Rogers' close friend Rose Gray, with whom she opened the River Café in Hammersmith in 1987.

River Café is 
considered one of the country's leading restaurants, producing celebrity 
chefs Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tobie Puttock.

Its Italian cuisine is said to 
have revolutionised British eating habits and the restaurant became the 
'canteen' of choice for New Labour figures such as Tony Blair and Peter 
Mandelson.

In 2009 Lord Rogers  was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) Stirling Prize for Maggie's Centre, a unit for cancer patients in Hammersmith, west London.

That year he also quit as an aide to London mayor Boris Johnson because he felt he was being 'blocked' in his work to design and deliver public spaces in London.
