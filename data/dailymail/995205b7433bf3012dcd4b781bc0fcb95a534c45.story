Convicted murderer Charles Manson is marrying a 25-year-old supporter, she has claimed.

Star, a name given to her by the 79-year-old cult leader, moved next to California's Corcoran State Prison when she was just 19 to be closer to him and has recently carved an X into her forehead to match his swastika.

'Yeah, well, people can think I'm crazy,' she told Rolling Stone magazine in a lengthy article about her beau. 'But they don't know. This is what's right for me. This is what I was born for.'

Star, who runs multiple websites calling for Manson's release, said she knows she will be his wife.

'I'll tell you straight up, Charlie 
and I are going to get married,' she said. 'When that will be, we don't 
know. But I take it very seriously. Charlie is my husband. Charlie told 
me to tell you this. We haven't told anybody about that.'

But Manson sounded a little more apprehensive when the interviewer asked him about his impending nuptials to Star.

'Oh
 that,' he said. 'That's a bunch of garbage. You know that, man. That's 
trash. We're just playing that for public consumption.'

Star,
 an artist, was born in St Louis, Missouri to a religious family who 
locked her in her room throughout her high school years after she 
refused to go to church and started taking drugs. 

While in high school, a friend told 
her about Manson's environmental writing and she decided to contact him,
 Rolling Stone reported.

When she was 19, she took $2,000 she saved working in a retirement home kitchen and jumped on a train headed to California.

Visits: Every Saturday and Sunday she visits him at Corcoran State Prison, pictured, for up to five hours a day

She
 now visits him every Saturday and Sunday for up to five hours a day and claims that her parents like him, and have even offered them to move in with the family if he ever gets out of prison.

Photographs on Facebook and websites calling for his release show the couple posing 
beside each other and touching during the lengthy visiting hours - which she said was not enough.

'I just want to be alone,' she said. I don't want to be always in that visiting room with people staring at me. But that's the only time I get to see him, in that room, with people staring. It's hard. But things change, you know. And who knows what could happen?'

He is also pictured in the images with Craig Carlisle Hammond, 63, whom Manson called 'Gray Wolf'. In March, Hammond was accused of trying to smuggle a cell phone to Manson during visiting hours, raising questions over the apparent freedom Manson is enjoying with his visiting friends.

If his marriage to Star does go ahead, it will not be the first for Manson, who has two ex-wives and at least three children.

He
 married Rosalie Willis in 1954 but they divorced in 1957 - a year into 
his prison term for stealing cars. After leaving prison in 1958, he 
married a prostitute called Candy Stevens. But again, she divorced him 
when he was sent back to jail.

Victim: Among those killed by Manson and his followers was actress Sharon Tate, pictured left with her husband director Roman Polanski and right. She was eight months pregnant when she was killed in 1969

In the interview with Rolling Stone, he also hinted that he is more fluid about his sexuality than previously thought.

'Sex to me is like going to the toilet,' he said. 'Whether it's a girl or not, it doesn't matter. I don't play that girl-guy s***. I'm not hung up in that game.'

He also recounted an incident from when he was 17 in which he said he asked a man to have sex, and when the man refused, he brandished a knife and promised to take the blame if they were caught. The man agreed.

Manson brainwashed members of a commune known as The Family into butchering eight people including film director Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife Sharon Tate in July and August 1969.

He was convicted of the slayings as well as the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in July 1969.

He was originally given a death sentence but spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional.

In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Manson will next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he will be 92-years-old.

When he was denied release in 2007 the parole board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.
