Sunderland and QPR have been offered former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill on loan by MLS outfit New York Red Bulls.

Both clubs are keen to bolster their attacking options from midfield and the ex-Millwall player could tempt them as a short-term fix.

Cahill moved to New York from Everton in 2012 following eight seasons on Merseyside, where he scored 68 goals in 278 games and became a fans' favourite.
