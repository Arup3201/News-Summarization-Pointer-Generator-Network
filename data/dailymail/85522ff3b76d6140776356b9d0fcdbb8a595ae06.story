The world can be a scary place when you're just a tiny meerkat.

So it's no surprise that London's latest batch of cute meerkat babies looked a little unsure about venturing out of their burrow and into the big wide world today.

The youngsters were spotted creeping up to the very edge of the burrow before curiously examining all of the goings on.

Tentative: A very cautious meerkat pokes its head out of the burrow to see it the coast is clear of predators around the enclosure at London Zoo today

Alert: The naturally wary creature looks both ways as it reconnoiters the area before setting foot outside the safety of its burrow

However,
not one of them was brave enough to step a paw out into the enclosure, 
even when given a little encouragement from some adults.

But soon the sheer wait of numbers trying to get a look at the big world outside from the burrow entrance was enough to open the floodgates and send the youngsters scurrying into the sunshine.

The tentative critters - which rarely grow larger than 14 inches tall and weight little more than 1.5lbs - were snapped by photographer Dave Stevenson during one of his wildlife photography workshops.

Baby
merekats or kits are born underground - in large social groups up to 30 strong - in extensive burrow systems and 
remain there for the first two or three weeks of their lives.

Now or never: Sensing this is the time to make the leap into the unknown and explore their surroundings, the pair tentatively set foot outside the burrow

But there always comes a time when they have to set foot outside the safety of their labyrinth.

And what the tiny creatures lose in size to possible predators, they more than make up for with force of numbers.

The highly social animals often display very altruistic behaviour - with several of the gang acting as sentries to keen an eye out for any approaching predators.

The animals rear up onto their hind legs and into their distinctive pose for the best view.

Floodgates open: With their new found confidence, the entire gang pour our of the burrow for their own taste of fresh air having spent the first two or three weeks of their lives underground

When
a predator is spotted, the meerkat performing as sentry gives a warning
bark, and other members of the gang will run and hide in one of the 
many bolt holes they have spread across their territory.

The
sentry meerkat is the first to reappear from the burrow and search for 
predators, constantly barking to keep the others underground.

If there 
is no threat, the sentry meerkat stops signaling and the others feel 
safe to emerge.

Meerkats also babysit the young in the group.

Meerkats have been known to engage in social activities, including what appear to be wrestling matches and foot races.

On guard: The ever cautious adult meerkats keep an eye on their adventurous young as they frolic in the sunshine in case of any predators
