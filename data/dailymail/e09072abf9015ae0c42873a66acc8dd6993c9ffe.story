A 23-year-old man who was jailed for attempted murder has taunted police by posting pictures of drunken nights out with friends on his Facebook - after going on the run from prison.

Michael McInnes, 23, failed to return from home leave from Castle Huntly prison near Dundee almost a fortnight ago.

But rather than going into hiding, McInnes has been boasting about his drinking exploits on the social networking site since absconding.

McInnes, circled, even posted a picture on his Facebook page of a night out at a local nightclub three days after he went on the run

According to the Daily Record, brazen McInnes even risked a visit to one of his favourite nightclubs in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, three days after he absconded and posted a picture of him with his arm around other revelers online.

Clearly amused by McInnes's posts, one of his Facebook friends commented: 'Your the hide n seek champion lol x' (sic).

Another posted: 'Your daft hahahaha' (sic).

McInnes, who posted a link to a newspaper story about his escape online, was jailed for six years in 2010 after leaving Kevin McNee brain damaged after repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head in a vicious attack.

He had previous convictions for violent offences.

Mr McNee spent three months in hospital following the attack and a further nine months in a rehabilitation centre for brain injury victims.

Despite being given an extended sentence because he was deemed likely to refoffend, McInnes was allowed to leave jail on home visits within three years.

The mother of McInnes's victim, Agnes McNee told the Daily Record: 'He's a very dangerous man and the judge said he was capable of doing it again.

'He should never have been in an open prison, he should have been kept in a secure jail because he's a danger to the public.

'When we saw on Facebook that he had been celebrating with his friends at a club, it just made us sick.'

The Scottish Prison service has faced criticism from both Scottish Conservatives and Labour over the decision to allow McInnes on home leave.

But a spokesman said that it would be 'inappropriate to comment' while an investigation is ongoing when contacted by MailOnline today.
