England manager Roy Hodgson fears he may have to play a vastly weakened side in next Tuesday's friendly against Italy, with more players set to drop out of his squad once the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania has been played.

Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana, Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw have all been forced to withdraw through injury already while Michael Carrick and Fabian Delph were unable to play a full part in training on Tuesday.

And Hodgson expects to lose even more players in what is one of his most-significantly weakened England squads in recent memory.

Roy Hodgson fears he could lose even more members of his England squad to injury in the coming days

The England manager already has a long list of absentees but could see more ahead of facing Italy

Hodgson oversaw training with the squad at St George's Park on Tuesday ahead of the two upcoming games

The Three Lions fly to Turin on Monday following Friday night's game against Lithuania at Wembley, but they could be missing even more players by the time they come to face the side they were beaten by in their World Cup opener last summer.

'Apart from all those players that I’ve suggested or have said aren’t here through injury I fear we’re going to lose a few more,' Hodgson said. 'There’s one or two that I know won’t be able to join us against Italy because of the current problems that they’re dealing with at the moment, so on this occasion in particular it won’t be as strong a team as I maybe would have liked to put out. 

'In England, unfortunately you're always judged harshly and you're in the spotlight because everyone wants England to do well and believes we can do well.

'We’ll accept that but as far as I’m concerned it’s still the qualifiers that I put top of my list of priorities even though on paper Italy are a strong team to play than Lithuania.'

Adam Lallana is another Liverpool and England player struggling with injury - he pulled out with groin trouble

Fraser Forster was in significant pain after picking up an injury for Southampton and also withdrew

Luke Shaw is another absentee for Hodgson, pulling out with an ankle problem ahead of the Lithuania game

Hodgson has been frustrated to see so many players absent from this selection but admits his luck with injuries of late may be coming back to bite him.

'We’ve been a bit unlucky on this occasion, it’s unusual,' he told talkSPORT. 'We’ve been very lucky most of the times we’ve got squads together that we haven’t lost a lot of players.

This time to lose the two goalkeepers (Forster and Ben Foster) for example is an incredible blow. To lose people like (Jack) Wilshere, Lallana, (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sturridge, all of whom you think are very important players in the year to come, to lose them all ahead of a qualifier that’s been a bit hard to take.

'But I still think theres enough good ones out there, so I still think we can get 11 good players on the field.'

Michael Carrick was unable to take part in a full training session with the rest of the squad on Tuesday

England have taken a maximum 12 points from their four games in qualifying group E so far, marking an impressive turnaround since the summer's embarrassing World Cup group stage exit which came without a win from games against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica.

But Hodgson is not getting carried away with the momentum his side appear to be building up ahead of next summer's tournament in France that they look dead-certs to qualify for. 

'You’re always pleased when you’re winning but I think we’re also trying to keep our feet on the ground,' he said. 'We've been benefiting from a group which isn't the toughest of the groups. There’s lots of very, very difficult games ahead and we realise also that everything we're doing at the moment is going to be truly judged in 2016.'
