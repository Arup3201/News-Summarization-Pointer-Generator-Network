Alabama, North Dakota, and Wyoming were the most conservative states in America in 2012.

In each of the states, between 49 per cent and 50 per cent of residents identified with being conservative.

Meanwhile, people living in the District of Columbia were by far the nation's most liberal, with 41 per cent identifying themselves in that way.

The annual Gallup poll found 
Massachusetts was the second most liberal state with 31 per cent of 
residents, followed by Oregon, and Vermont, which were each 29 per cent 
liberal.

As with most years, the ideological 
distribution in last year's poll generally reflected the familiar 'blue 
state' and 'red state' patterns that define the political geography of 
today's modern America, Gallup said.

The top 10 conservative states all vote reliably Republican in national elections and are all located in the nation's Southern, Midwestern, and Mountain West regions.

Wyoming and North Dakota were joint second on the list of most conservative states, followed by Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, and Arkansas.

But interestingly, there isn't a perfect correlation between ideology and party as three of the 10 most Republican states - Kansas, Montana, and Alaska - do not rank among the most conservative states. Similarly, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas rank in the top 10 most conservative states but not the most Republican.

After the top three liberal states comes Delaware, Connecticut, Washington state, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and New York.

These are all reliably Democratic voting states and all but Vermont and D.C. are on the coast, or - in Hawaii's case - surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.

According to Gallup, there is a closer correlation between liberal states and Democratic states. Only Illinois and Maryland rank among the most Democratic but not the most liberal where as Oregon and Washington state rank among the 10 most liberal states but not the 10 most Democratic, Gallup found.

Alaska, Rhode Island and Ohio were the three states where the most residents considered themselves moderate.

However, the distribution of moderates across the states is not highly related to whether that state is a swing state.

Alaska typically votes Republican and has a high Republican identification while Rhode Island is a blue state and Ohio is a swing state.

Overall, Americans identified themselves as slightly more liberal last year than they did in 2011, though more people still consider themselves conservative with 38 per cent, compared to 36 per cent for moderate or 23 per cent identifying themselves as liberal.

In 2011, 40 per cent of US citizens said they identified with being conservative, while 36 per cent said they were moderate and 21 per cent considered themselves liberal.
