A visit to the zoo and climbing Australia's tallest building - that is how New Zealand's Warriena Tagpuno Wright spent her last days alive before plummeting to her death from a high-rise building in Surfers Paradise.

The 26-year-old woman fell to her death from the 14th floor of Avalon Apartments on Queensland's Gold Coast on Friday at 2.20am while she visited a man she had met on a mobile dating app.

Ms Wright, from Lower Hutt - north-east of Wellington, was seen with a 28-year-old man on the balcony at the Wahroonga Place apartment he was living in by witnesses before tragedy struck.

The 26-year-old woman plummeted 14 storeys from Avalon Apartments at Wahroonga Place on Friday morning

But Ms Wright's Facebook page showed the great times the New Zealand woman had visiting Australia for a friend's wedding. She had travelled to the country alone on July 29, according to Nine News.

In one photo she is seen holding a python while laughing in a posed photo in front of rocky backdrop at an Australian zoo.

Savana Lesa was with Ms Wright during her two-week stay in the country.

Posting a tribute to her friend, Ms Lesa said she would never forget the animal lover whose page was filled with photos of animals.

'It was just like a few days ago we were hanging out, taking selfies relaxing on the beach, visiting the tallest building in Australia, cruising around and talking about the good times we had together as buddy ol pals making the best of our time together,' Ms Lesa wrote.

'Though my heart aches for you and my mind is still adjusting to the fact you are gone I will always cherish the best moments I have had with you while you were here.

'I will never forget you my dearest friend who I love and keep close to my heart forever.'

Police are continuing their investigations into the circumstances surrounding Ms Wright’s death.

The 28-year-old man, who was seen with Ms Wright before she died, was computer expert Gable Tostee who met her through mobile dating app Tinder, according to The Courier Mail.

He turned himself into Queensland police at 11am on Friday and was questioned for more than two hours at the Surfers Paradise station, accompanied by his lawyer, but was released without charge.

It is believed Tostee - who was found guilty of supplying fake IDs to underage Schoolies with two of his friends which made them $30,000 eight years ago - had been drinking with Ms Wright.

Police were almost immediately on scene when a man raised the alarm but on arrival at the unit she had fallen from, nobody was inside.

They are investigating if someone had been there but fled the scene when police came knocking.

Forensic officers have scoured the apartment building from the 14th floor to the ground.

On Friday, Queensland police were almost immediately on scene after a man raised the alarm.

'Voices were heard and noises were heard coming from the unit,' Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson told media.

Witnesses said they had heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor.

'I heard her screaming once, then she stopped. Then she screamed and then she stopped again. I think she screamed a third time and after that I heard a bang,' a witness - only identified as Tania told Nine News.

'Very upsetting, very upsetting, I couldn't believe it.'

Another witness, Adam, who lives on the 17th floor said: 'By the sounds of things it's happened on my side of the building, right by my bedroom window.'

Charges in relation to the 26-year-old's death have not been laid and it is possible no charges will come about at all.

The 26-year-old's death is being treated as suspicious by police and are appealing to the public for information.

Detectives want to speak to anybody who has been in contact with Ms Wright since she arrived or know of her activities in Australia.
