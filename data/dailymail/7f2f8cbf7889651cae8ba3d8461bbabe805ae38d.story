Director Roman Polanski (pictured) has said he will cooperate with Polish police procedures after he the U.S. requested his extradition

Polish prosecutors have questioned filmmaker Roman Polanski following a U.S. request for his extradition over a 1977 child sex crime conviction.

The questioning took place in Krakow, southern Poland and local prosecutors are likely to issue a statement on Thursday, it was reported.

It was revealed last week the U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the 81-year-old filmmaker over the historical child sex crime conviction.

Following last week's extradition request, a lawyer for Polanski - viewed by many Poles as one of their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go free, and since then nothing had changed.

Polanski has also stated he hopes Poland would not extradite him, but he would submit himself 'to the procedure, and we will see,' TVN24 reported. He added: 'I have confidence in Poland's justice system.'

Polanski, who was born to Polish parents but lives in France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film.

In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 conviction.

They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on any further steps.

'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, said.

The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old during a photoshoot in Los Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs.

Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain but fled the United States the following year, believing the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him in jail for years.

In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed  after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to the U.S.

His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus affair, without risking another arrest.

Paris-born Polanski spent his childhood and youth in Poland but lives in France. He holds Polish and French passports.

Roman Polanski was born in Paris to Polish parents, but moved back to his parents' home country just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.

After having survived the Holocaust as a young boy, and having grown up and educated in Poland, he began directing films.

Some of those, including The Pianist and Chinatown, have gone on to become hugely successful, and have won numerous Academy Awards.

In 1969, his pregnant wife Sharon Tate was killed in the Manson Family murders which rocked Hollywood.

After the two had married the previous year, Polanski was working in London when the group of killers - at the beckoning of cult leader Charles Manson - broke into their Los Angeles mansion, killing Tate, the couple's unborn baby, and four of her friends.

Coroners later found the bodies had been in some instances mutilated, with dozens of stab wounds and messages on the house left written in the victims' blood.

In the years following, Polanski continued directing and made perhaps his most widely-regarded film to date - 1974's Chinatown, starring a young Jack Nicholson.

In 1977, after Polanski pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old  during a photoshoot in Los Angeles, he has lived his life outside the U.S.

After  serving 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain, he fled to France, believing the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him in jail for years.

Last year he was arrested by Swiss police at the behest of U.S. authorities - however,  attempts to extradite him were unsuccessful.
