Nicholas Long stole £450 from Sainsbury's by scanning in his groceries as loose onions at the self-service checkout

As a fraudster with 20 super- market scams under his belt, Nicholas Long should have known his onions.

But onions were precisely where the former international hockey player came unstuck.

Long, 25, stole from Sainsbury’s 20 times in three months by fooling the self-service scanner into thinking more expensive items were onions.

The debt-ridden City recruitment consultant was caught by a security guard who spotted that every item of his grocery shopping was being scanned as  loose onions.

Long managed to save £450 using the ruse, which his own lawyer admitted to a court was ‘stupid’. He would take an item such as an avocado, which costs more by weight than loose onions, then place it on the scales of the scanner and declare it as the cheaper vegetable.

The former under-19 hockey international dreamed up the scheme when he feared losing his job and his then-girlfriend became pregnant, the Old Bailey heard. He was also saddled with a £10,000 loan he had taken out on his father’s behalf. But his father’s firm failed soon after, leaving Long with the debt.

Long was caught trying to get away cheaply with a £22 shop on August 7.

He confessed to having repeatedly conned the same Central London store, which didn’t even sell loose onions, but had them on their standardised scanners.

‘It is a straightforward allegation that he went to Sainsbury’s and was seen scanning various items in at the self-service checkout’, said prosecutor Denise Murrin.

‘All items were being scanned as 
loose onions, but the store does not sell loose onions. It was an 
inexpensive way of doing his shopping.’ Long had previous convictions 
for shoplifting, having taken a coat from John Lewis in 2010 and 
attempted to pass off a bottle of champagne as bleach using the same 
scam in 2011.

He also stole a mobile phone from a handbag at a party in 2012.

Angus Mathieson, defending, said Long
was driven by mounting debts and the fear of losing his job.  ‘It was a
stupid thing he has  done’, he said. ‘He was not getting a stupid 
amount, not substituting champagne or anything like that, but just 
getting an avocado and claiming it was an onion.

‘He had a good job at the time, but 
committed an offence as he felt his job was under threat and he was 
imminently likely to be made redundant. His girlfriend had become 
pregnant and he was worried about money, because he had debts.

‘Part of the debts had arisen because
he had taken a bank loan out for his father, who needed money to help 
his business along. He took out a £10,000 loan, but his father’s 
business failed and he was saddled with the debt.’

Mr Mathieson said Long was not a 
‘manipulating and calculating thief’, and said he used his hockey 
experience by voluntarily training young players at weekends.

Long was given 180 hours community service after admitting fraud by false representation at the Old Bailey

But Judge Paul Worsley QC said Long 
was a ‘persistent thief’ and warned him he was on the edge of a prison 
sentence. He added: ‘Stealing from a supermarket is always serious. It 
pushes up the cost of goods for honest members of the public who have to
pay to cover the cost of those goods lost through dishonesty.

‘You are an otherwise respectable 
young man who achieved international honours in hockey, so it is sad to 
see you before the courts.  But if you persist in taking other people’s 
property, you will go to prison.’

Long, of Chatham, Kent, admitted a 
single count of fraud by false representation. He was given 180 hours’ 
community service and ordered to pay £250 costs.
