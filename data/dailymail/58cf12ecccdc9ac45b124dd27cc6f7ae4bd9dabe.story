Notorious gangster John Gilligan has been shot while celebrating a family christening at his brother's house.

The drug lord was targeted at the home in Clondalkin, near Dublin, at about 7pm on Saturday night.

It is understood the 61-year-old was with family and friends in the house when two masked gunmen tried to force their way inside.

Accused: Drug baron John Gilligan was released from prison last year for a cannabis trafficking scheme. He had denied and was acquitted of the murder of the journalist Victoria Guerin

Gilligan is believed to have locked himself in a downstairs toilet as the attackers got inside.

Up to four shots were fired in the attempted murder, Irish police said.

Gilligan was hit at least twice, suffering bullet wounds to his shoulder or upper chest area and also another bullet wound in one of his legs.

Shot dead: Journalist Veronica Guerin. Gilligan was tried for her murder and was acquitted

Gardai said that two men forced their way into the gangster's brother's house on Greenfort Crescent where the day-long christening celebrations had been taking place.

Both men were armed and wearing masks.

Gilligan was treated at the scene and then taken to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown with what police described as 'non-fatal' injuries.

The attackers fled the scene in a silver SUV or 4x4 type vehicle, detectives believe.

The crime boss, who was released from jail last year after being convicted of a multi-million euro cannabis trafficking operation in the 1990s, is understood to have been recently warned of threats to his life.

It had also been reported that a gunman attempted to shoot him in a pub in north Dublin several weeks after his release.

Gilligan was freed from Portlaoise Prison last October after being jailed in 2001.

He had been arrested in 1996 after being stopped by UK Customs officers with IRÂ£296,000 in a suitcase as he attempted to get on a plane for Amsterdam at London's Heathrow Airport.

Within hours of his release Gilligan repeatedly denied the murder of Ms Guerin, a crime journalist with the Sunday Independent, who was shot dead in 1996.

He had been tried for and acquitted of her murder.
