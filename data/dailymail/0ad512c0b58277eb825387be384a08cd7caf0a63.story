West Ham have asked about taking Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero on loan with a view to a permanent deal.

Guerrero, 30, is a Peru international who has scored 19 goals in 49 appearances for his country.

He has spent much of his playing career in Germany with a four-year spell at Bayern Munich, followed by six years with Hamburg.

Target: Corinthians and former Hamburg striker Paolo Guerrero is the subject of interest from West Ham

Guerrero was fined by Hamburg in 2010 for throwing a plastic bottle at a fan.

The Hammers have also revived interest in Boca Juniors left-back Emanuel Insua, 23.
