More than 17,000 people
took part in Germany's largest anti-immigration rally to date in the eastern city of Dresden.

Thousands of people gathered to sing
Christmas carols on Monday and listen to speakers complain about
immigrants and asylum-seekers.

The rally, by a fast-growing grass-roots movement calling
itself PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation
of the West, was its tenth and largest so far.

PEGIDA leader Lutz Bachmann told the cheering crowd: 'Germany is not a land of immigration,' while they waved German flags and
chanted criticism of media it accuses of biased reporting.

Bachmann started PEGIDA in October with an appeal on social
media in Dresden to protest plans to add 14 centres for about
2,000 refugees locally. 

However, demonstrators rejected charges they are
far-right extremists or neo-Nazis.

Monday's rally took place in front of Dresden's famous
Semper Opera house in the city's historic centre.

A counter-demonstration of 4,000 people tried to disrupt the
PEGIDA rally, which grew from a previous record of 15,000 a week
ago and has embarrassed the political establishment with claims
that Germany is being overrun by Muslims and other immigrants.

Justice Minister Heiko Maas has called PEGIDA a disgrace to Germany.

Movement: The first PEGIDA march took place in Dresden in October and has since attracted thousands of participants to its weekly gatherings that have also begun spreading to other cities in Germany

City: Protestors gathered in Dresden, eastern Germany for their tenth Monday demonstration in a row

Crowd: People gather during the demonstration but reject charges they are far-right extremists or neo-Nazis

Christian: Supporters of the movement PEGIDA hold up a cross in German national colours during a rally against the supposed excess of immigration by refugees in Dresden

Anger: A woman holds a sign saying 'Germany's next...revolution' during a demonstration organised by an anti-immigration group

But PEGIDA's demands have attracted support from some on the
far-right as well as ordinary Germans alarmed by a sharp rise in
refugees, many fleeing the conflict in the Middle East. 

The rallies
have spread across Germany even though Dresden, with a tiny
immigrant community, remains the movement's hotbed.

Islam: For the past ten weeks, activists protesting Germany's immigration policy and the spread of Islam in the West have been marching each Monday 

Lights: People hold up lights during the demonstration organised by anti-immigration group PEGIDA against the Islamisation of the West

Opposition: About 17,000 opponents of Germany's policy towards asylum seekers and Islam attended

Instead of their usual marches through the night time
streets, the rally remained in one place where a crowd sang Christmas classics such as 'Stille Nacht' (Silent Night) and 'Oh, du froehliche'. 

The
Semper opera turned off its lights to protest the rally.

Yet, the number of asylum-seekers in Germany has surged to some
200,000 this year, more than any other western country, due in
part to an influx of Syrians.
