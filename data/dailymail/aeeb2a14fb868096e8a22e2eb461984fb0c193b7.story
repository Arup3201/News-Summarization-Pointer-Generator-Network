I don’t know about you, but I find this time of year a bit of a struggle. 

The fun and frolics of Christmas are over, and it’s back to work – getting up and going home in pitch darkness, and battling through the cold, wind and rain just to grab a pint of milk from the shop.

If I had my way, I’d burrow down under the duvet and hibernate til the spring sunshine makes an appearance.

This week Binky shows you how to get a polished makeup look, perfect for the winter weather, in just five minutes 

But since that’s not an option, I’ve gone for the next best option. 

I’ve created a quick and easy make-up regime that will have you have you looking fresh-faced and gorgeous in a flash – just the thing to brighten up those dark winter days.

Step 1: The Base

Chilly weather and central heating are a dehydrating double-whammy for your complexion, so this is a good moment to invest in a decent foundation. 

DiorSkin Star Foundation gives excellent full coverage, evening out dry, dull winter skin without feeling greasy or cakey – I applied it with a foundation brush to achieve a professional finish.

Binky begins with a correcting concealer as a quick fix for any blemishes 

Christmas indulgences often lead to blemishes, so I also used a touch of bareMinerals Correcting Concealer to disguise any spots and under-eye shadows. 

This product has a lovely creamy consistency, making it easy to blend, but if your concealer is a little hard, you’ll find that applying it with your fingertips helps as the heat from your hands will warm and soften the formula.

A dusting of translucent powder will fix everything in place – I used bareMinerals Illuminating Veil Powder, swept onto my forehead, cheeks and T-zone with a big fluffy brush.

Step 2: Cheeks and Eyes

I’ve become a real fan of contouring powders. 

Clever shading and highlighting can subtly alter your face shape, sharpening up those cheekbones and adding a glamorous dewy sheen that looks super-flattering. 

Binky uses contouring powders to sharpen her cheek bones 

For this quick look, I used the Red Carpet Cosmetics Contour Made Easy palette, blending the contour shades under my cheekbones and dusting the highlight shades across my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin.

Sticking with the same palette for speed, I worked the same light shimmery shades all over my eyelids with a medium-size, flat brush, followed by applying the warmer shades along the crease of my eye to add definition. 

Using a single palette for face and eyes really pulls your look together, as well as saving both time and money!

A few coats of Too Faced Lashgasm Mascara will add a polished finish to your eyes. Work the brush from roots to tips, wiggling from side to side as you go to ensure each lash is fully coated with mascara.

Lips need extra care this time of years so Binky recommends opting for a tinted balm

Finally, use your fingertips to work a touch of Daniel Sandler Watercolour Cream Blusher in Soft Pink into your cheeks. Winter complexions tend to look pale and washed-out, so blusher is a must at this time of year, and this lovely creamy formula is a welcome treat for your skin, too.

Step 3: The Lips

The delicate skin on your lips is especially vulnerable at this time of year when the wind and cold can play havoc, so a hydrating and protective product is a great beauty investment. I slicked on a coat of Clarins Instant Light Natural Lip Perfector in Rose Shimmer. 

Again, it’s super-quick to apply, it gives a fresh shimmery finish, and (best of all) its rich, moisturizing formula will take care of your precious pout!

To get Binky;s glamorous day-to-day look it only takes three simple steps and five minutes 

Time’s up! Three steps and five minutes from start to finish, and that pale creature that greeted you in the mirror when you woke up will be transformed into a glowing, fresh-faced beauty – a gorgeous ray of sunshine on a dreary winter day.
