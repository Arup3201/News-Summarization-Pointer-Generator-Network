Israel is putting fresh pressure on the White House to release Jonathan Pollard, an American convicted of spying for Israel 27 years ago, reopening a long-running feud with its closest and most important ally.

Israeli leaders say the former civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy should be freed after a dramatic deterioration in his health.

Pollard, now 57, pleaded guilty to leaking classified documents to Israel after his arrest by FBI agents in Washington in 1985.

But Washington has rejected renewed calls for his release by issuing a statement saying that American policy on the issue has not changed, despite claims by Pollard’s wife Esther that he is suffering from a life-threatening illness.

The case is fraught with issues, given the strong ties between Israel and the United States, and the delicate issue of suspected dual loyalties among American Jews.

Pollard, who is Jewish, enjoys 
widespread sympathy in Israel, where he was granted citizenship after he
was imprisoned, and where many believe the sentence was too harsh 
despite fact that Pollard was spying on an ally.

On June 13, US President Barack Obama, campaigning for re-election, plans to honour Israeli President Shimon Peres by bestowing on him the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.

This has roused hopes that Peres - a Nobel Peace laureate and globally respected statesman who has better ties with Obama than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - might use the occasion to press the issue.

More than 24,000 Israelis have joined a Facebook page urging Peres to miss the event if Pollard is not freed.

Netanyahu, who made a private visit to Pollard in prison a decade ago, has repeatedly raised the issue in meetings with Obama. With Passover currently being celebrated by the Jewish people, Netanyahu said earlier this week that the time had come to release Pollard.

'We must let him finish his life in dignity,' he said.

Ronit Tirosh, an Israeli lawmaker who heads a parliamentary caucus pressing for Pollard's release, said that with time running out, Israel has to be vocal in its appeals, even if it upsets its American allies.

‘He's so sick, and so many years have passed, we have nothing to lose,’ she said. She described Peres' appeal as ‘the last card we have’ with the Americans.

Tirosh and many other Israelis argue that the punishment has been excessive, and that many other Americans convicted in espionage have served lesser sentences.

Netanyahu himself attempted to link the Pollard issue to peacemaking during his first term as prime minister, pressing for Pollard's release as part of a 1998 interim deal with the Palestinians.

President Bill Clinton, who was hugely popular in Israel, rejected the request after fierce opposition from U.S. intelligence officials.

Even after more than a quarter of a century, many details of the case remain a mystery. Pollard delivered hordes of documents to his handlers, but the full extent of what was released has never been revealed.

Darshan-Leitner, Pollard's lawyer, said the information was material that had traditionally been shared with the Israelis. She said the information had included details about Arab and Soviet military capabilities, and had helped Israel carry out the assassination of a senior PLO official in Tunisia in 1988.

Much of the American military and intelligence community remains opposed to releasing Pollard.

But this opposition has begun to crack, raising hopes that a breakthrough may finally be near.

Former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, Lawrence Korb, the assistant secretary of defense at the time, former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, Sen. John McCain and former Vice President Dan Quayle have all called for Pollard's release in recent years.
