The other day I was playing with my three-year-old daughter, Dolly. She’s obsessed with the story of Snow White and keeps sticking a mirror in front of my face and inquiring: ‘Who is the fairest of them all?’

The answer must always, of course, be her. I once ventured away from this party line and dared to say: ‘Dolly, your beauty is true, but Mummy’s face is quite nice, too.’ And she looked at me, utterly horrified, and said: ‘No it’s not. Your eyes are wonky and your nose has a big bump on it.’

She was right, of course. Children are nothing if not honest. But here’s the thing. It didn’t matter. I still pulled her to me — this wonderfully zany little girl who constantly tells me she loves me to the moon and back — and I felt so happy my heart could burst.

So what if I have a face that might crack a mirror? Why on earth would I care? I may be somewhat lacking in the looks department, but I am happier and more successful than most women I know.

I was reminded of this rather satisfying fact this week when actress Olivia Colman, who won huge acclaim for her role as DS Ellie Miller in the brilliant ITV drama, Broadchurch, admitted she felt fortunate she was not a ‘conventional’ beauty. 

She went on to say that there are fewer parts available for prettier actresses — suggesting she attributes her well-deserved success to the fact that she isn’t a looker.

It’s a searingly honest thing to say and I, for one, whole-heartedly agree — not with the fact Olivia Colman is ugly (actually, I think she has a rather lovely face), but that being plain can often play hugely to a woman’s advantage.

I have written before about coming to terms with the fact I’ll never be beautiful. It has taken me years to accept that, unlike my fellow Daily Mail writer Samantha Brick, men never fall over themselves to open doors for me or, indeed, proffer free bottles of champagne on aeroplanes.

But, cruel fate that it is, I have four amazing children — and Samantha, like so many other attractive women, yearns to have a baby. I’m sure, given the choice of a pretty face or a warm bundle in her arms and a face like mine, she’d go for the latter.

Who is better off? Shona believes childless, self-confessed 'most beautiful woman in the world' Samantha Brick, right, would swap her face for a baby

Of course, I’m not suggesting that any woman can help how they look or, indeed, should suffer because of it. But in an age when so much emphasis is placed on physical perfection, it’s a relief when someone like Olivia Colman admits that being plain can be a blessing for a woman.

Because I firmly believe that’s how it has worked out for me. Indeed, I am convinced that if I had been blessed with the looks of Brigitte Bardot, life wouldn’t have panned out in quite the wonderful way it has.

Today, I look in the mirror and while the reflection staring back at me is unremarkable, looking this way has given me the strength, determination and force of character to get out there and prove myself in other ways.

And prove myself I have. Compare my story with that of my two close friends from school — both stunning girls whom I spent years feeling desperately inadequate standing next to. I used to be convinced they were guaranteed a glittering future, with the promise of a handsome husband, children and whatever else they wanted the world to conjure up before the altar of their exquisite beauty.

'One kind reader even suggested that 
next time I have something published I might be a little more 
public-spirited and place a bag over my head. Do I care?'

We hooked up recently at a reunion. They have both kept their looks — indeed it was still hard, a quarter of a century on, to quash that same feeling of inferiority when they walked into the room.

But a few glasses of wine later, it materialised that one remains single, having never found a man to meet her exacting standards, and the other did get married — to someone equally gorgeous — but he turned out to be gay and left her for a man.

I’m not being smug when I say they oohed and aahed over photographs of my four children — Flo, Annie, Monty and Dolly. Well, maybe I am a little bit. But they were doing absolutely nothing to disguise the fact that, in their opinion, my life was pretty near perfect. And, actually, I couldn’t help but agree.

The reason for this is simple. Once I accepted what my limitations were on the looks front, I then set about making up for them in other ways. Unlike prettier girls I knew, I didn’t make my prospective boyfriends jump through a series of inexplicable hoops before deciding to date them.

If they wanted to take me to an all-you-can-eat Tex-Mex buffet instead of a fancy French restaurant then — hey — who was I to complain? Bring on the chicken wings!

If one boyfriend turned out to have an unfortunately hairy back, I didn’t — as one girlfriend admitted to doing — dump him instantly with a shudder of disgust. I simply felt relieved that the pressure was off to shave my own legs every single day.

Happy with her looks: Actress Olivia Colman said being plain has its advantages

When I eventually met Keith at the age of 22, I felt unbelievably grateful that he was interested in me. I didn’t think there was a more interesting, good-looking or richer man out there — I was just relieved that any man at all wanted to hang out with a woman who looked like me.

So what that he didn’t always know the right thing to say at social occasions or choose the appropriate attire for a family wedding? I fell in love with him because of his personality — and he, because of mine.

I can remember sensing from certain quarters — friends and, indeed, my own parents — a feeling that I could do better.

Well, guess what? Those friends are still single, my parents are now divorced and 14 years on Keith and I remain soulmates.

But, for me, the benefits of being plain haven’t stopped there. Over the past couple of years I have been photographed frequently to accompany features I have written. It’s not my choice — it’s simply part of the job.

But what has surprised me has been the extreme reaction from complete strangers who seem to feel the urge to constantly comment on how cross-eyed and ugly I am.

They could, instead, remark on my writing ability or disagree with my opinion. The fact that they don’t only leaves me to assume that I am pretty good at my job — hooray!

Admittedly, I’ve had to develop a fairly thick skin. It can be a little unsettling to be constantly told that my photograph is putting people off their breakfast.

One kind reader even suggested that next time I have something published I might be a little more public-spirited and place a bag over my head.

Do I care? Well, the TV offers keep flooding in and I’m still being commissioned, which just goes to show that Oscar Wilde was right — the only thing worse than being talked about is, well, not being talked about.

And thanks to my looks there doesn’t seem to be any real danger of that happening any time soon.There is also something quite liberating — having hit my early 40s — about no longer fretting over my appearance.

I’m not husband-hunting or looking for a date. The only people who see me every day are my family, the postman and other mothers. None of them care if I am made up to the nines or wearing kitten heels.

Quite simply, I don’t feel the need to validate my worth as a woman by turning heads in the street or being complimented on my face.

All I need to do is take a long look at my career, my family and the many positive letters I receive from other people who feel supported through what I write.

I agree with Olivia Colman. Being a plain Jane has made my life a dream.
