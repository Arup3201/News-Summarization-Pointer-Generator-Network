A British tourist has been found drowned in a swimming pool at popular summer holiday destination Ibiza, and is the fifth young UK holidaymaker to die on the island this summer.

Christopher Barrington died in the swimming pool at the three-star, Â£130-a-night Hotel Puchet in the party resort of San Antonio, where some of the world's biggest DJs spin.

The 31-year-old was pulled unconscious from the pool at 4.30pm yesterday and despite the best efforts of the paramedics, who tried to revive him, he died poolside.

Revellers flock to the chill-out zone in San Antonio Bay, Ibiza - five Brits have died on the island so far this summer

It is understood that Mr Barrington was not a guest at the 212-room hotel - he was, in fact, residing at the two-star Hotel S'Anfora close by.

Police are investigating why he was in the pool at the Puchet.

'A 31-year-old British tourist died in a hotel swimming pool on Tuesday afternoon,' a spokesman for the Civil Guard, investigating the death, said.

'We believe he drowned. We are waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination. At this stage we do not know what caused him to drown.'

Earlier this month, on August 1, Barry Hesford, from Craigend in Glasgow, drowned in the pool of the Aparthotel THB Bahia in the same resort in similar circumstances.

The 21-year-old was pulled from the pool unconscious and efforts by paramedics to revive him were unsuccessful.

In addition, three Brits have died on the Balearic island this summer season after falling from terrace balconies.

The 23-year-old Samuel McCaughey fell 20 feet from the balcony of his holiday apartment on July 29.

Also Roberto Marcuccio, 24, was killed after dropping 30ft from a hotel balcony in San Jose on July 1.

And Jodie Taylor, 25, plunged from the third floor of the Hotel Galera in San Antonio on July 23.
