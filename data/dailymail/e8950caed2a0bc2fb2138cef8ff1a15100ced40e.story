You may not even be able to tell but Karlie Kloss has landed the coveted role of Chanel's new face.

The 22-year-old, who counts Taylor Swift as her best friend, has been unveiled as the face of the French beauty giant's new perfume, Coco Noir.

However, we can only see Karlie's silhouette in the moody shoot for the new spritz.

Who's that girl? American supermodel Karlie Kloss has been unveiled as the face of French beauty giant Chanel's new perfume, Coco Noir

The American model, who shot to fame on the Victoria's Secret runway, joins the likes of Nicole Kidman, Keira Knightley and Gisele Bündchen, at the fashion house.

Her good friend Cara Delevingne is also working with Chanel, fronting the label's latest fashion collection.  

It's been a successful year for Karlie, who was also recently unveiled as the face and toned body of Nike. 

Mysterious and moody: The model, who shot to fame on the Victoria's Secret runway, joins the likes of Nicole Kidman, Keira Knightley and Gisele Bündchen, at the fashion house.

While she oozes femininity and glamour in her most recent campaigns, the star recently admitted that she's a tomboy at heart.

'I love football. I am obsessed,' she told Grazia. 'I have my own fantasy football team and love going to games. I love the strategy that goes into the plays. I’ve looked through playbooks before and it’s like playing chess.'

Want to get Karlie's natural glow? The supermodel, who admitted that she has so many beauty products, a bathroom isn't enough to contain them, has shared her secrets.

The young star, who appears in the July issue of ELLE, revealed: 'I have a whole second bedroom filled with products, but I stick to the things that work.' 

Red carpet to runway: Karlie may only be 22 but she's already got Victoria's Secret angel on her CV and has walked for every major fashion house

She adds: 'I like products that streamline my morning routine. Sunday Riley has a really good foundation; it’s very velvety. I love RMS “Un” Cover-Up for under eyes or on a blemish.'

She also credits Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, for making her hair 'bounce in a different way,' and mentions that Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer is also 'good.'

Karlie, whose modelling career started at Abercrombie, has seen her star rise rapidly in recent years.

The model, who once walked 64 shows in a fashion week season, is also currently the clothes horse for Tamara Mellon's new range. 

Natural beauty: The clothes horse wears barely any make-up in her new campaign for Nike, despite recently revealing that she has a spare bedroom to store all of her beauty products in
