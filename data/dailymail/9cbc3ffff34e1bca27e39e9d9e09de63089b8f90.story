Imprisoned: Matthew Schrier, 35, was held by Syrian rebels with al-Qaeda links for seven months

An American photographer has revealed the torture he suffered at the hands of Syrian rebels who held him captive in a dark cell for seven months after accusing him of working for the C.I.A.

Matthew
 Schrier, 35, from Syosset, New York, was captured by Jabhat 
al-Nusra, a militant group  aligned with al-Qaeda, as he traveled in 
Syria last December during his first trip to  a war zone.

He was taken to a compound near Aleppo and locked up with an American cellmate - who could still be in captivity - before escaping from a gap in a basement window on July 29, he said.

Before he fled, Schrier said he was beaten with a metal cable across his feet and given electrical shocks. He also said the rebels cleaned out his bank accounts and emailed his family pretending to be him and assuring them he was well, he told the New York Times.

The paper chose not to identify the other American captive at the request of his family.

While Schrier's abduction has not been reported before, he was one of several  Westerners in rebel-held 
territory since the civil war began.

He said he was traveling without a 
commission from a media organization and had attempted to leave Aleppo by
taxi on December 31. But the vehicle was stopped and he was taken by the rebels.

He said on one occasion, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, he was filmed confessing
 to espionage after the captors coerced them into doing so.

Schrier was also whipped with  cable on the soles of his 
feet while his knees were wedged in a car tire, and he was questioned  by men speaking fluent English whom he guessed were Canadian.

His captors masked 
his plight by sending emails from  his account. They also demanded to know his card PINs to raid his 
online bank account and buy computers and car parts with his eBay 
account.

He said he was moved several times and often
 held alongside Syrians accused  of fighting for the government, and he was also taken  for a time by another group, Ahrar al-Sham.

Alone: He was working as a freelance photographer when he was taken on December 31

At one place, where he was held in April, a boy as young as 12 was allowed to beat prisoners and use a Taser gun to shock them.

But
 amid the torture and frustrations, he said that there were moments when he was not treated forcefully, including when he was seized by three men with their 
faces covered with black cloths.

'They were so nonchalant,' he said. 'They didn't point a gun at me, and moved me very gently.'

When
 he was taken to the compound - where he thought they'd release him 
after looking at his photographs - they were polite, he said. One man even warned
 him the glass was hot when he was given tea, he said.

Treatment also improved  when he converted to Islam and was given a Koran in 
English.

But amid these moments of solace came
 the fear of being beaten and the boredom of pacing around a tiny cell. He 
shared the cell with two roommates, but rather than bond, they fought.

The rebels never gave 
any indication of when he could be released, but he deduced that many 
men had been held captive for much longer than he had been there.

'In your country you have a saying: You 
are innocent until proven guilty,' one captor said. 'Here we have the 
opposite. You are guilty until proven innocent. We do not know who you 
are.'

Schrier's mother 
grew worried about getting no word from her son and reported him missing
 to the State Department on January 31 - exactly one month after he was 
taken.

Held: He says that he was beaten, electrocuted and robbed by the rebels after they kidnapped him

But the captors assured friends and family he was well.

One email they wrote to a friend on February 2 read: 'I'm doing good man. I have access to Internet for like 5 minutes or 
so, and I will not be able to log in my e-mail for at least the next few
 weeks.'

Schrier eventually slipped from a gap in a 
basement window early on July 29,  he said, leaving behind his bulkier 
compatriot.

Schrier 
said he was able to  stand on his cellmate's back and unravel a wire 
mesh covering a  window. Just before dawn, he wriggled out but the other
 American  got stuck.

'All right, go,' he told Schrier, who walked until
 he  found other rebels. They drove him to the nearby Turkish border and he was eventually helped by American officials.

As well as suggesting the attitudes of rebels towards foreigners, his experience also reveals the risks facing those reporting  from Syria, notably freelance journalists traveling alone.

In an interview before his trip last November, Schrier said he had been a healthcare worker until recently and had funded his own trip.

It was his plan to travel from New York to Turkey and Jordan, before venturing across the border to a camp of displaced Syrian families.

'I don't have a death wish,' he said. 'The rebels want me to be as safe as possible.'

His capture and detention is one of more than 15 cases of Westerners, mostly journalists, being abducted or disappearing in Syria this year, the Times noted.
