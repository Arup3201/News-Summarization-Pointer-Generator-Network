An embarrassing paperwork bungle has seen a convicted killer held for extradition over the vicious murder of a 'well-liked family man' in March walk free a month later - and the victim's family is furious.

Robert Craig Sandman, 52, was a 'person of interest' in the murder of Donald Singer, found dead and wrapped in blankets in his garage in Duluth, 
Georgia, and his red 1988 Porsche missing, in late March.

Police arrested Sandman on April 7 for theft after seeing him driving the vehicle in New Mexico, and then discovering he had a warrant out of Georgia in Singer's murder.

Sandman was due to be extradited for questioning over the murder that month, but authorities sent the paperwork to the wrong place and let him go.

Duluth police discovered the 
paperwork mix-up on July 10 after looking into Sandman's filed and 
finding he was no longer in police custody.

According to kasa.com, Duluth police planned to extradite Sandman back to Georgia for 
questioning, with an extradition hearing to be held in Sandoval County on 
April 19.

However, according to a May 13 court order, 
District Judge George Eichwald released Sandman from detention because the state of 
Georgia failed to organize the extradition within 20 days of the April 
hearing.

Duluth police Captain Mark Hunter told Atlanta Journal-Constitution Sandoval County 
officials sent notice to the state probation office and not the Gwinnett
County Sheriff’s Department, which handles extraditions for its 
municipal police departments.

'Gwinnett never received any notice that he was ready for transfer and neither did we,' he said.

'Our investigation is at a standstill until we talk to (Sandman).'

While the warrant for theft remains in effect, Sandman has eluded 
capture.

Duluth police had the terrible task 
of notifying 57-year-old Singer's distressed family, who are still 
seeking answers over the horrific murder.

'It
was just a phone call that said, 'We have some bad news. Robert Craig 
Sandman was released from New Mexico jail,'" Christina Torres Cappello, 
Singer's niece, told KRQE News 13.

'It's tough on everybody. It's tough on the brothers and the sisters. 

'It's tough on his children.'

Singer’s body was found by his daughter.

Torres Cappello said Sandman would still be in custody if 'someone just picked up the phone and followed up'.

'I am disgusted that our justice system released a known murderer,' she told Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'Now
you have a dangerous man back on the streets. People should be outraged that this could ever happen.'

State prison records reportedly show Sandman, 52, served nine years for second-degree murder in New Mexico during the 1990s.

He
served a second brief stint in a Jackson prison in February after he was 
convicted of two counts of theft and aggravated stalking for an incident
just down the street from Singer’s home on Montheath Pass.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sandman was released on March 22 — one day before Singer was last seen alive.
