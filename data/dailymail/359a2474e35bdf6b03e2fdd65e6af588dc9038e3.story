Food critics have pounced on Bill de Blasio again after the New York Mayor was spotted eating pizza in Italy with a knife and fork.

De Blasio may have been returning to his family homeland with a trip to Naples, but he appeared to have forgotten his city roots when he reached for the cutlery.

It is not the first time the mayor has made a pizza faux pas. Fewer than ten days into his term this year, he caused outrage among his constituents for the way he ate the city's famous dish.

At the time he had claimed that using cutlery was a cultural hangover from his family's Italian roots.

'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and Iâ€™ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said in January.

But his method is one that New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter.

As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands.

Still, there could be some hope for de Blasio, who is currently vacationing in Italy with his wife Chirlane, and children Dante and Chiara.

After being spotted using his knife and fork at lunchtime, the mayor was later seen apparently having a lesson in New York eating styles, as he devoured a slice that had been folded in half.

As well as learning how to eat pizza like a true New Yorker, the mayor and his family are due to visit the town where his grandmother lived before immigrating to the U.S. in the early 1900s.
