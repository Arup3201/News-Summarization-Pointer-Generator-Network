Holland international Stefan de Vrij is set to sign for Lazio, ending speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United.

The Feyenoord defender started every game under Louis van Gaal at the World Cup and there had been talk he was a target of the new United boss.

However, Feyenoord confirmed on Monday that De Vrij will join Serie A side Lazio in a £6.7m deal.

Ever-present: De Vrij started every game for Holland under Louis van Gaal at the World Cup

The 22-year-old has been capped 19 times by Holland and, while a centre-back by trade, he can also operate at right-back.

United, meanwhile, continue to be linked with a move for Arsenal centre-back Thomas Vermaelen.

Louis van Gaal is keen to bolster his side's defence after losing vast amounts of experience at the back, with the likes of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand departing the club this summer.
