A complete stranger who attempted to blackmail reality star Amy Duggar with 'incriminating and shocking' photos of her with a supposed older lover pleaded guilty in court today.

Teresa Hunt, 49, was arrested in February after she contacted the niece of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, stars of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting.

She told Miss Duggar she had photographic proof that the 25-year-old was having an illicit affair and wanted a $10,000 pay off.

The pictures turned out to be innocent snaps of Amy with her singing mentor James Garrett, a John Denver impersonator 21 years her senior.

Hunt faced one charge of extortion in federal court in Davenport, Iowa after trying to blackmail Amy and Discovery Communications, the company which owns TLC who make the Duggar family's popular reality show.

Amy Duggar told the Quad-City Times that Hunt was a complete stranger to her.

Mr Garrett had previously said that Hunt worked as a personal photographer for him, providing his publicity shots.

Hunt's scam was revealed after an FBI sting where an undercover agent posed as an employee from Discovery Communications. Hunt claimed to the agent that three media outlets had each offered $3,000 for the pictures of Amy Duggar.

Hunt then emailed the pictures unwittingly to the FBI with a demand for $10,000 to be wired into her bank account.

Amy Duggar, a devout Christian, said that justice had been served, telling RadarOnline: 'It is a sad situation and it didn’t affect me at all.

'I’m deeply saddened that she is going to have time in prison and I hope to God she gets her heart healed, whatever is hurting her.'

Teresa Hunt, of Bettendorf, Iowa, told the judge that she had used anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for 20 years. She claimed that there was 'two sides to every story' as she left court.

Hunt is due to be sentenced on November 9 and faces up to two years in prison. 

James Garrett earlier told RadarOnline that he and Amy had enjoyed a good laugh that the photos would be considered incriminating but that the whole experience had been unsettling.

According to Mr Garrett, Amy sang with the 
John Denver tribute show in Branson, Missouri for four years and their 
working friendship was strictly platonic and professional.

Hunt had worked for Mr Garrett as his personal photographer providing 
pictures for his billboards and magazine ads.

Country singer Amy occasionally appears on the reality series as a guest star. Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar are a deeply religious couple who shun contraception and have a family of 19 children.

They have been married since 1984 and have ten boys, nine girls and two grandchildren.
