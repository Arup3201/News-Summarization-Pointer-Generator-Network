With cities all along the Philadelphia-to-Boston corridor preparing for a potentially historic storm, Uber has announced that it is suspending price surges during the storm in accordance with an agreement made with New York's attorney general last year.

Uber, which uses a mobile application to connect riders with vehicles for hire, has its rates rise and fall with demand, but it has been criticized for 'surge pricing' that's sometimes exponentially higher than base fares.

After charging eight times normal fares during snowstorms in New York in late 2013, Uber agreed last July to limit prices during emergencies, natural disasters or other unusual market disruptions consistent with a state law against price gouging.

The San Francisco-based company also instituted the same cap policy nationally and agreed to donate commissions on surge trips, or 20 percent of the total fare on trips with elevated pricing, to the American Red Cross.

'Dynamic pricing will be capped and all Uber proceeds will be donated to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts,' the company reiterated in a statement on Monday.

Under the agreement, Uber will set a cap during 'abnormal disruptions of the market,' limited to the range of prices charged in the preceding 60 days and excluding the three highest prices. 

During those times, businesses are prohibited from charging 'unconscionably excessive prices' for essential consumer goods or services.

Snow predictions as of Monday afternoon reveal that several feet is set to blanket the Northeast along with high winds that will create 'life-threatening' whiteout conditions, according to the National Weather Service

The company has previously claimed that its surge-pricing algorithm helped encourage drivers to respond to increased requests during peak hours, in inclement weather and on holidays.

But huge hikes  also led to accusations that the company was simply seeking to benefit from others' misfortune.

There was outrage after the company's surge pricing model kicked-in in Sydney during a hostage crisis in December, in which a gunman held occupants in a cafe for about 17 hours.  

The National Weather Service is predicting that 2 to 3 feet of snow will fall in a 250-mile stretch of the Northeast, including the New York and Boston areas. Philadelphia is braced for 14 to 18 inches.
