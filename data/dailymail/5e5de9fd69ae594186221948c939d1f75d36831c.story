International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced yesterday that the UK will end its aid programme with South Africa

Britain is to stop giving millions of pounds of aid every year to South Africa, Justine Greening said yesterday.

The International Development Secretary said Britain’s relationship with the country, one of the richest in Africa, should be about trade and should no longer be about handouts.

The Government’s aid programme to South Africa is currently worth £19million a year, but will stop by 2015, she said.

The decision provoked a furious reaction from a spokesman for the South African government, who accused Britain of ending the aid budget unilaterally and warned that it could redefine the relationship between the two states.

But the Department for International Development insisted that it had notified Pretoria about the decision months ago.

South Africa is one of the richest countries on the continent, and the UK wants to target its aid budget towards the poorest nations.

The country now accounts for over a third of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product, and is a member of the BRICS  (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) group of emerging economies and the G20.

Britain has already announced that direct bilateral aid to India will also end by 2015.

However, despite these decisions, Britain’s aid budget is still soaring to 0.7 per cent of GDP while domestic services are facing cuts.

Ms Greening made the announcement at a conference of African ministers and business leaders in London yesterday.

‘South Africa has made enormous progress over the past two decades, to the extent that it is now the region’s economic powerhouse and Britain’s biggest trading partner in Africa,’ she said.

‘We are proud of the work the UK has done in partnership with the South African government, helping the country’s transition from apartheid to a flourishing, growing democracy.

‘I have agreed with my South African counterparts that South Africa is now in a position to fund its own development.

‘It is right that our relationship changes to one of mutual co-operation and trade, one that is focused on delivering benefits for the people of Britain and South Africa as well as for Africa as a whole.’

But last night the South African government accused Britain of ending the aid budget unilaterally.

Clayson Monyela, spokesman for the country’s international relations department, said: ‘This is such a major decision with far-reaching implications on the projects that are currently running, and it is tantamount to redefining our relationship.

‘Ordinarily, the UK government should have informed the government of South Africa through official diplomatic channels of their intentions and allowed for proper consultations to take place, and the modalities of the announcement agreed on.’

He said it had been expected that a review of the UK-South Africa strategy and decisions about how to move forward, including on direct aid, would take place later this year at a bilateral forum.

‘This unilateral announcement no doubt will affect how our bilateral relations going forward will be conducted,’ he said. ‘We are however, looking forward to the SA/UK bilateral forum later this year to clear up this matter among others.’

But Britain’s Department for International Development said it had held months long discussions with South African government over ending aid.

A spokesman said: ‘Today’s announcement comes after months of discussions with the South African government. DfID ministers and senior officials have met with the South African government on many occasions to discuss our decision.’

South Africa is the UK’s 24th biggest trading partner, with annual trade amounting to £10.5billion.
