Sir Elton John kisses baby Lev during a news conference at a hospital for HIV-positive children in the town of Makeyevka outside Donetsk in 2009

The grandmother of a little boy in Ukraine who Sir Elton John tried unsuccessfully to adopt has called on the singer for ‘any help’ he could give.

Sir Elton and his husband David Furnish were captivated by little Lev Ageyev when they encountered him at an orphanage in 2009.

But under Ukraine’s laws, gay men are banned from adopting and in any case Sir Elton, then aged 62, was considered too old.

Sir Elton said at the time: ‘I would love to adopt him. He has stolen my heart.’

Lev’s grandmother Yulia, 61, has now rescued him from the orphanage.

She said: ‘I have taken Lev out of the kindergarten until the trouble is over.’

She added: ‘I know he felt something for Lev. We’re worried what will happen so any help he could give us would be appreciated.’ 

She added: ‘Lev went away to a camp recently and ended up becoming the star.

'And he told everyone that Elton John wanted to adopt him.’

After
 failing to adopt him, the couple publicly pledged to find him a home in
 his native country and send regular financial help.

In
 2011 Lev's grandmother said she had not heard anything for Sir Elton 
since his visit. She said the  the singer had also promised to help 
Lev’s HIV-positive brother, Artyom

Lev’s alcoholic mother Marina, who was also HIV positive, died of pneumonia in 2010.

Meanwhile,
 dating agencies in Ukraine said they are being inundated with women who
 are seeking British men in a bid to escape the troubled region.

A
 university art teacher with two degrees, told The Sun: ‘Right now, in 
Ukraine, our society is falling apart and I’m very sad about it.

‘I worked in Spain as a model and met a lot of British men there.

‘The British mentality really is very different. I like how your men have wonderful manners.

‘They can talk to you without boorishness. They know how to have fun and not to turn into drunken animals like our men do.’

Today Ukrainian national guardsmen opened fire on a crowd outside a town hall in eastern Ukraine. An official for the region's insurgents said there were fatalities.

The bloodshed in the town of Krasnoarmeisk occurred hours after dozens of guardsmen shut down voting in a referendum on sovereignty for the region.

An photographer who witnessed the shooting said two people were seen lying unmoving on the ground and insurgent leader Denis Pushilin was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as saying there were an unspecified number of deaths.

Several hours earlier, guardsmen came to the town about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the regional capital, Donetsk, and dispersed referendum voting that was taking place outside the town hall and they took control of the building.

In the evening, more guardsmen arrived in a van and a scuffle broke out with people who were gathered around the building. Then the guardsmen fired shots.

Eastern Ukraine has been gripped by unrest for the past month as pro-Russia insurgents occupied police stations and government buildings. Ukrainian forces have mounted a limited offensive to try to drive them out.

The Donetsk and Luhansk regions conducted referendums on declaring the regions as so-called sovereign people's republics.

Leaders of the vote, which is regarded as illegitimate by the central government and the West, say that sometime after the referendum, a decision will be made on whether to remain part of Ukraine, declare independence of seek annexation into Russia.
