Two of the youngest Sydney sige hostages have revealed they considered stabbing gunman Man Haron Monis during the horrific 17-hour ordeal.

Lindt Café workers Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat told how they were secretly armed with kitchen knives and switch-blades and grappled with how and when to make their move against Monis.

Hoffman, 19, and Herat, 21, tried to seize an opportunity to stab Monis 'in the jugular' but were also concerned their actions would further place other hostages' lives in danger. 

Cafe workers Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat revealed to 60 Minutes they considered attacking gunman Man Haron Monis in a bid to end the ordeal. 'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' said Hoffman

'What if I miss?' Joel Herat grappled with the idea of stabbing the crazed gunman. He was brought to tears when he recalled the moment he decided to run out of the cafe

'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' said Hoffman.

Herat recounted the thoughts that went through his head during the siege. 

'He was, you know, right below me sitting on the lounge and like, do I stab him? You know, what if I miss? What are the consequences of that, you know?' he told 60 Minutes.

Hoffman then decided his actions would lead to fatal consequences - potentially the life of pregnant lawyer Julie Taylor.

'We are so close we could do this but you know someone would need to jump, hold his arms down and then I would stab him in the jugular,' he said. 'But he had his gun, he had it on his knee and I could see that it was pointed directly at Julie Taylor's back.' 

For the first time, the rantings of Sydney siege gunman Man Monis can be heard from inside the Lindt cafe, as hostages were forced to make phone calls to media outlets making demands.

Monis can be clearly heard during the 60 Minutes siege special, in the background of their conversations, making almost incomprehensible statements: 'You, you call her she's ringing some of the politicians now.'

'Very good that everyone know, because everyone today realise that politic they all lie and they all cheat but before today they didn't know about it,' he continues.

'Most of you they thought different.'

The gunman forced hostages to make the calls as the siege dragged into the late hours of December 15.  In his comments, the gunman focuses on politicians claiming 'they all lie and cheat'

During the Channel Nine program presented by Liz Hayes, pregnant cafe worker Harriette Denny spoke about the gunman's bizarre behaviour.

'It was very strange, he would have a big smile on his face when he would threaten us,' she said.

'I don't know why he kept smiling. But I will remember those teeth.' 

Ms Denny spoke about what she thought would be last desperate conversation, about her unborn child, with partner Jorge, who was waiting outside in Martin Place, powerless to help.

Ms Denny, 30, revealed she had secretly kept her phone despite Monis' demands all wallets and mobiles be handed to him - and how used it during a trip to the bathroom to call her partner, Jorge.

'He asked me if I was in the building. And I said yes. And I said I loved him, as you would, because I didn't think I was coming out,' she admitted.

'You always think that you're not going to come out.'

She said her partner made sure to say that 'he loves me and he is waiting for me outside'. Jorge had raced to the scene from a work site and watched on, helpless.

Lindt cafe worker Harriette Denny told Liz Hayes on 60 Minutes that she thought a mass execution was about to take place when they were all up against the windows. 'I thought I was gone' and recalls her secret phone conversation with partner Jorge

She also made the startling revelation that she prepared herself to be shot in the back in a mass execution inside the Lindt cafe.

Denny, thought the moment gunman Man Monis forced all hostages up against the shop windows, was the beginning of the end.

'I heard him - I heard a velcro opening. I literally thought that he was going to shoot us. So everybody can see through the window, I thought I was gone,' she said.

'And I knew my family would be watching.'

Pregnant 30-year-old Harriette Denny, has spoken of how she made a secret phone call to her partner Jorge who rushed to Martin Place when he found out she was trapped inside the Lindt cafe. She had made peace with the fact she was going to be shot, when she believed she would die inside the building

Two months on from the siege inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, the Nine Network has brought together eight of the surivors; Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe, Louisa Hope and Robin Hope.

Harriet Denny, the Lindt cafe barista who was pregnant at the time of the siege, revealed how she made peace with herself when she thought she was going to be shot by Monis in the early hours of the morning.

'Knowing that you’re about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear, you lose hope, thinking about your family outside, thinking there’s nothing you can do to get yourself out and it’s very hard..' she said.

'I remember sitting down and I thought I had a sense of calm. I started to be grateful for my family, for my partner and my friends and the fact that I know that maybe I won’t be able to have this baby. 

'I was very grateful that I was able to experience the pure love and happiness of being pregnant so at that time I remember thinking if he shoots me, as long as I don’t feel it or see it coming I’d be okay with it.' Ms Denny continued.

Joel and Harriette were among those who were able to escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at the height of the Sydney siege

 As more and more people escaped, the remaining hostages recalled their fear, convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised.

'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman recalled Monis saying. 

'They had left us.

 'A glass or something just smashed and made this big bang and the gunman, he yells..."what was that?!" And then everything just slows down,' Joel recalled.

'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny (far left) said

 

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege. 'He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said

He recalled when his manager Tori first told him to go get the keys to shut the front door.

'Well, generally when someone says, "Everything is OK," "tell the staff that we're not in danger," pretty much usually means that you're in a lot of danger.'

Yet, despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old refused to budge until the very end.

Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life.

Neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - Louisa suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72-year-old mother doubted she could run at great speed.  

'I looked up and opened my eyes and they were all gone. [I thought] "Well this is it" but at the same time "I'm ready",' Ms Hope told 60 Minutes.

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised more of the hostages had escaped.

'Now he's realised another two, and he's heard it, we all heard it. He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said.

Louisa Hope recalled thinking: "Well, this is it," but also at the same time, "Well, I'm ready." And then he says to Tori (Johnson), "Kneel down." 'He shot him.'
