Harry Potter fans or fairtrade food activists? As it turns out, fans of the boy wizard are concerned about where their magical snacks come from.

Fans are celebrating after winning a four-year battle to get Warner Bros. Entertainment to use only fairtrade certified chocolate in all Harry Potter-branded chocolate.

This includes the chocolate frogs that are sold at Universal Orlando's theme park in Florida, as well as the Shock-O-Choc and HoneyDukes Chocolate Bars.

Led by the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA), fans have just won a four-year fair-trade chocolate battle against Warner Bros.

The HPA sent petitions and video messages to Warner Bros. arguing against unethically produced chocolate

The Harry Potter Alliance (HPA), a social justice group, has been pushing for such certification since Halloween 2010.

HPA founder Andrew Slack and his slew of activists, which includes Harry Potter creator, J.K. Rowling herself, were working to ensure that all chocolate production not rely on child labour and that all producers are paid a decent wage.

In a 400,000-strong petition to Warner Bros., which own all rights to the Harry Potter franchise, which includes products and merchandise, the HPA argued that Harry's fans didn't think that the fictional wizard would approve of unethically produced chocolate.

'If 'Harry Potter' [as a franchise] were to be in alignment with the values of Harry Potter [himself], it could be a real symbolic and coherent victory,' Slack told the Washington Post.  

Any chocolate products affiliated with the Harry Potter series will be made only of certified free-trade cocoa

Chocolate plays an important role in the franchise and is very symbolic to the storyline 

After Harry leaves his aunt and uncle's house to attend Hogwarts, the abundance of chocolate available there becomes a symbol for how the school will nourish Harry's body and mind.

Since chocolate plays such an important role in the series, the opportunity to turn fans into real-life advocates was an idea that especially appealed to Slack. 

The group charged Behr's Chocolate, the company that Warner Bros. used to make all of the Harry Potter chocolate, with a poor record of human rights and child labour.

Thousands of fans sent complaint letters over the years and in 2013, the HPA took yet another step forward when they teamed up with Walk Free, an anti-slavery movement, to pressure Warner Bros. even further.

In December, it was announced that chocolate sold at the Universal Orlando theme park would be fair-trade

In 2014, J.K. Rowling also joined the cause. 

And it paid off.

On December 22, Joshua Berger, the president of Harry Potter Global Franchise Development, wrote an email to the HPA announcing Warner Bros,' decision.

'By the end of 2015, and sooner when possible, all Harry Potter chocolate products sold at Warner Bros. outlets and through our licensed partners will be 100 per cent UTZ or Fair Trade certified.'
