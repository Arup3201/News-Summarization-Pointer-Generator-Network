An astronaut conducting a spacewalk outside the ISS today reported dangerous water leak in his helmet - a problem reminiscent of a near-drowning in orbit two years ago.

Flight engineer, Terry Virts, reported the water while he waited in the air lock for today's spacewalk to formally conclude.

The amount of water increased slightly, but he appeared to be in no immediate danger, said Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who helped to remove his suit.

In 2013, another Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. 

The water escaped from his suit's cooling system. Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks.

Today's problem didn't impact the spacewalk which saw Virts join fellow astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore on a 6.5 hours mission to prepare parking spots for future 'space taxis'. 

A camera fixed to the astronaut's spacesuits provided stunning shots of the ISS and Earth, as the astronaut's grapple with lubrication of the latches and brackets.

Wilmore took a moment to savor the view. 'I don't think I've seen blue that blue,' he observed above the Caribbean.

The spacewalkers struggled to remove a cover protecting the berthing slip, one of two sites being reconfigured for new spaceships under development by Boeing and SpaceX.

'This thing has rigidified out here,' Wilmore radioed to flight controllers in Houston.

'That's as expected, so good luck with that,' replied astronaut Joe Acaba at Mission Control.

Station commander Wilmore, call sign EV-1, is wearing a suit with red stripes and is using helmet camera No. 18.

Virts, EV-2, is wearing an unmarked suit is using helmetcam 20.

The cover's removal was another step to prepare the station for new international docking port adapters that are due to arrive later this year.

Station commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, 52, and flight engineer Terry Virts (pictured), 47, left the station's Quest airlock just after 7 am EST (1200 GMT) and headed to the space shuttle's old docking port.

The adapters will be installed during four more spacewalks Nasa plans in 2015.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

On Saturday, Wilmore and Virts installed about 340ft (104 metres) of power and data cables to support the new docking systems.

During today's spacewalk, scheduled to last about 6.5 hours, they plan to attach two more cables and lubricate the grapple fixture at the end of the station's robot arm.

The spacewalkers will also prepare the 'Tranquility' connecting node for the September arrival of an experimental inflatable habitat built by privately-owned Bigelow Aerospace.

Las Vegas-based Bigelow is developing free-flying expandable habitats for lease by agencies, researchers and businesses.

Nasa is looking at the technology for future human expeditions beyond the station's 260-mile (418-km) high orbit.

The station, a partnership of 15 nations, is a collection of laboratories and platforms for materials and life science experiments, Earth studies, physics and other investigations that take advantage of the microgravity environment and unique vantage point of space.

The Russian space agency Roscosmos said yesterday it would remain part of the international outpost until 2024, a four-year extension proposed by the US.
