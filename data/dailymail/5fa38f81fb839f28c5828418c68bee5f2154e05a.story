A diehard Seattle Seahawks fan who got a tattoo in December predicting that his team would win this year's Super Bowl has said he has no regrets about his premature inking and plans to keep it despite his team's last minute loss.

The man, who goes by OC, had the tattoo done on Christmas Eve 2014 at Fantasy Tattoo in Orange Park, Florida.

OC, who is originally from Washington state now lives in Jacksonville, has had a Seahawks tattoo since his team played in their first Super Bowl in 2006, when they lost to the Pittsburg Steelers.

OC tweeted his intention to keep his tattoo after his beloved Seahawks lost Sunday's Super Bowl

Then in a fit of overconfidence OC sought out a tattoo shop on Christmas Eve and paid $300 to add two Lombardi trophies and the words 'Back To Back Champions' to his original tattoo. 

As the clock wound down during Sunday night's big game, OC said he was on the edge of his seat and when a last minute interception put paid to his team's dreams he collapsed to the floor. 

'I fell to the ground and put my head on the ground for about 30 seconds or something like that, I was just in shock,' he told The Huffington Post.

Despite the 28-24 defeat to the Patriots putting an end to OC's dream of the Seahawks becoming back to back champions, he intends to keep his inaccurate tattoo.  

'I feel like you only live once, you know? I knew that there was going to be consequences to me getting it, even before I got it and everything I just didn't get it blindly ... 

'I knew that there was a chance that they could lose obviously. But I'm going to keep the Seahawks tattoo ... Hey, at least I did it. I took a chance. Sometimes though you take chances and you have the wrong outcome that you don't think is going to happen.'

Good sport OC even posted a video of a friend jokingly trying to rub the tattoo off with sandpaper after the game.
