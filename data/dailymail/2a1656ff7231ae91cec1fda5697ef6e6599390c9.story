Killed: Dr Jerry Umanos was a married father and practicing pediatrician who moved from Chicago to Kabul seven years ago and was fatally shot Thursday

One of the three American doctors killed in Afghanistan has been identified as a pediatrician who 'felt called' to move to Kabul.

Dr Jerry Umanos practiced in the inner-city of Chicago before moving to Afghanistan seven years ago.

Dr Umanos and a father and son who were visitng Cure International Hospital were killed at the western Kabul center on Thursday morning after an Afghan security guard opened fire. The names of the related victims have not yet been released.

'He was a loving, caring physician,' his former colleague Dr Bruce Rowell told CNN, adding that Dr Umanos treated his patients 'with the utmost of respect.'

'He loved the country, he loved the people, he loved to teach.

'As much as we love and miss him, all of us have a certain level of respect and contentment knowing Jerry died doing what he loved most.'

Dr Umanos' wife and grown children all live in the United States.

He had been living and working in Kabul for seven years, making him the longest-serving doctor at the facility.

He didn't limit his care to the training facility which also treats children, but he also worked at a community health center.

The Thursday morning shooting was the latest in a string of deadly attacks on foreign civilians in the Afghan capital this year.

An American nurse was also injured in the shooting but is said to be in stable condition.

The attacker was a member of the 
Afghan Public Protection Force assigned to guard the hospital, according
 to District Police Chief Hafiz Khan.

The man shot himself during the attack but survived and is in police custody.

Mr Khan said the man's motive was not yet clear.

The shooter was in surgery at midday in the same medical facility under heavy 
police guard, according to Kanishka Bektash Torkystani, a Ministry of 
Health spokesman.

'Five 
doctors had entered the compound of the hospital and were walking toward
 the building when the guard opened fire on them,' Torkystani said.

Fleeing the scene: Women are rushed out of the facility, which was founded by an American charity with the approval of the Afghan government in 2007 and treats 37,000 patients per year

Rising number: The Afghan capital has seen a spate of attacks on foreign civilians in 2014

The
 U.S. Embassy in Kabul confirmed that three American citizens had been 
killed in the hospital attack but said it had no other information.

According to its website, the Cure International Hospital was founded in 2005 by invitation of the Afghan Ministry of Health.

It sees 37,000 patients a year, specialising in child and maternity health as well as general surgery.

It
 is affiliated with the Christian charity Cure International, which 
operates in 29 countries with the motto 'curing the sick and proclaiming
 the kingdom of God.'

Timing: The worrying new trend comes as the U.S.-led military coalition prepares to withdraw most troops by the end of the year

On guard: The shooter, who worked as a security guard at the hospital, shot himself during the attack and was treated and is now being questioned and held by police

The 
attacker had emerged from surgery in the afternoon and was in recovery 
at Cure International before being questioned, Dalil added.

The
 Afghan capital has seen a spate of attacks on foreign civilians in 
2014, a worrying new trend as the U.S.-led military coalition prepares 
to withdraw most troops by the end of the year.

It
 was unclear whether the Taliban were behind Thursday's shooting, though
 the insurgents have claimed several major attacks that killed foreign 
civilians this year.

In 
January, a Taliban attack on a popular Kabul restaurant with suicide 
bombers and gunmen killed more than a dozen people, while in March 
gunmen slipped past security at an upscale hotel in the Afghan capital 
and killed several diners in its restaurant.

Two foreign journalists were killed and another wounded in two separate attacks.

The
 hospital shooting is also the second 'insider attack' by a member of 
Afghan security forces targeting foreign civilians this month.

On
 April 4, an Afghan police officer shot two Associated Press staff 
working in the eastern province of Khost, killing photographer Anja 
Niedringhaus and wounding veteran correspondent Kathy Gannon.
