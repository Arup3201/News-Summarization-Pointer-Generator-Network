The betrayal of older women who develop breast cancer in Britain is exposed today.

Eight out of ten are denied the chance of basic treatment simply on the basis of their age.

Those over 70 who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is the standard approach for younger patients.

This means potentially lifesaving drugs are denied to women purely because they are regarded as too old, rather than whether they are fit enough or could benefit from treatment.

Britain’s survival rates for breast cancer are also alarmingly behind those of other developed nations.

For women over 70, the gap in survival rates between the UK and Sweden stretches to 12 per cent.

Last night experts said the figures, from two separate studies, showed that older women were not being treated in a ‘fair and equal way’ by the NHS.

Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘As nearly a third of new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women over 70, with this set to rise due to an ageing population, it’s vital that a consistent standard of care is given to every woman, whatever her age.’

The first study, from the University of Sussex, and Brighton & Sussex Medical School, shows just 14 per cent of patients over 70 with early breast cancer are offered chemotherapy after surgery.

Older
women could also be missing out on the benefits of the ‘wonder’ drug 
Herceptin because it works better when used in combination with 
chemotherapy.

And in nearly a
third of cases, doctors decide how to treat patients over 70 without 
recording their fitness or testing their so-called HER2 status, to see 
if they are among the one in five who might respond to Herceptin.

The most shocking finding was that of the 45 per cent of patients at high risk of breast cancer returning, less than a third were offered chemotherapy.

Some hospitals did not give chemotherapy to any patient over 70, the research, funded by drug company Roche, found.

Professor Lesley Fallowfield, of the University of Sussex, said: ‘Elderly breast cancer patients should be assessed in the same way that younger patients are, based on their fitness and HER2 status, without prejudice or unreasonably ageist perceptions. This is essential information, and without it, you may as well guess as to the most appropriate treatment.

‘National guidelines need to be developed if elderly patients are to receive fair and equal assessment of their treatment requirements in future.’

The second study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, says although women under 70 have better survival rates everywhere for breast cancer, in the UK the gap between the chances of younger and older patients is the most marked.

Just 42 per cent of British women over 70 who are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer live for another year – compared with 60 per cent of younger women battling the disease.

The figures, from a study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and using data from 257,362 women diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 –  suggest that those over 70 are missing out on more aggressive treatments.

Lead researcher Dr Sarah Walters said the latest figures suggest that the UK should ‘investigate whether the treatment of women with later-stage breast cancer meets international standards’.

‘There is particular concern that this is not the case, especially for older women,’ she said.

Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of early diagnosis, said Britain  was starting to close the survival gap with other countries, but patients here ‘continue to fare worse’.

‘We know that UK women diagnosed with breast cancer are not routinely given CT scans to check if the disease has spread, which could mean we aren’t always accurately staging more advanced disease,’ she said.

‘But we also need to investigate the possibility that fewer women with later stage breast cancer in the UK receive the best treatment for their circumstances.’

The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer and a cross-party group of MPs are working on an inquiry into the treatment of older people with breast cancer.

The charity says they are missing out on the advances in radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery over the last ten years that have so dramatically improved the survival chances of younger patients.

MP Steve Brine said: ‘We are deeply concerned by suggestions that older breast cancer patients are being denied access to the full treatment and support options that are available purely as a result of their age.’

Dr Rachel Greig, from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘We already know that the number of women over 70 receiving chemotherapy is low.

‘What is a cause for concern, in the study, is that in some cases treatment decisions were made without data on HER2 status. This information could have changed the way the patient was treated.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘This study will help us keep improving breast cancer treatment as part of our cancer strategy to save an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2014.

‘The NHS is also working to ensure all patients are treated as individuals and receive care that meets their healthcare needs whatever their age or condition.’
