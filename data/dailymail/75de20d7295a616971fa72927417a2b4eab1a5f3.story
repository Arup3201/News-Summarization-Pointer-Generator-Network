The woman who survived a vicious meat cleaver attack on a Manhattan street over the weekend has had half of her skull removed by doctors working to fix the damage to her brain.

Jinyia You was stabbed numerous times by the large knife during the broad daylight attack on Sunday, allegedly by her husband, Ming Guang Huang.

A judge has ordered Huang, 28, held without bail in connection to the crime, a portion of which was caught by a store surveillance camera.

Attack: Ming Guang Huang has been charged with attacking his wife Jinyia You with a meat cleaver in broad daylight on a Manhattan street. She can be seen her being dragged along the floor

Springing into action: The attack was broken up by firefighters, who witnessed the trouble from their firehouse across the street

Both Huang and You are currently 
at Bellevue Hospital - where the woman is receiving treatment for her injuries, and the man is being held in a psych ward, the New York Post reported.

Huang has been charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder.

A criminal complaint obtained by the paper on Wednesday said that she 'sustained multiple lacerations to the head, two of which went into the skull, hitting the brain, and required removing half of the victim's skull in order to stabilize the injury.'

In court on Wednesday, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Philip Kavoor told the judge: 'This case is such a serious and strong case wherein two eye witnesses observed the defendant attack the complaining witness with a meat cleaver and strike her multiple times in the head, face and body,' according to the Post.

The morning attack on Chinatown's Canal Street on Sunday left onlookers horrified, and even shocked firefighters across the street who rushed to You's rescue.

Restraint: As they held him against the side of the street, the firefighters saw a nearby police squad car, which they flagged down and Huang was arrested

Jose Ortiz and some other firefighters heard a commotion from their nearby Engine Company 9 firehouse.

They witnessed the brutal attack as they prepared their equipment for the day.

In front of a hair salon and novelties store, they say they saw a man dragging a woman down the street by the hair as she cried and screamed.

As the woman tried desperately to fend the man off, Ortiz approached them.

The 18-year FDNY veteran told the NY Daily News that's when things got ugly.

He said the 28-year-old man pulled a meat cleaver from his waistband and began hacking into his young wife's face and head.

'I would guess maybe six, eight, ten times, he hit the woman in the head,' he said.

Ortiz continued to approach the man as 
the attack went on. He said he tried to hold back the man's arm but he 
continued swinging the cleaver uncontrollably.

Fellow firefighter Shane Clarke and Jim Trainor finally came to Ortiz's aid and subdued the madman as the cleaver went flying through the air.

It was more of a struggle than Ortiz had originally guessed it would be.

‘He was not a big guy, only about 5-foot-5, but the cleaver made him a little taller,’ Ortiz said.

The firefighters saw a nearby police squad car, which they flagged down and the man was arrested.

Meanwhile, the woman fled from the scene panic-stricken and bleeding.

Panicked: The bloodied victim fled the scene but was eventually found and taken to Bellevue Hospital where she is expected to recover

‘She bolts. Shane follows her, because I told him, “You’ve got to follow the lady, because she’s hurt,”’ Ortiz said.

Clarke was able to catch up to the panicked woman at a nearby restaurant.

Accustomed to terrifying and dire situations, these FDNY heroes feel fortunate to have come to the rescue so quickly but were definitely fazed by this unusual occurrence.

‘Besides the World Trade Center,’ Clarke said, ‘this was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.’

The attacker was taken into custody at the scene, where remains.
