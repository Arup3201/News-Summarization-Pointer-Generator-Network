The possibility that man walked much earlier than previously thought has been raised after a study of ancient habitats.

Scientists now believe that grassy open spaces - where human predecessors would have been forced to walk - have dominated the East African landscape throughout the whole of human evolution.

Until now it was supposed that the region known as the 'Cradle of Humanity' was heavily forested until around two million years ago.

Many experts believe the predecessors of humans only came down from the trees and developed into fully bipedal creatures after the forests receded.

But the new evidence, based on chemical signatures in ancient soil samples, shows that savannah-like open habitats have prevailed there for more than six million years.

The finding has implications for theories about the pivotal moment when human ancestors started walking on two legs.

Humans and chimpanzees parted company on the path of evolution between five and eight million years ago.

The findings published in the journal Nature tie into certain aspects of the fossil record.

One
species, Ardipithecus, which is thought to have lived in woody habitats
4.3million years ago, had a diet which included small amounts of 
tropical grasses.

'The fact it had some means it was going into the savannah, unless it was eating take-out food,' said Professor Thure Cerling, from the University of Utah, who led the new research.

The study showed that for more than six million years, tree cover has been less than 40 per cent at most of the East African sites where humans evolved.

By definition, woodland has more than 40 per cent tree cover and a forest more than 80 per cent.

Prof Cerling added: 'We've been able to quantify how much shade was available in the geological past, and it shows there have been open habitats for all of the last six million years in the environments in eastern Africa where some of the most significant early human fossils were found.

'Wherever we find human ancestors, we find evidence for open habitats similar to savannahs - much more open and savannah-like than forested.

'In some periods, it was more bushy, and other times it was less bushy. Hardly anything could have been called a dense forest, but we can show some periods where certain environments were consistently more wooded than others.

'We find hominins (early humans, pre-humans and chimp and gorilla relatives) in both places.

'How early hominins partitioned their time between 'more open' and 'more closed' habitats is still an open question.'
