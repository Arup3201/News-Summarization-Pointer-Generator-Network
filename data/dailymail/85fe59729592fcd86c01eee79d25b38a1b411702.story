Delta Airlines has sparked a Twitter backlash after telling one passenger she wasn't allowed to breastfeed her baby on a plane without covering herself up.

On Friday, Lindsay Jaynes was preparing for a six-hour flight with her ten-week-old son when she tweeted to Delta Assist: 'What's your breastfeeding policy? I'll be flying with my 10 wk old son and he won't nurse with a cover or take a bottle. Thanks [sic].'

The Newport Beach, California native was shocked when Delta responded: 'Lindsay unfortunately you are not able to breastfeed if you don't have a cover up. I'm sorry.'

Heated debate: Delta Airlines has sparked a huge Twitter backlash after telling passenger Lindsay Jaynes (pictured) she wasn't allowed to breastfeed her ten-week-old son on a plane without covering herself up

Exchange: When the Newport Beach, California native tweeted to Delta that her baby won't nurse with a cover or take a bottle, the company responded: 'Unfortunately you are not able to breastfeed if you don't have a cover'

Delta has since apologized, calling the tweet 'miscommunication' - but not before it sparked a massive online debate.

Determined to get a legitimate reason from the company, Ms Jaynes wrote to them: 'My flight is six hours and he needs to eat every two hours. What do you suggest?'

'I would suggest pumping if you can and bringing it on board with you. You are allowed to bring breast milk on board,' the company responded.

Ms Jaynes posted the conversation online, quickly drawing angry feedback from breastfeeding support groups and other activists.

TheBabyGuy NYC picked up on the exchange, which drew more than 1,600 comments when he shared it on Facebook.

Controversy: Breastfeeding in public is legal in all 50 states, and 45 states specifically allow it anywhere. Still, companies continue to come under fire for telling mothers to take their nursing babies elsewhere

Hot topic: Ms Jaynes posted the conversation online, quickly drawing angry feedback from breastfeeding support groups and other activists who disagreed with Delta's statements

'That is so stupid,' wrote one person. 'If others don't want to see it then they don't need to stare. How rude. Would they rather a screaming baby?'

Another remarked: 'At ten weeks I couldn't even pump enough to last through one feeding.

'If others don't want to see it, they don't need to stare. Would they rather a screaming baby?'

'Pumping produces significant less milk in many women. It is not a reasonable option for some.'

Several hours after sparking the heated debate, Ms Jaynes again tweeted to Delta, writing: 'So even though I am legally allowed to breastfeed without a cover, you're saying I can't? Is there a Delta written policy?'

This time, another rep responded: 'Delta welcomes breastfeeding mothers and babies on our flights. We apologize for the misinformation earlier.'

Apology: Finally, another rep responded to Ms Jaynes: 'Delta welcomes breastfeeding mothers and babies on our flights. We apologize for the misinformation earlier'

That night, Delta called her to formally apologize, but the company still apparently refused to post its breastfeeding policy online, despite her requests.

Breastfeeding in public is legal in all 50 states, and 45 states specifically allow it anywhere. Still, companies continue to come under fire for telling mothers to take their nursing babies elsewhere.

In 2006, Delta sparked controversy yet again for telling mother Emily Gillette to leave a flight for refusing to cover her breast while she breastfed her baby.

Six years later, she reached an undisclosed settlement with the airline.
