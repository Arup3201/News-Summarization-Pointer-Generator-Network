The wettest summer on record lead to an increase in the number of beaches breaking clean water standards.

The latest water quality tests found that 93 per cent of England’s bathing spots reached the mandatory minimum levels, compared to 98 per cent in 2011.

Around England, 29 coastal sites failed to make the minimum grade, up from just nine spots last year, figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) showed.

And only 59 per cent met tougher “guideline” standards for water quality, a large drop on 2011 when almost four-fifths (79 per cent ) reached the higher level.

Across the UK as a whole, the number of beaches meeting water standards also fell, with those meeting guideline standards dropping from 77 per cent last year to 60 per cent in 2012 and those achieving the minimum grade falling from 98 per cent in 2011 to 94 per cent this year.

The fall came as the UK suffered the wettest summer for a century, with heavy rainfall washing pollution from cities and the countryside into rivers and down to the sea.

Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: 'While the majority of England’s bathing waters continue to be of good quality, I am disappointed that a number have fallen short of the tighter standard due to the heavy rainfall we experienced during the summer.

It is crucial that we continue to work with the Environment Agency, water companies and stakeholders to continue to address the effect that pollution is having on bathing water quality in some areas.

'Having quality bathing water and beaches is not only good for the water environment but also for tourism and local economies.'

Lord Smith, chairman of the Environment Agency, said: 'Bathing water quality has improved significantly over the past two decades, but this year heavy rainfall over the summer has affected results.

'During intense rainfall, pollution from farmland, roads and drains is washed into rivers and coastal areas.

'Water companies also operate combined sewage overflows to prevent sewage from backing up and flooding people’s homes.'

He warned that the very wet conditions highlighted that more needs to be done by water companies, businesses, farmers and local authorities to improve water quality on beaches and meet the more stringent EU standards coming in by 2015.

According to monitoring of 575 bathing spots around the UK , the number of beaches in Wales which met the current minimum standards fell from 99 per cent in 2011 to 97 per cent this year while the number passing in Northern Ireland fell from 100 per cent to 96 per cent .

But the situation in Scotland improved, with 98 per cent of beaches making the mandatory grade, up from 95 per cent last year. All 12 inland bathing waters assessed made the grade, the figures showed.
