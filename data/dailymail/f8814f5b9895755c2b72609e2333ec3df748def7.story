A mother of three who was left bald after spending 30 years pulling out her hair due to stress has told of how it was her 'horrible secret'.

Karen Fisher, 42, from Broadstairs, Kent, allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her severe hair loss. 

But instead, she was actually suffering from trichotillomania, a rare condition whereby she felt compelled to pull out her locks.

Now,  she has finally revealed the truth behind her baldness - and is speaking out in a bid to help others deal with the condition.

Mrs Fisher, who still suffers from trichotillomania but is receiving professional help, said: 'I’ve lived with trichotillomania for more than 30 years and it isn’t my dirty secret any more. 

'If people ask me about my bald patch now I tell them truth. I’m not proud that trichotillomania is a part of my life, but it doesn’t mean that I’m not proud of who I am and I won’t let this condition change that.’

Mrs Fisher, a florist, first began pulling her hair out at school aged 13 to cope with stress.

She said she felt a 'sense of relief' after tugging hairs from the centre of her scalp - something she continued to do every time she felt anxious.

By the time she was 15, she had a bald patch on her scalp the size of a 50 pence piece.

Treatment: Mrs Fisher, from Broadstairs, Kent, allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her hair loss. Above, she is seen having a hair weave attached to her scalp to cover the bald patch

Mrs Fisher's mother took her to the doctor, who diagnosed her hair loss as likely alopecia. But at the time, the teenager was too embarrassed to reveal the truth.

When she met her future husband Del in a pub, Mrs Fisher told him the same story to explain her bald patch. The couple married in August 1993 and had their first daughter Nevada two years later.

Exhausted from tending to her newborn Mrs Fisher noticed she had stopped pulling out her hair, but when the baby started to settle and sleep though she began tugging at it again.

The couple's second daughter Arizona was born in December 1997, followed by their son Memphis in September 2005.

Over the following years, Mrs Fisher went to great lengths to hide her condition, burying hair she had pulled out under rubbish in the bin.

Only when she read an article about trichotillomania did she realise she was suffering with the condition.

'Until then I didn’t even know it had a name,' she said. 'It was my horrible secret.’

Mrs Fisher said she contacted NHS direct, who urged her to see her GP, but she remained too ashamed to do so

'I was just relieved to know there were others out there even though I didn’t yet have the confidence to seek help,' she said. 

But as time passed, she began pulling her hair our more frequently and by 2007, the bald patch on the top of her head was so big she resembled, she said, a 'medieval monk'.

Tattoo: With her 40th birthday approaching, she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words: ‘You don’t define me' (left). She later shaved off her hair (right)

Attempts to style her hair with hairpieces failed so she began wearing a hat to hide the pink skin. 

It was only months later, while chatting to a friend, that Mrs Fisher suddenly admitted for the first time the truth behind her bald patch.

She said: ‘I just blurted it out. I waited for my friend to look shocked and horrified, but instead she just asked me why I did it and how it felt.

‘It felt wonderful to finally tell somebody the truth and I realised I had to tell my family.’

Mrs Fisher said her husband was disappointed she had not confided in him sooner but understood her reluctance to do so, while her close friends also rallied round in support.

Brave: Mrs Fisher, who is still suffering from the condition but is receiving help, said: 'The more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be'

With her secret out, she began looking for professional help and contacted a clinic that specialised in helping people with the condition by attaching a hair weave to the scalp to cover the bald patch. 

In October 2010, Mrs Fisher went to the Hair Solve clinic in Barnet, London and left with a full head of hair.

'It felt fantastic not to have to try and cover my bald spot. I could walk out in a breeze without worrying it was going to be exposed,' she said. 

Mrs Fisher said that the weave also prevented her from accessing the hair underneath the weave, meaning she had no urge to pull it.

She returned for treatment every six weeks and by August 2011, 96 per cent of Mrs Fisher's hair had grown back.

With her 40th birthday approaching, she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words: ‘You don’t define me'.

She hoped it would help stop her from pulling her hair when she saw it. But the urges grew stronger and eventually she started again and by December last year her scalp was once again visible.

Finally, Mrs Fisher decided to shave all her hair off in a bid to fight the temptation to pull and turn the tables on her condition, which she described as 'not very well understood'. 

'It is a constant battle for me. But the more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be attached to it making it easier for others,' she said.

‘I have found a brilliant community of online support and we all agree that educating people about trichotillomania is the best way to help those living with this secret. 

‘This disorder can have crippling effects on individuals and there needs to be better understanding and support.’
