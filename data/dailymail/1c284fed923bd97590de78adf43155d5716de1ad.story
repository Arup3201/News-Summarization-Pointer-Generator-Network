She is just one year away from her half century. But, as these photos from her glossy new beauty campaign prove, Courteney Cox is defying the ageing process.

The 49-year-old, who found fame as Monica Geller on cult show Friends, showed off shiny locks and radiant skin as she posed for her debut shoot for haircare brand Pantene.

And while she may be able to afford the most luxurious products, the actress has revealed the cheap and simple secrets to youth as nothing more than sleep and water.

Age defying: Courteney Cox, 49, looks young beyond her years in her latest beauty campaign for Pantene

Speaking about growing old, she said: 'It's a constant daily vicious battle trying to fight that clock.

'I think that people are always looking for something that is going to make them feel better about themselves as they age, and we have tons of creams that are out there.

'I'm all about trying to find the next beauty secret. I really do spend a lot of time trying products, I'm crazy for it.Â 

What's her secret? In a behind-the-scenes video, Courteney revealed that her secret to youth is 'boat loads of water and sleep'

Radiant: The former Friends star says she is constantly looking for ways to turn back the clock and is a product junkie

'But I would say the most important thing to do to keep up with time would be drink a boat load of water and sleep is imperative.'

She did, however, reveal that she has struggled with keeping her hair looking youthful and glossy over the years.

'One day I was on the set of my show and my hairdresser said: "Your hair is different, what are you using? I can't even get the comb through it" and I just said, "I'm using the same thing I've been using forever.

Giving it some oomph: Courteney says she worries about how her hair has been getting duller and thinner with age

'I thought it was really strange and started wondering if it was hormones.

'I wasn't aware that my hair was ageing but things were changing, it was getting duller, drier, thinner and more brittle,' she said.

As the new face of Pantene's Expert Collection Age Defy Range, Courteney naturally says she is a huge fan.

She said: 'There's so 
many things you can read about. There's books about exercise and staying 
young and fit - but no one ever talks about how to help your hair. I swear by Pantene's Age Defy range.

'The beauty secrets that are so important for me to pass on to my daughter now are to protect your skin from the sun, moisturise your skin and hair, and drink a lot of water,' she added.
