This is said to be the world's most expensive Starbucks coffee featuring 60 espresso shots and costing $55 (Â£33).

The Sexagintuple Vanilla Bean Mocha Frappuccino, which measures in at 128 ounces was ordered at a Starbucks in Texas, and is thought to hold the title of the company's most expensive drink ever.

The drink was bought by a customer only known as Andrew, who posted a picture of the giant coffee and the receipt on Twitter.

But even though the Frappuccino cost over $50, Andrew paid nothing for it as he is a gold member of the Starbucks loyalty programme.

The programme allows gold members to claim a free drink after every 12 that they buy, with apparently no stipulations on a limit.

This meant he was allowed to make the coffee as big as possible and knowing they wouldn't have a cup big enough, he even took his own glass with him to the shop.

Despite the almost $55 price tag, the customer, only known as Andrew, got the drink for free due to his loyalty membership

The drink topples last year's record, which saw a man purchase a 48-shot frappuccino, costing $47.

Andrew told the Consumerist: 'It took a few minutes to figure out all the math, but in the end, it took about 55 shots to get us over the $50 line, and we just rounded it up to 60 to make it easy.'

'I gotta say, it was delicious.'

However, he did concede he was unable to drink it all in one go.

A Frappuccino is an iced blended coffee, with the name being trademarked by Starbucks.
