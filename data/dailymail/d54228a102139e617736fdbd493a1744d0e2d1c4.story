They are noble Outback creatures, iconic of the Snowy River.

But a pair of Canberra men on a camping trip to Kosciuszko National Park last month were left stunned when they discovered a small band of starving brumbies feeding on another horse's flesh.

In the words of witness Dr Don Driscoll, the wild horses 'had turned to cannibalism'.

Noble creatures: Wild horses roam the outback.

Ecologists Dr Driscoll and Dr Sam Banks first noticed the dead horse, which had a huge hole in its abdomen, on the way up the hill from Dead Horse Gap, in the national park located between New South Wales and Victoria.

It's intestines appeared to have been nibbled out. It wasn't clear what  could have caused the damage.

'I had no idea what could've done that,' ecologist Dr Driscoll, from the Australian National University, told Daily Mail Australia.

But the culprits became clear the next day, as the campers headed back down the hill.

Three emaciated horses stood near the dead brumby. Two had shoved their snouts inside the fallen creature's abdominal cavity.

Walking away: The brumbies trotted away from the body after the researchers approached. 

Grim discovery: The campers discovered the horses eating the body on the way back from Ram's Head towards Dead Horse Gap. 

The animals were nibbling at the animal's digestive tract, Dr Driscoll told Daily Mail Australia. 

'They were biting at what was left of the insides... They were obviously starving.'  

Horses are herbivores, but Dr Driscoll supposed the horses had been pushed to the edge.

He said he witnessed one of the brumbies bite part of the cavity and pull it off. 

'It was obvious they were being pushed to eat the entrails of the dead horse...'

'I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures in the horse world.' 

The wild horses of the Snowy Mountains are 'denizens of the Australian psyche', Dr Driscoll said. 

In a piece for the academic website The Conversation, the scientists wrote: 'As far as we are aware, this behaviour has never been documented before. 

'The noble brumbies of the silver screen have been reduced to starving cannibals in Kosciuszko National Park.' 

Dr Driscoll said the number of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park was overwhelming.

The population in the Snowy Mountains has ballooned from an estimated 2369 in 2003 to 7679 in 2009. Their numbers were forecast to pass 13,000 in 2012. 

'I've never seen an environment so overwhelmed by feral animals,' he said. 

And while there is a horse management plan in place, which organises for excess animals to be shuttled away to new homes (or sometimes taken to the abbattoir), Dr Driscoll and Dr Banks argued it would be more humane to cull the creatures from helicopters. 

'It's really quite tragic, in that the only option to minimise suffering by horses is to shoot them from the air,' he said. 

'If you don't shoot them from the air then many more horses are going to suffer and die in the next ten years.' 

The Park's wild horse management plan is currently up for review.
