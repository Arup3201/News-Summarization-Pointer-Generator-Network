The mother of a two-year-old boy who was verbally abused by a Walmart customer for wearing a pink headband has been taken to a medical center after becoming stressed from receiving a barrage of threatening phone calls and emails. 

Kathleen Carpenter, who writes a blog under the name Katie Vyktoriah, told Polk County police the family had been inundated with threats since details of the incident were published.

After she reported the harassing calls over the weekend, the mother-of-two was taken to a hospital as she struggled to cope with the publicity, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Stress: Kathleen Carpenter told police she was struggling to cope with threatening phone calls

Concerned for her well-being, police arranged for Ms Carpenter to have a mental health assessment, under Florida's Baker's Act, according to 13 News.

As well as phone calls, the mother-of-two received more than 11,000 emails in response to her blog 
post, about an alleged incident at the Clermont Walmart.

In a police report Ms Carpenter told deputies 'that the attention obtained by her story and the negative 
comments and communications to her had become too much stress and she 
could not handle the situation ... anymore,' and was thinking of killing 
herself, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

In her original blog post, she explained that a man approached her son at the check out and knocked a pink hairband from his head, which he had been wearing after playing dress up.

She claimed the man then said: 'Your son is a f****** f****t. 
He'll get shot for it one day,' before walking off and leaving Ms Carpenter shaking as she tried to comfort her son.

However, some people doubted her story and questioned her decision to not press charges.

The
31-year-old has since closed her blog and Twitter account and, in a 
Facebook post seen by News 13, she said: 'I a going to be offline for 
the next while until all of this is resolved,'

She added that she had been advised by police not to discuss the incident further now that it was under investigation.

Lake County police are investigating the alleged incident in Walmart, which Ms Carpenter said happened in Clermont.

In
her blog, she explained how she confronted a stranger who had knocked 
the headband from her son and told him: 'You'll thank me one day 
little man.'

Ms Carpenter 
said in her blog that her son just enjoyed playing dress up, and added 
that two-year-old children did not have any sexuality.

The Lake County Sheriff's Office is trying to obtain surveillance video from the Walmart to 
verify if the incident did occur.

A
case for harassing communication has also been started in response to 
the barrage of emails Ms Carpenter received after her story was 
publicized.
