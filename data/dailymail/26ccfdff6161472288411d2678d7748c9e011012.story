This is the first picture of a mother and her six-year-old son who were brutally stabbed to death in their seaside home.

Lisa Clay, 41, and Joseph Chadwick, were both found dead when police broke into their semi-detached dormer bungalow yesterday morning.

The little boy was found knifed to death in his upstairs bedroom while his 41-year-old mother was lying dead downstairs.

Victims: Lisa Clay, 41, and her six-year-old son Joesph Chadwick were discovered stabbed to death in the property in Bolton-le-Sands

Police sources said the house in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashie, was a scene of carnage with both victims suffering a sustained and frenzied knife attack.

A home office post mortem examination carried out last night revealed that they both died as a result of multiple stab wounds.

A 34-year-old man, believed to be the father of the child and the woman’s partner, was found with serious knife wounds.

He was arrested on suspicion of murder
and was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital where his condition is 
described as serious. Detectives have been unable to interview him because of his injuries.

Police said they were confronted with a 'distressing scene' as they entered the property around 11.40am yesterday following a call from a concerned member of the family.

A cordon remained in place at the house as forensic scene of crime experts continued working inside the property.

Neighbours said the family had moved in only a matter of weeks ago and are thought to be originally from Morecambe, Lancashire.

It is understood they were refurbishing the property and carrying out other maintenance in recent days.

Detective Superintendent Paul Withers 
said: ‘This is a murder inquiry, but we are not looking for anybody else
in connection with the investigation.

‘It was a very distressing scene. The 
deceased people have been attacked with a knife. I can only imagine the 
stress the family is going through.’

Neighbours reported seeing the downstairs lights on in the dormer bungalow into the early hours of Tuesday morning.

They said they were stunned and shocked that a brutal double murder could occur in a sleepy residential street.

Peter Hammersley, 46, a Tesco night 
manager, said: ‘You don’t think anything like this could happen in 
Bolton-le-Sands – anywhere but here. It is such a nice quiet place to 
live.

‘You just never know what kind of 
stress people are living under. It is such a shame for the family and 
everybody around here is in shock.’

Another neighbour, who didn’t want to
be named, said: ‘I’m horrified by what’s happened. Whatever went on, 
no-one deserves to be killed. What on earth did that little six-year-old
boy do to deserve that?’

Another local resident said: ‘I think
they had only just moved in to the house in the past couple of weeks. 
The only thing I noticed which was odd, was that when I got up in the 
middle of the night, their downstairs lights were always on, even at 
4am.’
