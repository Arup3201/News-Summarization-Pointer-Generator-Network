A storm with a 2,000-mile footprint threatened to frustrate Christmas travelers from Texas to Nova Scotia with a mix of freezing rain, ice and snow, flooding, thunderstorms and possibly some tornadoes.

Some of the millions of people hitting the roads and airports Saturday squeaked through before any major weather hit, but as the afternoon wore on some cancellations and delays started to mount at major aviation hubs.

Forecasters said roads that are passable one minute could become treacherous the next as a cold blast on the back end of the storm turns rain to ice and snow.

Winter Wonderland: Ice storms were expected to wreak havoc on travel in Midwestern states

Winter Storm Gemini is the seventh named storm of the year

Whiteout? Freezing rain on Friday morning snarled traffic and forced some school closures in Michigan and Wisconsin. The states were bracing for significant snow, sleet and ice

Making it harder for forecasters to 
stay a step ahead, the system, dubbed 'Gemini,' was a weird swirl of wintry and 
spring-like weather as it passed over areas in the Midwest with freezing
 temperatures and places like Nashville, where it could surpass 70 
degrees.

Temperatures in New York City are also expected to approach the 70-degree mark Sunday, but by tomorrow night, the storm systems 
will be hammering the East Coast.

Some New England and mid-Atlantic 
states could see rare winter thunderstorms.

‘This
 is a particularly strong storm with very warm, near record-breaking 
temperatures in the East and very cold air in the Midwest, and that 
contrast is the sort of conditions that are favorable for not only 
winter weather but also tornadoes,’ said National Weather Service 
meteorologist Ed Danaher in College Park, Maryland.

The
 worst of the storm was expected to hit Midwest population centers this 
evening, giving some travelers a window at the start of the holiday rush
 to get through airports and along highways with little disruption.

Flight cancellations were creeping up above 400 around the country, according to aviation tracking website FlightAware.com, and there were more than 1,000 flight delays. 

Most
 of the disruptions were affecting flights in and out of major hubs like
 O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, though the weather there was 
not yet nasty.

Other major airports being affected Saturday afternoon included Dallas/Fort Worth International and Denver International.

It's bad timing for the estimated 94.5million Americans planning to travel by road or air during this holiday season, which runs from Saturday through January 1, and those hitting the roads for some last-minute shopping.

The storm had several bands of strikingly different weather.

In the Upper Midwest, forecasters expected 6-8 inches of snow north and west of Chicago and into Wisconsin.

It
 was already bringing significant ice accumulations to Oklahoma, 
southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, splitting trees and snapping 
power lines. That was expected to change over to snow by Saturday night.

Parts
 of Maine could get more than a half-inch coating of ice, which would 
make roads treacherous and cause widespread power outages.

‘The
 best advice for everyone is just to really pay attention. With every 
few hours, we're going to get better information,’ Maine Emergency 
Management Agency spokeswoman Lynnette Miller said Friday.

The
 weather service issued a flash flood watch from Arkansas northeastward 
through parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with up to 4 
inches of rain projected.

With
 falling temperatures, some of that could be freezing rain by Saturday 
night in the St. Louis area, weather service meteorologist Jon Carney 
said.

In Indiana, the 
National Weather Service posted flood warnings along southern and 
central Indiana streams and predicted the highest flood crests along the
 East Fork of the White River since April 2011.

While
 the Midwest and Plains were preparing for ice and snow, residents down 
South were concerned about tornadoes, which forecasters said were 
possible this weekend even though they are uncommon this time of year - 
but not unheard of.

A tornado outbreak on Christmas Day 2012 reached from northeastern Texas through central Alabama - one twister hit Mobile, Ala.

A tornado on December 16, 2000, killed 11 people in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

The area most threatened stretched from central and northeastern Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and southeast Missouri, where 80 mph wind gusts and flash flooding were possible.

Rain and ice in Oklahoma were blamed for two fatal traffic accidents and thousands of power outages. A 16-year-old boy died early Saturday after his car crashed and overturned on U.S. 64 near Tulsa, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

And Oklahoma City police said a woman was killed Friday night in a collision on a slick roadway.

Forecasters said up to a half-inch of ice could accumulate across the middle of the state.

A woman sleeping in a hotel in Holland in western Michigan was injured when a motorist lost control of his car on an icy street early Friday and slammed into the wall outside her room, MLive.com reported.

The weather wasn't the only headache maker. A baggage-equipment breakdown lasted for hours at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, creating a backed-up line of travelers that stretched onto the sidewalk outside one of the terminals.

If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter said.

‘When a holiday falls on a Wednesday it gives travelers more flexibility of either leaving the weekend before, or traveling right before the holiday and extending the trip through the following weekend,’ Hunter said.
