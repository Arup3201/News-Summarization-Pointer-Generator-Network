'Unprecedented' pressures on staff in A&E mean for the 15th successive week the four-hour waiting time was missed across England.

But while crisis grips the NHS, the latest figures do offer a glimmer of hope, with a slight improvement on the previous week's performance. 

Emergency departments in England saw 89.8 per cent of patients within four hours in the week ending January 11 - short of the 95 per cent target. 

The gold standard was last achieved the week ending September 28, 2014.

But the figures, released today by NHS England, do show a step in the right direction.

The previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending A&E were seen within four hours.

Experts say it is a further sign of the 'unprecedented' pressures facing the health service this winter.

Ambulances queuing outside A&Es has become an all to familiar sight as 'unprecedented' pressures grip the NHS with the latest figures showing the four-hour waiting time was missed again for the week ending January 11, with just 89.8 per cent of patients seen within that time - short of the 95 per cent target

On January 6, NHS England revealed from October to December last year waiting times reached their worst levels since the 95 per cent target was introduced in 2004.

In that time just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four-hour target window. 

Dame Barbara Hakin, NHS England's national director of commissioning operations, said: 'We continue to see and treat the vast majority of patients in England within four hours, and performance improved this past week.

'Although we have seen a slight easing in the number of attendances and emergency admissions to A&E, the NHS continues to face unprecedented pressures on its front line services - particularly A&E, NHS 111 and ambulance services.

'In light of the latest weather warnings across the country, we would urge people - particularly the elderly - to stay in the warm, ensure they have proper medication, get their flu jab if they have not yet done so, and seek advice from their pharmacist or their GPs for colds, coughs and minor ailments.' 

In the week ending January 11, 389,377 people attended emergency departments in England, down from 407,239 patients the previous week.

But an increase of around 6,000 patients from the same week 12 months ago. 

Of those, 39, 705 people had to wait longer than four hours to be seen, down from 53,681.

There were also high levels of emergency admissions, with a total of 105,200 - up 3,400 on the same week last year.

The number of patients waiting more than four hours for admission after attending an A&E unit was 11,980, down from 16,324 in the previous week.

The latest figures show that on average more than 4,000 hospital beds a day were occupied by patients whose discharge was delayed, the highest point this year and worse than at any point last winter.

The NHS 111 service took 255,000 calls for the week ending January 11, down from 323,000 the previous week and a dramatic reduction from the peak of 439,000 for the week ending December 28.

Figures released on January 6 revealed from October to December 2014 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target and the longest waits since the target was introduced 

The latest weekly figures comes as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published draft guidance for the number of nurses that should be on duty in A&E units.

The organisation said there should be enough nursing staff on duty to have one nurse for every four cubicles but two registered nurses to one patient in cases of major trauma or cardiac arrest,

There should also be a registered children's nurse on each shift, or at least one A&E nurse with education and training in children's nursing.

Because demand in A&E can change rapidly, the guidelines recommend that departments, in planning, should allow for enough nursing staff to care for higher than the average number of patients who attend the department on a daily basis.

By increasing weekly nursing staff hours to cover above-average attendance numbers, staff can deal with unexpected peaks in the demand for services and be moved around the department flexibly to respond to changing situations.

The chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said thousands more staff should be recruited for A&E departments.

Dr Peter Carter told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The reality on the ground is even if these guidelines are implemented, which we hope they will be, we are a long way from having the requisite number of staff in many A&E departments. 

'Not all, but there is certainly a significant number of A&E departments that are woefully short of the requisite number of nursing staff that they currently need.'

He added that RCN analysis due to be published shortly will 'demonstrate that you will still need to recruit several thousand nurses across the country in A&E departments' to meet the guidelines, which would inevitably require staff to be brought in from overseas.

Professor Mark Baker of Nice said the organisation was 'not absolutely sure at the moment' how many hospitals already complied with the draft guidance.

'The six experts who have been helping us and advising our committee on A&E staffing suggest that the recommendations we have got for the deployment of staff within the department are in common practice,' he told Today.

He said that better planning and 'anticipatory' recruitment would reduce the dependency on agency staff, potentially balancing out any cost to the NHS.

'If you plan to staff your departments at average demand, you will be understaffed half of the time,' he said.

'What we are proposing is that managers should plan to staff their departments so that they are only short of staff, on the random variation of demands on A&E, one day a week and that will reduce the dependency on agency staff.

'So even though there will be more staff available, it won't cost the service more.'

The target: The Government wants 95 per cent of patients to be transferred, admitted or discharged within four hours of arriving at accident and emergency departments

The challenge: There were 5,573,644 attendances at A&E departments across England in the October to December 2014 quarter, up from 5,294,269 during the corresponding period in 2013

Record-long waits: The four-hour rule was met for 92.6 per cent of English A&E patients this quarter - the poorest showing in a decade - down from 95.6 per cent during the corresponding period in 2013

Where people waited: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in East Anglia had 75.2 per cent of its A&E patients in and out of the department within four hours this quarter, compared with 79 per cent of emergency department patients at Medway NHS Foundation Trust hospitals in England's South East and 79.1 per cent of A&E attendees seen by Hull And East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust

The biggest blow-out: The University Hospitals Of North Midlands NHS Trust had 100 emergency patients who waited more than 12 hours to be admitted once the decision to admit them was made

The toughest week: Across England in the last week before Christmas - the week ending on January 4, 2015 - only 86 per cent of emergency patients were dealt with within the recommended four-hour window.

An investigation has been launched after a cyclist died the morning after she was sent home from hospital, having suffered a head injury.

The 52-year-old woman was taken to Cheltenham General Hospital on Tuesday, after being found on a street in the town.

The hospital was facing its tenth day of special internal emergency measures, implemented amid rising pressures with surging demand and a lack of beds. 

The measures give hospital bosses extra powers to call in staff and decline to treat patients, cancel or postpone operations or transfer patients out of the hospital.

The emergency plans also applied to Cheltenham's sister hospital, Gloucestershire Royal in Gloucester, and lasted from Sunday, January 4 until Wednesday. 

The woman was treated for a head injury in the hospital's emergency department, and discharged later the same day.

Cheltenham General was placed intitiated special emergency measures on January 4 until Wednesday after seeing a surge in patients and increase in pressures

But paramedics were called to her home on Wednesday, and she later died.

Two separate investigations are now underway, the first a police inquiry into what caused the woman to suffer the injuries on her bike.

And the second is a formal inquest into her death, which is set to take place next week. 

A spokesman for the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust said it was too early to confirm whether a third internal inquiry into the woman's care on Tuesday within the hospital would also take place. 

The emergency measures the hospitals were under at the time may have made absolutely no difference to the care the woman received, the decision to discharge her the same day and the ultimate tragic outcome.

He said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the woman's death, or comment on any aspect of her care or treatment, in advance of the post-mortem and any inquest process.

'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family at what must be a terribly difficult time,' he added. 

Hospital bosses in Cheltenham and Gloucester said that they had not yet calculated exactly how many routine operations were cancelled over the ten-day emergency measures period, or how long it would take a backlog of what could be hundreds of postponed appointments.

Dr Sean Elyan, the trust's medical director, said even though the emergency measures status had been ended, the two hospitals were still under 'significant pressure'.

'While the hospitals have been stood down and its status level reduced, they are still under significant pressure and this is likely to continue during the winter weeks ahead,' he said. 'Therefore we would advise the public to access A&E only if they have life threatening or serious injuries.

'Throughout this extremely challenging period we've continued to provide treatment to those patients who really needed acute, emergency or critical care.

'Ensuring that level of care was provided could only have been made possible through the commitment and dedication of our staff here at the hospitals and also from our partners across health and social care. Their response in extremely challenging circumstances has been really exceptional.

'Finally, I do want to apologise to patients who have had their planned surgery postponed. That's not a decision we take lightly and it is a last resort. We would like to reassure those patients that we will be doing everything that we possibly can to rearrange their appointments as soon as possible either with us or an alternative provider,' he added.
