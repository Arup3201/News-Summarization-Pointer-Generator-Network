Thirteen schoolchildren aged four and five were taken to hospital after they started ‘vomiting violently’ and having trouble breathing during a swimming lesson.

One mother said she arrived at Gateway School in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, to see ‘four ambulances surrounding a coach’.

A teacher told her a number of children were ‘vomiting violently’ within minutes of beginning the class at Chesham Leisure Centre.

‘They took a decision to get them off site as quickly as possible and got them back to school where they had ambulances waiting,’ said the mother.

‘For many, it was their first swimming lesson.’ All were discharged, but their parents are furious. ‘We’re so cross as we are not getting any answers,’ said another mother.

‘There has been no confirmation about what was in the water.’ Greenwich Leisure Limited, which runs the centre, apologised.

‘Water circulation in the pools failed to restart after a planned power-cut… which resulted in a strong smell in the pool area,’ it said.
