No more 'tinnies': The use of Australian slang, which was aided by Dame Edna Everage (pictured), is in decline in Britain, according to linguistic experts

Hello possums! If you are enjoying a barbie with a few tinnies while wearing your sunnies, you are hopelessly out of date.

Australian slang has fallen out of fashion, experts fear.

They say that a new generation of Aussies is coining fewer words of their own and borrowing more from abroad.

The decline of the backpacker also means that less of the lingo is making its way around the world.

The warning comes from Tony Thorne, a linguist at Kings College London and author of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang.

While the latest edition of the dictionary still contains many long-standing colourful terms, there are just three new additions from Down Under.

And two of these are just old words that have come back into common usage.

Mr Thorne said that Australian slang first began to take off in the late 19th century, aided by the rich dialects of settlers from Scotland, Ireland and London’s East End.

He told the BBC: ‘Those people weren’t hampered by the upper-class cultures of the UK. 

'They were much more free to play with language, creating nicknames for local things, in a way that buttoned-up Brits in those days weren’t able to do.’

Australia’s convict past also played a role, with slang, even today, still being popular with prisoners and those who want to keep their conversations private.

But it was in the 1960s and 70s that Australian slang really took off, aided and abetted by the popularity of Dame Edna Everage and other characters created by comedian Barry Humphries.

Hugely popular Australian soap operas also helped spread the world.

John Hajek, a professor in linguistics at Melbourne University, said: ‘There was certainly a huge shift in attitude towards Australian English in the UK as a result of Neighbours.

‘It exposed the British to a much wider variety of Australian accents and terminology. "Rack off" [Get lost]. "Daggy" [naff/uncool].

Soap influence: John Hajek, a professor of linguistics at Melbourne University, said Kylie's role in Neighbours was partly to blame for the increasing use of phrases such as 'Rack Off' [get lost]

‘Good old Kylie Minogue certainly exaggerated her Australian accent as Charlene, which is partly what made her so popular.’

But Australia today is much more business-like, and the language used reflects this.

Americanisms are being embraced and young people are latching onto words and phrases from social media, rather than creating their own words.

But there is one exception, ‘selfie’, the term for self-photographs, is believed to have originated in Australia.

Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was ridiculed when he said that a question whether enough women were promoted was a ‘fair shake of the sauce bottle’ meaning fair enough. His critics claimed his attempts to appear to be a man of the people by using Aussie slang were insincere.
