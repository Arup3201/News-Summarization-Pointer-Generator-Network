The grieving father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne was tormented by the killer of Milly Dowler after befriending him at their local pub at the height of his killing spree, it has been reported.

Unsuspecting Michael Payne, who died last week aged 45 after struggling with alcoholism, became a neighbour of serial killer Levi Bellfield, who murdered Milly, as well as Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange.

According to Mr Payne's mother Cynthia, Bellfield then befriended her son in the Ashley Park pub in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey and targeted him during weekly drinking sessions.

It is thought that Mr Payne only found out the truth about his drinking partner when police taped off Bellfield's flat and arrested him in 2004, leaving him devastated that the man he befriended was a killer.

The Sun on Sunday also reports that when police searched Bellfield's flat, they found a stash a newspaper cuttings about Sarah's murder.

Mr Payne's brother, Keith 53, told the newspaper: 'It is sick what he did. I am sure Bellfield knew exactly who Mike was and targeted him.

'Why I don't know. What can you say? Evil - that's all. 

'Bellfield claimed he was friends with the Paynes and boasted about it. Everybody was devastated as he wasn't friends with us at all. Michael and Sara were shocked. It was disgusting. He was trying to grab attention.'

Mr Payne moved to Walton-on-Thames following his split from Sarah's mother Sara, and lived near the railway station where Milly was last seen in 2002. 

 Bellfield was told in 2011 that he would die behind bars for the murder of the 13-year-old in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, nine years earlier.

He was already serving a whole life term handed down in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell.

Last week Mr Payne died alone in his armchair after being driven to drink and despair by the death of his daughter.

It is thought he struggled to cope after the abduction of his eight-year-old daughter in July 2000, and was found dead at home in Maidstone, Kent, by police on Monday.

His brother Alan, 47, believes 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah' and their father Terrance, 72, says his son was tortured by 'the fact he wasn't there to protect her'.

Michael's schoolgirl daughter was snatched by paedophile Roy Whiting from a field near her grandparents' home in West Sussex, where she was playing with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte.

Mr Payne spoke of his battle with depression in the aftermath of the ordeal, when he suffered recurring nightmares and used alcohol to cope with her death.

He and wife Sara ended their 18-year marriage three years after the disappearance and both blamed the 'overwhelming' strains of coping with their tragic loss.

Michael's father Terrance said: 'He turned to drink because of what happened, for the fact he wasn't there to protect her.

'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this.

He added: 'I hadn't spoken to him since the last Friday of September. I had agreed to speak to him the next week but there was no answer.

'I kept calling and leaving answerphone messages but never heard anything.

'Eventually the phone was cut off, so we knew something was wrong and we called the police.

'The police broke their way into his flat, and found him sitting there in his chair. We don't know exactly what he died of, but we think it was drink-related'.

Sarah's mother, Sara, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law.

She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work and told recently how it had given her 'much-needed focus' amid the grief and her severe post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mrs Payne also suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick.
