Murder-accused Shrien Dewani told his new bride their relationship was 'not natural' and he was 'forcing' himself to be with her just five days after their wedding, intimate emails between the newlyweds reveal.

Anni, who was 28 when she was shot to death in South Africa in 2010, threatened to walk out on him before their ill-fated honeymoon after he told her he regretted their marriage, his murder trial heard.

The Swedish engineer sent two scathing late-night messages to bisexual Dewani, 34, just a week before her murder following his frank admissions which left her feeling hurt, confused and unable to sleep.

'Just because we had a Bollywood wedding, it doesn't mean we are Bollywood actors': An e-mail from murdered Anni Dewani to her husband Shrien shows she was willing to leave the relationship, a court heard

Troubled: In the email Anni states: 'You've hurt me a lot by this and I'm ready to pack and leave. This is not a joke. I can't sleep at night'

Shrien wrote back: 'I love you. You know that. Surely, this is what is the most important thing. The rest will just come'

Shrien's response: The 28-year-old expresses serious concerns over the state of the marriage

'Because we had a bollywood wedding doesn't mean we r bollywood actors and just pretending that everything is good when it isn't will just end up with us hating each other,' the 28 year-old wrote on 5 November 2010.

In another email, composed in her third language, the Swede asked: 'Seriously, do you want me to leave you? Its very mean of you to tell me these things that you told me just after marriage then you should have told me this before!!!

'I don't want an insecure man or a man that feelings doesn't (sic) come natural that you have to force yourself.

'Never expected things like that from you. Never expected things like that from you but now I want you to tell me exactly how u feel and honestly, u hurt me a lot by this and iam ready to pack and leave and this is not a joke! I can't even sleep at night.' 

Dewani, left, is on trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his new wife Anni, right, on their honeymoon

The correspondence was extracted from Dewani's phone by police a month after Mrs Dewani was killed in a township carjacking during her South African honeymoon, the Western Cape High Court heard.

They were read into the record by Captain Paul Hendrickse whose investigation into the  bride's death concluded that her husband of two weeks was the mastermind of her cold-blooded murder.

Dewani's emailed response to his wife's outpourings was handed to Judge Jeanette Traverso by defence barrister Francois van Zyl. In contrast to his wife's excitable tones, Dewani's reply was curt, rebutting her concerns in numerical order – number two being the most revealing.

'When I said it was not natural and was forcing myself – we were talking about not feeling happy. Not that I was forcing myself to be with you,' he wrote, nearly four hours after his wife's two-part screed.

The accused took copious notes during the testimony of Captain Hendrickse

'They are very different comments and seriously you cannot just take a meaning that you want. 

'You need to listen to what I meant.'

Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Zola Tongo to organise a fake carjacking as a cover for his wife's murder at the hands of two gunmen during their trip to Cape Town, exactly four years ago.

Capt Hendrickse told the court he had been assigned to investigating Mrs Dewani's murder shortly after her body was discovered, with a fatal gun shot wound to her neck, in the back of Tongo's taxi.

He formally interviewed Dewani 48 hours after he and Tongo had been freed unharmed from the ambush which claimed his wife's life and it was during that interview that the grieving husband's story began to unravel.

Basic details from the first-hand account of the carjacking given to police by Dewani in the hours after the incident were then changed in his later statement, the court heard.

Dewani told a new story about the location of the two gun men at the point they confronted the taxi carrying the newylweds, changed the number of guns the men were carrying and what valuables were stolen in the terrifying ordeal .

In his first account to police, Dewani had described pleading for his bride's life in return for the weddings rings he handed over.

The following morning, he had phoned Capt Hendrickse to tell him exactly where officers should look for his wife's £25,000 engagement ring - 'in the stitching' in one of the taxi's car seats, the court heard.

The detective said he was'a bit confused because Dewani told me specifically where to find the ring, after he said [in his statement] that he gave the rings to the attackers.'

After being confronted by the detective with the contradictory versions, Dewani 'became uneasy with the question and began pacing up and down my office and then gave me that explanation,' Capt Hendrickse said.

The body language between Dewani and his family was noticeably tense as the policeman gave his testimony - during which Dewani took copious notes which he passed over the dock to his brother Preyen, who has sat with the defence team since the start of the trial last month.

Capt Hendrickse told the court that by the time Tongo was in custody, Dewani had returned to England but kept in touch with the officer to check on the investigation's progress. During one call to the detective, he learned of Tongo's arrest.

'The accused was somewhat surprised that I had arrested the taxi driver,' the detective said. The following day, he was contacted by a lawyer, acting for Dewani, who wanted to know 'whether her client had been implicated in any way.'

The policeman said that Dewani had failed to mention a number of vital facts during the hunt for his wife's killers, which would have entirely changed the direction of their inquiry.

Most significantly, Dewani had not revealed that he had put R8,000 (£500) in his wife's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking - or that it was payment for a surprise helicopter ride that he had asked Tongo to arrange.

Dewani did not reveal to police that he had put R8,000 (£500) in his wife's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking

It was only at the opening of his trial, that the helicopter trip was raised for the first time by Dewani as the cover for the secret meetings, phone calls and text messages between him and Tongo, and the cash the couple was carrying on the night of his wife's murder.

'If that explanation had been given to me, Mr Tongo would automatically have become a suspect,' Capt Hendrickse told the court.

'It would have created a motive for what transpired. I did not have any of those facts available.

'There would have been a motive for Tongo to have robbed Mr Dewani.'

He dismissed Dewani's explanation as 'a newly-fabricated story'.

After the lunch break, during cross-examination Mr van Zyl revealed that he had spoken to Tanya Lochner, the lawyer first instructed by Dewani in the wake of Tongo's arrest.

The barrister put it to Capt Hendrickse that he had told Ms Lochner outside an earlier hearing dealing with the cases of Tongo and hit man Mziwamadoda Qwabe, that Mrs Dewani had been shot in error.

'She told me that you said they [hitmen] did not mean to shoot her. They only shot her because she wouldn't stop screaming,' Mr van Zyl said to the officer, who said he could not recall the exchange.

Mr van Zyl also summed up his client's contribution to the fiery email exchange as, 'Shrien says he loves Anni', referring to bullet point number three of his e-mail.

'I love you. You know that. Surely this is the most important thing. The rest will just come,' it read.

Intriguingly, the two-page print out of the correspondence revealed that it was an innocuous – if impersonal – message from Dewani, which was obviously followed by a more intimate confession in person - that triggered her fervent reply.

In a stark list – under the subject: Things to get ready – Dewani offers his wife of five days a list of six items to pack – five of them electronic.

Passports, your laptop, laptop charger, camera, camera charger, camera memory card.

Mr van Zyl told the court: 'The accused will say that they had a discussion when they were in a hotel in Bristol. He said how he felt and she didn't like it.'

Dewani denies five charges including murder and robbery. The trial continues.
