The RSPCA risks becoming a ‘political prosecutor’ rather than an animal welfare organisation, a senior Tory warned yesterday.

Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general, said the costs of a recent case involving David Cameron’s local hunt were far too high.

And he called for the charity’s cases to be taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service.

MPs clashed over the the Heythrop hunt, which Prime Minister David Cameron has ridden with, after it was the subject of a £327,000 private prosecution by the RSPCA

The RSPCA prosecuted the Heythrop hunt
in Oxfordshire last year at a cost of £327,000 following covert 
filming. The hunt was fined £4,000 after admitting four offences.

Although
two of its members pleaded guilty and were fined, their supporters 
claimed the case was politically motivated to target the Prime Minister.

‘If they continue to prosecute at such
huge expense in such a disproportionate way, they will be open to 
public criticism... by the judge, as they were, or by MPs, or by 
ordinary members of the public,’ Sir Edward said.

Speaking at a Westminster debate, he said the CPS would be more dispassionate.

He added: ‘This is not to say the 
RSPCA should not investigate, but it needs to be careful that it does 
not move away from being an animal welfare organisation and become a 
political campaigner, using the state prosecuting system as a weapon.’

The well-attended debate was triggered by Tory MP Simon Hart, a former head of the Countryside Alliance.

Former solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier warned the RSPCA would face more 'public criticism' if it pursued cases against hunts

He claims that the charity is pursing 
an ‘aggressive political agenda’ against pet owners which is ‘at odds 
with animal welfare’.

Pointedly avoiding the subject of 
hunting, Mr Hart called for ‘absolute clarity and accountability’ about 
the charity’s role as a prosecutor.

He said it pursued only ‘tantalising’ cases and that some defendants pleaded guilty because they feared crippling legal costs.

But Dominic Grieve, speaking for the 
Government, told MPs the charity had the right to bring private 
prosecutions and that it performed a ‘valuable role’ bringing cruelty 
cases which might otherwise go unprosecuted.

The Attorney General said the Crown 
Prosecution Service had the power to take over RSPCA cases, or stop them
if they do not meet standards for evidence or public interest.

Mr Grieve said this had happened in only four of the thousands of cases the charity has brought.

The RSPCA says it spends £5million a 
year prosecuting cruelty cases, which it insists accounts for just 5p in
every pound donated.

It said the prosecutions department was independent of its campaigning work and that it had a 98 per cent success rate in cases.

Mr Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and 
South Pembrokeshire, said the RSPCA was ‘not an arm of the law’ and 
claimed its relationship with police in offering to investigate such 
cases was ‘deeply troubling and part of the problem’.

But Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport 
West, accused Mr Hart of representing the ‘hunting lobby’ and trying to 
help ‘rich, powerful Tories’ break the law.

Cheryl Gillan, until recently Mr 
Cameron’s Welsh Secretary, praised a £2.3million prosecution that the 
RSPCA brought in her Buckinghamshire constituency.
