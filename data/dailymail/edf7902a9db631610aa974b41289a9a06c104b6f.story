Murder victim: Kieran McGrath was shot at several times and hit once in the chest as he left the pub

Detectives investigating the murder of a 26-year-old man who collapsed outside a police station released a CCTV image today of the 'killers' on a stolen motorbike moments before he was shot.

Kieran McGrath, of Clayton, Manchester, was shot at several times and hit once in the chest as he left the Sheldon Arms pub in nearby Ashton-under-Lyne on Saturday night.

Mr McGrath managed to stagger into a white Audi A3 and drive about a mile to a police station in Ashton. He collapsed and died outside the front door despite efforts to revive him there.

Greater Manchester Police have now arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of murder, and detectives have released an image of the motorbike used by the alleged hitmen.

It was captured on CCTV at the rear of the pub where it allegedly parked up for about five minutes before riding to the front to carry out the hit. It shows a rider and a pillion passenger.

After the shooting, the Suzuki sped towards the M60 and then two junctions clockwise before heading towards Blackley. It was later found burned out at Boggart Hole Clough park.

Police are now trying to trace the driver and/or rider’s movements after abandoning the bike.

Dectective Chief Inspector Terry Crompton said: ‘From our inquiries, we know the motorbike was stolen from the Stockport area in June, 2013, and believe it was used in the shooting.

‘The bike was found burnt out near to a pathway in Boggart Hole Clough on Tuesday afternoon and after studying CCTV, we have found images of two people riding the bike near to Charlestown Investigation: Road.

‘I would ask anyone who may have information on the 600cc Suzuki Bandit from it being stolen last year, being seen on Saturday night at the Sheldon Arms and its discovery, to contact us. Did you see two people riding a similar bike between 9pm and 10.30pm?’

He added: ‘We believe the offenders have shot Kieran at the pub and then sped off directly to Boggart Hole Clough before setting fire to the Suzuki. We are also keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the bike being dumped or two people wearing or carrying helmets as they left.

‘Were you in the area at around 10.30pm and did you see anything out of the ordinary? If you did, no matter how insignificant you may feel what you saw is, we would like to talk to you. The information you supply will be treated with the strictest of confidence.’
