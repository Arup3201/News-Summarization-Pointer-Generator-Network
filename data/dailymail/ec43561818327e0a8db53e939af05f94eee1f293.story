A 77-year-old woman died after doctors misdiagnosed her blood clot as norovirus and sent her home twice, according to her partner.

George Andrews, 69, claimed his partner Jean Graham died the night after Glasgow Royal Infirmary sent after she had been admitted for the second time.

He said that doctors failed to recognise the clot in her bowel, and said she had nothing but the winter vomiting bug.

Misdiagnosed: Jean Graham, who died in January from a blood clot, with her partner George Andrews

The father-of-two said he is seeking compensation for medical negligence after NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde apologised for the incident, which took place in January.

On two consecutive weekends, Ms Graham was taken into the hospital's A&E from their home in Dennistoun, Glasgow.

Mr Andrews said: 'We put our trust in the NHS and they let us down. No one should go through what happened to Jean.

Ms Graham, who had a heart condition, started feeling unwell on the evening of January 5.

Delay: Ms Graham had to wait for several hours to be seen each time she was admitted to hospital, her partner said

Mr Andrews, a former engineer, said his partner's condition deteriorated, and when she began to have severe diarrhoea, he had called for an ambulance.

Mr Andrews said his partner waited for five hours before seeing a doctor, and says that she was kept on a trolley for all that time.

After she was eventually seen, doctors sent her home, but over the next 18 hours her condition continued to worsen.

On Sunday afternoon, Mr Andrews said, he phoned NHS 24.

He said a GP was sent to their home who insisted that Ms Graham was sent back to hospital after he spotted that she was passing bood.

But Mr Andrews claims that she still waited five hours on a trolley to be seen - before being sent home again after a doctor told her to 'go home and take fluids'.

The next day, Mr Andrews said, his partner started screaming that she had lost the use of her legs and he had to carry her up to the bathroom.

Again they phoned an ambulance, Mr Andrews said.

He said: 'This time they agreed it was serious and kept her in - but she was still not put in a ward and ended up in a trolley.

'By the next morning she was scanned and diagnosed with a blood clot on her bowel. By that stage she was too weak to even sign the consent form.

'She never made it out of surgery and died on Tuesday morning.

'They should never have sent her home. We both felt utterly abandoned.

'Now I want justice for Jean. A dog wouldn't have been treated so badly.'

Margaret Watt of Scotland's Patient Association said: 'This horrific case shows the dire consequences when our patients are ignored and A&E is stretched to its limit at weekends and Christmas time.

Mr Andrews's lawyer Cameron Fyfe said 
that Mr Graham was pursuing a claim against the health board and said: 
'There may have been negligence on the part of the hospital in 
discharging Jean on the Sunday when it seemed clear to George that she 
was seriously ill.'

A 
spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'We'd like to once 
again express our sincere condolences to Mr Andrews for his loss.

'We met with Mr Andrews early this year to discuss his concerns about the care his partner received.

Compensation: Mr Andrews said he felt failed by medical services

'We fully accept that there were lessons to be learned, in particular, the need to improve communication between clinicians in relation to the issue of the patient's previous presentations.'

Last Friday new figures showed Scottish hospital staffing levels plunged dramatically at the weekend, prompting calls from Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont for a full-scale review of the numbers of doctors and nurses on call at weekend.

The figures showed staffing levels at three of Scotland's 14 health boards drop from 18,000 to just over 5,000 at weekends.

Fife had only seven consultants on duty at the weekend compared with 210 from Monday to Friday.

Forth Valley had 3,398 staff on weekdays and 1,256 at weekends, and Lothian's weekend workforce was 3,063 compared with 11,200 during the week.
