A woman whose childhood rapes by her uncle were captured on camera and widely traded on the internet wants the Supreme Court to make it easier for victims of child pornography to collect money from people who view the brutal images on their computers.

Doyle Randall Paroline, 48, is being sued by a woman for looking at child pornography of her being raped as a child by her uncle

The case being argued at the Supreme Court on Wednesday involves a Texas man who pleaded guilty to having images of children engaged in sex acts on his computer.

Doyle Randall Paroline, 48, of Brownsboro, Texas, is appealing an order holding him responsible for the full amount of losses, nearly $3.4 million, suffered by the woman known as Amy.Â 

Paroline was arrested in 2009 after an employee at a computer company found sexually explicit images of minors on his computer.

Of the 150-300 incriminating images found on Paroline's computer, just two were of Amy.

Paroline pleaded guilty and received a 24-month prison sentence, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

Amy,
 now her early 20s and living in Pennsylvania, was a child when her 
uncle sexually abused her and widely circulated images of the abuse, 
according to court records.

The
 National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said it has found at
 least 35,000 images of Amy's abuse in more than 3,200 child pornography
 cases since 1998.

In at least 174 cases, Amy has been awarded restitution in amounts ranging from $100 to more than $3.5 million.

A case before the Supreme Court Washington brought forward by a child pornography victim is vying to change the way such victims can seek restitution from offenders. A woman identified as 'Amy', who was raped by her uncle and the subsequent images circulated online, is seeking $3.4 million from Doyle Randall Paroline, a Texas man found in possession of the images

She has collected more than $1.5 million, one of her attorneys has said.

In another case involving Amy and a second woman, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco threw out a restitution order because it found there was not a sufficient link between a man convicted of possessing child pornography and the women.

Advocates for child pornography victims say that holding defendants liable for the entire amount of losses better reflects the ongoing harm that victims suffer each time someone views the images online.

Last year, the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said in a 10-5 decision that victims do not have to show a link between the crime and their injuries.

The threat of a large financial judgment, coupled with a prison term, also might deter some people from looking at the images in the first place, the advocates say.

'The threat that a person in the child 
pornography market may well bear the entire cost of the harm done to the
 victim, even if they are a ''minor player'', is likely to be a large 
deterrent, especially when the harm done typically runs into the 
millions for a victim's lifetime of care,' said Marci Hamilton, a law 
professor at Yeshiva University.

Hamilton wrote a brief in the case on behalf of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children.

The Washington Supreme Court will take up a case about when victims of child pornography can recover money from people convicted of viewing their abuse

The money is intended to cover the cost of her psychological care, lost income and attorneys' fees.

Thirty-four states, dozens of victims' rights and child advocacy groups, local prosecutors and members of Congress are urging the court to uphold the ruling against Paroline by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

No one has intervened on Paroline's behalf.

But his lawyer, Stanley Schneider of Houston, said in court papers that there is no link between the restitution ordered by the appeals court and Paroline's conduct.

'An award of $3.4 million against an individual for possessing two images of child pornography is punitive and grossly disproportionate,' Schneider said.

The $3.4 million estimate on the damages to the victim was calculated by a psychologist working for James Marsh, an attorney for Amy.

The Obama administration is trying to steer a middle course.

Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said the government agrees with Amy that her injury comes from the widespread viewing on the Internet of the assaults by her uncle.

'The real question is whether ... a court must impose all of Amy's aggregate losses on each defendant. On that issue, Amy and the government take different views,' Verrilli told the court.

The administration said the correct answer is greater than zero and less than the entire amount and said trial judges should make the determination.

The issue centers on the interpretation of the federal law granting restitution to victims of sex crimes, including child pornography.

Regardless of the outcome of the court case, Congress could change the law.

The U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended that lawmakers consider doing just that to eliminate confusion among federal judges about the right way to calculate restitution.

Amy's lawyers estimate that tens of thousands of people worldwide have collected and viewed Amy's images.
