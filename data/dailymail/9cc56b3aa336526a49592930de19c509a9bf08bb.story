Classmates who studied with Tony Abbott's daughter have hit back at revelations that Frances received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister.

Ms Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors.

The news came on Wednesday, the same day that thousands of students protested across Australia about the cuts to tertiary education funding, announced in Mr Abbott's federal budget.

Chad Mason, 20, who studied alongside Frances in 2011 for a Bachelor of Design in styling and creative direction, told news.com.au he was absolutely outraged.

'I can assure you that there were no scholarships awarded to any other students in our cohort, and I can definitely say that I studied with some extremely talented people who were more deserving of a $60,000 scholarship,' he said.

Other students who did not wish to be named said there were students that did it really tough just to get through the degree and pay the expensive fees.

One woman, who reportedly comes from a low-income background and finished the course with a high-distinction average, said she was upset that someone as privileged as the Prime Minister's daughter was given assistance and that there were other more deserving students.

The Whitehouse Institute's website states that it 'does not currently offer scholarships to gain a place into the Bachelor of Design,' though it does say students may be sponsored to undertake further study once already at the college.

The chief executive of Whitehouse Ian Tudor however said the college does award 'all sorts of scholarships; it would probably be 20 or more each year'.

Mr Tudor also said that as the institution was a private company, the founder and owner Leanne Whitehouse was well within her jurisdiction to offer Frances the scholarship.

The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said.

Mr Abbott defended his daughter Fairfax radio on Thursday, and said his daughter got it on her academic potential.

'She kept it on her academic merit - she is a distinction student,' he said.

The college was so pleased with Frances' performance it offered her a place in their initial Masters course, he said, though Mr Abbott did not believe the matter warranted media interest.

A spokeswoman for the prime minister said if Mr Abbott received alternative advice on declaring the scholarship he would 'meet the amended requirements.'

Mr Abbott has not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.

Current laws rule that members of the House of Representatives are required to declare gifts of more than $300 when they are given to themselves, their spouses and dependent children and come from non-official sources.

However, a spokeswoman has denied that Mr Abbott needed to disclose his daughter's scholarship as it did not constitute a gift.

'Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' she said in a statement.

'If alternative advice is provided, Mr Abbott will meet the amended requirements.'

Guidelines currently say gifts from family members or personal friends 'need not be registered unless the member judges that an appearance of conflict of interest may be seen to exist'.

Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said.

When Mr Abbott was in opposition he received clothing from him as a gift in February 2012 and April 2013.

'While the exact cost of the gifts were not known, it was clear they were higher than the $300 threshold and were appropriately disclosed, with Mr Abbott providing all the information required by an opposition member,' Mr Abbott's spokeswoman said.

Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 and is currently working for Whitehouse as a teacher's aide in Melbourne.

She aims to continue her studies with a Masters degree course later this year and is now a regular front-row fixture at Australian fashion shows.

Details of Frances' scholarship emerged as students campaigned against the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education in cities around the country.

The institute that Frances attended is likely to benefit from the federal government's changes to subsidies, which previously did not cover private colleges.

Mr Abbott attended last year's graduation ceremony at the institute in support of his daughter and gave a speech praising its work.
