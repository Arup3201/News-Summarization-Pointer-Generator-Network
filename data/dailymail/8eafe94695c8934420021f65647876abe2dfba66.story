What's your secret? Jennifer Lopez, 45, can be seen showcasing her famous bottom in  raunchy new music video Booty - and now it's been revealed how she honed it into shape

Tracy Anderson, a former dancer and business partner of Gwyneth Paltrow, has produced four exercise DVDs - each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone - and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method.

Tracy trains Jennifer for one hour every day and they mix it up with 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of muscular structure. 

'Her workouts have to give her the ability to have endurance for the show. We don’t want to change her sexy body and wanted to design a workout to keep her sexy butt toned,' Tracy told Hollywood Life.

Her secret? Tricking Jennifer's muscles. 'We change the workout every 10 workouts,' she said. 'That’s the secret. We can only stay on a movement every 10 days.' 

Tracy also revealed that the singer can’t go two days without a workout for risk of losing her toned physique. 

Tracy is loved among the Hollywood set and her best friend and business partner Gwyneth Paltrow credits the trainer with 'completely changing her body'.

She said: 'Still, when I first started working with Tracy, finding motivation was hard. She advised me to think of exercise as an automatic routine, no different from brushing your teeth, to avoid getting distracted. Now it is part of my life.' 

Other famous fans of Tracy include Madonna, Shakira and Nicole Ritchie and J-Lo isn't the only pop star who can thank her for getting her back into shape for her musical comeback.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini followed Tracy's method, telling Glamour magazines: 'I do the Tracy Anderson method. I've been doing it for a long time now. It's not easy but if you push yourself through, I love it.'
