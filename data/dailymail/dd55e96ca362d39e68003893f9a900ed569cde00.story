An Iranian newspaper has been shut down after the country's authorities accused its front page headline of 'supporting' the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

The article's headline quoted Hollywood actor, George Clooney, saying: 'I am Charlie Hebdo.'

But the accompanying article did not actually express support for Clooney's statement, nor for the magazine itself.

The editor of Mardom-e-Emrooz - or Today's People - confirmed his paper was ordered to close for publishing the story.

Clooney was one of many actors to arrive at the Golden Globe awards to wear 'Je Suis Charlie' pins.

'Today was an extraordinary day,' he said during an acceptance speech for his lifetime achievement award - in reference to the solidarity marches in Paris. 

'There were millions of people that marched — not just in Paris but around the world. They were Christians and Jews and Muslims... And they didn’t march in protest — they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. Je suis Charlie.'

Iran has condemned the satirical French magazine's insistence on publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad is 'provocative' and an insult to Islam.

But the country also denounced the deadly assault on its office, and the subsequent terror attacks in Paris - in which 17 innocent people were killed.

Elsewhere in the Muslim world, Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani also criticised Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition, describing it as a 'blasphemous and irresponsible' act.

In a statement issued by the presidential palace, he said: 'Freedom of expression should be used in a way to boost understanding between the religions.

'Afghanistan has suffered many years of war and violence, more than any other country, and it is necessary to understand and promote peaceful coexistence among all the people of the world.'

Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, also issued a statement of condemnation against the Paris attacks by saying terrorism 'has nothing to do with Islam in any way'.

But he too warned against the publication of 'blasphemous' images, saying: 'offensive words might lead to further bloodshed.'

Bloody protests have already erupted around the world as furious Muslims react to Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition - again featuring the holy Prophet Muhammad on its front cover.

A photographer was shot in Pakistan as 200 angry protesters took to the streets in the city of Kuratchi - while equally violent demonstrations broke out in Peshawar and Lahore.

It's believed Adif Hasan was shot by demonstrators and although his condition was at first thought to be serious, he was now said to be recovering.

Wounded: Adif Hasan rests in a vehicle, out of harms way. The bullet was said to have struck his lung and passed through his chest

Meanwhile, the Niger government confirmed four people were killed as the police clashed with protesters who attacked a French cultural centre and set churches ablaze.

Police fired tear gas to suppress the crowds in the city of Zinder, where angry Muslims burned French flags and attacked Christian shops with clubs and Molotov cocktails.

Three civilians died - including two who were shot by police during an attack on their station - Niger's Interior Minister, Hassoumi Massaoudou, said on state televison.

The fourth person to be killed was a police officer who was run over, while 45 other people sustained injuries.

Clashes also broke out in the Jordanian capital of Amman, between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organised by the Muslim Brotherhood - the country's largest opposition group.

Riot police used batons to disperse the people as they tried to march towards the French Embassy.

Anger: At least 1,000 people are reported to have gathered at the grand mosque in Niger's capital, Niamey, after Friday prayer's to protest against Charlie Hebdo

Death: Four people, including one police officer, died in the Nigerian city of Zinder during violent protests

Demonstration: Thousands gathered after Friday prayers in Zinder, Niger, to vent their anger at the latest Charlie Hebdo magazine, which features the Prophet Muhammad on its front cover

The crowd chanted slogans against Charlie Hebdo and Jordanian officials for taking part in a unity march in Paris on Sunday.

The Jordanian royal household denounced Charlie Hebdo's latest cover, saying publishing the cartoon was 'irresponsible and far from the essence of freedom of expression'.

King Abdullah and Queen Rania, however, took part in the Paris march in solidarity with the victims of the terror attack.

Yesterday, the Royal Jordanian Hashemite Court issued a statement calling the cartoon insulting, irresponsible and reckless.
