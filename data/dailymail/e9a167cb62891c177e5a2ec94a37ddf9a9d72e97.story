The UK will be battered with rain and strong gusts of wind today as stormy conditions roll in across much of the UK, heralding the beginning of autumn.

Britain faces another week of unsettled weather, with sunshine and showers forecast along with the risk of thunder.Â 

But the mix of warm, sunny weather, along with moisture in the soil after the wet 
winter, means we could be in line for 'potentially spectacular' autumn colours following the summer, experts have said.

Fancy dress fun runners take part in the Bupa Great North Run 2013 in Newcastle upon Tyne this morning. Winds in the area are expected to be up to 40mph, and will increase to 45mph in the afternoon

Nick Prebble, forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said the conditions were looking pretty grim and not ideal conditions for running, with heavy rain and strong winds

The conditions have allowed plants to build up sugar levels needed to create 
amazing autumnal red, orange and gold foliage, the Royal Horticultural 
Society said.

And the recent rain has replenished 
soils that had become dry in the heat, meaning plants are still actively
growing and building up resources that could make for a great display, 
the RHS's chief horticultural adviser Guy Barter said.

As the days shorten, trees will begin to withdraw their resources from the leaves into the roots, he said.

Autumnal
weather in October, with warm days and cool nights, will now be needed 
to deliver the best diplays, boosting the breakdown of green chlorophyll
in the leaves and exposing the colourful pigments that remain.

Mr Barter said: 'The
wonderful combination of warm days, plenty of light and reasonable soil
moisture this summer has filled plants with resources needed to create 
amazing autumnal reds, oranges and gold foliage.

'For
this to happen we need autumn weather conditions in October, warm days,
cool nights, akin to up-state New York where the autumnal colours of 
trees are a major tourist attraction.

'We've
been lucky enough to have had an amazing summer of warmth and light 
that has really helped plants come on after a very late spring, and now 
it looks like we can look forward to a potentially spectacular autumn 
with the weather treating us to one of nature's most spectacular 
displays.'

Last year's hopes
for a top display of autumnal colour were dashed by the wet weather in 
the autumn. Mr Barter said that the UK tended not to have huge extremes 
in its weather, which did not generally make for intense colour 
displays.

The country is more used to experiencing warm, wet days and nights or cold, dull days in autumn.

But
while it might hinder the best colour displays, some rain in autumn had
benefits for gardeners , as the season was a good time to be planting 
new plants and some moisture in the soil would help bulbs, shrubs and 
trees going into the ground, he added.

Today, as some 55,000 people set off on the half-marathon Great North Run in Newcastle, winds in the area are expected to be up to 40mph, and will increase to 45mph in the afternoon.

Nick Prebble, forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'It's looking pretty grim and not ideal conditions for running, with heavy rain and strong winds at times.

'For the rest of the country, you'll be lucky to escape any rain today and we could see pretty high rainfall totals in Scotland, Wales, north-west England and Northern Ireland.'

Western areas of Scotland are expected to see the worst rain of the day, with 30-40mm falling in some places. It will also bear the brunt of the windy conditions, with Northern Ireland and Cumbria, with some tree branches expected to be brought down by the gusts.

Gusts of 50 to 60mph have been predicted, with the potential to reach even higher speeds over exposed coasts and hills.

The rest of the UK is expected to see cool, cloudy and windy conditions, with no signs of a return of any sunshine.

Temperatures will reach 15 to 16C across England and Wales and 13 to 14C in Scotland, with a wind chill expected to make it feel much cooler.

The Met Office said it had issued severe weather warnings for the gales in Scotland and Northern Ireland for today and the public should be aware of the potential for some minor disruption to travel.

Chief forecaster Paul Gundersen said: 'A spell of gale force westerly winds is expected later Sunday, peaking on Monday across much of Scotland, the north of Northern Ireland and coasts of north west England and north Wales. Gusts of 50 - 60mph are likely, with the potential for 70mph across exposed coasts and hills of Scotland.

'The public should be aware of the potential for some minor disruption to travel and keep up to date with the latest weather forecast information.'

Conditions are expected to remain unsettled into next week, with sunshine and showers forecast along with the risk of thunder.
