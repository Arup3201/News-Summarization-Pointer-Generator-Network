Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi continues to languish in a Mexican jail after being arrested for accidentally taking guns across the border

A U.S. Marine jailed in Mexico on drug charges after accidentally crossing the border says that he's being 'chained to a bed naked and beaten' in custody

Andrew met with Greta Van Susteran of Fox News on Thursday and spoke of disturbing details following his March 31 arrest.

Tahmooressi said that he accidentally arrived at a border checkpoint with three guns in his truck after making a wrong turn in California - and told police he didn't mean to be in Mexico.

'I said I have all my stuff back here, plus three guns, but I didn’t mean to be in Mexico, it was an accident and there was no place to do a U-turn,' Tahmooressi said.

Tahmooressi said that one officer who was able to speak English said that they would find him an escort to go back to the United States, that is until Mexican officials took over.

Tahmooressi said that he was handcuffed and taken to Mexican prison.

'He just took control,' Tahmooressi told Fox.

'He didn't seem to care at all about anything that I had to say. It was like a math equation in his head. Three guns, man equals prison.'

Tahmooressi was allowed to speak to his mother on the phone and decided after speaking with her he would have to escape because he feared for his life in prison.

'I thought that if I had went back into the cell that night that something, that I would be raped and killed,'he said.

'And I didn't think that telling the officers would help me at all.'

Tahmooressi tried to escape and failed which made tings worse, much worse, he said.

He was beaten badly until he was left 'gasping for air.'

He was also allegedly chain to a bed with his feet at one end and his hands to another.

He told reporters that he got this treatment as a punishment and he began to wonder if they would go after his family.

'I was afraid,' he said.

'I was afraid for my family because I thought, you know these guys they  wanted to harm me and that they were talking to the guards, that they were going to try and get information from the guards about the whereabouts of where my family was.'

Tahmooressi said that after the media began covering the case his treatment in jail has improved.

He sometimes 'gets depressed' but is hopeful that things will 'work out.'

He told Fox that he hope to be released in one month.

Tahmooressi's best friend Marine Mark Podlaski spoke with Greta 
Van Susteran days before and said that his jailed friend Andrew 
Tahmooresi spoke to him on the phone last week from Mexican prison and 
told him he was 'chained naked to a bed' along with other 'disturbing 
details.'

Podlaski told Fox that Mexico is supposed to be an ally on the United States and said it's 'absurd' that they are treating Tahmooressi so poorly.

Podlaski said that his captured friend described being beaten by a bat so britally that his jaw was broken. He was also chained naked to a bed.

'This is from his mouth, what I'm telling you right now is what he endured as an American citizen and a U.S. Marine,' Podlaski told Van Susteren.

'He was chained to his bed for so long that when they finally released him at the end of that four weeks he couldn't even walk, he was crippled from such bad muscle dystrophy and joint pain and not being able to fire the muscles in his body,' he added.

After his arrest, Tahmooressi's family hired a private investigator to investigate the case further.

Santos told Fox that the torture was inflicted before Tahmooressi's  mother went to the media.

Tahmooressi's best friend Mark Podlaski told reporters that his friend is being treated 'like a prisoner of war'

The 25-year old U.S. marine veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan, was detained and jailed by Mexican authorities late March after he drove across the Tijuana border with three U.S.-registered guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition

The treatment allegedly started after Tahmooressi had his first hearing for the case.

He has since fired his attorney Alejandro Osuna who allegedly instructed him to lie and say that he had never been to Tiajuana.

Tahmooressi had in fact been to Tiajuana six times after his detention.

A spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. who's involved in the case said that an April 6 email exchange between Osuna and Tahmooressi's family states Osuna told Tahmooressi to 'stick to the script, and keep it short and simple' by saying he had never been to Tijuana.

'Andrew kept insisting he wanted to change it, but our concern was that if he mentioned he had been in Tijuana about six times prior to his detention (which seems to be the case), his story would have been less credible,' Osuna wrote in the email, obtained by FoxNews.com.

Tahmooressi says he wants to 'set the record straight' after 'being instructed to lie.'

Tahmooressi was represented by a court appointed temporary lawyer at a Wednesday hearing.

Osuna confirmed with reporters that he'd been fired but said he didn't instruct his client to lie.
