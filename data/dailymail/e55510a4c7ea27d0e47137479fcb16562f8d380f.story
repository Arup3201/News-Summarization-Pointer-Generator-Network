Germany began their World Cup campaign with a 4-0 rout of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal on Monday and immediately vowed to lift the trophy in honour of stricken Formula One star Michael Schumacher.

A Thomas Muller hat-trick lit up Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova as Portugal were flattened by a brilliant German performance and the sending-off of defender Pepe.

Afterwards, Germany’s players revealed they had been heartened by news that Schumacher had left hospital for the first time since a skiing accident left him in a coma in France at the end of last year.

Heartening: Germany's players were boosted by the news Michael Schumacher has left hospital for the first time since falling into a coma following a skiing accident

Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski — a close friend of the driver — said: ‘It is important to all of us to hear the news that he’s come out of hospital. He’s doing well and he’s getting better and it’s really good news.

‘Of course it helped us. When you hear the news about a good friend it always helps and you get a little bit of a boost and I was very happy when I heard.

‘He’s a good guy and he’s also crazy about football. Maybe he watched the game or he knew about the result.  Yeah if we win the title of course it would also be for a good friend as well as ourselves.’

Germany surged into a two-goal lead in the first half and were able to switch to cruise control once Pepe had been dismissed for a headbutt on Muller.

It seemed the correct decision and the Real Madrid star will now miss the rest of the group stages.

Portugal coach Paulo Bento appeared to suggest Serbian referee Milorad Mazic was biased against his team, not only for that but for the 12th minute penalty that allowed Germany to take the lead.

‘The first half of the game — apart from our mistakes — had some things on behalf of the referee that penalised us,’ said Bento.

‘The sending off seemed to be forced and the penalty was the same. They were two things that led to us chasing the game.

‘I never said it was only the referee’s fault. We made mistakes in defence and we showed a lack of accuracy.

‘Compare that to the accuracy of the Germans and you see the difference.

‘But there seemed to be some bias towards the Germans. The first was the penalty and the second was the sending off.’

'Unusual': Thomas Muller says he has a vague recollection of this incident which led to Pepe's sending off

Muller was able to offer his own view of the red card incident after being presented with the man of the match award after the game.

He said: ‘As far as the sending off is concerned it’s unusual. I didn’t see a replay. Things went very fast. I have a vague recollection.

‘His hand struck me in the face. I fell on my back and he approached me with his head towards mine. I can’t really recollect.

‘I can’t say if it’s a red as that’s not up to me. But the entire action from Pepe was unnecessary.

‘I have scored a hat trick and that doesn’t happen every day. I have had a good run in World Cups and I wanted to carry that on.’

Accusation: Portugal coach Paulo Bento said there seemed to be 'bias' towards Germany from the officials

Germany would already appear to have one foot in the last 16 while Portugal must beat USA and Ghana in their remaining group games to progress.

German coach Joachim Low said: ‘Muller has an instinct to create danger and he scores from situations that you don’t expect.

‘He makes diagonal runs and it’s hard for opponents to track him.

‘He is unorthodox. You can’t predict them and as an opponent he is difficult to face.

‘He has one aim and that is to score a goal. He is an innate scorer.’
