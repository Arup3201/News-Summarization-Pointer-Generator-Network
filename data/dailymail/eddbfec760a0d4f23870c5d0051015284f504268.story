From Botox and lasers to surgery and high-end face creams containing a whole host of bizarre ingredients, it seems that we have entered a new era in the 
fight against ageing.

But the latest addition to the litany of unusual lotions and potions taking the beauty world by storm is literally out of this world.

111 SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream is a potent anti-ageing concoction using rare diamond dust particles that has been developed by NASA scientists and tested on astronauts in outer space.

Out of this world: The £599 111 SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream contains diamond particles from space and was developed with the help of NASA scientists

The galactic cream, which is sold exclusively at none other than luxury department store Harrods, doesn't come cheap. Beauty aficionados desperate to turn back the clock must pay a staggering £599 for 50ml.

111 SKIN Celestial Black Diamond Cream claims to penetrate the deeper layers of skin in order to transport potent youth restoring ingredients including NAC Y2 formula, Collagen type I and III and Hyaluronic acid.

And as you'd expect for a cream 
packed with diamond particles, it contains brightening agents to give 
skin a glowing appearance and a healthy complexion whilst diminishing 
signs of age spots and pigmentation.

The incorporation of black diamond particles is borrowed from medical 
research where they are used in cancer and rheumatism drugs as a delivery 
mechanism.

The 111 Skin range, which this quirky new product is a part of, was founded and developed by plastic surgeon Dr Y. Alexandrides MD of 111 Harley Street, London, in collaboration with space scientists.

Spacey: Key 111 SKIN ingredients were used by astronauts in extreme space conditions where accelerated ageing is known to occur

From the very beginning the product was designed to stand up to extreme conditions – to protect against environmental damage at high altitude, varying temperatures and the polluted urban setting.

Key 111 SKIN ingredients were used by astronauts in extreme space conditions where accelerated ageing is known to occur.

As research developed, space science became the clear answer.

The first cream from the range was created in 2008 to help patients heal after surgery. In addition to the dramatic healing results, the creams also had potent anti-ageing and protecting benefits.

Dr. Alexandrides said: 'As a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon, I deal with the most challenging problems of ageing and injury.

'I developed 111 SKIN through the inside out view that only a surgeon can master. Our products were tested in the most demanding situations: after cosmetic surgery and laser treatment, on scars and burns.

'Our science laboratory used the most advanced ingredients to maximise results. I am proud to offer my unique insight to my patients and now to everyone who wants to fight ageing.'
