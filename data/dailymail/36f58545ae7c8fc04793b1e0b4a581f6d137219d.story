This is the horrific moment a bouncer punched a man outside a bar causing permanent brain damage that led to his death.

Scott Sheard, 24, was struck by doorman Stuart Humphreys outside Destination Bar in Southport, Merseyside.

Mr Sheard immediately dropped to the floor and lay motionless on the pavement. He died in hospital two years later.

Horrific: This CCTV footage shows the moment a bouncer punched Scott Sheard outside a bar. He later died after suffering permanent brain damage

Powerful: Doorman Stuart Humphreys punched Mr Sheard outside Destination Bar in Southport, Merseyside

Injured: The 24-year-old lies motionless on the ground as the violence threatens to spill out of control. He suffered permanent brain damage

Mr Humphreys told police he slapped Mr Sheard across the face because he feared the Formby man was about to punch him.

This CCTV footage has now been released by Mr Sheard's mother Fenella and step-dad Colin Hill who are furious that no action has been taken against the doorman.

Mr Hill, from Formby, said 'The slap claim was ridiculous. The CCTV footage showed a punch, although if you blink you miss it.

'The consultant told us that Scott 
was unconscious before his head hit the pavement. And an independent 
eyewitness told the police that the blow was like a boxer’s punch due to
its speed.

'During the inquest Mr Humphreys said
he only wanted to knock Scott off balance. I have seen the CCTV and 
would question whether that was the action of a man trying to knock 
Scott off balance.'

The trouble flared when Mr Sheard was pushed as left the bar in October 2009.

Unhappy: Mr Sheard's mother Fenella and step father Colin Hill are furious that no action has been taken against the doorman, who said he had acted in self defence

After he is knocked to the floor, the 
CCTV footage shows Mr Humphreys appear to briefly square up to one of 
his friends as the violence threatens to spiral out of control.

The group of friends then shout at the doorman for striking Mr Sheard and point towards the CCTV camera above them.

At the inquest into Mr Sheard's death, the coroner said he accepted Mr Humphreys 
had acted in self-defence, believing he was about to be assaulted.

The Crown Prosecution Service has also said that Mr Humphreys’ claim of self-defence could not be disproved in court.

The film also captured the aftermath of the attack, as Mr Sheard's friends cradled him in their arms and members of the public stopped to help before paramedics arrived.

Doctors told Mr Sheard's family that he suffered brain damage both from the punch and from the impact of his head hitting the pavement.

He died of septicaemia in January 2012 after being left unable to walk, talk or feed himself. He was 27.

Mr Sheard's mother always hoped her son would be able to come home one day so she could look after him.

Since her son’s death, she has urged city clubbers and drinkers to show restraint after witnessing at first hand the damage that just ‘one punch’ can do.
