Liverpool and Manchester City will do battle for far greater prizes this season but Brendan Rodgers’s side drew first blood between last season’s top two teams in the Premier League as they won a penalty shootout in Yankee Stadium.

Steven Jovetic scored another brace for City, with Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling on target for Liverpool.

The Merseysiders will now face AC Milan in Charlotte on Saturday with a chance to clinch top place in the group and set up the possibility of a showdown with Manchester United and Louis van Gaal in Miami of all places.
