Former Socceroo Robbie Slater has hit out at his ex teammate Craig Foster on Twitter, claiming the sportsman turned presenter has 'ruined the World Cup'.

Foster, who has a long-running feud with Fox Sports pundit Slater, fired back telling him 'your thoughts are excretions'.

The 45-year-old had just commentated on Australia's 3-0 loss to Spain on Tuesday morning, when Slater slammed him.

Foster, who is helping to present SBS's World Cup coverage from Brazil, called out to the Socceroos' fans to get behind the national team, via Twitter.

'Message to everyone that loved Roos is get into a stadium, become A-League member, join the mission, throw your support behind the dream,' he said.

But while he presumably intended the tweet to be well received by his 40,000 followers, Slater piped up: '@FTSAUS @Craig_Foster learn how to co commentate! You ruined the World Cup my son! A bit harsh but constructive!'

Fired up, Foster replied: '@RobbieSlater17 Rob, your thoughts are excretions. I long ago tired of your intellectual bowel movements. Bit harsh, eminently constructive.'

This isn't the first time the soccer stars have had a blue.

Their disdain for each other reportedly first began during the 1997 Confederations Cup in Saudi Arabia when they got into a pay dispute.

Slater claimed Foster wanted more prize money.

And in January 2012, the SBS Chief Football Analyst was labelled a racist by the ex-Blackburn Rovers player.

Former Crystal Palace player Foster questioned Melbourne Victory's decision to hire Northern Irishman Jim Magilton, while writing in a newspaper article.

Slater responded by calling him a 'racist' and a hypocrite.

He raged on Twitter: 'OK here goes. I am sick of the continual attacks and in my opinion racist comments from @Craig_Foster on British people his article in [...] [t]odays sun herald [sic] in my opinion is a racist column and it is beyond me how he continually gets away with these vile articles.'

Foster retired from football in 2003 after earning 29 caps with the Socceroos.

Meanwhile, Slater, who was born in England and migrated with his family to Australia, won 44 caps for the Australian national team.

His final appearance for the country was against Saudi Arabia in the 1997 Confederations Cup, where the pair fell out over the second place winnings.

Australia came runners-up to Brazil during the Cup.
