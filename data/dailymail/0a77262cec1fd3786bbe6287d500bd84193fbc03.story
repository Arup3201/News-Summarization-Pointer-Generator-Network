A female Internal Revenue Service employee allegedly coerced a taxpayer into having sex with her in order to keep him out of hot water with his taxes.

Vincent Burroughs, 40, of Fall Creek, Oregon, said Dora Abrahamson, 38, used her position with the IRS to sexually harass and intimidate him, according to a recently filed lawsuit.

Burroughs says he initially resisted Abrahamson’s attempt to solicit him for sex until she told him that she could either impose no tax penalty or a 40 per cent penalty.

Burroughs says the two had sex at his home in September 2011 and that the affair caused a rift in another relationship he was in.

The IRS agent phoned the unsuspecting taxpayer to notify him that he was being audited, according to the lawsuit.

Abrahamson allegedly told Burroughs ‘she knew who he was, and that it was lucky for him that this was the case, and that they should meet.’ Burroughs said he had no recollection of her.

Abrahamson then went on to flirt with Burroughs over the phone and through text messages, offering him massages and at one point sending him a photo of her in her underwear, the lawsuit states.

Though Burroughs said that he did not respond to Abrahamson’s initial advances, he reportedly gave in to her demands after a ‘provocatively attired’ Abrahamson showed up at his home and propositioned him yet again.

‘She told (Burroughs) that she could be a bitch, or that she could be nice,’ the lawsuit states, ‘She said that she could impose no penalty, or a 40 percent penalty, and that if he would give her what she wanted, she would give him what he needed’

Burroughs had sex with the IRS agent that day ‘as a result of (her) coercive conduct,’ according to the lawsuit, which names Abrahamson and the United States of America as defendants.

IRS spokesman Richard Panick told The Register-Guard that agency officials could not respond to questions regarding Burroughs’s allegations or Abrahamson’s employment history.

Abrahamson declined to comment on the lawsuit when the newspaper contacted her by phone on Thursday.

The former Eugene, Oregon, resident now lives in Cottage Grove, according to court records.Abrahamson is not believed to still be employed by the IRS, according to the Register-Guard.

Burroughs is asking a jury to award him unspecified punitive damages.

He said that Abrahamson’s conduct caused him distress and ‘a rift in his relationship with his significant other.’

According to the lawsuit, Abrahamson’s advances violated Burroughs’s constitutional right to privacy and ‘were an excessive intrusion onto his person.’

The lawsuit states that the federal government is liable for damages because IRS officials provided inadequate supervision to Abrahamson allowing her to pursue a sexual relationship with Burroughs against his wishes.

Burroughs said he did not initially report Abraham¬son’s sexual advances ‘out of embarrassment and fear that she would cause substantial financial penalties to be imposed upon him,’ the lawsuit states.
