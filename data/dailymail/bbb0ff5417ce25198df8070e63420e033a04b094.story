A Chicago mother on Wednesday received the horrible news that her teenage boy was shot dead after a fight broke out at the end of a high school basketball game.

Pamela Wright had dropped her son Tyrone Lawson off at Chicago State University for the game and was waiting for him to get back in touch when she heard what had happened.

Lawson, 17, was shot around 9:20pm outside the gymnasium near 95th Street and King Drive, according to Police News Affairs Officer Daniel O’Brien.

Mother's grief: 'Instead of looking forward to prom, I'm looking for an insurance policy to bury him,' his mother Pamela Wright said

‘Instead of looking forward to prom, I'm looking for an insurance policy to bury him,’ Wright told the Chicago Tribune.

Shortly before the shooting, an argument had broken out in a handshake line after the game between Simeon Career Academy and Morgan Park High School, where Lawson was a student, police said.

The heated argument that started after Simeon won spilled into the parking lot where someone pulled out a gun and shot Lawson, according to local authorities.

Both teams were held in the locker rooms longer than normal after the game ended and tensions ran high throughout the gymnasium, witnesses said.

University police issued a message to Chicago officers, asking them to remain on the lookout for a Jeep.

The vehicle was pulled over east of the school and two suspects were taken into custody, officials said. Officers found a gun inside the Jeep.

It was unclear what the argument was over. Nothing beyond the norm appeared to have happened during the game between the two schools, which are located about 30 blocks apart from one another.

Chicago State University released a statement Thursday morning saying it was ‘deeply saddened by the tragic shooting death.’

‘(Chicago Public Schools) periodically uses the university’s athletic facility to provide a neutral setting for student sporting events. This is the first such incident to occur on the campus of Chicago State University where CPS students have played many times over the last three years,’ the statement said.

‘Additional security is provided by the university and all external partners during high school sporting events. Arrests have been made and university officials are awaiting the outcome of a full investigation to learn details about the shooting incident.’

Lawson was pronounced dead at 9:59 pm, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.
