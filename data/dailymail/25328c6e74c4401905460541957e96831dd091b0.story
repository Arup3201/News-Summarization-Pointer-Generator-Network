Former world champions Spain prepared for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus  by playing a full practice game in Las Rozas, where Santi Cazorla scored a screamer.

The pint-sized playmaker has not found the net for Arsenal this season but picked up the ball outside of the area to rifle home a thunderous shot past Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas.

The Spaniards face Belarus in their Group C clash in Huelva on Saturday as they seek to bounce back from last month's 2-1 defeat in Slovakia - before hosting World Cup winners Germany in a glamour friendly on November 18.

Slovakia top the pool on nine points from three matches, with Spain and Ukraine on six, Macedonia on three and Belarus and Luxembourg on one point each. 

Manager Vicente del Bosque will be without in-form Chelsea pair Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa for the game after they were both ruled out with injury.

Fabregas, who has racked up two goals and 11 assists in 15 appearances for the Blues this season, was diagnosed with a hamstring problem and has been replaced by Villarreal midfielder Bruno Soriano.

Meanwhile, Brazilian born Costa has been left out of the squad to allow him time to recover from a series of niggling injuries  

'I have spoken to our doctors and those of Chelsea and I have decided to leave him out due to the situation with his pubis (pelvis),' Del Bosque told a news conference. 

Del Bosque added: 'We have reached a decision with Chelsea's medical staff that we will take a break due to his groin issues. It has nothing to do with whether he later plays for his club. He always wants to come with us, but we have spoken and this is the best for his health.'
