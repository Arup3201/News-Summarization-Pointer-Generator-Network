These leaked images show how Frankenstein iPhones created out of broken mobiles are being repackaged and sold as new.

With millions of iPhones in circulation, the booming business of cannibalising iPhones has now taken off in a big way in south-east China.

The phones, purchased mostly from Western countries, are shipped en masse to China where they are stripped down and tested to see which parts are working.

With millions of iPhones in circulation a booming business has now taken off in south-east China in which broken iPhones are cannibalised to create seemingly new devices

They are then put back together and the cases polished to make them seem like new – and then sold at the market price.

With labour so cheap in China massive warehouses have been set up with armies of technicians stripping down the iPhones wholesale and putting them back together again so that they can be resold.

Would you be able to tell the difference between a Frankenstein iPhone (left) and one that's new (right)?

1 - Match IMEI number of your iOS device with the box it came with.

The IMEI number can also located on the back of your iPhone’s box on the bottom left corner.

2 - You should be the one to activate your iPhone. If your iPhone is already activated then it's likely to have been used by someone else first.

3 - If you check the SIM tray in a new phone, it is likely that it would be carrying same IMEI and Serial number as your iPhone

According to the insider who took these pictures of the process taking place, the innocent buyers cannot tell the difference between the repackaged phones and new devices as the rebuilt phones from cannibalised parts look like new.

The anonymous person said: ‘The only way to tell is to open up and look inside and who does that when they buy a new phone? They are carefully polished to make them indistinguishable from new devices.’

The informer said that the centre of the business has developed in Shenzhen in southeast China’s Guangdong province, and that the iPhones had to be smuggled into China as it was not legal to bring them in openly.

In most cases, it’s only the touch screen that is faulty. Scammers replace the screen, case and internal rib cage, then repackage it in original, or sometimes fake, retail packaging.

‘They even know how to put codes on the iPhones again to make them indistinguishable from the brand-new models,’ he said.

‘And it costs a fraction to buy up the parts and build a second hand phone rather than buying a new one, and by selling them as new there was a lot of money to be made.’
