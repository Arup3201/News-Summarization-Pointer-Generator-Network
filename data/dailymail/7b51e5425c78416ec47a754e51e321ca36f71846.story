'Crying': Shrien Dewani (pictured earlier in the trial) told police that his wife Anni was the one who decided to visit a dangerous South African township on the night she was shot dead, a court heard today

Shrien Dewani told police that his wife Anni was the one who decided to visit a dangerous South African township on the night she was shot dead, a court heard today.

In a statement provided to police just hours after the 2010 hijack, Dewani is quoted as saying: 'I think my wife talked to [taxi driver] Zola about the townships.

'Zola then took us into the townships because my wife told him that's what she wanted.'

The claim was revealed to Cape Town's High Court by South African police officer George Stefanus, who said he interviewed Dewani around four hours after their car was ambushed by gunmen.

Asked about the Briton's reactions at the time, Stefanus told the court: 'He was crying. What he also said was: "I hope they didn't kill Anni" and 'I hope Anni's okay".'

The policeman's recollections came on a torrid day for the prosecution, which argues that Dewani both planned and paid for his wife's murder on their honeymoon.

Prosecutor Adrian Mopp had sought to reveal to the court a cache of 53 sexually charged e-mails sent to Dewani by an older man over a three-month period a year before Anni's death.

The e-mails, Mr Mopp said, would help the court understand the prosecution's version of how Mrs Dewani died - a story, the lawyer admitted, that some 'may find peculiar'.

Former Metropolitan Police IT expert Mark Roberts had flown to South Africa from Britain to present the e-mail evidence, which he discovered on Mrs Dewani's laptop computer. 

But before he was able to do so, Dewani's defence barrister Francois van Zyl objected to their disclosure, pointing out that the 34-year-old businessman already admits to being bisexual.

'This is communication between the accused and another person from June to August 2009 in which they discuss their sexual preferences - what one man wants to do the other', van Zyl told the court.

'Amongst this are two instances - maybe three - in which they clearly have discussions about whether to come out and also about marriage.

'It is clear that the accused is [sexually] conflicted. The advice from his friend is that commitment is serious but if that is what he wants, he would support him and so would his family.'

Van Zyl admitted that while the 17 pages worth of email messages contain a wealth of detail about Mr Dewani's sexual activity, they should have no bearing on his murder case - particularly since they were sent only shortly after Dewani first met his wife-to-be. 

Prosecutor Adrian Mopp argued however that they should be revealed because they show how Shrien Dewani was 'confused' about his sexuality.

'But we know he was confused!', said Judge Jeanette Traverso before ruling that the emails should remain secret. 

Murder scene: The taxi where Anni Dewani's body was found in the  Cape Town township of Gugulethu

Mrs Dewani was murdered on the evening of November 13, 2010, after the taxi she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked in the dangerous Cape Town township of Gugulethu.

The taxi's two hijackers ejected first the driver, Zola Tongo, and then Shrien Dewani before heading deep into the Cape Town townships where they killed Anni with a single bullet to the neck.

Shrien Dewani, who spent four years fighting extradition from the UK to South Africa to face trial, denies all involvement in the crime.

His murder trial, which started last week, was adjourned until next Monday after Cape Town's High Court heard that one of the prosecution lawyers had fallen ill.
