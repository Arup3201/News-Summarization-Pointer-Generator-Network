Team news

QPR

Midfielder Niko Kranjcar has recovered from thigh trouble ahead of QPR's Premier League clash with Manchester United at Loftus Road on Saturday.

Armand Traore will miss out with a toe problem, while Sandro (knee) and Yun Suk-Young (ankle) are both still sidelined.

Unsettled attacking midfielder Adel Taarabt could feature again after coming in from the cold for QPR's 2-1 defeat at Burnley last weekend.

Charlie Austin celebrates scoring a penalty against former side Burnley - but it was all in vain as QPR lost 2-1

Manchester United

Robin van Persie has a slim chance of playing against QPR on Saturday after Louis van Gaal revealed the Manchester United striker only suffered a 'minor' ankle injury against Southampton last weekend.

If Van Persie is ruled out, either Radamel Falcao or James Wilson is likely to come into the starting XI.

Defenders Rafael (cheekbone) and Marcos Rojo (thigh) are in contention after recovering from their respective injuries but wing-back Ashley Young is unavailable because of a hamstring problem.

Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Valdes, Vermijl, Blackett, Shaw, Smalling, Evans, Rojo, Jones, McNair, Rafael, Pereira, Blind, Fellaini, Fletcher, Herrera, Valencia, Lingard, Anderson, Carrick, Powell, Januzaj, Di Maria, Mata, Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie, Wilson, W Keane.
