Four teenagers were 'flicked' off a jumping castle during a birthday party when it was picked up during high winds in a rural Victoria town yesterday. 

The casualties, all aged between 13 and 14, were taken to hospital with a range of injuries after the 'freak' accident in Bannockburn, near Geelong. 

A girl was airlifted to Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne suffering from a loss of consciousness and a back injury after the incident in The Grange.

'One boy was taken privately to Geelong Hospital by his family with an arm injury.  

'We also transported a boy with an arm and leg injury and was taken to Geelong and another girl suffering from lower back soreness. 

'The jumping castle had a slide attached and we heard the teenagers were at the top of the slide when they were flicked off when it was picked up in the high winds.

The jumping castle, which measured 6m by 4m, landed on the teenagers after it was swept into the air 

There was a high response from emergency services after the incident on Saturday afternoon

A spokesman for Geelong Hospital said the boy and girl were in a stable condition on Sunday. 

It is not known which company the jumping slide was hired out from but other jumping castle companies said they cancelled bookings at the last minute because of the high winds forecast.  

Kay-lea Boston, who runs Jumping About Castles in the Bannockburn area, said she did not know which company had hired out the jumping castle but would not have hired one out on Saturday. 

She told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was very windy, I was surprised when I read on Facebook about the incident.

'I hope the kids get better and wish them all the best. It was my middle child's birthday yesterday and he asked if we could have a jumping castle out and I said no because of the winds. 

Bannockburn is a small rural town near Geelong, in Melbourne, Victoria 

'People book the jumping castles ahead and we have to look at the how the weather is at the time and make a decision on the day, I would not have let one be hired out for the outside yesterday.

'You always read about this kind of thing happening but never think it is going to happen that near you.' 

A spokeswoman for Aaron's Amusements in Melbourne said they cancelled two bookings because of the weather forecasts. 

She said: 'There are strict rules in Australia about this kind of thing and we did cancel parties because of the forecasts. 

'Customers do get upset but safety has to come first. We saw winds up to 37kph so we had to pull out.
