Charged: Ronald Miller, pictured, was arrested after performing a test on his child's elementary school. He entered the school and repeatedly quizzed teachers about what they would do if he had a gun

A father has been arrested on terror charges after threatening his child's elementary school to test if they could deal with an armed intruder.

Ronald Miller, 44, was described as 'aggressive and combative' during the incident at Celina Elementary School, just outside Dallas.

He made his way inside the school's main office and confronted staff after dropping off his child early on Wednesday morning.

According to CBSdfw, he pointed at members of staff and said 'you're dead'.

He then repeatedly asked panicked teachers what they would do if he had a gun and 'a target inside the school'. 

'He asked questions such as what would you do if I had a gun and I had a target inside the school? Those questions would obviously be alarming,'  Patrol Sergeant Shea Scott of the Celina Police Department told myfoxdfw.com. 'He was putting them on the spot and demanding quick responses.'

Miller was not armed and left the scene peacefully. He handed teachers a note telling the school district to call him if they were in need of security training.

The former volunteer firefighter was later arrested at his home and charged with making a terrorist threat. If found guilty he could face prison with a sentence anywhere between two and ten years.

Somewhat ironically other parents criticized the school's security measures in the wake of the incident and the local police chief admitted changes would be made to security procedures as a result.

'He exposed to us some weaknesses that we have,” Celina ISD Superintendent Donny O’Dell told CBSdfw. 

Parents said they should have been informed of Miller's threats and given the option to remove their children from school that day.

'I feel that they should have potentially locked down the school. It would have been my choice if I picked up my child,' mother Abby Hall told Fox.

Panicked: Teachers at Celina Elementary School were left unnerved by Ronald Miller, who threatened the school on Wednesday. The father of a second grader quizzed them on what they would do if he had a gun

Another parent emailed the channel: 'My son attends kindergarten at Celina Elementary School. We were NOT notified of this whatsoever! I 
found out today via FACEBOOK!'

Miller, father of a second grader at the school, is a paramedic and has no formal security training, he is being held in lieu of a $75,000 bond. 

His family is well-known in the community after holding fundraisers for his teenage daughter, Ashley, who developed a rare form of cancer in 2010. She died in July 2011.

The school district put out a statement defending the school's response to the incident.

Angry: Abby Hall, pictured, was one of the parents angry at Celina Elementary School after Ronald Miller pretended to be a gunman. She said the school should have been locked down

'At no time did we feel our students were in harm's way. However, as a precaution a police officer was positioned at each of the campuses for the rest of the day,' it said.

It is not the first time a parent has decided to act on school security in the wake of last month's Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

Nashville marine, Jordan Pritchard, stood on unarmed guard outside Gower Elementary school, attended by his two children, in the wake of the attack in which Adam Lanza gunned down 20 children and six teachers.
