The overjoyed parents of twin girls in India who survived a complex operation to separate them after they were born joined at the liver are now desperate to take their healthy daughters home.

The two-month-old girls, Saboora and Safoora, beat incredible odds of one-in-50million of surviving such a procedure.

They were joined at the abdomen and had shared a liver since birth, called Omphalopagus.

But a team of 40, from Medanta – The Medicity Hospital, in Haryana, northern India, performed the rare feat over six hours, on November 15, which involved separating the liver.

Mother Zabeeda and father Mohammad Hameed, from Srinagar, in Kashmir, northern India, are now overjoyed to have two healthy daughters.

Zabeeda, who already has a three-year-old boy, said: 'I am overjoyed the surgery has gone well. It was my only wish to have my two beautiful daughters healthy and my wish has been granted.'

Zabeeda knew she was pregnant with twins but they had not been diagnosed as conjoined until they were born.

She said: 'If the doctors had informed us earlier we would have made arrangements to separate the girls at birth but we had no idea.

'It was very difficult for us to take proper care of them when they were born.

From feeding them to bathing, everything was tough. We were also worried about their health but relatives told us about this hospital and supported us to make this happen.'

Dr Neelam Mohan, Director of the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Liver Transplantation, at Medanta – The Medicity Hospital, said: 'The surgery has been a success. We had a team of 30 staff and eight were at the operating table working on the girls. 

'The biggest challenge was separating the livers where the blood vessels were joined which increased the risk of severe bleeding. 

'There was also a danger the livers wouldn't function again in the future.

'Neither baby had a belly button either but they were constructed during surgery.'

Conjoined twins occur once in 100,000 births, with three out of four cases being girls

Saboora and Safoora were kept under close observation for the first 48 hours but they were finally discharged on November 26th, and are now feeding on milk comfortably.

Dr Mohan added: 'Conjoined twins, in most cases, have failed to survive so the entire team was anxious but we have succeeded. 

'There should be no complications for these babies now. They should go on to live a healthy life.'
