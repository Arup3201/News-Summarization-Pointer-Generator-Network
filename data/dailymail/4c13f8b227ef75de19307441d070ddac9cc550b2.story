Online music streaming through sites like Spotify now account for at least 10 per cent of record industry revenue

The rise of downloads and streaming means that digital music now accounts for half of record industry income in the UK for the first time, according to new figures.

Digital revenue increased by 11.9 per cent last year on the back of strong album downloads, with streaming income also rising by 41 per cent, a report by music industry body the BPI has found.

Despite the positive digital figures, revenue from sales of CDs and music videos continued to decline - dropping by 6.4 per cent in 2013 to stand at £365.4million.

The digital sales mean the UK music industry saw an overall 1.9 per cent increase in its income - the first growth in four years - taking it to £730.4 million last year, up from £716.8 million in 2012.

Hit albums such as Bastille's debut Bad Blood - the biggest selling digital artist album of 2013 - helped the income from download albums to grow by 19.5 per cent.

The trend for luxury digital packages also contributed to the boost, although sales of download singles slipped by 4.4 per cent.

But the rise of streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer offset any drop and represented the fastest growing area, with revenues growing by 41 per cent and generating £77million.

Digital income accounted for a milestone 50 per cent of UK record industry sales revenue.

According to figures compiled by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), 7.4billion tracks were streamed in 2013, up from 3.7billion the year before

The figures take account only of the 
record industry income from digital and physical music and do not 
include VAT and the additional costs of retail.

BPI
 chief executive Geoff Taylor said: 'With digital increasingly becoming 
its key source of revenue, Britain's music industry is fit and ready to 
seize the global opportunities it offers.'

Tony Wadsworth, the BPI chairman, said: 'After over a decade of digital transformation we are now seeing the transition of the recorded music business reach a significant milestone and a return to revenue growth.'

'This was only ever going to happen if we give the consumer what they want , and the continual support given by artists and labels to new ways of enjoying music means that music fans can enjoy more choice and better value than at any time in history.'
