An Oklahoma woman has finally spoken out about why she faked her own kidnapping only months before her 2010 wedding – she had cold feet.

Tiffiny Bray, 42, of Oklahoma City, stole her fiancé's pickup truck, shacked up with another man in a Corpus Christi, Texas motel room and pretended to be kidnapped in July 2010 because she decided against marrying Chad McGuire.

The runaway bride-to-be pawned jewelry he bought her on her way to meet an internet beau named Steve. She told ABC News in a recent interview that she ran because she felt like she was suffocating.

‘I mean Chad was a nice guy,’ said Ms Bray. ‘I just was not happy with my life in general, I just felt like I couldn't breathe anymore.’

Ms Bray’s strange odyssey began July 20, 2010 when she told Mr McGuire she was borrowing his truck to go shopping. She never looked back.

‘The last text I heard from her was around noon,’ Mr McGuire said. ‘She asked what I wanted for lunch.’

She pawned a heart necklace given to her for Valentine’s Day and drove due south.

 ‘The whole time I was driving I was shaking,’ Ms Bray recalled. ‘I was so confused.’

He would not hear from her until 96 hours later, when she sent a cryptic text message pleading for help.

‘Need help. Somewhere in Lawton in dark room. White man. Please f*****g help me. Not sure I [can] use this again.’

Mr McGuire immediately contact authorities, they dropped everything to find the seemingly endangered woman.

‘When a text message comes in of that nature, that takes it to the forefront of the seriousness of what may be going on,’ said Richard Goss, special agent in charge of Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

Friends, including Tommy Lewis, also joined in the search.

‘We spent our time and money searching, trying to assist investigators, give them any information we could,’ said Mr Lewis.

Mr McGuire was put under intense scrutiny, at one point even accused by OSBI agents of killing Ms Bray – ‘I had one ask me where the body was.’

Charged with lying: Investigators took Mr Bray to court over the false kidnapping claims, a judge agreed and ordered her to repay the $34,000 cost of the investigation

Police eventually discovered Ms Bray had been chatting with a Texas man identified only as Steve.They tracked his cell phone to the Corpus Christi motel – more than 500 miles from where Ms Bray claimed to have been kidnapped to.

Agents hurriedly busted down the door only to find the woman had planned an elaborate scheme to avoid marrying Mr McGuire.

‘Tiffiny was there in the room by herself... when we walked into the motel room, and she was safe and sound,’ Mr Goss recalled. ‘We knew it had all been a hoax.’

Mr Bray’s new flame had no idea that she was on the lam.

‘It was my escape,’ she said of driving to Texas. ‘It was my way out.’

Officials charged her with a number of counts related to her flight and false reporting of a crime.

Instead of serving jail time, she was ordered to repay the $34,000 OSBI spent looking for her. She works 60 hours a week to pay off the debt.

Oh, and, she did finally get married – to Tommy Lewis. 

When asked if he was concerned about her getting cold feet again before their big day, he quipped ‘I'd be lying if it didn't cross my mind.’
