They could call it Harry Potter and the Mystery of the American Housekeeper.

The Home Office is probing whether actress Emma Watson’s maid has been working illegally at the star’s £2m north London home.

Officials are looking into claims that the housekeeper only had a tourist visa, which would bar her as a foreigner from working here.

Emma Watson: The Home Office is probing whether actress Watson's maid has been working illegally at the star's £2m north London home

The woman was stopped by UK immigration staff who questioned how she could pay for her stay here, it was claimed.

Employers who breach the rules by hiring foreign staff illegally can face a fine of up to £10,000.

Watson, 24, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, first started using the maid’s services in her New York apartment last year.

But the woman allegedly made trips to London and was paid to help out at the star’s three-storey Georgian terraced house in Islington, it was claimed.

Emma Watson appeared in all the Harry Potter films from the age of nine

Between September last year and February this year, she is said to have spent a total of three months in the UK.

It was on one of her trips to London that UK Border Agency staff allegedly questioned her about her ability to pay for her stay.

A source at the Home Office said: ‘An allegation has been received and processed and has been allocated for further action.’

Watson, worth £30million, has been living in the States where she recently obtained an English literature degree from Brown University in Rhode Island.

But she is currently believed to be in London to attend David Cameron’s ‘Cool Britannia’ party in Downing Street tonight.

Mr Cameron’s former immigration minister Mark Harper resigned earlier this year when it emerged his Colombian cleaner was in the country unlawfully.

Records showed the cleaner received at least £2,000 from Mr Harper’s Westminster expenses before second home allowances were tightened up.

And in 2009, it emerged how Labour’s Attorney General Baroness Scotland had employed her Tongan housekeeper in breach of the rules – which her own department had drawn up.

Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 because she had failed to keep copies of her housekeeper’s papers.

Employers can avoid being prosecuted or fined a civil penalty if they can show they did everything possible to check the immigration status of a worker.

Watson, who starred in all the Harry Potter films from the age of nine, graduated last month from elite Brown University.

Watson, who is dating rugby-playing Oxford student Matthew Janney (with ball), has often sought to play down her celebrity status

She made headlines after it emerged the ‘friend’ who accompanied her at the ceremony was actually an armed guard, carrying a gun beneath her gown.

The high-security was a marked contrast with her stated aim of having a ‘normal’ experience as a student at the prestigious US college.

Last night the Home Office declined to say anything, and Watson’s spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
