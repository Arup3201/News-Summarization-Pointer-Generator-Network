Tragic: Little Harry Connolly died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after being sent home by doctors twice in just five days

A devastated mother is demanding to find out why her young son died after medics sent him home three times in less than two weeks. 

Harry Connolly died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after medics repeatedly failed to diagnose his illness.

The 19-month-old first became ill with severe diarrhoea and vomiting on 23 April 2011, and was taken to a local GP three days later.

With his worried mother Lucy at his side, Harry was admitted to Northampton General Hospital that evening, before being discharged the next day.

However when he was unable to keep down fluids, his family took him back to the same hospital on April 28.

But he was sent home after a paediatrician told Mrs Connolly he wasn’t dehydrated and he did not have a virus.

When he was still ill the following day, his desperate mother was told the hospital was closed for Good Friday, so she took Harry to an out-of-hours emergency GP service, where he was seen by a doctor.

Mrs Connolly claims she repeatedly asked that Harry be referred back to hospital, but instead he was sent home again.

Horrifying: Less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry's father found him tragically dead in his bed

Then, less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry’s father found him dead in his bed.

It later emerged he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon.

Now his distraught mother and her husband Raymond, who have two other sons aged 11 and 17, are demanding a full investigation into the standard of care they received.

Mrs Connolly said: 'The fact remains that Harry died as a result of dehydration and acute renal failure despite being admitted to hospital twice and attended by an out-of-hours doctor in the space of just five days.

'He would have survived if he’d remained in hospital from 26 April and fully rehydrated, he would have survived had he been readmitted on 28 April, and would have survived had the out-of-hours doctor referred him to be readmitted on 29 April.

'Three opportunities to save my son were wasted.'

Mr and Mrs Connolly will be represented at an inquest into Harry’s death next week by law firm Access Legal from Shoosmiths.

Phil Barnes, a medical negligence specialist for the firm, said: 'We are supporting the family in the lead up to, during, and after the inquest process; and hope that it will produce a clear and definitive picture of the cause of Harry’s death.'

A spokesman for Northampton General Hospital said: 'In light of an impending inquest, we regret that we are unable to make any comment about the circumstances surrounding this case at the present time.'

A two-day inquest will start at Northampton General Hospital on Tuesday.
