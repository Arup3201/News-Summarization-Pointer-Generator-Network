A Government minister has backed a campaign to save horses from pain by allowing top-level riders to compete using bridles without the traditional metal bit.

Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister for care services, wants a change to the rules for dressage competitions.

At present, the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) demands that Olympic dressage riders use bitted bridles that go between the horses’ teeth.

The same rule is enforced at a national level in the UK and in most regional events.

But many riders prefer to use bitless bridles, arguing that the bit can cause severe nerve pain, tongue lacerations, pinching and breathing problems for horses.

In a letter to the national governing bodies, including the British Equestrian Federation, Mr Lamb lends his support to a campaign against bits by the Norfolk Horse Training and Equitation Club (NHTEC).

The Norfolk North MP writes: ‘A constituent showed me photographs where it appeared to me the horses [with bitted bridles] were clearly in pain. The request is for people to have the choice. I cannot really see the argument against.’

The traditional bit has been used by riders since ancient times.

But an internet debate about the safety of bitless bridles was sparked in March when Prince Edward’s ten-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor was pictured riding a pony using one. 

Campaigners argued that if a young Royal could ride a horse without a bit, it must be safe.

NHTEC secretary Johanna Macarthur said: ‘In some ways, we haven’t moved on since Bronze Age people were riding horses with these devices wedged in their mouths.

'Metal bits can be very painful for many horses, particularly those put under pressure to perform in competitive events. It’s high time riders were allowed to choose more horse-friendly bridles.’ 

British Dressage issued a statement supporting the FEI rules. It said: ‘A fundamental requirement in the education of the horse is the concept of submission and this includes the willing acceptance of the indications of the rider. This also means the acceptance by the horse of the bit in its mouth, just as much as the acceptance of the rider’s weight on its back.’

British Olympic dressage gold medallist Carl Hester wrote on Facebook in December: ‘I wouldn’t mind in the slightest if I competed against a bitless competitor. It’s a personal choice.’
