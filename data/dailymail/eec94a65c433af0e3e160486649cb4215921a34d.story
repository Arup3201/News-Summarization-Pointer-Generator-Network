Parents Philippa and Andrew Fenner, 
from Newcastle, were left all shook up when their first son Elvis made 
an early arrival two years ago, forcing Andrew, his father, to take on 
the role of midwife.

And it was a case of history repeating itself when second son Felix was born on September 1.

Not be outdone by his older brother, newborn Felix Fenner arrived into the world in similar dramatic fashion.

'They caught us out both times,' said 31-year-old Philippa, who had planned a home birth again.

Son Elvis, who will celebrate his second birthday later this month, surprised his parents when he arrived five days early on the living room floor of their home in Heaton, Newcastle.

But this time, second son Felix decided he would arrive in the couple's bedroom.

'The whole thing was complete comedy,' said Philippa. a researcher in the psychology department at Northumbria University.

'This time I woke up at 6am as normal and the contractions started, there may have been a few twinges in my sleep but not enough to wake me.

'They were four minutes apart and I just thought, I'm going to give birth today.

Andrew was forced to take on the role of midwife for the second time on September 1

'My husband had been out and got back in the early hours and he was a bit groggy so I said he had to start looking lively,' she said.

The couple then made arrangements for friends to look after son Elvis as they prepared for the birth of their second child.

But the contractions became closer together and soon Felix decided to make his grand entrance.

'The next half hour is a blur,' said Philippa, who has been with IT contractor Andrew, 39, for nine years.

Within 90 minutes of waking, Philippa was cradling her little Felix in her arms as the paramedics and midwife arrived

'I remember shouting to my husband, "It's happening again, the baby is coming",' she said.

Within 90 minutes of waking, Philippa was cradling her little Felix in her arms as the paramedics and midwife arrived.

Felix, who was also five days early, weighed 7lbs 14oz when he was born.
