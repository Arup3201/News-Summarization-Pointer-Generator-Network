The quick thinking of Max Willson, right,  saved his sister Mini, left, after she put her hand through glass

The son of former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson saved his sister's life by guiding an ambulance to a remote vineyard where they were staying in France - using a bottle of wine.

Max Willson, 16, rushed to help his 10-year-old sister Mini after she put her hand through a pane of glass and severed an artery while they were on holiday at the family's French château.

Their father was in Britain working and their mother was out at the time of the accident and the panicked teenager  did not know the address of the rural house to call emergency services.

Instead he attempted to stem the bleeding by using a towel, some duct tape, a place mat and a dog lead to hold it in place.

He then remembered they kept wine produced at the vineyard in the château cellar and rushed to grab a bottle so he could find the address on the label.

The teenager, who has Asperger's Syndrome, searched Google to find out how to ring emergency services in France before using a translator to explain to authorities what happened.

Through his directions, paramedics were able to find the estate and take his sibling, who was nine at the time of the accident, to hospital for treatment. 

Max said: 'I knew time was of the essence. You could bleed out with a wound like that.

'I put a red towel on a sign close to the house so they would know where to come to.

'At the end of the ordeal, I realised it's pretty amazing what you can do under pressure.'

The children were on holiday with their mother Michaela at the picturesque Chateau Gourgues near Saint-Emilion in the Bordeaux region of France in August last year when the accident happened.

Their father, former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson, was back in the UK at the time and his wife, who was on holiday with their children, was out

Max did not know the chateau's address but remembered the wine they kept in the cellar had the vineyard's address on and read that to call handler

Max, who boards at £27,000-a-year Bredon School near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, partly credits the training he received through the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for saving his sister's life.

The CCF is a Ministry of Defence-sponsored youth organisation which runs courses in school and Max has now been nominated him for a CCF award.

His motoring journalist father, who has appeared on several TV and radio shows including a stint on Top Gear, said: 'l'm enormously proud of him.

'For Max to cope like that on his own in a foreign country it makes his achievement even more impressive,' he added. 'Had he not acted so quickly, Mini might not be here now.'

He praised his son's school for providing cadet training and said it was doing a great job and he had written to the headmaster to tell him so.

'We underestimate these kids with these syndromes,' he said. 'It's surprising. When they're in the right educational environment, they can do stuff that the rest of us can't.'

Mr Willson bought Chateau Gourgues in 2005 and spent four years restoring it to its original grandeur complete with towers and turrets.

The journalist and his wife try to visit every weekend, and the family spent eight weeks at the vineyard, which produces Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rosé, over the summer.

In 2008 his Rosé won the highly commended award at the International Wine Challenge, and it is now stocked in local restaurants.
