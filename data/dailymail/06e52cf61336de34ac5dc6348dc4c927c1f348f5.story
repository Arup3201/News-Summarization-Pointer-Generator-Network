A 12-year-old schoolgirl who aspired to be a nurse died four days after falling ill with flu when the common virus attacked her heart.

Olivia Diamond, from Accrington in Lancashire died of myocarditis, a condition that causes inflammation of the heart muscle.

She first complained she felt ill on Saturday, October 4 - four days before she died.

But after her condition deteriorated the 12-year-old was taken to hospital before being transferred to a specialist unit where she passed away.

Olivia Diamond died on October 4, four days after she first complained of feeling ill. The 12-year-old was diagnosed with myocarditis, a condition where the heart muscle becomes inflamed 

Ms Diamond said: 'She was out playing with her best friend Macy on Saturday. 

'She came home, and sat and ate biscuits with a glass of milk. After half an hour, she said she did not feel well. 

'She had a headache and felt cold, but she was hot. She was hallucinating and had chest pains in the night.'

The family sought medical advice, before later contacting the family doctor, who prescribed medication.

They took her to Accrington Victoria Hospital on Wednesday after her condition continued to deteriorate.

Olivia was transferred to Manchester Children's Hospital after doctors suspected she had suffered a heart attack.

Ms Diamond said: 'She had a stent put in to rule out a heart attack. She had to be resuscitated because her blood pressure dropped.

'They said she did not have a heart attack, but said it was very weak. The flu virus got to her heart. The main pump stopped working.

Myocarditis is often triggered by a virus, which attacks the heart muscle. In Olivia's case doctors believe the flu virus, pictured under the microscope, caused her condition 

'Olivia knew what was coming because she was spending time individually with me and her dad, Chris. She said she loved us, and did not wake up again.' 

'Olivia meant everything to us,' she added .'We are taking it day by day, but instead of getting easier, it's getting harder. It's ripped my heart out to be honest.' 

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, and is usually caused by a virus. Cases range in cause and severity. Some recover completely, but it can cause serious health problems.

Olivia's mother described her daughter as a 'devoted' sister to Asif, Aleesha, Sophie and Kallie. 

'She did anything for them,' Ms Diamond.  'She wanted to become a nurse looking after sick children. She had a lot more to give. I can't get my head round the fact she is not here anymore.'

Olivia was fanatical about horses, and attended Accrington Horse Riding Centre. Her favourite horse Amos will be taken to her funeral, her mother said.

The service will be held later today in Clayton-le-Moors.  

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus.

Some of the most common infections which cause myocarditis, are those called adenovirus and Coxsackie B.

Others include:

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by a virus

Symptoms of the condition, include:

If the inflammation damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, complications can develop.

They can develop quickly, and include sudden loss of consciousness, an abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeat, and heart failure.

In most cases of viral myocarditis, the illness goes away and there are no complications.

In some cases the inflammation and damage is so severe the only treatment option is a heart transplant.

In very severe cases the condition is fatal. Also, some cases of sudden death in a previously healthy person are due to an acute myocarditis that develops rapidly.
