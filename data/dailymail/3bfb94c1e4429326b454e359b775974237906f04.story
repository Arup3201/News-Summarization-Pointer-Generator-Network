The Columbia University freshman who leaped to her death on the day she moved into her dormitory reportedly called her parents only hours before to say she felt suicidal, it has emerged.

The father of Martha Corey-Ochoa, 18, has also revealed his heartbreak at losing his only child on Monday, just hours after helping her move into her dorm at the New York City school.

'I feel like she was my life and, 
without her, my life seems to be gone,' George Ochoa told The Journal News. 
'I don't know what I'm doing now. We built our lives around her and now she's gone.'

Tragic: Columbia University freshman Martha Corey-Ochoa, 18, jumped to her death from her dorm window late on Monday night. She had reportedly called her parents to say she was 'suicidal'

Martha Corey-Ochoa made her fatal leap from the 14th floor of her university residence, John Jay Hall, at around 11 p.m. on Monday, only two hours after a session on dorm policy.

The teenager had a dazzling future ahead of her: she was valedictorian at Dobbs Ferry High School, a talented violinist and had planned to major in English and mathematics at the top university.

But she had also battled with mental health issues and was taking undisclosed medications. She attempted suicide last year and was briefly institutionalised, sources told the New York Post.

'She looked a little sad when she was 
saying goodbye to us,' Mr Ochoa, who himself had attended Columbia University, added. 'But she was controlled. She had it together.'

But she later called her parents 'and reported she felt suicidal', law-enforcement sources told the New York Post. It is not known how they responded.

She later jumped from the window of her single dorm and hit a ledge a floor below before plunging to the pavement at West 114th Street, where she was discovered by members of the track team.

'Everyone was out here seconds after it happened,' said witness Efraim Ramos, 54. 'Everyone was in the street, it was packed.'

'People were getting ready to go to a 
party but then I found out the building was sealed off and nobody was 
being allowed out or in,' said fellow John Jay Hall resident 19-year-old
Lucas Zeppetello.

The students alerted a doctor across the street at St. Luke's hospital. A university security officer said a paramedic and a nurse had been seen by a student running out of the hospital.

Martha left no note and there were no witnesses, according to the Journal News. An autopsy has not been scheduled, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said.

Loss: The teenager was remembered as studious and generous by neighbours in Dobbs Ferry

Her parents identified her body at the hospital and collected her violin and other belongings from the dorm.

Corey-Ochoa's mother Melinda is a professor at Mercy College and her father is a medical writer for the McMahon Group in Manhattan. They live in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

'She was a quiet girl, a very studious girl,' said Roberta Reynolds, a neighbour of the family.

'Whatever happened, she was not used to being away from the family. If she did do this, it's because she didn't want to disappoint her family. I don't know how the family will cope without her.

'She was a very intelligent girl, a 
wonderful musician, and she was very devoted to her parents. She was a 
very caring daughter. She was looking forward to excelling at school.'

The gifted student claimed she 
enjoyed reading 'Twlight' and Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment and she
listed English literature and calculus as some of her interests.

Jennifer Dawber, 52, said she recently congratulated Miss Corey-Ochoa's parents after they dropped her off at Columbia.

She
described the 18-year-old as kind, polite and extremely intelligent and
said it seemed as though Miss Corey-Ochoa was always in the newspaper 
for receiving academic awards.

In her valedictory speech at Dobbs Ferry High School in June, Corey-Ochoa had cited Shakespeare's character Othello, who commits suicide after a lifetime of guilt.

'Before we act, we must consider the consequences of our actions,' she said.

'We are terribly saddened to tell you
of the untimely death of one of our Class of 2012 graduates, Martha 
Corey-Ochoa,' said Dobbs Ferry schools superintendent Lisa Brady to the 
New York Post.

'A brilliant student and last yearâ€™s valedictorian, Martha had just begin her freshman year at Columbia University.'

Tragedy: Miss Corey-Ochoa was taken to nearby St Luke's hospital and pronounced dead there

Dean of Student Affairs Kevin 
Shollenberger informed students of the death in an email sent around 
2:15am, calling the death a tragedy.

'It's a time that our community needs to pull together and support one another,' Mr Shollenberger said.

'Our returning students should keep 
in mind our first-year students have just gotten here, and they are 
developing contacts and relationships and should be sensitive and reach 
out to one another.'

He said religious advisers and counsellors would be on hand today to talk to students and staff.

At
5.20am he sent another email revealing her name and writing: 'Martha 
was passionate about mathematics and literature, and recognized as a 
very talented writer.

'We
extend our deepest condolences to the family of this student. As we 
continue to cope with the loss of one of our valued community members, 
we remain committed to ensuring the health and well being of our 
Columbia family.'
