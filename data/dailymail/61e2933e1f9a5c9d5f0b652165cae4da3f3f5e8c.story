A bank worker has appeared in court charged with the murder of his young wife after her body was found by detectives just one month after they got married.

Jasvir Ram Ginday, 29, stood accused of killing wife Varkha Rami, 28, after the pair tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in India.

Neighbours said Varkha had only been in the UK a matter of weeks since she married her new husband.

Police have cordoned off the house while an extensive forensic investigation is carried out

Police have not yet identified the body which was found in a house on Victory Lane, Walsall

Nine other suspects, four
men and five women who are believed to be from the same family, were released on bail on Sunday pending further inquiries.

Ginday was formally charged after he was arrested at his family home on Friday, when police discovered the victim's body.

Wearing a light grey suit, a white shirt and glasses, Gindlay spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the five-minute hearing at Walsall Magistrates Court.

Members of the victims family crowded into the court’s public gallery to hear the charges against him read out.

He was remanded into custody until Wednesday when he will appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Roger Bleazard, prosecuting, told the court that no bail hearing could take place until Ginday appeared at crown court.

Committing him to the crown court, head of the bench Simon Hallam, said: 'The offence of murder cannot be dealt with at magistrates court.

'We are sending this to the crown court at 10am on Wednesday September 18.

'Any bail applications will be heard then, until then you are being remanded in custody.'

The woman had been reported missing before police found her body at around 8pm on Friday

Police have been carrying out extensive forensic searches of the detached property in Victory Road.

The arrests came a day after an unnamed woman was reported missing in Ginday’s home town of Walsall, West Midlands.

West
Midlands Police said further forensic tests will take place on Tuesday,
when the formal identification of the victim has taken place.

Lead
investigator DCI Sarbit Johal appealed for any witnesses to come 
forward, saying: 'We are undertaking numerous enquiries and are still 
really keen to speak to anyone who may have information that could help 
this investigation.'

After the arrests were made, one neighbour said: 
‘They’ve always seemed like such a lovely family. I think she had only 
recently come over here and that she had married one of the children, 
but it was over in India.’

The family are said to have celebrated another wedding last week, the source added.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
