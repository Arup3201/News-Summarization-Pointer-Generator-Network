Having played for Barcelona for over 16 years and represented Spain 133 times, Xavi has had the pleasure of lacing up his boots alongside many of the world's finest.

The 34-year-old veteran has also faced the best of British talent in the Champions League, helping the Catalan giants win the famous trophy on three occasions over the last decade. 

Luis Enrique's side are safely through to the knockout stages this season and, ahead of Monday's draw for the last 16, the midfield pass-master has picked his all-time UK XI to have played in Europe's elite club competition.

Goalkeeper: Fraser Forster

Defenders: Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, John Terry

Midfielders: Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Gascoigne

Forwards: Theo Walcott, Wayne Rooney 

Speaking to ShortList magazine, Xavi chose a 3-5-2 formation in order to accommodate five of the greatest midfielders to have been born in the British Isles.

The Spaniard began by picking his goalkeeper, surprisingly opting for Southampton No 1 Fraser Forster.

The England man, who joined Saints from Celtic last summer, put in some inspired displays against Barca during his time in Glasgow - after one match the Catalan press dubbed him the 'Yellow Wall' - all of which stuck in the memory of Xavi.

'Barcelona have met Celtic four times in recent seasons, and every time Forster put in an incredible performance,' he said. 'In the games we've played, he's made some of the best saves I have ever seen.'

Lining up in the veteran's defensive three are former England trio Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and John Terry.

All three have faced Xavi and Barcelona in the Champions League, with Ferdinand part of Manchester United's back-four in final defeats by the La Liga side in 2009 and 2011. Chelsea skipper Terry enjoyed both success and failure against Lionel Messi and Co and Campbell scoring in Arsenal's 2-1 loss to Frank Rijkaard's men in 2006.

It's no surprise to see ex-United star Paul Scholes included in midfield, with Xavi having spoken of his admiration for the ginger-haired maestro on plenty of occasions.

'Technically the best English player since Matt Le Tissier, who I grew up watching,' said Xavi. 'Just unbelievably gifted. Every time I played against him or watched him on TV he made everything look so easy. I've never seen anyone make playing that well look so effortless.'

Former Rangers and Lazio playmaker Paul Gascoigne, ex-Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard and Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs also make the cut in midfield, although Xavi reserved special praise for Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard.

He said: 'John Barnes was one of the first midfield players I remember watching and appreciating his technical skill. Gerrard is just as good and, like Frank [Lampard], he has every attribute you need to be a Barcelona player.'

The former Spain star, who retired from international duty after last summer's World Cup, chose two forwards from Roy Hodgson's current England set-up to lead the line for his all-time XI.

Arsenal favourite Theo Walcott, although used more as a wide player, was picked after helping the Gunners fight back for a 2-2 draw against Barca at the Emirates in 2010.

And Xavi opted for United striker Wayne Rooney to partner him, insisting that the 29-year-old would easily fit into Barcelona's tiki-taka style.

'Wayne was very complimentary about the way Barcelona play,' he said.

'He would have fitted into our style of play no problem, but Manchester United would never have wanted to let one of the best players in the world leave. He's still the player who makes things happen for them.'
