Shameless water firms have been chasing customers in debt by using threatening letters from ‘invented’ third-party companies.

The letters appear to be from an external debt agency, but are actually from the water companies themselves.

The strategy is part of the psychological warfare used to turn the screw on customers with money troubles, by making them believe their debt has been passed to an outside company.

But the tactic has been condemned by consumer groups and MPs as underhand and potentially illegal. However, some of the water companies involved insist they are doing nothing wrong.

Earlier this year, payday loan giant Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were harassed with threatening letters from firms that it invented to chase debts. 

Subsequently, the head of the Student Loans Company apologised after it emerged the government agency had been using similar tactics.

Recently, the chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, condemned high street banks for using the ploy to turn the screw on customers.

And energy regulator Ofgem has warned power companies that their use of third-party names for their own debt collection or legal departments was unacceptable.

Research by BBC Radio 4’s You & Yours found that 12 of the largest water firms had used the third-party-letter ploy at some point.

Demanding: Thames Water sent letters from 'County Wide Collections' - which is part of the same company

Five were still doing so earlier this year although this has now been reduced to two.

Typically, the name of the debt collection company appears in large print at the top the letters sent to customers. Often the small print reveals it is linked to the water company, but sometimes no link is made.

Thames Water sends out letters headed County Wide Collections, which is actually part of the company’s debt collection department.

In the past, this connection was not spelt out, however the small print now states County Wide is part of Thames Water group.

A spokesman said the use of a third-party name works and it plans to continue with the policy. He added: ‘We try hard to engage with our customers in arrears.

‘This is a long process, but our open and transparent letters do increase in severity.

‘When it gets to a final letter, we have found the use of an internally branded debt collection agency approach to be effective and cost efficient.’

Yorkshire Water has been sending letters to some customers in arrears under the name Rockford Debt Collections Ltd. It has changed them recently to include a statement in the small print that it is linked to Yorkshire Water.

It defended the practice, saying: ‘Any customer who receives a letter from Rockford would already have received three letters from Yorkshire Water urging them to get in touch, as well as a text.’

Other water firms including Northumbrian Water, Affinity Water and Welsh Water stopped sending such letters this year.

Citizens Advice condemned the aggressive approach. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘We’re not saying don’t pursue debt. Clearly companies are entitled to do that, but we are saying that they really ought to do that honestly and with some sensitivity.

‘These letters are about increasing the level of aggression to get payment.

‘They’re made on the assumption that people won’t pay rather than actually that many can’t.'
