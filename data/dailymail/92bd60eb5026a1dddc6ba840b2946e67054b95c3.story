A group of Florida teenagers killed a pelican by blowing cigarette smoke into its beak and then closing it shut so the bird couldn't breathe. 

Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission say the savage January 16 attack was caught on a surveillance camera at an upscale Fort Lauderdale condominium complex.

According to FWCC spokeswoman Liz Barraco, a security guard at the apartment complex told officials about the attack on the bird, described as a brown pelican.

Barraco told the South Florida Sun Sentinel one suspect held the bird down and blew fumes from an electronic cigarette into its beak and eyes.

He then held the pelican's beak closed so it could not draw a breath, repeating the action multiple times until it died.

Pelicans have no nostrils, so they cannot breathe unless their beak is open.  

The main suspect is charged with a violation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Barraco says he'll likely be placed in a juvenile diversion program.

The names of the teenagers have not been released because they are minors.

According to wildlife officials, the pelican was captured by a group of teens at around 1am January 16 and brought to the Venetian condominium tower, where one of the suspects lives with his family.

After questioning the boy, who is believed to be 16 or 17 years old, sheriff's officials identified him as the ringleader in the sadistic slaying of the bird. 

In the 1970s, the brown pelican was an endangered species, but the ban on the pesticide DDT has helped the birds make a strong comeback. 

Large populations of brown pelicans can be found in estuaries along both the east and west coasts.
