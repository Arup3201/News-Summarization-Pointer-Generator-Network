Four months, fourteen miles and a change of surface separate Wimbledon from this week’s proceedings at the 02 Arena but not much seemed to have altered on Sunday for Andy Murray.

Having played a strangely lacklustre match on his last appearance in London – the quarter final defeat to Grigor Dimitrov at SW19 – he lobbed in a similarly curious performance to open the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

Except this one was even worse. Whereas the Bulgarian had excelled beyond himself on that summer afternoon Kei Nishikori did not even have to produce his best to win 6-4 6-4 and jeopardise Murray’s hopes for this week at the 02 Arena.

Now he will surely have to win both his last two matches, starting tomorrow against Canada’s Milos Raonic, who let slip a set point on Sunday night before going down 6-1 7-6 to a determined Roger Federer in the second match of Group B.

Before subsiding 7-0 in the tiebreak the big-serving Raonic caused the Swiss master sufficient problems to reinforce how dangerous he is.

Like Nishikori, he was making his debut at this tournament and was nervous at the start. Unlike the Japanese player he was up against an opponent in Federer who was ruthlessly sharp enough to take advantage from the off, rather than Murray, who was reluctant to take the initiative.

Both opening matches drew an excess of 17,000 spectators, and those who packed the venue to its dimly-lit rafters for the first session were to be reminded of an eternal truth about the 27 year-old Scot: for all his career achievements you are still never quite sure what you are going to get with him.

Not much, it turned out, on this occasion. He was desperately vulnerable on his serve and stuck so far back behind the baseline in the rallies there was a danger of him incurring a fee for parking.

Surprisingly sanguine afterwards, he dismissed the notion that the left calf muscle he had treated might have been a factor.

'I felt okay on the court today, I don’t think that was the reason I lost the match,' said Murray. 'If this was anywhere else I would be out of the tournament. I’m definitely going to have to play better if I am going to get through.'

All his supporters can hope for now is that, with back to the wall, he shows the same resolve that drove him to play six consecutive weeks in Asia and Europe to qualify for this eight-man field in the first place.

You suspect he instinctively prefers to be in that situation anyway as he has never been a great front runner, which is what he might have considered himself to be against 02 new boy Nishikori.

Murray’s demeanour was certainly flat, despite the fact that he was given a rousing enough welcome, and his second serve took particular punishment.

He denied afterwards suggestions on Sunday from Greg Rusedski that he has made deliberate if subtle changes to his action since back surgery: 'I wouldn’t have intentionally changed serve because I wasn’t getting any problems with my back from my service action,' he said. 'At the end of the year I will look at video from before and now to see if things have evolved.' 

Nishikori capitalised upon numerous mistakes on Murray's second serve, as Murray failed to settle

He is bound to be aware of minor changes in his ball toss already, and it is something he will have to review with head coach Amelie Mauresmo, who also has to fathom out a complex temperament that leaves him so prone to letdowns.

In his previous match, against Novak Djokovic in Paris ten days ago, he competed well before mentally tuning out and collapsing in the last five games.

There was no sign of the resourcefulness or fight that carried him to three ATP titles in six weeks, and also absent was any of the all-court attacking intent she would like to instil in him.

Nishikori was there for the taking early on and could not a land a first serve in. He pretty much gifted Murray a break to fall 3-2 behind but then had the donation reciprocated straightaway before the first set was dismally conceded. 

Murray's next games are against Roger Federer and Milos Raonic and he will have to play much better

A brief glimpse of attacking purpose was given when Murray got back from 1-4 to 4-4 in the second, but he was broken again to lose the match with a backhand that went almost embarrassingly long beyond the baseline. A curious performance indeed.

Further down the scale, British number two James Ward narrowly missed out on entering the world’s top 100 for the first time when he lost 6-4 6-1 to Australian John Millman in final of the ATP Challenger in Melbourne.

The 27 year-old Londoner, who has now ended his season, is likely to go up to around 102 in the new rankings and already should be assured of a direct entry into January’s Australian Open.
