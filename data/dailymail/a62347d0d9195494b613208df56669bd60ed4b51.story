An abortion doctor who is serving consecutive life sentences for performing countless grisly and unorthodox late-term abortions at his Philadelphia clinic is speaking out in defense of his heinous crimes.

Kermit Gosnell, 72, whose crimes include snipping the spinal cords of live, partially birthed infants, says he was on a mission to help eradicate poverty.

A new interview with Gosnell, who was handed a third life sentence this past May, portrays the killer physician as unrepentant and even proud of his work as 'a soldier at war with poverty.'

Unrepentant: Gosnell is pictured leaving the Criminal Justice Center after he was found guilty in May. The abortionist ran a gore-filled clinic of horrors for decades but says it was part of his crusade against poverty

Philadelphia reporter Steve Volk sat with Gosnell in prison. His exclusive interview with the man who he says comes off as charismatic and intelligent appears Tuesday in Philadelphia magazine article.

‘He believes himself to be innocent,’ Volk told ABC News. ‘In this larger spiritual sense. He believes he was performing a service for people that asked him. He believes he was a soldier at war with poverty. He has a sense of righteousness, that whatever rule he broke, it was worth it.’

Volk believes Gosnell sees abortion as sinful but that alleviating patients' poverty--compounded by the financial burdens of parenthood--outweighed that sin.

'It's not as if he feels guilty about what he did. He sees the world is a dark place. He sees himself as having performed a noble function in society. For him, in a perfect, idealized world, it wouldn't be necessary,' Volk told ABC.

'House of Horrors': Testimony from workers and other witnesses portrayed Gosnell's clinic in an impoverished Philadelphia neighborhood as a horrifying, filthy place filled with the body parts of aborted babies

War against poverty: Gosnell is serving consecutive life sentences. He maintains in an interview from jail that hits news stands Tuesday that he was working for good and that abortion, though sinful, was less so than living in poverty

Gosnell has been imprisoned since 2011. ABC News reports that since then he’s been studying the Bible, learning Spanish, and exercising. He’s even been reaching out to charities like the Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation to speak out about prison issues.

‘He believes that he gained insight into what it's like to be pushed into the system, without the capacity to explain himself,’ Volk told ABC. ‘He believes if he could have spoken about his rationale for doing things, he wouldn't be in jail.’

Gosnell's trial revealed atrocities that shook pro-choice and anti-abortion Americans alike.

Authorities alleged he used scissors to sever partially-birthed infant’s spinal cords. Plastic bags full of body parts were found in a refrigerator at the Philadelphia practice. He and his staff brought about the deaths of an untold number of birthed and partially birthed children in medically unsafe and grisly ways in his 30 years as a practicing physician.

In court testimony, the jury heard how a clinic employee had photographed a baby after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk you to the bus stop.'

Clinic workers also testified that they had another a little baby girl move her arm before her neck was snipped, killing her.

And yet another infant was born in the
clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get out of the toilet 
before a worker snipped that child’s spine as well.

Gosnell's
grotesque business was discovered more than two years ago when 
authorities went to investigate prescription drug trafficking at 
Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area of West Philadelphia.

Unfathomable: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice

Sickening: The jury saw another photo of bags of body parts. One witness said a sink was plunged and a baby's arm came out. Another report said a toilet had to be removed when a baby became lodged in a pipe

They came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report.

The tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, even cat-food containers.

The report added that dozens of women were injured at Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of horrors'.

Some left with torn wombs or bowels, some
with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of non-sterilized 
equipment, and some left with fetal remains still inside them, the 
report alleged.

Employees at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.'

Former staffers testified that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended.

Gosnell is also serving time for a large-scale drug distribution outfit. He pleaded guilty to federal drug distribution charges in July.

The dual businesses apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions.

Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.
