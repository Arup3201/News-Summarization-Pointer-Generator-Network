A grandmother trapped by fire was seen screaming ‘Help me! Help me!’ from her bedroom window before she and her husband died in the blaze.

Anna Crowther, 46, and her husband Victor, 48, were trapped in their terraced house in Hull when the fire broke out at 6am on Saturday.

Neighbours rushed to help after hearing desperate Mrs Crowther's screams.

Floral tributes: A man and woman living in this house in Hull died after a fire which may have been started by fairy lights

But before they could do anything fire exploded through the front window of the house, which the fire service say did not have a smoke alarm.

Fire investigators say the fire could have been started by fairy lights it is believed the Crowthers had wrapped around the bannister of their home.

Three fire engines and 15 fire fighters fought the blaze, which left the house so badly damaged that when fire crews entered the stairs collapsed.

Neighbours had tried to rescue the couple with ladders, but were beaten back by the fierce heat.

Dad-of-one Danny Draper, 28, a tree surgeon who lives opposite the Crowthers, said: 'I could hear Anna screaming out of the window, the fire was at the back of the house.

'We got the ladder there but before I could go up the window popped. Anna had been at the small window at the top screaming, but the entire frame just blew out.

'Then we didn't hear anything, the screaming stopped. 

'There was thick, black smoke all over the street. I went up the ladder but it was too hot.

'There was a leg hanging out of the window, I hope the kids on the street didn't see that.

'I tried to get in through the front door. I managed to kick the porch door open and was trying to get in the second when the fire brigade arrived.'

Terrified Ms Allison grabbed five-month-old daughter Mia and rushed out of her house, covering the baby's head with a blanket to protect her from the heavy smoke outside.

'I was going to drop the baby around a neighbour's house across the road and try and come back and smash the window with a hammer or something,' she said.

'But by the time I got outside she had stopped screaming, she was gone.

'I will never forget the sound of her cries for help, I haven't been able to sleep since it happened.

'I saw them the day before and it was so normal. They were such lovely people, she had a cat she adored.'

Tragedy: Fire investigators are trying to work out what caused the fire, which was so fierce it the stairs in the house collapsed as fire crews entered

Neighbours searched for the couple's beloved cat Theo after the fire and thought he too had perished, but he turned up in the evening.

Neighbour Paul Metheringham, 46, who is now looking after Theo, said: 'Anna loved her cat and we thought it had died too. It's a small mercy the cat survived. 

'It came back to the house and was stood there looking lost so I took it in.'

Devastated children Samantha, 28, and Darrel, 26, came to view the charred remains of the house today.

Samantha said: 'We are heartbroken. They were such lovely people, they lived for their grandchildren. They were so loving. We can't believe they are gone.

The pair are comforting younger brother Jamie, 25, Samantha's son Dillon, three, and Darrel's daughter Chenille, four, as they come to terms with the tragedy.

There are still shards of glass on the pavement outside the house, which has a number of floral tributes left outside.

One heartbreaking message read: 'Mum and dad, I love you so much. I can't believe you've gone and won't be here anymore. 

'We will always miss you. I hope you're both together and happy where you are. I'll miss you forever, bye, Sami, Dillon, Darrel, Jamie.'

Grim search: A fire investigator sifts through charred rubble to gather evidence at the rear of the house. The couple are believed not to have owned a fire alarm

Fire investigation teams are now trying to find the cause of the fire.

The Crowthers, who were both non-smokers, are believed to have had fairy lights around their bannister, officers are investigating these as well as electrical appliances at the burnt-out home.

Humberside Fire Group leader Keith Evans said: 'We were alerted to a fire on Montrose Street at 6.15am yesterday (SAT) and we mobilised three pumping appliances and 15 fire fighters who were at the scene within three minutes.

'The conditions were severe and all three emergency services were at the scene.

'Unfortunately by the time we were able to locate the occupants, there was no further medical assistance that could be offered.

'Fire fighting operations continued in the extremely damaged property until 7am and a specialist fire investigation team are continuing an in depth investigation. 

'It is believed that the occupants did not have a smoke alarm. I would urge all householders to ensure they have a working smoke alarm in their homes.

'Our thoughts are with Anna and Victor's family.'
