Hollywood's latest epics really test the capacity of the average bladder. So anyone going to see Les Miserables (2hrs 38mins), Lincoln (2hrs 30mins) or The Hobbit (2hrs 46mins) will love this app.

RunPee, which is available on Apple, Android and Windows phones, tells you the best times to dash to the loo without missing any key scenes.

Don't you hate when needing the loo interrupts a good movie? Or when you leave to go to the bathroom and accidentally miss the best scene?

Thanks to RunPee, you can safely miss the queues for the loo at the beginning of the movie, and just nip out during a dull bit

The staff behind the app make a note of any three-to-five minute slots when the film starts to drag a bit.

Helpfully, the app then gives you a synopsis of what happened while you were away.

Films up to 90 minutes get one break, but for longer movies the app offers two or three possible slots. It costs 69p from runpee.com.

Never suffer with your legs knotted together in a film again thanks to the magic of RunPee
