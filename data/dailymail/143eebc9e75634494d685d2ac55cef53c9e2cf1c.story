MK Dons’ 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli will have the chance to show why the Premier league’s big boys are after him against Manchester United on Tuesday night.

Alli has taken League One by storm since establishing himself as one of the Dons’ key men at a tender age.

The highly-rated midfielder made his debut in 2012 in an FA Cup first round match against Cambridge City at the age of 16 and his first goal for the club came in the replay at stadium:mk.

Talent: 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli will come up against Manchester United on Tuesday night

Alli was strongly linked with a move to Liverpool in the summer, having been monitored by the Anfield giants throughout the year.

Liverpool were hopeful of completing a £3.5million summer swoop for Alli and the Anfield club had opened talks with the League One club over a move for the 18-year-old midfielder. 

MK Dons manager Karl Robinson raves about him, saying earlier this year: 'He is one of the most gifted 17-year-olds this country has ever seen.

'I've said from the word go, he's as good as it gets and he's the best young player I've ever worked with.’

Although he made his debut in 2012, it was last season where he became an important figure in the Dons’ starting XI, making a total of 37 appearances, scoring seven goals.

The Milton Keynes-born star is known for his intelligence and maturity on the ball, a trait seldom seen in someone so young (he was born in 1996, don’t forget). 

Robinson’s young prodigy also managed to net his first professional hat-trick last season in a 3-1 victory over Notts County.

It is obvious Alli has an eye for goal as in his last season for the under 18s, he finished as the top scorer with 17, leading him to sign a three-year professional contract. 

He has started this season in a similar fashion, already netting his first goal of the season in the 3-2 loss at Peterborough United.

Alli has made nine and two appearances for the England Under 17s and 18s respectively but is yet to get on the scoresheet at international level.

Having shown so much promise, if Alli is able to continue his progress it’s hard to see him remaining an MK Dons player for much longer, especially if he impresses against Premier League opponents.

Indeed, the side he’s facing on Tuesday night could well be his future destination.
