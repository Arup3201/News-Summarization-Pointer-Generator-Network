One of the main features Apple devices are missing is the option to easily increase an iPhone and iPad's built-in storage.

But now a company from California has created a USB flash drive that connects to Apple's Lightning connector. 

It’s not the first flash drive to feature a Lightning connector, but it is the first to be approved by Apple and can be used to stream films when there's no web connection, or easily transfer files to a PC.

Called iStick, the device, pictured, was created by 
San Francisco firm HYPER. It’s not the first USB drive to feature a Lightning connector, but it is the first to be approved by Apple and can be used to stream films when there's no web connection, or easily transfer files to a PC

Capacity: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB and 128GB

Connectors: Standard USB 2.0 and Apple MFi-Certified Lightning Connector

Dimensions: 51.6 x 28.6 x 9.1mm

Weight: 10g

Colours: White, black, gold and silver

Compatibility: iPhone 5, 5S and 5C, iPad (4th generation), iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina display, iPad Air, iPod touch (5th generation)

Early Bird Prices (50% off retail price): $65 (£3) for 8GB, $85 (£50) for a 16GB model, $100 (£59) for 32GB, $150 (£89) for the 64GB version and $199 (£118) for 128GB.

Called iStick, the device was created by San Francisco firm HYPER, which currently makes portable power packs for Apple’s Macbook, as well as other Apple accessories.

Storage options range from 8GB to 64GB and Early Bird Kickstarter prices, which offer 50 per cent off the retail price, start at $65 (£38).

Other prices include $85 (£50) for a 16GB model, $100 (£59) for 32GB, $150 (£89) for the 64GB version and $199 (£118) for 128GB.

The drive can be used to store files, including films, music, photos and documents, and transfer these files to a computer or any device with a USB connector. 

At the moment, the best way to increase storage on an Apple device is to upload it to the cloud, but this is less secure than a USB drive and becomes near-on useless without a web connection. The iStick, pictured, removes the need for this connection and means users can stream films on a plane, for example

Once the Kickstarter project ends on 17 June, prices are expected to rise to $129 (£77) for 8GB, $169 (£100) for 16GB, $199 (£118) for 32GB, $299 (£177) for 64GB and $399 (£237) for 128GB.

The iStick is due to be shipped by August and shipping costs outside the U.S will add an extra $10 (£6) to the price.

To use iStick, owners will additionally need to download an iOS app, which will be available after the stick has launched.

The iStick is due to be shipped by August. It will be available in white, black, gold and silver and will be compatible with the iPhone 5, 5S, pictured left, 5C, pictured right, the iPad (4th generation), iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina display, iPad Air, pictured centre, and iPod touch (5th generation)
