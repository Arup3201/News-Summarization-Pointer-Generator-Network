Police have detained a man after Aaron Cook, 16, fell from a bridge over the M6 motorway and was hit by a car

A motorist has been arrested by police investigating the death of a 16-year-old boy who fell from a bridge onto a motorway.

The driver was detained after college student Aaron Cook fell about 30 feet into the path of oncoming traffic on the M6 motorway on Saturday morning.

Four vehicles swerved to avoid the teenager, but a fifth vehicle ran him over as he lay on the carriageway. The driver then sped away without stopping or reporting the accident.

Today Lancashire Police said a 38-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the death near junction 28 of the motorway at Leyland.

The suspect, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was also being questioned on suspicion of failing to notify police of an accident.

Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the tragedy to come forward.

The southbound carriageway was closed for six hours between junctions 27 and 28 for a scene investigation to be carried out.

Sgt Dave Hogarth from the Force Road Policing Unit said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life and we are doing all we can to identify his next of kin and establish the circumstances of exactly what happened.

the dead boy’s family said: 'Aaron Cook was 16 years old, studying 
Childcare at Runshaw College.

'He wanted to be a Nursery Teacher. He 
loved spending time with his friends and family and will be deeply 
missed.

 from the tormentors.
