Love him or loathe him, you can’t deny he’s entertaining.

Conor McGregor delivered on his promise to stop Dennis Siver – before clambering out of the Octagon to confront the watching featherweight champion Jose Aldo.

McGregor’s victory in Boston, which came in the second round, sets him up for a shot at the long-reigning king of the division in Las Vegas in May.

'I just saw his little skinny Brazilian face,' said McGregor.

'They thought I was going to see my girlfriend but I was going to kill that Brazilian.

'Thankfully they stopped me. 

‘Everyone keeps talking about the talk, but they never talk about the skill or the technique because they know I own that.

‘He [Aldo] is one of them saying it’s all talk; it’s not all talk.

‘I’m going to wipe out the division.

‘He’s going to spit shine that belt ready for me to take it.’

Aldo responded to the uninvited guest at his Octagon-side seat with a grin.

'He's just a joke and a court jester to me so all I do is laugh at him,' he said.

'I think it's great for the UFC and I definitely think it will be the biggest fight in the weight class we've ever seen.

'Dennis Siver is a seasoned fighter but he is not of the calibre of people I've faced before.

'I'm not impressed. I know what I'm going to do to him.'

Referee Herb Dean stepped in to halt Siver's punishment as McGregor continued to look impressive

McGregor had promised to stop Siver inside two minutes and he made his intentions clear from the second he entered the Octagon, flicking his middle finger as the two squared off.

And he started the fight as if he was desperate for an early night, opening with two body kicks  and attempting a spinning wheel kick.

The Dubliner was also enjoying success with his hands but he was momentarily dropped by a leg kick, only to bounce back to his feet.

Siver remained in contention until McGregor took control from midway through the session, following up a jumping knee with a straight left as the German's face began to mark up badly.

And he had no answer to McGregor's array of shots as he closed out the round in style before picking up where he left off at the bell to start the second stanza.

After several attempts at a spinning kick, it was a simple left that floored Siver and McGregor sensed the finish was close. He rained in another barrage, forcing referee Herb Dean to intervene.

'I felt it went exactly as I thought it would,' McGregor said. I said the two minute mark but I didn't want to rush it.

'I wanted to find comfort in calm in there and spend more time in there.

'I said I was going to wipe out the division and there's one man left. When we collide, he will collapse.'
