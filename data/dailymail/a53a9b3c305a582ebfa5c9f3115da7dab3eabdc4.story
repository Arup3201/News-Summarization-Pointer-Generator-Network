The bombshell secret videos of Mitt Romney at a Florida fundraiser in May miss out 'one to two minutes' of the Republican nominee's remarks, the magazine that released the footage has admitted.

It may never be known what was said in the gap between the two parts of the 49-minute video. The missing section is shortly after Romney's now infamous comment that 'there are 47 percent who are with him [President Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.'

The first tape ends: 'We do all these polls - I find it amazing. We poll all these people to see where you stand in the polls but 45 percent of the people vote for the Republicans and 48 or 49...'

In the second, it picks up with Romney talking about a completely different subject: '...about twice as much as China, not 10 times as much like is reported. And we have responsibility for the whole world, they’re only focused on one little area of the world, the South China Sea...'

Mother Jones billed the 49 minutes as 'raw and uncut' and 'full.'

David Corn, the Mother Jones reporter who broke the story, told Politico that the video was published as he received it from his unidentified source.

'When we put up the full video, the source said - and I have no reason not to believe him - that the device that was being used inadvertently shut down or timed-out,' he told Politico.

'As soon as he knew that, he turned 
the camera back on and, at most, one to two minutes were missed. The 
video came to me as two separate files, and that is how we posted it on 
the website.'

It is not 
known who passed the video to Mother Jones, though it has been widely 
speculated that a member of the waiting staff, rather than a donor who 
paid $50,000 to listen to Romney, is the culprit.

Bona fide: The Romney campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video

The taping of the event may have been illegal.

Florida law requires that anyone taping conversations has to get the permission of everyone involved - something that clearly did not happen in this case.

But no 'victim' has complained in this
instance and even if one did it might be ruled that Romney had no 
'reasonable expectation of privacy' in this case because his remarks 
were to 100 people and the fundraiser was therefore essentially a public
event.

One of the great 
mysteries of the Watergate scandal was the missing 18.5 minutes of a 
potentially incriminating Oval Office tape of President Richard Nixon 
that had been subpoenaed by prosecutors.

Rose Mary Wood, Nixon's secretary, said she might have erased several minutes by accidentally pressing record but many suspected damaging material was deliberately wiped.

It also emerged from the 'full' tape that Romney had spoken of an event similar to the Iranian hostage crisis that helped end Jimmy Carter's presidency in 1980 could be an 'opportunity' for him.

The Republican presidential candidate
said that if he were a confronted with a hostage situation before
the presidential election, he would 'take advantage' of it.

He was responding to a question about
the Iran crisis, which is credited with defeating Jimmy Carter in 1980 
and ushering in Ronald Reagan.

He said: 'One of the things that’s frustrating to me: in a typical day like this, when I do three or four events like this, the number of foreign policy questions I get is between zero and one. 

'And the American people are not concentrated at all on China, on Russia, Iran, Iraq, and this President’s failure to put in place a status of forces agreement allowing ten to twenty thousand troops to stay in Iraq- unthinkable!

'And yet, in that election, in the 
Jimmy Carter election, the fact that we had hostages in Iran, I mean, 
that was all we talked about. And we had the two helicopters crash in 
the desert, I mean, that was the focus, and so him solving that made all
the difference in the world. 

'I’m
afraid today that if you simply got Iran to agree to stand down on 
nuclear weapons, they'd go, "Now hold on. It’s really a -" I mean, if 
something of that nature presents itself I will work to find a way to 
take advantage of the opportunity.'

Gracious host: Hedge fund manager Marc Leder threw the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where the Mother Jones video was recorded

The videos have exposed Romney for making more gaffes after the full transcript of his controversial speech was made public.

Romney - who is worth $250million - jokes he is 'as poor as a church mouse' and blasts late night chat show host David Letterman, who on Tuesday interviewed President Obama.

In clumsy anti-immigration comments, he also says: 'If you have no skill or experience... you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life.'

As Romney tries to move past the headlines about the secretly taped video, his campaign is framing the 48 days until the election as a choice between 'two visions for America.'

In an attempt to turn the tables on 
Obama, whose super PAC allies have already released ads featuring the 
Florida fundraiser, the Romney campaign is highlighting a 1998 audio 
tape of Obama, then an Illinois state senator, talking about being in 
favour of redistributing wealth.

Explaining himself: Romney appeared on Fox New Channel on Tuesday to talk about the Mother Jones video

Matt Rhoades, Romney's campaign manager, argued in a memo  that the differences between  Obama and Romney have become sharper.

'Mitt Romney's vision for America is an opportunity society, where free people and free enterprise thrive and success is admired and emulated, not attacked,' he wrote.

In the audio tape, Obama asks: 'How do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution? Because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot.'

Rhoades argued in the memo: 'Mitt Romney has a different idea. He knows that we need to foster growth and create wealth, not redistribute wealth, if our economy is to grow the way it has in the past.'
