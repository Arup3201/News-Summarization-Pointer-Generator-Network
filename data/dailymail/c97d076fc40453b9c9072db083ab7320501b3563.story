Stressed civil servants at three of Whitehall’s flagship government departments took the equivalent of more than 125 years off sick last year.

Staff at the Home Office, Department for Education and Department for Communities and Local Government were absent for more than 46,000 days for stress, anxiety or depression in 2012-13.

The sickness rate in parts of the civil service is four times higher than the rest of the UK workforce.

At the Home Office, an average of 1.3 days were taken in 2012-13, almost three times the national average

Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows 30million workers in Britain took a total of 15.2million days off with stress, anxiety and depression last year.

It means employees from all sectors took on average 0.5 days off in 2013 because of the disorders.

But in Whitehall departments, hit by spending cuts and policy overhauls, the rates are much higher.

Staff at the Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) took an average of 1.8 days - four times the national figure.

Figures released by DCLG show the number of sick days rose in the last five years, despite deep cuts to staff numbers.

In 2012-13 a total of 3,052 days were taken off for mental health reasons, equivalent to nine years.

The figure has risen from 2,662, or seven years, in 2008-09. Over the same period staff numbers have fallen by a quarter to 1,681.

A DCLG spokesman said: ‘The civil service considers the long-term health of its staff to be of paramount importance.

‘In April 2013 the Department introduced a new comprehensive policy for managing long-term sickness absence and offers a number of wellbeing services to staff.’

Sickness rates at Theresa May's Home Office and Michael Gove's Department for Education are much higher than the national average

Staff at Michael Gove’s Department for Education took 5,156 days or 14 years off for mental health reasons in 2012-13.

It reverse falls in recent years and markjs a return to levels previously seen in 2008-09.

At the Home Office, an average of 1.3 days were taken in 2012-13, almost three times the national average.

Staff at Theresa May’s department took 37,950 days suffering from stress, depression and anxiety in 2012-13 and 45,182 days in 2011-12.

The figures cover staff working at the central Whitehall department as well as its executive agencies, such as the troubled UK Border Agency.

However, the ministry said the data was ‘unreliable’ because the recording of workers' reasons for being off had not been standardised across the department and agencies.
