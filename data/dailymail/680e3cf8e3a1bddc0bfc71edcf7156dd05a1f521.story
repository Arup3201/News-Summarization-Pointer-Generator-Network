The 
Campaign for Housing in Later Life has been launched at a Westminster 
summit - and its mission is to avert what the think-tank Demos has 
called 'the next big housing crisis'.

Fronted by Esther Rantzen and 
backed by housing providers as well as the charity Shelter, it aims to 
convince councils to recognise the changing needs of older people.

Demos
 says there is a 'chronic undersupply of appropriate housing for older 
people', and more and more are living in homes that are unmanageable.

This has a negative impact not just on their health and wellbeing but on
 the rest of the housing chain, because properties are not being freed 
up for families desperate to get on the ladder.

One man who has 
managed to make the switch from large family home to retirement 
accommodation is Buckinghamshire widower Derek Carr - thanks to his 
daughter Paula. Returning from New Zealand to live with her father, she 
saw him struggling with the house and garden and suggested he downsize. 'I
 didn't want to change my GP, and found a development in Princes 
Risborough that allowed me to stay with the practice,' says Derek, 75.

The
 former insurance broker sold his house in Naphill and bought a 
one-bedroom apartment at nearby Windsor Lodge, run by Churchill 
Retirement Living, for £275,000 on a long lease. He spends half the year
 at a holiday apartment in Spain, so the fact that the property would  
be looked after while he was away appealed to him. Another plus was that
 the town centre is just a few minutes' walk away.

Windsor Lodge 
comprises 46 private one- and two-bedroom apartments designed for 
retired owners. There is a lounge for coffee mornings, games afternoons 
and cream teas, and a manager is on hand to deal with any problems.

Another
 boon for Derek - the brother of late anti-smoking 'guru' Allen Carr - 
is that the development has guest rooms where visiting family can stay.

A
 Demos report last month estimated that if all those interested in 
buying retirement property were able to do so, 3.29 million properties 
would be freed up.
