It has now been revealed that disgraced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling even discriminated against white players.

Clippers guard J.J. Redick claims Sterling showed signs of wavering on a sign and trade deal reached last summer with the Orlando Magic after the team owner was disappointed with another white player.

Redick told USA Today about how his four-year, $27million contract nearly fell apart after already being initially agreed upon.

'I’ve been told both ways: one, that he didn’t want to pay me because I was white, and that he didn’t want to pay me because I was a bench player,'”  the former Duke University star told the paper.

'I didn’t know until after the face. I just got a weird phone call from Doc (Rivers) on July 4, and I got off the phone and said to my wife, ‘Something’s going on.’ He’s like, ‘You better play for me (expletive).’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, that’s the plan. We figured this out two days ago, right?

And then he just rambled a bit,' Redick continued. 'But he never really got into the nuts and bolts of what was happening. And then I got a call about 48 hours later from my agent, and he said, ‘We wanted to keep you out of it, but here’s what happened.’

Sterling is said to have reconsidered the price he was willing to pay for the sharpshooting Redick because he was still smarting from the $52million contract he handed center white Chris Kaman to average a pedestrian 11.8 points per game until being unceremoniously shipped out of town to the New Orleans Hornets in 2011.

Redick still pushed for the deal to get down because he wanted to play for Rivers.

'I came here for Doc. I came Here for Chris (Paul) and Blake (Griffin),' Redick explained. 'I looked at this incredible opportunity for me on the basketball court, but also from a personal standpoint.

He averaged a career-high 15.2 points per game on nearly 40 per cent three point shooting while playing an average of only 28 minutes off the bench during his first season in Los Angeles.

Redick scored 20 points in the deciding game of the team's opening-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors.

'I looked at this as there were great people in the organization, and it’s been backed up by that. I think you’ve seen that over the last week, regardless of one person’s opinion, you’ve seen that throughout the organization.”

Sterling’s racist ranting recorded and leaked to multiple websites pissed Redick off, he said.

'In the days after, it was the first time in my life where I was conscientious of the fact that the people I was talking to were black or Asian or Mexican,' said the former All-American. 'I don’t look at people like that, so to hear those things come out of someone’s mouth, it pisses you off.'

Rivers said employees on the team’s business side considered not working for the franchise after Sterling’s racist comments were exposed.

The coach also said he met with team employees who were still upset and angry Friday morning, several days after Sterling was banned for life from the NBA.

'What I witnessed today, you realize this thing has touched a lot of people,' Rivers said hours later at the Clippers’ training complex in Playa Vista. 'The people that didn’t do anything are being harmed by this, and I wish we could find the right solution, and I don’t have it.'

Rivers has been on the Clippers’ bench for less than a year, but the veteran NBA coach and player has emerged as the public face of the franchise during Sterling’s ouster. Rivers also is the Clippers’ senior vice president for basketball operations, giving him a voice in personnel decisions.

Sterling acquired the coach from the Boston Celtics last June in a trade for a first-round pick in the 2015 draft, signing him to a contract paying him a reported $7 million per year.

Rivers won an NBA title in 2008 and reached two NBA finals during nine seasons as the Celtics’ coach. He coached just over four seasons with the Orlando Magic before taking over in Boston.

He also had a 13-season playing career for four franchises, even playing one season for Sterling with the Clippers in 1991-92.

Rivers refused to meet with Sterling shortly after the comments were made public, openly acknowledging his personal conflict about continuing with the club. He has been praised for his frankness and leadership during the crisis, but Rivers is reluctant to take credit.

'I don’t know if I’m doing a good job,' he said. 'I’m just doing my job. We didn’t know this was coming. Last time I met (with team employees) was before the season, and we talked about our goals as a group, being a championship team and a championship organization.'

The Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors Saturday night to advance to the Western Conference Semi-Finals.

Their next opponent is the Oklahoma City Thunder in a series that begins Monday.
