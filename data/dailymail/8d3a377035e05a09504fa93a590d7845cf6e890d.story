They are known for being aggressive predators, willing to attack and kill humans.

But as this picture shows, brown bears are also ever so slightly vain.

This young bear was caught out gazing at its own reflection in a Finnish lake

Curious: This brown bear appears transfixed by its own reflection in a river in Kainuu, Finland

Vain: London-based photographer Sylwia Domaradska was hidden just yards away as the brown bear admired itself

Interested: The bear repeatedly stared at itself as it wondered around the lake

These
 pictures show the brown bear repeatedly stooping to stare at himself, 
unaware that photographer Sylwia Domaradska is hiding just yards away.

She captured the pictures in Kainuu, eastern Finland, where there is almost 24-hour daylight during the summer months.

The 37-year-old from London said: 'It totally felt like a dream. It was almost difficult to see where the reflections were starting.

'The bear turned up at around midnight. He came very quietly along the water's edge looking for food.

'It was a fairly young bear, perhaps two or three years old. He was very cautious as at this age he'd need to be careful about females with cubs, and older males. 

Impressive: With the stillness of the water and the woods around the bear, this image could be a painting

Funny: The photographer said the bear appeared to keep looking at his reflection as he made his way around the water's edge

Youthful: It is thought the curious bear is only about two or three years old

'He seemed to look at his own reflection - as he stayed in the same place for a while.' 

Miss Domaradska said when the bear began moving around the edge of the lake he continued looking in.

'It really was quite amusing to see - and then he was gone,' she said.

'The conditions were absolutely perfect for this kind of image. 

On guard: The bear stands to attention as he plays on the water's edge

Bright: Despite it looking like the middle of the daytime, these pictures were actually taken close to midnight

Going home: After admiring himself for a while, the bear decides enough is enough and heads away from the lake

'The reflections were perfectly still and the line between the reflections and actual trees being reflected created very little blur.

'I had actually gone out with the intention of taking a different image. I was hoping to see bears bathing and splashing in the water but instead, this happened.

'But it didn't turn out too bad, did it?'
