Arsenal are already plotting further moves to strengthen their forward line with a swoop for Marco Reus next year.

Having completed the £16million capture of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on deadline day, Arsene Wenger is eyeing further reinforcements to his attacking options.

And the Gunners WILL be in the running to sign Reus from Borussia Dortmund next summer after trying to sign him in the last transfer window.

Wenger is a huge fan of Reus and Arsenal intend to activate a £20million buy-out clause in the Germany forward's contract, which is due to kick-in next summer.

Of course, Arsenal will not be the side in the running for Reus, with Europe's elite clubs likely to register their interest in the player.

Dortmund want to tie  down the speedy 25-year-old to a new deal that would see the clause withdrawn from his contract.

But Reus, who can play anywhere across the front three, has so far refused to sign.

He was tipped to be a star of the World Cup before being injured a week before the tournament.
