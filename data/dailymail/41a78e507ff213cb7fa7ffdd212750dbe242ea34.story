The past few days have been turbulent, to say the least, for British middleweight, Luke Barnatt. 

When his upcoming fight against Clint Hester was scrapped from the UFC's Fairfax card on April 4, after Hester developed a foot injury, Barnatt was on the hunt for a replacement opponent.

'I heard from Clint directly that he was injured and out of the fight.' Barnatt told Sportsmail. 'I spoke to Joe Silva and he said there's no-one on the roster who is free to fight you, so it might have to be a newcomer. But I didn't want to fight a newcomer who people knew nothing about. He had a few guys in mind but none of them could take the fight or would agree to it.

'I said, 'Why don't you give me Mark Munoz and let me fight in the Philippines?'

'Then Joe called back and said he'd made about 500 phone calls and that he couldn't find anyone, so your wish is my command – you're fighting Mark in the Philippines.

'I went from being very down, to being very happy, and now I have 10 weeks to prepare for the fight.'

Barnatt is looking to bounce back from two frustrating back to back losses, both of which the middleweight feels he would have won, were it not for poor judging decisions.

Mark Munoz, meanwhile, who recently fell short of the UFC's top 15 middleweight rankings, is a veteran of the sport and will present a dangerous challenge on the ground for Barnatt.

'Obviously I have to pay a bit more attention to my wrestling now' said Barnatt. 'Mark is a very, very good wrestler. There will be a bit more of a focus on, but I am going to implement my own game plan.'

The bout will feature on the UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Faber fight card, the UFC's first event ever to take place in the Philippines.

'Six years ago I was in Thailand.' Barnatt continued. 'I lived there for 7 months and I always wanted to go to the Philippines, so I'm super excited. I'm going to go out there about 10 days before to get acclimatized. The funny thing is, Mark trains about 3 hours away from me in California so we will both be going all that way. We will probably leave on the same flight to get out there!'

When it comes to trash talk, we can expect to witness none of that in the lead up to this bout.

'I know Mark' said Barnatt. 'He's pound for pound the nicest guy in the world. But this will probably be Mark's last fight in the UFC. He's wanted to fight in the Philippines for so long so it's great that he's able to do that, but I think this will be the last fight for him.

'It's a fantastic opportunity that the UFC has given me, to allow me to be the one to retire Mark Munoz.'

Munoz was on the losing end against Carneiro, but he'll be hoping for a comeback against Barnatt on May 16
