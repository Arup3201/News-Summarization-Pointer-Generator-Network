A boy, aged 6, tried to kill himself after seeing corpses on the street of his home town in war-torn Syria.

The boy, from the northern province of Idlib, a rebel stronghold, was found by his brother, 12, hanging from a rope tied to a swing on the family's balcony.

In a shocking portrayal of life in a country being decimated by a brutal civil war, he told his father 'he would rather die like this than to have Assad come and kill him with a bomb or gun'.

Meanwhile, another six-year-old was pulled out dead from under the rubble on the outskirts of Syria's northern city of Aleppo after an airstrike by Syrian government forces at the weekend.

The boy, identified by locals as Mohamed Abdou al-Ghadhban, died after shelling by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad caused buildings to collapse on top of him.

Aleppo has become a main focus of the conflict since late July. On Sunday Syrian forces intensified air attacks on the city and shelled rebel strongholds.

Warplanes on Saturday bombed the town of Azaz near Aleppo and shelling continued in several of the city's neighbourhoods, including the Salaheddin neighbourhood where much of the regime's military operations against the rebels have been focused.

In Idlib, where the young boy tried to take his own life, civilians have faced daily gunfights and the sight of corpses lying in the street for hours before being retrieved.

His mother spoke of the horrific event which nearly took her son's life.

His mother, who didn't want any of the family to be named, told The Times: 'He is only six. He is too young for these dark thoughts. We knew he was scared but we didn't understand how much.'

When his older brother discovered him on the balcony last month, he screamed to his mother. He wasn't breathing at the time and his family took him straight to a doctor.

He was in a coma for several days before he woke.

Human rights groups estimate that more than half of the 130,000 refugees fleeing the conflict-torn Syria are under the age of 18.

Many of those that remain are in refugee camps and cramped apartments where they are waiting out until the end of the war.

There were reports children have also become targets in Syria, with Syrian security forces having killed, arrested and tortured children in their homes, schools or on the streets.

Men, women and children are trapped in bombed-out towns, people are struggling to find food or medical supplies to treat the sick and wounded, while the grim cycle of shelling and air strikes and fighting claims scores of lives daily.

The International Committee of the Red Cross began treating the conflict as a civil war more than a month ago, when the fighting dramatically escalated, reaching the capital Damascus and the main northern city of Aleppo.

Yesterday it was revealed British intelligence on Syrian troop movements was helping rebels in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

The disclosure by a Syrian opposition official was the first indication of British intelligence playing a covert role in the civil war.
