British jihadists in Syria are posing with guns, ammunition and severed heads before posting their bragging photos on social media sites. 

The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sharm (ISIS) has found itself alienated from the more moderate rebel groups due to its history of attacking those groups and killing their commanders. 

However, despite setbacks British fighters are posting disturbing images of themselves on social media, according to Vice News.

This time last year photographs appeared to show British recruits having fun in swimming pools and eating Cadbury's chocolates which they had taken from home. 

But the images have now taken a more sinister turn - including men posing with severed heads, bloodied guns and ammunition.

Abu Abdurrahman al Britani and Abu Daighum al Britani are two fighters from London who are now members of Rayat al Tawheed, an ISIS faction that communicates in English. 

The pair have been uploading pictures for their followers back home in Britain to see. 

One image shows a bloodied hand with the caption: 'My first time.'

Depraved: Sayyad Al-Britani tweeted this photo which showed three men on the floor and blindfolded

Another shows three men blindfolded kneeling on the floor.

Sayyad Al-Britani tweeted the photo with the caption: 'Got these criminals today. Insha'Allah will be killed tomorrow. Can't wait for that feeling when U just killed some1.' 

Others which are too graphic to publish show men holding up severed heads. 

In December last year the EU's anti-terror chief warned how battle-hardened jihadists who have fought alongside extremist Al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria's civil war are returning to Europe. 

The number of fighters travelling back and forth from war-torn country is increasing, stressed guidance prepared by the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove.

Drawn by recruiters who arrange travel and accommodation, these men are learning to fight, being indoctrinated with the tenets of militant Islam, and could pose a potent threat once back home.

Syrian rebels are often seen as heroes to a small section of youths upon return, making them ideal to further foster recruitment, warned a note prepared for a meeting of EU interior ministers. 

The note specifically called for better use of airline passenger information available to security officials to keep track of when and how rebels move to Syria.

The 11 western European countries with the biggest contingents in Syria are estimated to have some 1,200-1,700 citizens among rebel forces. 

The head of MI5, the UK's domestic spying agency, said last November that 'low hundreds of people' had travelled from Britain to Syria and that some have since returned - stoking fears extremists could pose a domestic threat.
