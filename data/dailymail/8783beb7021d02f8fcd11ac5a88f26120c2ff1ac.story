Most galaxies are thought to be large star-forming structures with millions or billions of stars.

But the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy, 75,000 light-years from Earth, has astrophysicists scratching their heads.

It contains just a few hundred stars and it hasn't produced any new ones in over 13 billion years, suggesting it may be a fossil left over from the young universe.

The stars of the dwarf galaxy Segue 1, which may be one of the universe's first galaxies, are circled here

Researchers led by Anna Frebel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US recently published their measurements.

Scientists believe the Big Bang gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen, helium, and a trace.

All the other elements that we see today were forged in
stars, which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae — huge
stars that explode at the end of their life.

This endless recycling process has yielded an intriguing
tool for astrophysicists.

One way of determining stellar age is iron, whose content in
a star enriches with every successive birth.

The lower the iron content in a star's light spectrum, the
older it is.

They analysed data from the Las Campanas Observatory’s Magellan Telescopes in Chile and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

What they found was that the stars in Segue 1 are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with very little amounts of heavier elements like iron detected.

This makes Segue 1 ‘the least chemically evolved galaxy known,’ the researchers say in their paper.

Most galaxies go through periods of repeated star formation.

When stars explode in supernovae, they release heavy elements that lead to the creation of new stars.

The types of element released depends on the mass of the star.

High-mass stars, which live for relatively short amounts of time, release elements like magnesium and calcium.

Low-mass stars, on the other hand, live longer but release mostly iron.

Now you see it: On the left is an image of the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy as imaged with other stars, where it is almost invisible. When the other stars are removed (right), the sparse galaxy starts to reveal itself

The stars in the Segue 1 galaxy only seem to contain products from high-mass stars.

The researchers say this supports the idea ‘that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one burst of star formation.’

The reason for this is not known.

It may be due to something known as the ‘epoch of reionisation’ that occurred 13.2 billion years ago, 600 million years after the Big Bang.

In this period any existing galaxies would have lost their ability to make new stars.

This would also explain why Segue 1 experienced only one brief spurt of star formation.

The new data on Segue 1 was taken from observations made by the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile (pictured) and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii

Another unknown is whether galaxies can form this small, or whether they form larger and then have mass taken away.

‘This study is so interesting because I really want to know, can galaxies form this small?’ astronomer Beth Willman of Haverford College told Scientific American.

‘Can galaxies form and look like Segue 1 when they form or do they have to form larger and then have some mass taken away?’

‘There could be 200 Segue 1-like galaxies around us.’

‘My lifelong goal is trying to understand, are things like this the most abundant in the universe?'

For now Segue 1 gives us a tantalising look at some of the first things to form in the universe.

And it may provide us with some useful new information as to how some of the very first structures in the cosmos came to be.

Dwarf galaxy Segue 1 contains fewer heavy elements than any galaxy

This suggests it stopped forming stars over 13 billion years ago

This would make it one of the oldest galaxies we know of
