A dead man's body was left decomposing on a mortuary table for six days - because he was too big to fit in the fridge.

David Gardner, 59, from Tetbury, was admitted to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital suffering from a diseased kidney and liver last month and died on March 1.

His family claim his body was too big to fit in a mortuary fridge so was left unrefrigerated on a table.

Plans for an open casket funeral have been scrapped because his body is too decayed.

A hospital spokesman told the BBC an investigation had begun.

Mr Gardner's wife Elsie said the family 
had wanted to say goodbye to him in an open casket but could not because
his body was too badly decomposed.

She said: 'He was the only man that I loved. He was the only man that loved me. How can I let him go when I can't say goodbye? It's just wrong.â€™

The funeral will take place next Tuesday.
