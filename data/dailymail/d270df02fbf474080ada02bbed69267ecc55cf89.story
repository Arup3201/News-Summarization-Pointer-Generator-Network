Jack P Shepherd, who plays David Platt in Coronation Street, was forced to apologise after making jokes about the fire at the kennels

Hundreds of Coronation Street fans have called for Jack P Shepherd to be sacked after he made jokes about the Manchester Dogs' Home fire which claimed the lives of 60 animals.

The actor, 26, who plays David Platt in the ITV soap, was forced into an apology after causing uproar on Twitter when he said: 'I have a million 'hot dog' jokes'.

When people responded with complaints and messages of disbelief he added: 'You guys need to lighten up. #GetItLightenUp.' 

Hours later when it became how many animals have perished in the fire on Thursday night, he issued a grovelling apology.

He said: 'I sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. This was not intended to be a malicious tweet and I didn't consider the offence it would cause.

'At the time I didn't realise the scale of the tragedy but that doesn't excuse my behaviour. I now realise how insensitive I have been.

'I have made a donation to the MCR dogs home and I'm very sorry for my behaviour.'

More than £1.36million has been raised for the dogs' home which will be used to rebuild the home in Harpurhey.

Firefighters said the 150 dogs rescued from the blaze had been moved to a sister site, Cheshire Dogs' Home.

Around 400 people have agreed to provide permanent homes to dogs, with 300 more responding to the charity's 'foster auction' to find short-term homes.

His offensive and ill-timed tweets about Manchester Dogs' Home sparked outrage on social media

Coronation Street bosses pledged to speak to the actor, who has appeared in the show since he was 12, after reading his tweets.

A spokeswoman for the show said: 'Jack quickly realised the insensitivity of his tweets and deleted them straight away.

'Jack's ill-judged and insensitive tweets were clearly unacceptable and we will be talking to him about his conduct.'

Fans have threatened to boycott the show until the young actor is fired.

The fire raged through  the dogs' home, killing 60 animals as hundreds of others yelped in their cages

Emma Anne Marie tweeted: 'Refusing to watch @itvcorrie until the disgracful excuse for a human being @jackpshepherd88 has been sacked. How heartless can you get?!'

Fern Cook tweeted: 'Jack Shepherd (David Platt in Coronation Street) should be sacked for those disgusting comments.'

A 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of deliberately starting the fire, but the teenager has been bailed pending further enquiries.

The boy – who is the subject of death threats from furious animal lovers on social media sites – cannot be named for legal reasons.

It has been revealed that the teenager was attacked by Rhodesian ridgeback earlier this year.

Yesterday police urged his family to move, but the boy's defiant mother, 49, insisted they would not be forced out and said the allegations were a 'pack of lies'.

'They have said that he has had to move away, that the police told him to go away for his own safety but as you can see he is still here,' she said.

'I don't care what people are saying about threats. I am still here and I'm not leaving. I don't want to talk about it because people will twist everything we say.'

A vigil for the dogs that died in the fire will be held at the local Christ Church at 6pm tonight.
