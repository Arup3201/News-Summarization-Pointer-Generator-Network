A mother suffering from cancer has passed away just one day after she completed the final item on her bucket list by marrying her long-term boyfriend.

On Saturday, Mindi Jo Flanagan, 37, wed her boyfriend of seven years, Joe Bakalar, in front of overjoyed family and friends at a small ceremony at their home in Des Moines, Iowa.

But on Sunday, just hours after they had shared their vows, Flanagan passed away.

'It's bittersweet,' her sister, Shellie Bridges, told the Des Moines Register. 'She was so happy. She got to get up and dance with Dad and her husband. It was beautiful.

'We thought maybe it would give her a push, we've had so many miracles with her. But it wasn't meant to be.'

Flanagan, who had a daughter Savanna, now six, with Bakalar, as well as two nine-year-old twin girls from a previous relationship, had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008.

She underwent a double mastectomy - but the following year, she was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer.

She underwent surgery, chemotherapy and an experimental study and bravely beat the cancer five times - but then it returned a sixth time.

In April, she ended up in the hospital with intense pain and doctors had to put drains in her stomach to drain her liver. She learned that she had just six to 12 weeks to live.

Bakalar propsed on Easter Sunday.

'I wasn't sure how much time she had left, and I want to show her and her family how much I cared for her, and I wanted to give her a little more to fight for,' he told KCCI on his wedding day.

His wife-to-be had added before the ceremony on saturday: 'At this point we're like, let's do it. We love each other, and it's time to put it together today.'

The couple married at their home, with Flanagan rolling down the aisle in a wheelchair pushed by her father.

She passed 
guests dressed in tie-dye clothing - at her request - and cheered in joy as she 
neared Bakalar, who sat beside her through their vows.

'Before
 I met you, it felt like I was traveling around in the dark,' he said as he became emotional. 'Then, you, a bright shining star, gave me a light 
to see again and brought me back to life.'

As part of her bucket list, Flanagan 
had written birthday cards for her daughters every year until they turn 
18 and had prepared videos for her loved ones.

Bridges said the family was heartbroken at the loss.

'We were still kind of hoping for a miracle,' she said. 'There had been the catalyst of getting ready for the wedding. I think she was at peace, ready to let go. That's what she did. It's tough for those remaining but she's where she needs to be.'
