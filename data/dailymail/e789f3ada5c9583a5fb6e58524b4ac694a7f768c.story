A construction worker has fallen to his death from the roof of the Arena da Amazonia stadium where England will open their 2014 World Cup campaign.

Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, fell 35 metres from the roof of the stadium, located in the city of Manaus, when a cable broke.

It is thought he died in hospital at around 4am this morning.

Andrade Gutierrez, the construction firm building the stadium, confirmed the man had died on Saturday.

The company said in a statement that Ferreira worked for a firm which had been contracted to build the arena's cover.

They added that an internal investigation of the incident would be conducted.

The Local Organizing Committee of the World Cup said work on the stadium was halted for a period of mourning, but will resume on Sunday.

The construction of the stadium is behind schedule and work is under way 24 hours a day to complete it by Fifa's end of year deadline.

The death is the latest tragedy linked to the construction of numerous Brazil World Cup stadiums.

Linked: Several construction workers have died while working on stadiums for the Brazil 2014 World Cup - with one dying at the same stadium in May

It will no doubt add to safety concerns as the country races to finish many of the arenas by next year.

Last month, two construction workers were killed when a crane collapsed as it was hoisting a 500-ton piece of roofing at the Sao Paulo stadium - where the opening match of the competition will be held.

Several more workers were injured.

The accident is thought to have put the stadium's completion date back by several months.

Another worker fell to his death at the Amazon stadium in May and a worker died in 2012 after falling from a stadium in Brasilia.

Preparations for Brazil 2014 have also been plagued by delays, accidents, cost overruns, and public anger over government waste that contributed to massive nationwide street protests in 2012.
