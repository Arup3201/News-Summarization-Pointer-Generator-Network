From the very beginnings of clothmaking to Dior haute couture, the V&A's new venture takes you through the history of fashion.

The Clothworkers’ Centre for Textiles and Fashion Study and Conservation has been built for 'the study, enjoyment and care' of the museum's outstanding textiles and fashion collections. 

Countless researchers, students and enthusiasts use the V&A's spectacular collections every year, and the new centre will bring together all the textile and fashion collections - consisting of over 104,000 items - to offer them the best possible access.

'Zemire' ensemble, Christian Dior 1954-55. Part of Dior's H-line collection of Autumn/winter 1954-5, it echoes the shape of a riding habit. The original model in grey silk satin was shown to Princess Margaret at Blenheim Palace in 1954

Everything from small scraps of Egyptian 
archaeological textiles and Medieval royal tapestries to the latest creations by leading contemporary designers will be displayed.

The Clothworkers’ Centre has been developed at Blythe House in Kensington Olympia, London, home to the V&A’s study collections and the Archive of Art and Design.

It will open on Tuesday October 8, thanks to a generous lead grant from The Clothworkers' Foundation and support from many others.

The new centre forms 
part of the V&A’s ambitious FuturePlan, which is turning spaces 
previously used as storage into public galleries.

Textiles
and fashion will continue to be displayed in temporary exhibitions and 
in permanent galleries at the V&A, notably in the Fashion Gallery, 
which presents around 100 outfits arranged chronologically to reflect 
the quality and breadth of the V&A's collections.

Gareth Pugh, 2011. Full length evening dress of tabbed silver vinyl, fitted from the neck to the thigh where the skirt flares out into a full circle with a train. There is a zipper fastening down the centre back. Inner arms are fitted with panels of black stretch fabric

Red carpet dress by Laurence Xu, China, 2011. Xu plays with the well-known motifs from the traditional dragon robe of the Qing dynasty. It was full of symbols like the dragon, which coils around the body here, and water at the hem, cascading down the long flowing train

Some
of the Museum’s finest tapestries, embroideries and furnishing silks 
can be seen in the Medieval and Renaissance Galleries and important 
carpets, chintz, lace and rare fashion items in the British Galleries.

The
Tapestry Gallery shows the magnificent Devonshire Hunting Tapestries, 
the only great hunting tapestries to have survived from the 15th century
and many superb textiles from China, Japan, Korea, South Asia and the 
Islamic world are on display in the Asian galleries.

Haworth Tompkins Architects have sensitively designed the centre within the Grade II listed Edwardian building, maintaining and enhancing the industrial feel of the internal architecture by reinstating original features, while inserting contemporary interventions to form new spaces. The original grand entrance of Blythe House will be reopened to create a more welcoming street presence.

A donation from Mr. Jorge Yarur Bascuñán has enabled the V&A to create a new reception area, which will feature floor to ceiling glass cabinets to house changing displays from the study collections. The first display will be Eduardo Paolozzi’s Krazy Kat Arkive of Twentieth Century Popular Culture. 

A spacious new public study room will offer a relaxed and peaceful environment for visitors to view even the largest textiles first hand, with staff and reference books available for consultation. The adjoining seminar room, supported by The Patricia Baines Trust, will be used for groups and classes accommodating up to 18 people.

Coats plc. has enabled one of the antique wooden display cabinets from the former Textiles Gallery to be restored for display in the study room. The cabinet will contain 160 framed historical textiles to show the quality, geographic range and diversity of the collection and to demonstrate a variety of textile techniques and design. 

Modern, custom-built storage will ensure the long-term preservation of the collection. It includes storage for 1,280 large rolled textiles from 1.5 to six metres long; 500 linear metres of storage for hanging garments; and 7,000 drawers in six different sizes to house everything from dress fabrics to religious robes, handbags to walking sticks, and embroidery to underwear.

A gift from The Basil Samuel 
Charitable Trust has purchased specialist access equipment to enable 
staff to work safely at height.

The V&A's Textile Conservation Department is one of the leaders in its field anywhere in the world.

The
new centre provides upgraded conservation studios in which they can 
carry out their specialist conservation of the collection. Visitors will
be able to see into the studios and watch work in progress. 

Martin
Roth, V&A Director, said: 'This development at Blythe House 
reflects our commitment to making the V&A’s collections available to
the widest possible audience to inspire designers and help researchers.

'We want visitors to 
the new Clothworkers’ Centre to have the same experience studying 
fashion and textiles as they do when viewing fine art in our public 
study room or visiting our library.'
