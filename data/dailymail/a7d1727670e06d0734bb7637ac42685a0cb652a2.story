The former Navy SEAL who wrote an inside account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden says the years since have been harder than any of his 13 deployments.

Matthew Bissonnette released his controversial book No Easy Day in 2012 and immediately faced the ire of the Pentagon and fellow SEALs.

Things have been so bad for Bissonnette, AKA Mark Owen, that he told CBS that he'd rather personally take on the Islamic State. 

'I would go back overseas today and deal with fighting ISIS face-to-face rather than deal with the last two years again,' he said Sunday.

Speaking out: A disguised Matthew Bissonnette AKA Mark Owen was back on 60 Minutes Sunday to defend himself against accusations he put fellow soldiers in danger when he published a book about the day he helped take down Osama bin Laden

Bissonnette's surprising statement came as he continued to defend himself against claims he somehow knowingly endangered his fellow SEALs, and even America's safety as a whole, by divulging classified information. 

'That's absolutely not what I intended to do. These are my brothers that I served beside for years,' he said.

Bissonnette told CBS he believed at the time of his book's publication that he was acting totally within the law.

However, now Bissonnette says he was following the advice of his attorney at the time when he chose to forego submitting his manuscript to the Pentagon before it went to print.

It's clear now that was a mistake. Even Bissonnette's former commander has washed his hands of the problem.

'I [wanted] to reach out to my former command and say, "Hey, look, sir, let's discuss. I have nothing to hide,"' he said. 'I got a text message back just simply saying, you know, "Delete me."' 

With so much venom flying his way, the former soldier says he's had to change his habits in hopes of calling as little attention to himself as possible.

'I fly a little further underneath the radar than I ever have before. I don't want anybody to know where I live,' he said. 'I want to be very cautious - security wise.' 

Now, as he prepares to publish a sequel to his dangerous tome, his lawyer has revealed a vast proportion of the profits could be soaked up by extensive fines leveled by the Pentagon.

The latest probe centers on the speeches Bissonnette has made since publishing his tell-all book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, The New York Times revealed. 

It comes after Bissonnette submitted a draft of his second book - No Hero: The Evolution Of A Navy SEAL - for approval from the Department of Defense, including slides and notes from his speeches.

He has already apologized for failing to seek approval for his revelations in No Easy Day, and allegedly agreed to forfeit a portion of his royalties in a dispute settlement.

However, another probe has been launched to investigate details disclosed at speeches across the U.S.

Last year, he spoke at a golf club in Atlanta where visitors were instructed to deposit their phones at the door and were barred from taking notes.

Bissonnette, right, says even his former commander has washed his hands of him in the wake of his book controversey

His lawyer Robert D Luskin insists the speeches were not controversial and says he  expects the investigation to be resolved 'favorably'.

Bissonnette was disciplined in November 2012 for sharing classified information with the makers of the popular video game Medal of Honor: Warfighter.

According to senior Navy officials, Bissonnette recruited his fellow SEALs to spend two days as paid consultants for Electronic Arts.

It was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book  that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal.

His second piece of work is a reaction to the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty, which consulted former CIA director Leon E Panetta.

The narrative conflicted with many elements of Bissonnette's telling, and in his opinion it is the SEALs' story to tell.

The news comes as  the SEAL Team 6 member called 'The Shooter' - who fired the kill shot at Bin Laden - prepares to reveal his identity. 

Controversial: He was forced to apologize after publishing No Easy Day without Pentagon approval. The book, written under the pseudonym Mark Owen, was an inside account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden

He fiercely guarded in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakisatan compound, fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Qaeda as retribution.

But he has since retired and is apparently ready to take off his mask of anonymity to detail the events leading up to and during Operation Neptune's Spear.

According to a Fox News press release, the two-part special The Man Who Killed Usama Bin Laden will air Tuesday November 11 and Wednesday November 12 from 10-11pm ET. The interview will be conducted by Washington Correspondent Peter Doocy.

'Revealing his identity and speaking out publicly for the first time, the Navy SEAL, also known as “The Shooter,” will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,' the press release states.

'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.'

It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected in anyway, or if he will both appear on the camera and reveal his real name. 

Fears: Officials feared the account of the mission, which the White House watched live (pictured), could reveal key details of U.S. military strategy. Bissonnette was already disciplined for liaising with a video game on it
