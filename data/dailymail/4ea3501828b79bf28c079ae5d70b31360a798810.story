Last year trusts were forced to employ 5,217 nurses from the EU to plug understaffed wards

The NHS is employing soaring numbers of nurses from Europe while cutting training places for Britons, figures reveal.

Wards are so understaffed that last year trusts were forced to employ 5,217 nurses and midwives from the EU.

This is a rise of more than 50 per cent from the year before, and more than double the total in Labour’s last year in power.

Despite the acute shortage of British nurses, however, the number of training places in England slumped from 20,829 in 2009/10 to 18,009 last year. Over the past four years there were 10,255 fewer places than there would have been without cuts.

The revelation will add to fears over foreign recruits’ grasp of English and the impact on care.

Around a quarter of NHS trusts have recruited abroad to cope with understaffing, but there are fears most do not properly test applicants’ English. Many have had to send staff on language courses amid fears they could not communicate properly.

Campaigners fear the shortage of training places is storing up problems for the future.

A recent poll found more than half of nurses believe their ward is understaffed.

Last night Jamie Reed, Labour health spokesman, said: ‘With youth unemployment so high, the Government should be bringing on the next generation of nurses. Instead, ministers are cutting trainee nurse places at home and spending millions on overseas recruitment.

‘David Cameron’s short-sighted plans are bad for the NHS and bad for our economy... One in six hospitals in England are already running without enough staff. This is more proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the issue ‘is getting out of hand’.

‘We are concerned poor English skills may lead to mistakes. We urge the Government to urgently review this situation,’ she said.

In 2013/14, 5,217 Europeans registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, or 100 a week, figures released after a Parliamentary question show. That is a rise of 52 per cent on the 3,436 the previous year, and more than double the 1,970 in Labour’s last year in power.

Tory Andrew Percy, a member of the health select committee, praised the work of European nurses.

But he added: ‘We should only be looking to foreign nurses if we can actually prove they can hit the language standards that patients expect.’

Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘It is morally questionable that this country is trying to make savings by simply pushing the costs of training on to other countries.’

In February, a recruitment fair was held in Rome for jobs in  Hereford Hospital. The trust’s website says foreign recruitment is ‘an increasingly permanent feature’ of health care because of a shortage of British nurses.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There are over 5,100 more nurses on our wards now than in 2010 and 1,000 extra adult nursing training places are being created this year.

‘Nurses from abroad make a valuable contribution to the NHS... But local hospitals should only employ them if they have proven their competence.’
