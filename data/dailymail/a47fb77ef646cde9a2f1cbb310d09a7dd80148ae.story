As birthday presents go, this one was priceless.

With a little planning, a Naval Officer was able to give her daughter a very special birthday treat by coming home to Michigan from California to give her a surprise celebration.

Navy Petty Officer 1st class Shawna Welborn gave her daughter, Sienna Welborn, the surprise of her life, during a school assembly in Bay City. 

Sienna, who was celebrating her eighth birthday, had not seen her mom since August as she is stationed across the country in San Diego. She couldn't contain her emotions when her mother, whom she wasn't expecting to see her again until Christmas, walked in.

The best present a girl could wish for: Sienna Welborn had not seen her mom since August while she is stationed in San Diego

Shawna Welborn has been in the Navy since before her daughter was born, enlisting before she graduated from Bay City Central High school in 2002 

Shawna Welborn saw her daughter earlier this summer and wasn't expected to see her again until Christmas, but Welborn had a big surprise for her

She's only spent a month with her daughter this year. Her military career is full of sad goodbyes. 

 'My heart is beating out of my chest right now,' the mom said before she surprised her daughter.

The cameras were rolling during the assembly but Sienna had no idea that they were there for her.

The students gathered on Wednesday for an assembly on kindness, respect and caring for others. 

Towards the end, one of the presenters mentioned that it's almost Sienna's birthday, and had her stand while a video message from her mother played in the gym.

All of a sudden, her mother came out from the back of the assembly hall with a bunch of balloons as she walked over to her daughter.

It was a surprise visit, and eight-year-old Sienna was stunned, frozen in place as her mother strode into the gymnasium with a cloud of balloons

Serving as a Petty Officer 1st Class aboard the USS Ronald Reagan — her third aircraft carrier. Though she's been around the world, surprising her daughter still made her nervous.

The surprise was an emotional one for all who were present, including the other teachers who were watching. 

Tears began to well up in their eyes as a crowd of students and teachers gathered to watch the emotional reunion.

Eight-year-old Sienna was stunned, frozen in place as her mother strode into the gymnasium.

As the students sang Happy Birthday, the two hugged each other for several seconds as they both took in the enormity of the moment. 

Clinging shyly to her mother's uniformed arm, she murmured a few words on what it meant to her.

'I like to spend time with her,' Sienna said.

'I'm overwhelmed right now. She just looked really shocked when I saw her,' mom Shawna Welborn said to WNEM.

None of this would have been possible without the help of a teacher from the school.

'Sienna is the nicest, sweetest little girl. Her family is just wonderful,' teacher Jodi Decuf said.

Sienna is a hard worker and 'the sweetest little girl,' her third-grade teacher said. 

Though she hasn't mentioned missing her mother in class, she said, she knows that Sienna misses her.

'She was real quiet at first, and as the year's gone on, she's really come out of her shell,' Decuf said.

The pair hugged each other and wiped away tears of joy as they were reunited in Sienna's assembly hall

In full Navy dress, Shawna Welborn pressed her forehead against her daughter Sienna's in the gymnasium of MacGregor Elementary School 

Sienna, a third-grader at MacGregor, lives with her grandparents in Bay City, and has only seen her mother for about four weeks this year, a combination of visits in January and August. 

Shawna Welborn has been in the Navy since before her daughter was born, enlisting before she graduated from Bay City Central High school in 2002.

She's since toured the world, visiting Korea, Japan, Australia and more. Now, she serves as a Petty Officer 1st Class aboard the USS Ronald Reagan — her third aircraft carrier, she said — in San Diego.

Decuf helped get the ball rolling by creating a day her student will never forget.

'I was crying. You can see it means so much to have her mom here,' Decuf said.

Officer Welborn said her daughter has had to endure three deployments but that she always wanted a surprise like she had seen on other Youtube videos.

The pair will be spending the weekend together before the officer has to return to California early next week. 

Moments after their reunion, and after Shawna Welborn wiped a few tears from her eyes, she was still holding her fistful of balloons

Matt Wenzell, principal at MacGregor, said he was happy to arrange the event

She said they'll probably head to a pumpkin farm this weekend, where Sienna has spent other birthdays, and eat a big family dinner before she returns to her Naval duties on Monday
