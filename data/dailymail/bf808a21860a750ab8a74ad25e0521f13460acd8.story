Repairing the damage: Hollywood actor Pierce Brosnan has started renovations on his Malibu home after a dramatic blaze ripped through it, last week

Wearing a safety hard-hat, a worker could be seen using a wheelbarrow to transport charred goods onto a lorry for clearance.

And, although much of the content was unidentifiable, there was certainly a considerable amount of it. 

In fact,  he could be seen filling the vehicle several times which deftly illustrates the scale of the destruction.

KTLA reports that as many as 20 firefighters responded to the first-alarm residential fire and put the flames out within 30 minutes.

As a result, only the garage and a nearby guest bedroom sustained any damage.

Brosnan, who was home with wife Keely Shaye Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze.

TMZ report that Brosnan said in his 911 call 'I've got to go now in case I get blown up'. 

Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was.

One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house.'

Los Angeles County firefighters responded to emergency calls to put out the fire at the Hollywood star's property, estimated to be worth $18.5 million, at 9:48pm local time on 11 February.

It took around 50 firefighters to distinguish the blaze in around 35 minutes.

Brosnan, who is best known for his role as James Bond in movies including Die Another Day and GoldenEye, was pictured outside of his mansion at the time of the fire.

An additional clip has surfaced online, taken by a supposed nearby witness from Malibu, showing the fire going at full strength.

Damage: Fire ravaged remains from the blaze could clearly be seen on the mansion's driveway

NBC journalist Kenny Holmes posted pictures on Twitter of the actor outside with firefighters during the incident.

He added: 'Heavy smoke & fire last night from the garage of Pierce Brosnan's Malibu home. No injuries. Damage to garage/bedroom.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Pierce Brosnan and is awaiting comment.

The large home is said to be one of Malibu's finest beach-front properties, with neighbours including Danny DeVito and Dustin Hoffman.

Most recently, the 61-year-old actor appeared in a Super Bowl commercial.

The new Kia Sorento Super Bowl advert - entitled The Perfect Getaway - sees Pierce attempt to go back to his 007 roots.

He finds himself disappointed as his agent pitches him a movie role that lacks his flair for action and adventure.

The clip sees the actor sitting in a luxurious office waiting to line up his next globe trotting onscreen adventure, only to have his hopes dashed.

Soon every expectation is dashed for the star, as he learns he will not be contending with snipers and missile launchers but instead will have to settle for pleasant encounters with natural beauty and wildlife while driving a modest Kia Sorento.

The vehicle his agent is pitching - a fuel efficient family SUV - is a far cry from the zippy super cars he is used to in his various action movie roles.

But just when he thinks all hope is lost he asks if the scene he is being pitched ends in an explosion... which it doesn't.

He does however get some fireworks in the form of a lovely woman waiting for him in a snowy cabin his modest car arrives to at the end of the pitch. 

The Irish actor has been married to wife Keely Shaye Smith for over ten years; the couple have two teenage sons together, Dylan and Paris.
