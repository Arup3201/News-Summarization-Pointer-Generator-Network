The mother of three young girls who perished in a house fire on Christmas Day is believed to have tried to kill herself, it has emerged.

Madonna Badger, whose boyfriend was the only other survivor in the blaze which may have been started by embers from a yule log, was taken to hospital last Thursday after injuring herself.

A relative said she is now out of danger and 'somewhere safe' trying to come to terms with her horrific loss.

Devastated: Madonna Badger breaks down at the funeral of her three young daughters earlier this month
in New York City. The three girls died with their grandparents in an early morning blaze on Christmas Day

'She is okay...She is out [of the 
hospital] and somewhere safe. It’s just terrible, nobody could really 
hold up well under the circumstances,' the relative told New York Daily News.

A source speaking to CBS 2 added that Mrs Badger 'is now in a safe place surrounded by family and longtime friends'.

It follows the funeral of the three 
girls on January 5, where their grieving mother said: 'When I used to 
hear about people losing a child I would say I could never ever, ever 
live through losing my babies.'

Police say smoke detectors and fire 
extinguishers may have been removed from the Connecticut home where a 
deadly fire erupted on Christmas Day, killing the three young girls and 
their grandparents.

Seven-year-old
twins Grace and Sarah Badger, nine-year-old Lily Badger and their 
mother's parents Lomer and Pauline Johnson died in the Stamford home 
destroyed by blistering fire.

New reports suggest smoke alarms were
in place before the fire, but were removed as part of a renovation 
process on the $1.7 million Victorian.

Construction workers, overseen by their mother's boyfriend, contractor Michael Borcina, are being investigated for possible criminal charges.

According to CBS 2, investigators have
talked to several people involved in the work being done on the 
five-bedroom home, which was being overseen by Mr Borcina.

Mrs Badger was interviewed last week.

Officials want to determine whether 
the house had working smoke detectors. They say the fire was started by 
embers in a bag of discarded fireplace ashes.

Construction workers allegedly told 
investigators the alarms and extinguishers were removed and stored 
in the garage when painters began working on the house. Police would not confirm those reports.

The network also reports that Matthew 
Badger, the girls father and Mrs Badger's estranged husband, has hired a
private investigation firm to look into the fire.

Michael Ciravolo,
a retired NYPD investigator not associated with the 
investigation for Mr Badger, told the network: 'If they find 
something that in their estimation is criminality or negligence on the 
part of someone, they have a duty and I’m sure they will take it to the 
police.'

Police have officially ruled out any 
foul play in the investigation into the Badger home fire, but are now 
looking to see if there are any accidental criminal charges that will be
filed. Specifically, charges of criminally negligent homicide or 
reckless manslaughter are both possible charges in a case like this.

Stamford police say they hope to wrap up their investigation in the next two weeks.

Mr Borcina’s company, Tiberias 
Construction, has been heavily scrutinized during the investigation, and it has been discovered that several required forms were missing.

The house did not have a new 
certificate of occupancy since the Badgers moved in, and MrBorcina’s 
contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire. His contractor
registration for work in the state of Connecticut expired in 2000, and 
his home improvement license for the state of New York expired in June 
2010.

Mr Borcina has hired Eugene Riccio, a 
high-profile criminal defence attorney, to represent him in this case, 
but this is not his first run in with the law over his construction 
sites.

Greenwich Time earlier reported that 
he owes almost $100,000 in from previous legal judgements.

He is also 
in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients - one in Manhattan and 
one in Long Island.

Because the house was torn down 
immediately after the fire, at the request of the local fire department 
which deemed it a continued safety risk, investigators are not hoping to
find any evidence at the scene.

The fire killed 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger, 9-year-old Lily Badger and grandparents Lomer and Pauline Johnson.

Mr Johnson was a department store Santa Claus who had worked as safety director for a Louisville, Kentucky, company.

Mr Borcina appeared at Ms Badger’s 
side- along with her ex-husband and his current girlfriend- at the 
January 5 funeral for the three girls.

Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.
