A young woman who fell to her death during an office Christmas party at a Premier League football stadium had just broken up with her boyfriend, it emerged today.

Danielle Cooke was just 22 when her body was discovered at the foot of a stairwell in Reading's Madejski Stadium in the early hours of December 22.

Her family has paid tribute to their 'intelligent and beautiful daughter' as police continue to investigate the mysterious death.

The young estate agent was said to be devastated after splitting from her boyfriend of three years, who was also at the party.

Tragedy: Danielle Cooke fell to her death aged just 22 during her office Christmas party last month

Venue: The event was being held at the Millennium Madejski Hotel, which is attached to Reading FC's stadium

Officials have not ruled out the possibility that she may have jumped to her death, though they are currently treating the death as 'unexplained'.

Miss Cooke was found at the bottom of the fire escape in a hotel attached to the Reading FC ground.

She was pronounced dead at the scene, and a post-mortem examination found she had died from head injuries consistent with a fall from a height.

'Danni was a generous, intelligent and beautiful young woman,' her family said in a statement.

'Our family is still in shock at her untimely death.'

Detectives, who have not ruled out either suicide or foul play, have taken statements from partygoers at the Millenium Madejski Hotel.

The four-star hotel was the venue for a Christmas party held by the Romans Group estate agents, which owns the Atkinson and Keene lettings firm in Maidenhead where Danielle had worked for two years.

A statement from the company said: 'Danielle Cooke was a valued member of our Atkinson and Keene Lettings team in Maidenhead and was popular with her colleagues and clients.

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family and we ask that their wishes for privacy to mourn their loss are respected.'

Danielle lived in Bracknell with her father Paul and brother Lawrence.

Her mother was said to have separated from her husband, and lives in Northamptonshire.

The Cookes' next-door neighbour George Ferguson said: 'She was a lovely lassie. She was quiet and down to earth.

'She had her whole life in front of her, she was only 22 years old. Her death has come as a complete shock to everyone who knew her.'

Another neighbour added: 'She was a lovely girl. She was bubbly and full of life.'
