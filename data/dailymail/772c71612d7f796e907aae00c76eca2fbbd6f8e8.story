Two sisters have become Britain's youngest entrepreneurs aged just seven and four.

Budding businesswomen Elizabeth, seven, and Rebecca Appleyard, four, have launched their own company from their home in Sittingbourne, Kent, and according to the girls business is booming.

The brainy duo reckon they can give Lord Alan Sugar a run for his money and even drew up a business plan to persuade doubting relatives to invest in them.

Elizabeth and Rebecca buy toys and sweets online which they sell on at pocket money prices and are raking in up to £120 a fortnight.

Proud mother Rachel, 34, says the idea stemmed from Elizabeth's interest in how business works.

Mrs Appleyard said: 'Elizabeth wanted to learn how to earn money as she said she wanted to start saving for university.

'She wants to be a scientist and an engineer but understood that she would need to save some money.

'So we sat down and thought of a few ideas, which is when she decided she wanted to sell toys and sweets.

'We looked at toys on eBay and she came up with ideas of how much to sell them for and what her profits would be.'

Rather than just playing 'shops' like most girls their age, the sisters run the business together and manage different departments.

Elizabeth sells pocket money toys bought in bulk online while younger sister Rebecca is in charge of the sweet section.

The tiny saleswoman buys sweets and popcorn then packs the goodies into cones and sells them through their joint venture.

But to secure investment from father Peter, 36, and grandad Bill, 68, the pair had to draw up a professional business plan.

Mrs Appleyard said: 'Peter and Elizabeth held a proper business meeting so she could show him their plans.

'She set out all their ideas neatly and presented them very well, it was a bit like Dragons Den.'

Except unlike some of the unsuccessful applicants on the popular TV show, the girls secured a deal and were awarded a £76 investment.

They launched 'Just For Kids' at their local Christmas fair in early December, which Mrs Appleyard says was a huge success.

She said: 'The girls are so excited about their business and it's great to see them learning how business works.

'It's funny, they are really getting to grips with it but are also really enjoying it.

'It's always amusing to see them sat in the lounge surrounded by bits of paper and a calculator.

'But what's really surprising is that they're not even fussed about spending the money, they're very sensible and just want to save it.'
