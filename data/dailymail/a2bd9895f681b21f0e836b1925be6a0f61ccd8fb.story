John Bullett, who was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court after he sent another man to take a DNA test to avoid paying child maintenance

A scheming father who sent another man take his DNA test so he could avoid paying child maintenance, a court heard.

When the Child Support Agency asked John Bullett to prove he was the father of his son, he sent a stooge who presented himself as Bullett, signed a declaration and also had a picture taken.

Leeds Crown Court heard the man, known only as Andrew,  took the test in the summer of 2012, looked nothing like 44-year-old and even had a facial tattoo, which Bullett doesn't.

When the test came back negative 
concerned mother, Danielle Roxburgh, was shown the picture of the 
tattooed man and told the CSA it wasn't Bullet.

Julia Harrow, prosecuting, told Leeds 
Crown Court, West Yorkshire: 'She said she didn't know who the person in
the photograph was and she was 100 per cent sure Mr Bullett was the 
child's father.'

The court heard that when 
interviewed, Bullet first said he had taken the test, and only later 
admitted it wasn't him, saying he didn't know who the man who took it 
was.

A second DNA test taken by Bullett, of
Featherstone, West Yorkshire, while accompanied by two CSA officials, 
finally confirmed he was the father of Miss Roxburgh's child.

In interview Bullett, who previously 
admitted one count of fraud, told police he knew the name of the man he 
sent was Andrew but couldn't recall his second name.

Miss Harrow said: 'He said he 
[Andrew] had also had a sexual relationship with with Miss Roxburgh and 
that man had taken the test and wanted to see if he was the father.

Speaking today Recorder S Hirst said: 
'I take the the view Mr Bullett was very fortunate not be charged with 
perverting the course of justice.

'You behaved in a despicable and 
cowardly fashion. This was plainly a planned deliberate matter in which 
Mr Bullett recruited another man to pull the wool over the doctors eyes,
the department and of course to avoid paying some money to this lady to
help with the upbringing of this child.'

Bullett was sentenced to a six-month curfew and ordered to pay costs.

The CSA were approached by Mis 
Roxburgh in January 2012 to see if she could get child maintenance for 
her lad who was two-years-old at the time.

The court heard she had been in a 
relationship with Bullet for around a year, splitting in September 2009,
while she was pregnant. The court heard that at point he denied 
paternity.

Leeds Crown Court heard the man, known only as Andrew, who took the test in the summer of 2012, looked nothing like Bullett

When the CSA tracked him down he again
denied being the father and initially denied knowing Miss Roxburgh, 
later saying he didn't know her name and he had only met her a few times
in a club.

Even when interviewed in late 2012 he 
said Miss Roxburgh was 'sleeping with three other men at the time and it
was a one in three chance' it was his.

Speaking at an earlier hearing at 
Wakefield Magistrates Court, West Yorkshire, Chairman of the bench 
Angela Beardshall said: 'There was the planning, the financial loss and 
distress caused to Danielle Roxburgh.

'But the biggest factor to us is that the child in question would have grown up believing that someone else was his father.'

The man who took Bullett's place has also been asked to attend an interview.
