The Christmas tree lights 'switch on' was billed as a major event for the people of Stanley who turned out in their droves to watch Emmerdale's Ross Adam flick the switch.

The sight of safety barriers and security guards protecting the 8ft tree - the crown jewel in the Durham town's Christmas festival - served only to heighten the excitement.

But within an hour of lighting up the 
town and the faces of the 1,500 who turned out, the fake-frosted tree 
was hurriedly taken down for fear of electrocuting somebody.

Fir your eyes (and one hour) only: The Stanley Christmas tree in all its glory before council bosses pulled the plug after one hour for fear of electrocuting somebody

Fake fir: The £10,000 metal Christmas tree took all day to put up and was the crown jewel in Stanley Town Council's £15,000 Christmas budget. More than 1,500 people turned out to see the big switch on

Shocking: One Durham councillor said that there was a good risk that anyone messing around with it would 'not just get a little shock. It would be a fatality'

The plug was pulled when Stanley Town Council chiefs realised the 240 volt metal tree twinkling with thousands 
of blue lights was ten times the health and safety electrics limit.

Durham County Councillor Carl Marshall, who helped organise the festival, said: 'The tree was metal and covered in LEDs.

'If anyone was to open up a junction box or was messing about with it then there was good risk that they would not just get a little shock.

'It would be a fatality.

'I am disappointed because it was a great spectacle for Stanley’s Front Street. It is a total joke.'

The tree was bought six weeks before Saturday's 'switch-on' and its instructions were in French, although this is not believed to have caused the oversight.

It was erected by Durham County Council, who checked the tree and realised it did not meet safety specifications so fenced it off for the duration of the event and then had it dismantled.

Council clerk Russell Morgan said: 'Modification work has been scheduled for January/February 2013 to ensure that the tree is fully operational in less controlled circumstances for many more Christmases to come and a range of suitable locations is being considered within the council’s wider regeneration strategy for the town centre.'

Local shop owners, who hoped the town’s new decoration would bring much-needed trade to the town, told of their shock over the tree’s premature removal.

Gillian Andrews, manager of Store 21, a clothes and home ware store on Front Street said: 'It was meant to be a big event.

Christmas always goes so quickly: The assembling and dismantling of the 8ft metal tree cost £2,000. The voltage needed to light it ran at 240v - ten times the safety limit

'The town council and Stanley Traders Association wrote to us asking us to extend our opening hours which we did.

'There was a lot spent on it and we all hoped it would attract more people here.

'It’s disappointing that the tree has been taken down, they went to a lot of effort on the night getting a soap star and they were collecting money from each store for a Secret Santa for the kids.”

Elizabeth Cajioa, owner of Jake’s Hairdressing on Front Street, Stanley, said: 'I saw them putting it up on Saturday, after four hours they’d half finished it, but I left before they finished or took it down.

'It was a fake frosted metal tree.

Ready for action: Emmerdale's Ross Adams, known as Alex Owen to soap fans, turned on Stanley's Christmas lights

'I’m not really surprised. I didn’t think it would last, some people in Stanley might have vandalised it first.

'I think that £10,000 could have been better spent, there’s a few shops fronts that need doing up.

'The town has another Christmas tree already just further down the road, so it seems like a waste.

Darren Robins, assistant manager of 
House and Home of Front Street, Stanley, said: 'I saw it being put up, 
it was 8ft and white with white lights and they switched the lights on. 
They spent all afternoon putting it up.

'They should have thought it through.'

The
tree formed part of a programme of activities paid for by the town council
and delivered by the non-profit organisation Stanley Events.

John Reed,
head of technical services at Durham County Council, said: 'The tree 
purchased by Stanley Town Council was not safe for use in an 
unsupervised outdoor public display.

'Safety requirements specify a maximum voltage for such electrical equipm of 24 volts.

'In this case the tree had electrics
which ran at 240 volts - 10 times the safe level.

'The tree, which was part of a wider
festive lighting display, was therefore fenced off and supervised during the
switch-on event and taken down following the event on Saturday, at the request of
the town council.'
