She fell victim to a silent illness, an eating disorder which took her to the brink of death.

Ally Stableford was so weak she could no longer walk, too exhausted through malnutrition.

Yet when the size eight teenager looked into the mirror all she saw was a 'fat' person staring back - a creation of her imagination, warped by anorexia.

Now 26, the mental health student has beaten the devastating illness, standing defiantly, a healthy size 10.

Ally Stableford, now 26, has beaten anorexia after battling the illness since she was nine years old. She was so thin at one point (left) she could barely walk

For Miss Stableford, the turning point came when she was admitted to hospital twice, so malnourished doctors feared she was on the brink of succumbing to the eating disorder.

At nine years old anorexia reared its ugly head, slowly taking a hold over Miss Stableford's life.

She was embarrassed to eat in front of friends and started to skip meals.

Years later, in 2007 when Miss Stableford left home bound for university, the illness which had lurked in the background for more than a decade took hold.

In four months she lost three stone, leaving her only able to wear children's clothes and struggling to walk to lectures.

Her condition was so severe doctors admitted her to hospital, concerned the illness might claim her life.

Miss Stableford, who had to drop out of her first degree, said: 'I had covered the mirror up in my room because when I looked at myself I just saw a fat person looking back at me.'

The mental health student, who is now a healthy size 10, said her wake up call came when studying for her first degree, which she had to abandon, she became so weak she was unable to walk. She was then hospitalised twice as doctors feared she was on the brink of death

'In
 hospital I started on food supplement drinks to build up to eating 
solid foods again as I had been surviving off soup for over two months.

'I remember having to eat my first meal which was Weetabix and I was physically shaking because I was so scared to eat it.

'I also had to be weaned back into looking at myself in the mirror because I was so scared of the reflection I would see.

Miss Stableford first noticed she had problems with food when she was at primary school.

She was too embarrassed to eat her lunch in front of her class mates and when teachers told her parents they became worried and tried to make sure she ate.

Miss Stableford said: 'I was really self-conscious eating in front of people so I stopped eating my dinner at school.

'I started to miss breakfast and try my best to eat as little as I could for my tea.

'When the school told my mum and dad they would literally sit and watch me eat my tea to make sure I was having it.

When Ally Stableford looked in the mirror, the size eight student saw a 'fat person' staring back, a figment of her imagination warped by her illness

'I kept the disorder at bay for a while but by high school I was counting calories again.

'I associated confidence and popularity with being thin and even though I was already a size 8-10 I just thought that if I was thinner I would be more confident.'

The now 26-year-old, from Leyland in 
Lancashire, was unable to walk to university because she was so weak, 
and so turned to a university counsellor for help.

She was admitted to the eating disorder unit at Cheadle Royal Hospital and began the gruelling process of learning to eat again.

Miss Stableford, said: 'When I struggled to walk into university to go to a lecture I knew I needed help.

'I was absolutely petrified because I knew it would mean having to face up to everything that I had been doing.

It was when Miss Stableford moved away from home in 2007 to start her first year of university that her illness took over.

She was eating so few calories her body muscle was wasting away leaving her unable to walk to lectures.

'I
 just fell into a dark hole of self-destruction,' she said, now in her 
third year at the University of Central Lancashire studying mental 
health.

'When my mum and dad would come and visit me they would do a food shop for me and I would just throw it out once they had left.

'I became really isolated because I would avoid going anywhere or be around anyone who was eating food.

'If
 the students in my dorm were cooking I would just shut myself in my 
room because the thought of the food they were eating would just repulse
 me.'

At 19, Miss 
Stableford was dressing in children’s clothes and her destructive food 
routine became so bad her body was unable to keep itself warm.

Her
 body started to sprout Lanugo hair, a soft, fine white hair that grows 
mainly on the arms and chest of anorexic sufferers approaching 
emaciation, to try and insulate itself.

She said: 'I was constantly freezing and my lips would actually turn blue.

'I’d also have bruises all over my body because my body was so weak and I would faint quite a lot.

'My thoughts weren’t my own anymore and were just taken over by the constant battle to lose weight.'

Miss Stableford was in hospital for nine months and was readmitted a year later after falling back into her old eating habits.

She
 managed to put two stone back on in hospital and has since gained more 
weight, determined not to slip back into her destructive routine. 

But after two stays in hospital the now 26-year-old has beaten the illness, and enjoys indulging in a range of different foods, especially an Indian takeaway

She said: 'I am no longer scared of food and actually enjoy eating it, especially a good Indian meal.

'I still have some body image issues but I have a good friend and family network around me and my confidence has grown a lot.

'Anorexia is such a secretive illness so the best thing you can do is talk to someone and reach out for help sooner rather than later.'

Anorexia is a compulsive mental illness which makes the sufferer obsessed with losing weight or staying thin.

Often sufferers have a distorted view of their body and think they’re heavier than they are causing physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms.

The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence suggest that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and 46 per cent recover fully.
