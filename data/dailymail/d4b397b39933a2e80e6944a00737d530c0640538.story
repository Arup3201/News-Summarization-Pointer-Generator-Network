Russian President Vladimir Putin must end the 'festering and dangerous crisis' in Ukraine or face the consequences, David Cameron warned today.

Invoking the outbreak of World War Two, the Prime Minister said Europe must not forget the 'consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries'.

He insisted Russia 'needs European markets far more than we need Russian markets', as he warned it would be 'unthinkable' for France go ahead with selling warships to Putin.

It came after Chancellor George Osborne warned failure to stand-up to Russia  risks causing harm to the British economy.

Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that for too long some EU countries had refused to face up to the implications of the conflict in Russia, which has been 'fermented' by Moscow

Moscow will come under fresh pressure at the United Nations today and a meeting of EU foreign ministers tomorrow is expected to result in a more punitive sanctions regime.

Vladimir Mr Putin's ‘cronies’ are likely to be the targets of new financial controls.

But Britain has been frustrated by the refusal of some European countries to back tougher sanctions.

EU foreign ministers are expected to back the acceleration of sanctions against named individuals and entities, agreed last week before the MH17 crash.

However, Mr Cameron wants to go further and move to 'sectorial' sanctions, which could hit defence, energy and financial industries. 

'Further military sales I don't think should be going ahead from any country in the European Union,' he said.

Asked if France should abandon its  €1.2 billion for Mistral helicopter carriers, Mr Cameron said: 'Frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the French have.

'But we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we cannot go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way.'

Mr Cameron said it would be 'unthinkable' for France to press ahead with a deal to sell warships to Russia

In a statement to the Commons, the Prime Minister said there was now mounting evidence that separatist rebels in Ukraine shot down the Malaysian Airlines plane with a Russian surface-to-air missile. 

'President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the separatists.

'If he does not change his approach to Ukraine in this then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia.

'Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries.

'We should not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent.

'For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine.

'It is time to make our power, influence and resources felt.'  

'There is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has been fermented by Moscow,' Mr Cameron added.

The immediate priority was the repatriation of the bodies of the 298 crew and passengers killed in the crash, including 10 Britons.

He said the UK had sent a team of air crash investigators from the UK, along with police experts to help identify the victims.

But the six-strong team from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have still not been able to start their work, because armed militias are guarding the crash site and intimidating officials.

It come as US President Barack Obama called for international investigators to have "immediate and full access" to the site in eastern Ukraine. 

He accused pro-Russian separatists in the area of removing evidence and bodies from the crash site, adding: 'What exactly are they trying to hide?' 

Labour leader Ed Miliban missed the Commons debate because he is on a trip to  meet President Obama.

But in a speech to the Center for American Progress in Washington, he called for sanctions against Russia to be tightened. 

'Europe's economic well-being relies upon the upholding of international norms and international law. Our collective security requires every European country to accept its responsibility,' Mr Miliband said.

'European unity must not be an excuse for European inaction. Europe and America must stand together as they have at crucial moments in the past.

'As President Obama made clear in his state visit to the UK in 2011, Europe is a cornerstone of US global engagement. Together we are the most potent catalyst for global action that there is in the world today.'

George Osborne said the failure to stand up to Russian President Vladmir Putin with new sanctions could put the UK economy at risk

Earlier Mr Osborne insisted Britain and other countries must use their economic might to stand up to Russia.

He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: 'This is about living in a world where international borders are respected, where commercial airlines are not shot down, and it’s absolutely in Britain’s national economic interest that that is the case.

‘And when it comes to things like sanctions, of course they can have an impact on your own economy.

‘But the economic impact of not acting in a situation like this could be very much worse.’

British ministers are in talks about how wide to draw sanctions on Russian individuals and companies, following criticism that the US had gone further than the European Union before last week’s Malaysia Airlines crash.

Mr Osborne added: ‘Of course, any sanctions will have an economic impact and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions.

‘But think of the economic hit, as you put it, of allowing international borders to be ignored, of allowing airlines to be shot down.

‘That's a much greater economic hit for Britain and we're not prepared to allow that to happen.’

The Government has openly accused Russia of arming and supporting the Ukrainian rebels who shot down flight MH17.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The Russians have influence, if not direct control, over these people.

'They have been supplying, they have been supporting them, they cannot deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out.'

'There a growing number of strands of evidence, which looked at together in the round, lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel-held territory, almost certainly a missile supplied by the Russians.'

The Prime Minister has said the conflict 'could have been stopped by Moscow'.

He said all the evidence pointed to the fact that 'Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area'.

Mr Cameron said: 'If this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state, violating its territorial integrity, backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.'

There is growing evidence that MH17 was shot down by pro-Russian separatists who have seized control of eastern Ukraine.

Footage has emerged of a BUK missile launcher which could have been used to shoot down the civilian plane being smuggled back to Russia. 

Last night Mr Cameron told Mr Putin that his support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine had 'contributed to an appalling tragedy' and the delay in experts being able to carry out their investigation was 'indefensible'.

Mr Cameron, who had been trying to speak to the Russian leader since the plane was downed last Thursday, finally had a 30-minute conversation with him, an exchange which Downing Street insiders described as 'frank'.

A No 10 spokeswoman said Mr Cameron had made clear to Mr Putin that the shooting down of MH17 was 'totally unacceptable'.

Mr Cameron told the president that the 'world was now watching' and he 'must change course and work to bring stability to eastern Ukraine', the spokeswoman said.

Downing Street refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be targeted, but there is speculation it could eventually include well-known figures such as Roman Abramovich, who has close links to the Putin regime.

No10 played down suggestions Mr Putin, who is thought to have spirited away billions, could be personally targeted at this stage.

Sanctions could also include an EU-wide ban on arms sales to Russia and curbs on the ability of Russian energy firms to raise money in Europe.

Mr Cameron made clear to Mr Putin that Russia’s stance so far was ‘completely unacceptable’.

He urged him to intervene immediately to ensure the victims, whose bodies have been removed by local militias, could have proper funerals.

A source said he told the Russian President: ‘Ten of my citizens have just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by Russian separatists.

'I have been asking to speak to you since this happened. You clearly can play a role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the site.’ 

Britain and Australia will today try to push through a UN Security Council resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access.

But British sources are gloomy about its prospects after Moscow vetoed a similar call on Saturday.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will travel to Brussels tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on Russia.
