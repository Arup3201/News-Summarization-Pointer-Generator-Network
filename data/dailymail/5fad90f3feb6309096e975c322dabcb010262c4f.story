Chelsea full back Wallace has joined Vitesse Arnhem on a season-long loan in order to gain more regular first-team football.

The 20-year-old is the latest in a long line of Chelsea players to be loaned out to Vitesse and the move comes off the back of a difficult loan spell at Inter Milan.

Wallace follows Lucas Piazon, Bertrand Traore, Patrick van Aanholt, Christian Atsu, Gael Kakuta and Sam Hutchinson in the ranks of Chelsea players who have spent time at the Dutch club in the last 12 months.

Vitesse, who finished sixth in the Eredivisie last season, enjoy a close relationship with the Blues. The club’s owner Alexander Chigrinsky is an associate of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

Their Technical Director Mohammed Allach said: 'Wallace is a big talent, he fits in our offensive way of playing and provides more options in our midfield and defence.'

Wallace spent last season on loan at Inter Milan but only made three appearances for the club as they finished fifth in Serie A.

He joined Chelsea from Fluminese in January 2013, but was immediately loaned back to his former club.

The Brazilian Under-20 international made his debut for Jose Mourinho’s side during last summer’s tour of Asia before his season on loan at Inter.
