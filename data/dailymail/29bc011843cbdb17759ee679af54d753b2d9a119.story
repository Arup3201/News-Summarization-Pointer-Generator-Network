A nine-year-old boy found a message in a bottle while exploring a wooded beach of a small lake island on a family vacation - and then realized it was addressed to his grandfather. 

Nolan Rogers had been on a fishing trip with his family on Lake Murray in South Carolina. His mother, Viki Garrick noticed her childrens' attention waning and stopped at a small island to explore. 

That's when Nolan came across a screw-top Dr Pepper bottle with a rolled-up letter inside sitting next to a log.

Nolan Rogers was exploring a remote island in South Carolina's Lake Murray when he spotted the screw-top glass bottle with a letter inside

When Nolan's mother Viki Garrick read the letter, she immediately recognized her friend Diane Bryant's (left) handwriting. The letter was written to Nolan's grandfather, Mike Rogers (right)

Nolan imagined it was a 'note from the pirates or something', and showed his parents who read the note first, according to The Slate. 

Garrick and her husband could only make out a few words on the yellowed paper towel, but were able to make out, 'I wish I could see you... I love you so much... I love you, Diane'. 

They couldn't read who the letter was addressed to, but noticed the name started with the letter 'M'. 

Garrick recognized the signature from an old friend of hers and immediately sent a picture of the letter to her friend Diane Bryant, who responded by saying she knew 'exactly where that came from'.

In 1970, when Bryant, who's now 58, was about 13 years old, she was on an overnight church gathering on Lake Murray. 

The letter, found in the bottle pictured, had faded, but Garrick could read, 'I wish I could see you... I love you so much... I love you, Diane

Bryant (left) hoped that Rogers, righty, would find the letter when he was on vacation with his family later in the summer of 1970. He didn't discover the letter for another 45 years

She was missing her then-boyfriend, Mike Rogers, who wasn't allowed on the trip because he had gotten in some kind of trouble at the time.

The couple had dated on and off when they were teenagers. 

'He had long hair. And my dad did not like him, so therefore, I liked him,' Bryant told The Slate. 'I was his church girlfriend. I knew he had other girlfriends.'  

She said that as a 13-year-old, she was 'devastated' that Rogers couldn't come on the trip. 

So she wrote a love note - as the couple often did - and stuffed it in a bottle before tossing it in a lake, hoping Mike would find it later in the summer when he vacationed with his family,according to ABC.  

'With my whole heart, I just knew one day he would find it,' Bryant said. 'I've thought about it through the years, thinking, "I wonder if anyone ever found that bottle?"'

Bryant and Rogers remain friends to this day, though they are no longer romantically involved. They both married different people

And 45 years later, Rogers did find it. Nolan led him, now 58, to the spot where he found the bottle, and his grandfather joked that he finally 'got it'. 

He had a good laugh and told ABC that it was fun to reminisce about the 'good old times'.  

'The more you think about it, the more it blows your mind,' Rogers told The Slate. 'There's got to be some more meaning to this.'

Bryant agreed, saying she didn't know what 'the hidden message' was. 

Though the pair remained friends over the years, they decided they 'would have killed each other a long time ago', Bryant said. 

She and her husband Ron have been married for nearly 40 years. Ron was on the same church trip as Bryant the day she wrote her love letter to Rogers. 

Rogers is also married with children and grandchildren.
