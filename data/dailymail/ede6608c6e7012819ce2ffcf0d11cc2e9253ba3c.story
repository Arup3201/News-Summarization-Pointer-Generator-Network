Tony Abbott's controversial decision to knight Prince Philip has prompted an unexpected foray into film for the Australian Prime Minister.

A hilarious video from emerging video-editor Huw Parkinson sees Mr Abbott seamlessly edited into the opening scene from the classic British film Four Weddings and A Funeral.

Prime Minister Abbott's Australia Day knighthood speech is imposed over the cringe-worthy first man speech in the film.

Tony Abbott's controversial decision to knight Prince Philip has prompted a barrage of criticism for the Australian Prime Minister

The clip begins with Prime Minister Abbott standing to address a large crowd featuring Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant.

'Today we've had Prince Philp, who joins Prince Charles as a Knight in the Order of Australia,' he says.

At this stage the Prime Minister is cut off by Simon Callow's thundering laughter, a nod to the amusement of many Australians towards Mr Abbott's speech. 

'Every year, four Australians will receive knighthoods in the order of Australia. Today we've had Prince Phillip who joins Prince Charles as a knight in the order of Australia,' he goes on.

'Today we've had Prince Philp, who joins Prince Charles as a Knight in the Order of Australia,' he says to a large crowd, including Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant

'I'm pleased that the Queen has seen fit to award knighthoods in the Order of Australia to Prince Philip. I think we've had a good thrash at this one.'

After this, the crowd bursts into uncontrollable laughter.

Parkinson was also behind a viral House of Representatives Seinfeld mash-up video last year, as well as a Jacqui Lambie meets Ghostbusters treatment. 

On a more serious note, the knighthood decision has sparked barrage of criticism, with former Abbott supporters claiming it could be a fatal blow to his leadership of Australia.

Mr Abbott's most high profile media supporter Andrew Bolt told Macquarie Radio it was a 'flabbergasting' choice on Thursday.

'This is just such a pathetically stupid - gosh, I didn't mean to be that strong because I actually like Tony Abbott very much - but this is just such a very, very, very stupid decision, so damaging that it could be fatal,' he said.

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch also blasted Tony Abbott's decision to knight Prince Philip in a rare criticism of the Prime Minister.

The billionaire derided the knighthood as a 'joke and embarrassment' in a Twitter post on Tuesday morning. 

He has even garnered criticism from his own party, with Queensland Liberal National Party MPs Warren Entsch and Ewen Jones condemning the decision in various media interviews.
