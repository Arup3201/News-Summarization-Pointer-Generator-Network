Hillary is lucky to have Bill as her dance partner, former Republican presidential 
candidate and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said yesterday on CNN's
 Crossfire, because she's as ungraceful as Kim Kardashian at a Prince concert

'Bill is to 
politics what Fred Astaire is to dancing, he is just automatically 
amazing and he wants to have Ginger Rogers out there dancing,' Gingrich,
 who co-hosts the show, said according to Politico.

'Instead
 [with Hillary Clinton] it’s a little bit like watching Kim Kardashian 
get kicked off the stage by Prince because she couldn’t dance.'

'I think there’s a big problem, because I don’t think, as a candidate, that [she] dances very well,' Gingrich said of Hillary.

Not welcome 'round these parts: Hillary Clinton would 'probably get shot at the state line' if she tried to campaign for president in Arkansas in 2016, a GOP official from the state said yesterday

Hillary and Bill Clinton have been hit with a slew of attacks throughout the last several months as Republicans gear up for the 2016 presidential race

Speculation over Hillary's political plans has encouraged a new round of attacks on the Clintons throughout the past several months.

Nothing's been off limits in the 2016 firefight, and Republicans have thrown everything including the kitchen sink at the former first family in hopes that Hillary will rethink her presidential aspirations.

Bill's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the '90s, Hillary's early career as a criminal defense lawyer, a spill Hillary took as secretary of state that caused a concussion - those are just a few incidents in the Clinton family's past that Hilary's opponents have exploited in the media since April.

Hillary has contributed to her fair share of critical media coverage, however, making gaffes left and right at her numerous speaking events. Hillary's latest memoir, Hard Choices, provided additional ammunition for the right when it was released earlier this month.

The most notable chink in the Clinton's political armor came during one of Hillary's first interviews to promote her book.

Hillary told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House.

'We had no money when we got there, and 
we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, 
for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy,' Hillary said.

Attempts by the Clinton family to amend the statement have only led to more stories about their wealth and complaints that Hillary is 'out of touch.'

A follow-up comment by Hillary that the former first family was roughly $12 million in debt at the end of Bill's presidency was rebutted by evidence that she and Bill made that much money in their first year out of the White House.

Bill 
Clinton has made more than $106 million in speaking fees alone since his
 days as the 42nd president of the United States, and he received a 
nifty $15 million advance payment for his 2004 autobiography, My Life.

Hillary
 Clinton has made $5 million off of speaking gigs since she left the 
Obama administration and received upward of $8 million for Hard Choices.
 That's in addition to the $8 million she received for her 2003 memoir 
Living History.

Chelsea Clinton is on a $600,000 a year contract with NBC News on top of her salary at the Clinton Foundation.

Recent estimates put Bill and Hillary's combined net worth at $100 million or more.

In an interview with the Guardian published over the weekend, Hillary said her wealth doesn't hurt her image with poor people.

'They don't see me as 
part of the problem because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of 
people who are truly well off - not to name names,' Clinton said.

'And we've done it through dint of hard work.'

Yesterday Bill attempted to come to his wife's rescue at a Clinton Global Initiative America event.

Bill told NBC host David Gregory during an on-stage interview that Hillary advocated for legal assistance 
for the poor in law school, and in the '70s she fought for paid leave for new mothers.

'She's not out of touch,' he said.

'We go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on.'

'The real issue is, if you've been fortunate enough to be successful, are you now out of touch and insensitive to the agonizing struggles other people are facing?' Clinton asked.

'It is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt,' he said at another point.

Bill also said he doesn't think that average Americans will be offended by his family's post presidential success.

'I don't think most Americans resent somebody else doing well. They 
resent that they're not getting a fair deal. They want the bottom to 
grow. They want the middle to grow,' he said.

After the event, Hillary told PBS it was 'very sweet' of Bill to defend her, but 'I don’t need anybody to defend my record.

'I think my record speaks for itself.'

Hillary may not be making all the 
right moves, but she's getting enough of them correct to continue coming
 out in front in hypothetical 2016 match-ups.

Rasmussen
 Reports, a right-leaning polling organization, said on Monday that 
Clinton would beat most of her potential 2016 general election opponents
 by double digits.

Texas
 Governor Rick Perry, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Sens. Marco
 Rubio of Florida, and Ted Cruz of Texas, would all lose to Clinton by 
11 to 14 points if the election were held now.

Kentucky
 Sen. Rand Paul came the closest to beating Clinton in Rasmussen's poll,
 and he would still lose to her by seven points, the survey said.

Other
 suspected candidates like conservative pundit and retired neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were not tested.

Million in debt: Bill Clinton told NBC host David Gregory yesterday that his wife was telling the truth when she said her family was $12 million in debt when they left the White House

If Hillary does run for president in 2016, she'd be wise to stay out of Arkansas, though, a GOP official said on Tuesday.

'She'd probably get shot at the state line' if she tried to campaign there, he said.

Clinton
 lived there for more than more than 18 years with her husband when he 
served as Attorney General and later Governor, but she's no longer 
welcome in The Natural State, 2nd Congressional District chairman Johnny
 Rhoda told U.S. News yesterday.

'Nobody has any affection for her. The majority don't.'
