A family is in mourning after a wife and mother-of-two Mary Jordan died on a family holiday in New Zealand.

Mary Jordan and her husband Trent were four days into their holiday in Rotorua with their children Cara, 6, and Harry, 9.

Mr Jordan and his son were exploring a nearby national park, leaving Mrs Jordan and the couple's daughter at their accommodation.

Mrs Jordan suffered a seizure in a hotel swimming pool, as Cara struggled to hold her mother's head above water, drying her with a towel before running for help.

'We meshed, lived, laughed and loved in the way that now she’s gone, I’m not sure who I am,' said Mr Jordan

Paramedics were called to the scene but were unable to revive Mrs Jordan, who had a history of seizures and have suffered eclampsia during at least one of her pregnancies.

Cara is now being hailed for her courage, with New Zealand police praising the six-year-old girl for her brave actions.

Mr Jordan spoke out at his wife's funeral, saying that 'told me how brave you were and how much love you showed to Mummy by keeping her safe and going for help,'

'I am so proud of you and so is everyone else here. You’re a hero.'

At the farewell service for Mary Jordan last week, Mr Jordan called his wife 'my best friend, my love, my life', reported the Courier Mail.

'The cliche is that there’s a hole in my heart,' he said.

'It’s not so simple. We were one. One word – ‘trentandmary’, lower case, no spaces. Take out a single letter and things get confused. Take away the last four letters and the meaning vanishes.'

'The cliche is that there’s a hole in my heart,' Mr Trent said.

Mr Jordan said he wanted 'to tell the world how wonderful she was'.

'We meshed, lived, laughed and loved in the way that now she’s gone, I’m not sure who I am.'

The couple lost a daughter, Ellen, to Neonatal Hemochromatosis, just a day after she was born, with Mary suffering seizures as a result of complications following the birth.

She was placed in a drug-induced coma which lasted for four days. 

The Jordans had campaigned to raise awareness of the condition, explaining on their blog, 'We hope that sharing our story of Ellen will help people who may have experienced a similar loss.'

Mrs Jordan wrote of her experience of the ordeal saying, 'We also know how fickle life can be'. 

Trent Jordan said that the couple had recently celebrated 15 years of marriage and both of their 40th birthdays.

'That night was a wonderful opportunity for me to explain and tell everyone what a wonderful and beautiful person my wife was,' Mr Jordan said.

'I didn’t do it ... I didn’t worry too much, though. I wouldn’t forget next time. But this is next time. She’s not here to hear me say it.'

Mr Jordan said he wanted 'to tell the world how wonderful she was'.
