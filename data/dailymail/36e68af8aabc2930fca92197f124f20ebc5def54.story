A schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his 'extreme' haircut grows out, which could take months.  

Liam Pegg, 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies - despite having the cut for a year.

The Year 8 pupil now has to stay in isolation and will not be allowed to go out and socialise with other students, even at break times, until his hair grows out - which could be months.

But Liam's father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception.

Tim, a 30-year-old carpenter, said: 'His haircut is a mix of a mullet and a mohawk. He spikes up the top, but leaves the back flat for school.

'He has had this haircut for well over a year and no-one has had a problem with it before, so I don't understand why it has been raised as an issue now.

'It's hardly an extreme hairstyle. I would understand if he had dyed it bright pink and had it spiked up all over the place, but it isn't.'

Liam arrived at Nailsea School, in North Somerset, on Monday to be told he was no longer allowed to attend lessons with his friends and must report to isolation.

The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before 

The punishment involves students being taught in a room on their own, where they are set work and supervised by a member of staff.

They are not allowed to go out and socialise with other students even at break time. 

The case is similar to that of Anthony Mousiou who was told he must study in isolation by Samuel Ryder Academy after his short-back-and-sides was just 4.5 millimetres too short and breached their uniform policy.

Liam's parents, Tim and Claire, were informed their son had been placed in the special measure indefinitely when he arrived home from school.

They say Liam has had the same hairstyle since he started at the school in September 2013.

Mr Pegg added: 'We only found out that he had been placed in isolation when Liam came home and told us. We had no contact from the school.

'He has been in isolation all day, every day, since Monday. He is not in the classes he should be, socialising with other students nor taking any exercise.

'Surely this is against his human rights. When we went up to the school to discuss it we were told he would have to stay in isolation until his hair grows back.

'The headteacher said that in his opinion Liam's hair cut was inappropriate and extreme.

There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide.

But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy.

The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy.

A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion.

'If he has to wait until his hair grows back, he could be in isolation for months. This is outrageous and is effecting his education.'

The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before.

A number of years ago it hit the headlines after it banned female students from wearing skirts after problems with ones that were too short.

Head teacher Chris Wade said: 'The governors and staff at Nailsea School are united in setting high standards as we firmly believe our role is not just to enable students to pass exams, but to prepare them for life as an adult in their future work.

'It is also important to instill in students an awareness of rules so that they can be functioning members of society. I do not apologise for having these high expectations and for reserving the right to take action when our standards are not met.

'On this occasion it appears the parents disagree with the school about what is seen as acceptable but I remain open to discussing this in person with them.

'Ultimately if parents are not convinced that the rules we adhere to are of benefit to them or their children they may choose to attend another school.'

When students join Nailsea School, parents sign a home/school agreement in which they promise to ensure the children follow the rules.

The school's uniform policy says: 'If students arrive inappropriately dressed for school, they will in the first instance, be spoken to by their teachers and, if necessary, by their head of house.

'We reserve the right to send home any student whose clothing, hairstyle or personal appearance is inappropriate for school.'
