It's a sight that suddenly makes a repetitive 9-5 job look a whole lot more appealing.

The incredible video shows a glimpse in the day of what is surely the worst job in the world - a human pipe cleaner.

In the footage, which was published on YouTube, the sewer worker is seen being dunked into blocked drains by his colleagues in Timisoara, western Romania.

The two overall-wearing men use ropes to pull the submerged worker out from the sewer, feet first

The video shows the two overall-wearing men clutching onto ropes which hold the submerged worker in place, as he conscientiously cleans the inside of a sewer pipe.

The workman is dangled for around 30 seconds, before he is slowly lifted, inch by inch, out of the hole.

He then appears from the sewer feet first, before clambering out of the hole and stepping back into broad daylight.

The man - who emerges looking relatively unscathed - then casually walks away from the camera, ready for the next instalment of his daily dunking.Â 

The workman, who is donning red overalls, is helped scramble out of the hole by his two colleagues
