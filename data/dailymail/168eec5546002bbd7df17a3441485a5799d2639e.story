Ryan Ferguson, who was wrongfully convicted of second-degree murder and freed after 10 years in jail, has revealed how his newfound friend Amanda Knox is coping with the 'Italian court playing games with her life'.

Ferguson, 29, got in touch with Knox when he was released from prison last year after his conviction was overturned by a Missouri state appeals court panel and the pair quickly struck up a close bond.

He has revealed that Knox, 26, is 'doing considerably well' as she awaits the verdict from her latest trial - now the third she has been subjected to - for the 2007 murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher.

Something in common: It's no secret that Ryan and Amanda have become good friends since both were released. Here Amanda holds a sign welcoming Ryan with her best friend Madison Paxton

Speaking to ABC News, he said: 'She 
seems to be doing incredibly well considering the circumstances. The 
Italian courts continue to play games with her life which is sadly no 
different than what happens here on a daily basis.

'Having
 said that, she is very positive and we all believe that justice will 
prevail and the facts that have proven her innocence will set her free.

It comes after Ferguson revealed reading Knox's book helped get him through some of his darkest days.

In
 parallels to Ferguson's case, Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele 
Sollecito were also wrongfully imprisoned, serving four years in an 
Italian prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

Knox returned to the U.S. a free woman in 2011 after her 2009 murder conviction was thrown out by an Italian appeals court.

But she is now being tried for a third time in her absence for the murder.

Italy's highest criminal court overturned Knox's acquittal in the 2007 murder of a British student and ordered a new trial.

Ferguson
 has said he is able to identify with Amanda on many levels. 'I know 
first hand what it is like to have the world turn against you based on a
 series of lies,' he said in a revealing post on Facebook.

Knox, who became a Free Ryan supporter after hearing about his case, says the two have formed a close friendship since his release.

‘To get arrested and to get charged for a
 crime you didn't commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your life very
 fast,’ Ferguson said upon his release from jail. ‘But to get out of prison, it takes an army.’

Ferguson's case gained attention because
 his high school classmate, Chuck Erickson, claimed to have recalled 
through dreams that he and Ferguson had killed Heitholt during a 
late-night robbery after a Halloween of partying. Erickson has since 
recanted his testimony but is still in prison.

Ferguson has since revealed that while he was in prison, he read Amanda's book, Waiting To Be Heard.

Ferguson has decided to speak publicly about Amanda Knox's case, saying he has studied her situation in depth.

'I
 knew about Amanda's case while I was in prison. They're at this crucial
 point with their lives right now and to not say something, not speak up
 to not help spread awareness, it would be negligent,' Ferguson said.

Like
 his own case of wrongful imprisonment, many people had a knee-jerk 
reaction to Knox's story based on misleading information that has leaked
 into the media.

In his posting on Facebook, Ferguson points out several facts about Knox's case for people to understand:

1)
 When Amanda was initially interviewed by the Italian police she was 
badgered for hours in an interrogation that was later ruled illegal by 
an Italian appeals court. Amanda eventually signed a false confession in
 a moment of desperation. 25% of wrongful convictions are the result of 
false confessions (remember, my conviction also hinged on a false 
confession from Charles Erickson)

2)
 There was plenty of DNA evidence in the room in which Meredith Kercher 
was murdered including blood and fingerprint samples. NONE of it matched
 Amanda. But it DID match with Rudy Guede, who was later convicted of 
the murder.

3) The only 'witnesses' against Amanda were later deemed unreliable by an appeals court. (sound familiar?)

Freed at last: After his release from jail last November, Ryan 
Ferguson, 29, held an emotional press conference  thanking his parents and the 'army' of
 people who had helped in his struggle

4)
 Guede had a history of breaking and entering and wielding a knife. In 
the days following Meredith's murder he fled the country.

5)
 The Prosecution didn't have any real facts to convict Amanda – so 
turned the trial into a character assassination, presenting Knox as a 
crazed, sexual deviant. (In the same way my Prosecution presented me at 
trial as a spoiled rich kid)'

Ferguson
 notes that despite Knox being originally convicted of Kercher’s 
murder and then freed by an Italian appeals court, the current retrial 
that is taking place is as a result of an appeal launched by the 
prosecution. He believes the retrial is 'a politically motivated move [by the prosecution] to cover 
their mistakes.'

If Knox loses this appeal she may be extradited to Italy to serve a life sentence for Kercher's murder.

If
 she isn't extradited she will essentially become a prisoner in her own country, never able to leave the U.S. The conviction with hang over her for the rest of her life.

On his decision to speak out about Amanda Knox's predicament, he says the choice was a simple one for him to make.

'People
 helped save my life and I feel like if I can do some small part in 
helping another person get their life back then I'm going to do that.'
