When David Cameron was caught posing for a selfie at Nelson Mandela's memorial service, he said it was important to remember that 'the television cameras are always on'.

They are wise words which all politicians would do well to heed.

For every moment of glory like the Prime Minister's romantic tribute to 'this sceptered isle' or Tory minister Anna Soubry socking it to UKIP's Nigel Farage, there are the gaffes and blunders they would rather forget.

From Ed Miliband getting egged and Ed Balls' hot-headed Autumn Statement response to sports minister Helen Grant failing a question of sport, the cameras kept on rolling.

This was the year that brought us the prime ministerial breadmaker, pesky badgers moving goalposts and Boris Johnson's extraordinary slam dunk.

But there was one man who seemed incapable of opening his mouth without making the headlines...

Godfrey Bloom bemoaned aid money being sent to Bongo Bongo Land, called a room full of women sluts and then so spectacularly derailed the UKIP conference with an accusation that a Channel 4 reporter was racist he was forced to quit the party.

1. MEP Godfrey Bloom clobbers Channel 4's Michael Crick

UKIP's controversial Godfrey Bloom lost the UKIP whip earlier this year after he described women as 'sluts' before hitting reporter Michael Crick around the head with a copy of the party's agenda after accusing him of being a racist.

2. Boris Johnson's 'slam-dunk'

Ever the showman, the London Mayor impressed in April by netting a backwards basketball trick shot outside his offices at London Bridge - with the footage going viral on the internet.

He scores! Rather impressively, Boris Johnson scored a backwards trick-shot in April this year

3. Hot-headed Ed Balls left red-faced by the Autumn Statement

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was lampooned for getting rather red-faced during the Autumn Statement debate in the Commons. #RedEd was trending on Twitter, while an enhanced photograph with the caption 'he's going to blow' went viral.

He's gonna blow! #RedEd was trending on Twitter after the Shadow Chancellor got a bit worked up over the Autumn Statement

4. David Cameron hits back at the Russians when they called Britain a 'small island'

The Prime Minister jumped into defence mode at the G20 summit in St Petersburg when Dmitry Peskov, the Russian president's official spokesman, reportedly told Russian journalists that Britain is 'just a small island'.

'Small island': Mr Cameron was not happy when the Russians reportedly said Britain was a 'small island'

5. Owen Paterson and those pesky 'goal-post moving badgers'

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson had some issues with the animal kingdom this year. After announcing a pilot cull in west Somerset needed to be extended by three weeks, the MP said: 'The badgers moved the goalposts.' How dare they.

Never work with animals: Owen Patterson has issues with 'goal-post moving badgers' this year

6. Tory minister Anna Soubry doesn't hold back taking on UKIP's Nigel Farage on immigration

UKIP 
leader Nigel Farage was accused by the Tory of putting ‘fear in people’s
 hearts’ by scaremongering about immigration figures on BBC's Question Time.

Don't hold back: Anna Soubry said Farage put ¿fear in people¿s hearts¿ by scaremongering about immigration

7. David Cameron on the price of a loaf of bread... and how he uses a breadmaker

The Prime Minister proved he was just like us earlier this year by saying he 'didn't know the price of bread' as he has a breadmaker. Plenty of mockery followed.

Great British Bake Off? David Cameron didn't know the price of bread as he makes his own

8. Eric Pickles' world tour (well, a cardboard cutout)

A life-size cut-out of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles went on a trip to the U.S. - returning back to Westminster to meet the man himself in October.

Have a nice trip: A cardboard cut-out of Eric Pickles made a trip around the US

9. Sports minister Helen Grant faces a question of sport

The Tory MP failed to answer a single question correctly about football, rugby, tennis or the Paralympic during a television interview.

Quiz: Helen Grant failed to get a single question correct when quizzed about sport in a television interview

10. Labour leader Ed Miliband gets EGGED in south London

Mr Miliband was on the campaign trail when he got egg in his face at East Street Market, Walworth.

Some of these politicians might have wished they had heeded the advice

From egg throwing to slam dunking we chart the best videos of the year

But which political gaffe-machine gave us the number 1 moment of 2013?
