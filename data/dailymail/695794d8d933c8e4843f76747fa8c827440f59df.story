An Italian man left unable to speak or communicate properly following a head injury took doctors by surprise by ‘waking up’ and talking to his family normally after being given a common anti-anxiety drug.

The 43-year-old man, who doctors have named SV, suffered a traumatic head injury during a car accident two years ago.

He was left in a coma for 40 days, and then in a vegetative state – where he was awake but showing no signs of awareness – for four weeks.

A 43-year-old Italian man who was left unable to speak or communicate after a head injury amazed doctors by 'waking up' when he was given the common anti-anxiety drug midazolam. Tests revealed the drug had triggered changes in two networks of the brain responsible for responding to tasks and language

One year on after the accident, SV’s condition had deteriorated. 

He could only think and move slowly, and was completely dependent on others for all daily tasks necessary for living.

Throughout the next year, his family noticed even more of a decline. He didn’t speak or communicate in any way, and didn’t answer simple requests like ‘close your eyes’.

He would carry out what doctors called ‘aimless repetitive behaviours’ like clapping, but wouldn’t respond to other stimulus from doctors or his family.

Doctors tested a few different drugs, hoping to help him communicate again.

After nothing seemed to work, they stopped giving medicine.

He was diagnosed as being in a ‘minimally conscious state’, meaning he was awake, but was unable to communicate and needed constant care.

One day SV was send for a routine CT scan - a test which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images the brain – his doctors decided to give him common anti-anxiety drug midazolam to sedate him.

What happened next amazed doctors. Instead of making the man drowsy for the procedure, the drug ‘woke him up’ and he started to chat to the anaesthetists and then his parents.

Midazolam is in the family of drugs called ‘benzodiazepines’.

It works in the brain to cause sleepiness, muscle relaxation, and short-term memory loss, and to reduce anxiety.

Midazolam can cause severe breathing problems when used for sedation for conditions that do not require urgent medical attentions.

It can stop the lungs working properly, which could result in brain damage or death if not treated properly.

He spoke to his aunt on the phone, recognised the road to his home and even congratulated his brother when he was told he had graduated.

His family asked him about his accident, but he couldn’t remember anything and was unaware he’d been unable to speak until now.

Two hours later the drugs wore off and SV returned to his previous, minimally conscious state.

A few weeks later doctors gave him the anti-anxiety drug again, and this time monitored his behaviour and also looked at EEG recordings of his brain - a scan which picks up brain impulses.

Once again SV started to chat and interact, and could even carry out basic maths, before losing the ability to speak when the drugs wore off.

Doctors said SV was ‘able to understand verbal commands and to perform any type of response required, either behavioural or verbal,’ after being given the drug.

When they studied the EEG recordings of his brain impulses, they found the drug had triggered a change in the brainwave activity in two parts of the brain.

The first was the part of the brain called the task-positive network, which helps us respond to tasks that require our attention.

The second was the part of the brain responsible for speaking and understanding language.

Writing in the journal Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, where the doctors documented SV’s case, they said this is the first described in medical literature where a patient has ‘woken up’ after being given the drug midazolam.

Midazolam is from the family of drugs called benzodiazepines. Doctors said its use in patients with minimal consciousness - who are unable to communicate - should be investigated. A midazolam molecule is pictured

They said they suspected SV may have catatonia – a symptom of medical conditions like schtitzophrenia and depression - which leaves a seemingly-awake person unresponsive to stimulus.

This is because patients with catatonia are also responsive to benzodiazepines, the family of drugs which includes midazolam.

However, they theorized that perhaps some patients in a ‘minimally conscious state’ also show symptoms of catatonia, leaving them unable to move.

Either way, they concluded that treatment with midazolam should be explored for such patients.

They could be given a continuous infusion of the drug midazolam, which is commonly done in intensive care units for people undergoing long-lasting seizures, they said.

However, it is not clear what SV's long-term's fate was.
