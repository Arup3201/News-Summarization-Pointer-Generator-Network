The view of the Eiffel Tower against the Paris skyline is breathtaking on an ordinary day, but the French capital was recently bathed in a rare horizontal rainbow.

Across the city's horizon a clear spectrum of colours emerged for a short time, in a natural phenomenon known as a fire rainbow.

Parisian Bertrand Kulik, 33, spotted the unusual display out of the window of his apartment in France's capital on March 17.

Horizontal rainbows, or circumhorizon arcs, occur when cirrus clouds are elevated enough to form plate-shaped ice crystals

Amateur photographer Mr Kulik said: 
‘I have never seen a rainbow like that before. This light phenomenon 
looked like a rising aurora over Paris.

'When I saw it, I had to react 
very fast. I was very impressed by this beauty and I knew that I could 
not miss it.’

The display was only visible for a short time, but Mr Kulik quickly grabbed his camera and captured the rare sight.

Fire rainbows are a common sight in the U.S. but are rarer in northern Europe because the sun is not often at the right angle to create the effect

The horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms abd stormy weather that lashed Paris last week

He
 added: ‘It was only possible to see it for few minutes. Often I am 
waiting to catch some weather pictures. Every day I hope to see some 
atmospheric phenomenons like that.

‘The day was tormented with a stormy sky. Even in a big city it's possible to see some amazing natural phenomenon.

‘It was a very turbulent day and I will remember it for a long time.’

The horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms that lashed Paris last week.

Fire
 rainbows, known by the proper name of circumhorizon arc, occur when 
cirrus clouds are far enough up in the air to form plate-shaped ice 
crystals.

They are not actually rainbows, but a halo effect, although they are commonly referred to as fire rainbows.

When the sun is at the right angle it hits the top of these 
plates and splits into different colours that are viewable on the 
ground.

Although such fire rainbows are 
relatively common in the United States, they are a rarer sight in 
northern Europe where the sun less frequently has the required elevation
 needed for it to occur.

The effect only lasted for a few minutes so Bertrand Kulik acted quickly to capture the skyline vista
