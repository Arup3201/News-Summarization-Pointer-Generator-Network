It is one of Britain's greatest architectural masterpieces and these stunning photos give a rare glimpse inside the 150-year-old Clifton Suspension Bridge.

The iconic bridge, stretched 245 feet above the River Avon to link Bristol with Somerset, reached its landmark birthday this month.

And to celebrate, photographer Jon Rowley was granted rare access to the magnificent structure that Isambard Kingdom Brunel referred to as 'my first child, my darling'.

Jon captured images from inside the 110ft-high Leigh Woods tower and the stunning views across Bristol and the surrounding countryside.

In 2002 it was discovered that the abutment on which the tower stands was not a solid structure but contained 12 vaulted chambers up to 35 feet high, linked by shafts and tunnels. 

Roller-mounted 'saddles' at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge. 

Though their total travel is minuscule, their ability to absorb forces created by chain deflection prevents damage to both tower and chain.

The bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge, opened to the public on December 8, 1864 and is regarded as  Brunel’s finest achievement.

Plans for a bridge go back as far as 1754 when Bristol wine merchant William Vick left £1,000 in his will to the Society of Merchant Venturers, requesting £10,000 was raised to build a bridge to the city.

However, war with France stalled the idea of a grand bridge, built tall enough so that ships could pass underneath, and it was not until the 1820s that it was resuscitated. 

Completed in 1864, the majestic Clifton Suspension bridge is a testament to the ingenuity of Victorian engineering.

It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel who was only 24 years old when he won the commission to build the incredible structure.

The majority of the weight of the bridge is supported by its two major towers; Leigh Woods tower and the Clifton tower.

As compression pushes down on Clifton Bridge’s deck, the chains transfer that compression to the towers. The towers then dissipate the compression directly into the ground.

The bridge has three independent wrought iron chains on each side, from which the bridge deck is suspended by 81 matching vertical iron rods ranging from 65ft (20 metres) at the ends to 3ft (0.91 metres) in the centre.

Roller-mounted ‘saddles’ at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge, to help absorb forces and prevent damage to the structure.

The supporting cables deal with the bridge's tension forces. These cables run horizontally between the bridges anchorages, which pass the tension forces to the rock below.

Timber sleepers overlaid with planking make up the deck of the bridge, which has been covered with asphalt since 1897.

The bridge is made up of 3,500 load bearing bolts and huge chains that stretch 20 miles (32km) underground.

Of the 4,200 links in the iron chains which hold the 1,500-ton structure together, 4,199 are Victorian originals.

Overall, it spans 700ft (210 metres) and sits 245ft (75 metres) above the water below at high tide.

By 1829, £8,000 had been secured and a competition was announced for engineers to submit their designs for a bridge across the gorge.

The competition was to be judged by Menai Bridge designer Thomas Telford, but he rejected all entries - including Brunel's - and submitted his own plans.

However, locals were not impressed by Telfords plans and the whole project stalled.

A year later a new competition was held and Brunel, who was just 24 at the time, was declared the winner and appointed project engineer for a fee of 2,000 guineas.

Work was painfully slow and expensive and became surplus to requirement when another bridge was opened so the project was abandoned in 1853. 

The spectacular photos, taken from the top of the tower, gove a new perspective on the iconic Grade 1-listed bridge

But Brunel's death in 1859, aged just 53, prompted the Institution of Civil Engineers to restart the project to commemorate their hero.

They purchased chain links form the Hungerford Bridge in London, another Brunel project which was being dismantled, and used them to complete the Cliftonproject.

The link, purchased for £5,000, were even transported to Bristol on Brunel's Great Western Railway.

By November 1864, the bridge was ready and workmen tested t by dumping 500 tons of rock on the central section to see if it would hold.

The rare images celebrate what is one of Britain's most iconic architectural masterpieces, and 34 years in the making

Brunel first won the competition to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol in 1830, but it was not completed until 34 years later

After being abandoned in 1853, the bridge project was restarted following Brunel's death and completed in 1864

The bridge dipped seven inches under the weight, but returned to its former state once they were removed, declaring the engineering feat a success.

A century and a half later, the bridge still draws half a million visitors a year to marvel at the engineering wonder.

And the Grade I listed structure is used daily with more than 8,000 motorists crossing the bridge every day.

Thousands of people once again flocked to the bridge earlier this month to watch a dazzling fireworks display to celebrate its 150th anniversary on December 8.
