She is the TOWIE star turned designer
whose debut clothing collection was met with sneers by many in the fashion 
world when it launched last year.

But
as she unveils her revamped website - which sells her successful clothing, accessories, perfume and lingerie ranges - it looks like Amy Childs is having the last laugh.

To celebrate the relaunch of the site, 23-year-old Amy has posed in a range of her new AW13 designs: think lace, sequins - and plenty of bling.

Entrepreneur: Since her days on The Only Way Is Essex, Amy has launched a clothing and lingerie line as well as accessories and perfume range (L) Pippa Red, £95 (R) Jasmine Forest Green, £75

Ranging in price from £19.99 to £95, Amy has designed her dresses with the party season in mind.

Speaking to MailOnline about her new 
site, Amy said: 'I feel that I’ve got a dress for every occasion; from work 
wear to party and occasion dresses.

'The
response to my nightwear has been absolutely great. We’ve got new 
clothes and products coming in every week and the public think that the 
new Amy Childs Official website looks much more fashion-orientated now.

'With prices starting from just £19.99 there’s something for everyone.'

Amy has long been recognised for her sense of style, personality, ‘Essex’ vocabulary and the popularising of ‘vajazzaling.’

Since parting ways with the show that catapulted her to fame, Amy has landed a weekly presenting slot on This Morning and has starred on her own reality show ‘All About Amy’, on Channel 5.
