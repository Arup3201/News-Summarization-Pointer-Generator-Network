Plans to make Kerala a 'dry' state have been blocked at the eleventh hour amid fears from tourism chiefs  that overseas visitors will stop visiting the popular Indian state.

India's top court has put on hold until the end of the month a move by the authorities to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol everywhere but in five star hotels.

Protests from bar owners and hoteliers about the devastating effect a ban could have on tourism has led the court postpone the government's plans.

Disastrous consequences? One tour operator says the level of bookings to Kerala has noticeably dropped

The proposals include shutting down bars and shops which sell alcohol and introducing 'alcohol-free days'.

Only luxury, five star hotels will be allowed to serve alcohol in a bid to tackle the state's drinking problem.

Tour operators specialising in Kerala holidays expressed relief that the plan has been temporarily shelved, but are concerned that the proposals are already affecting business.

'It's madness,' says Graham Roberts, director of tour specialist Ellison Roberts, of the government proposals.

Rajiv Wahie, consultant at India Footprints 4u, says he has already noticed a drop in enquiries for holidays in Kerala.

'Interest in holidays last year was tremendous but the last six or seven weeks I've noticed much fewer calls and bookings,' he said.

'We're only here for the beer... ' or not, possibly

'If the ban goes ahead it will affect tourism on a huge scale. It will put small hotels out of business and the five star hotels will put their prices up even more,' Wahie says. 'We are all fighting against it.'

The number of foreign tourists visiting Kerala jumped by 8 per cent last year to 858,143, but Wahie says this will fall drastically if the move goes ahead. 

'The government's recent move to impose gradual prohibition in Kerala is nothing short of madness in my view,' Paul Zacharia, a writer and well known cultural figure in Kerala, wrote in an opinion piece about the proposals.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in India at more than eight litres per person annually.

The government has announced it will shut more than 700 bars as well as some shops in a move towards total prohibition within the next ten years.

In India, consumption of alcohol is already prohibited in the states of Gujarat, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. 

All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption although there is a fixed legal drinking age.

Holidaymakers were quick to admit they would think twice about booking a holiday to a 'dry' destination.

'When you're on holiday, you want a cold beer,' said Matthew Loney, 26. 'I would think twice about booking a flight to a country where you can't have a drink when you want to.'

But Graham Roberts believes that even if the ban is passed by the court at the end of September, there will be ways to get around it.

'Tourists will always be allowed to drink,' he says. 'And "special tea" will always be available. I'm not unduly worried about it as I don't believe it will be enforced religiously - off-licences will remain open.'

Roberts is one of many tour operators heading to Kerala next week for the Kerala Travel Mart (KTM) being held in Kochi on September 18-20.

'I fully expect the subject to be the main topic of conversation at KTM,' said Roberts.

Alcohol contributes 22 per cent of Kerala's revenue, and the State exchequer stands to lose 90bn rupees (£897m) if liquor is banned.

Courts in Kerala will until September 30 be able to hear petitions from bar owners who say that the move to ban alcohol is discriminatory and affects their business.
