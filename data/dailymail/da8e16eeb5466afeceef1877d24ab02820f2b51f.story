Sergio Aguero scored a last-gasp winner - his third of the night - to fire Manchester City to a 3-2 win over Bayern Munich in Group E of the Champions League.

Aguero opened the scoring from the penalty spot, before Bayern found a way back into the game and went 2-1 up.

Late on though, a double by the Argentina star kept City's Champions League hopes alive. 

Sportsmail's Rob Draper rates the players' performances at the Etihad on Tuesday night.

Manchester City 4-2-3-1

Joe Hart 5

Wrong-footed for the Xabi Alonso free kick – moved the wrong way and allowed Bayern back in the game

Bacary Sagna 5

Surging runs early on but allowed Robert Lewandowski to beat him for the second and couldn’t contain Franck Ribery

Vincent Kompany 5.5

Not commanding enough for the second goal even if Sagna was the closest man. Not his best night

Joe Hart's error for the Xabi Alonso free-kick allowed the visitors back into the game

Eliaquim Mangala 5

Clumsy foul which gave away the free kick to present Bayern with the opportunity to equalise. Unconvincing

Gael Clichy 5.5

Good on the offensive and troubled Rafinha – less good at closing down the cross for the second Bayern goal

James Milner 6.5

Over-run for long periods in first half even once Bayern were down to ten men – but improved and had good curling shot just wide on 52 minutes

Frank Lampard (right) was one of Manchester City's better players as they clawed their way back

Fernando 6

Started well but like the rest of his team-mates found it hard to cope with Bayern’s passing machine

Jesus Navas 6

Looked lively early on, got in behind Bernat but delivery could have been better at times

Frank Lampard 7

Superb ball to put Aguero through to earn the penalty for the first goal – but struggled to break up Bayern’s incessant passing

Samir Nasri (left) caused Bayern's defence problems early on, but faded for periods of the game

Samir Nasri 6.5

Was causing Bayern’s defence multiple problems early on. Faded in the first half but started the second well again

Sergio Aguero 8 - STAR MAN

Ruthlessly exploited Bayern’s mistakes. City’s saviour – they would be half the team without him

Manager: Manuel Pellegrini 6

His team was out-passed and outclassed for periods against ten men for long periods – but was rescued by Aguero

Sergio Aguero saved City - they would have been down and out without him exploiting Bayern's mistakes

Subs

Pablo Zabaleta 6 (for Sagna 67)

Came on to give City some added thrust - with limited success

Stevan Jovetic 6 (for Milner 65)

Worked hard but struggled to create an impact

Martin Demichelis (for Aguero 90)

Bayern Munich 4-1-2-3

Manuel Neuer 7

No chance with the penalty - though he got close - and a great save from Lampard’s shot in the second half

Rafinha 6

Had some difficulty containing Nasri but rarely troubled after City’s initial twenty-minute burst

Mehdi Benatia 4

A miserable and short night for the summer Man City target – his red card tackle was an unacceptable risk so early in the game

Mehdi Benatia (right) was Bayern's worst player, simply for the challenge that earned him a red card

Jerome Boateng 5

A lovely cross to set up Lewandowski for Bayern’s second – but ruined a fine performance with dreadful mistake for the winner

Juan Bernat 6

Suffered early on against Jesus Navas but grew in composure and effective going forward

Xabi Alonso 7

Ran the game for 85 minutes – even down to 10 men he continued to dictate the tempo. But uncharacteristically gave the ball away to allow City back in the game

Alonso (centre) ran the game for 85 minutes and even when Bayern were down to 10 he dictated the tempo

Sebastian Rode 6

Finally gets his first start since September and is hauled off after 25 minutes for tactical adjustments enforced by the red card

Pierre Hogbjerg 7

A revelation. Not first choice for Guardiola but slotted in just fine to the passing carousel. Looked at ease

Arjen Robben 7.5

Still scampering away with his dangerous runs. Always a threat to City.

Arjen Robben was always a threat to the Manchester City defence with his dangerous runs throughout

Robert Lewandowski 7.5

Not the most elegant of headers for Bayern’s second – but couldn’t fault his positioning nor his instinct

Franck Ribery 7

Troubled Sagna and then played with intelligence when down to ten men – instrumental in pushing the City wall to create space for Alonso’s goal

Subs 

Dante 6.5 (25 min for Rode)

Solid and composed when called upon to replace Benatia

Pep Guardiola (left) and Manuel Pellegrini watch on during the match at the Etihad on Tuesday 

Bastian Schweinsteiger (80 mins for Ribery)

Xherdan Shaquiri (84 for Lewandowski)

Manager: Pep Guardiola 7.5

Rested the big guns in Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller, lost Benatia to a red card but his team barely missed a beat – until those dreadful late errors. Tactically excellent though

Ref Pavel Kralovec (Czech) 6.5

Got the call on the penalty and the red card right. Solid throughout

Pep Guardiola rested his big guns, but his team hardly missed a beat... until Aguero turned up, that is
