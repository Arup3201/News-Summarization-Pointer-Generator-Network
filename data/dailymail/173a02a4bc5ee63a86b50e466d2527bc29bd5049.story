It says much for the way things have changed at Manchester City that manager Manuel Pellegrini had to cut short his post-match media duties on Saturday to meet the former King of Spain.

There was a time when the most famous match-day visitor at City home games was comic Eddie Large.

Pellegrini, however, now moves from a royal audience to the prospect of no audience at all as his team prepare for Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League tie with CSKA Moscow in Russia.

Sergio Aguero struck FOUR goals for City against Tottenham on Saturday as the hosts cruised to a 4-1 victory

This was only the second game in Premier League history to have four penalties. The other was Bradford City’s 4-4 draw with Derby in 2000.

It will be a peculiar experience for the City manager and his players. CSKA are serving a UEFA punishment imposed because of persistent racist chanting. 

Their Arena Khimki Stadium will be empty when the teams meet in a game Pellegrini says his team have to win if they are to qualify for the knock-out stages.

‘We must win if we want to continue to have options to qualify for the next stage,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I always said when you want to win something you need a team that knows how to play.

‘After that you need to have your best performance when you need them. We have very important players and they must make the difference now.’

Aguero could have scored a first half hat-trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound

So far, City have lost to Bayern Munich and drawn with Roma, and Pellegrini said: ‘Against Bayern we were a little unlucky. Against Roma here we didn’t play well, but I hope we start now in the Champions League playing the way we have in the last two games in the Premier League.’

Ideally, City need two victories from back-to-back games against the Russians.

CSKA Moscow warmed up for their clash with City with a 6-0 thrashing of Kuban Krasnodar. Forwards Ahmed Mousa and Seydou Doumbia scored two goals each as the Russians ran riot.

The win made sure they stayed in touch with Andre Villas-Boas’ Zenit St Petersburg, who lead the Russian Premier League by two points.

Certainly there are question marks against the English champions in Europe. Saturday’s victory over Tottenham came on the back of four goals from the splendid Sergio Aguero and a superb display from goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Peculiarly, though, there remains an air of vulnerability about City when they do not have the ball. Both Roma and Bayern could have scored more goals against them, as indeed could Spurs, and it was interesting to hear visiting manager Mauricio Pochettino admit that his players had been told to exploit spaces in front of City’s back four.

‘Yes, we were aware of that and we tried to use it,’ said Pochettino. Meanwhile, Hart acknowledged the issue while reminding his team-mates it is up to them to cope with the peculiar circumstances surrounding Tuesday’s game.

Hart said: ‘Like the manager said, we are always going to score goals. We just have to keep down the number we let in at the other end.

‘It’s just about getting the “W”. It sounds crazy, but if you have a stinker and we win, that is the main thing.

Aguero strokes home his fourth goal of the game and is now level with Diego Costa as the top scorer

‘Tuesday will take me back to my Shrewsbury reserves days, going to play Blackpool away at Bloomfield Road when there were Coke cans clattering around the pitch.

‘It’s a bit different — there is a bit more on this one — but it’s a game of football at the end of the day, whether there are 100,000 there or just the benches, it’s no different.

‘You can’t let it affect you as a player, we have a job to do out there. I have massive sympathy for our fans because it wasn’t us that caused this, but they are the rules and unfortunately we have to abide by them. I don’t think too many of them will be bothered as long as we win.’

City remain a devastating side when they have the ball. Aguero’s finishing was sublime on Saturday and he could even afford to miss a penalty — one of four awarded in the game — and score the goals he needed to take him past Carlos Tevez (58) as City’s leading scorer in the Premier League. 

He now has 61 in total. ‘I owe a special thanks to my team-mates and City’s fans,’ said Aguero.‘It’s a pride to become City’s maximum goalscorer in Premier League history.’

Midfielder Yaya Toure should start against CSKA Moscow after beginning as a substitute on Saturday

It is hard to imagine Aguero not starting Tuesday night’s game in what are expected to be below-freezing temperatures. Equally, midfielder Yaya Toure should start after beginning as a substitute on Saturday. 

Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. 

Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games)

Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games)

Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games)

Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games)

Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) 

Toure has struggled as part of a holding midfield in Europe this season and it may well be that he plays in Moscow as a second striker. City gave the ball away carelessly at times against Tottenham and will need to be a little more resolute in Russia.

Pellegrini added: ‘I think we had excess of trust with the ball at our foot because we lost three or four important balls near our box, that can finish with a goal.

‘And in that way I am sure we will have the concentration we need first to not concede a goal.

‘I hope we are going to play in the same way as we did against Aston Villa recently, not conceding one chance... well, I think one chance in 90 minutes.

‘We must be balanced. Football is always different and changing. If you are talking about the game we played today, yes, of course, it’s not normal to me to concede or lose so many balls near our box, but if you talk to me about the (other) games we play we didn’t lose balls but we didn’t have clear chances to score.

‘So we must be a balanced team, a very concentrated team and continue playing the same way we are doing so far, maybe the year-and-a-half that I have been here.’ 

'Referee Jonathan Moss awarded four penalties at the Etihad but not all were correct decisions...

'Penalty 1: Award was not wrong technically because there was contact but the worst decision of them all. Frank Lampard (left) threw himself to the ground from Erik Lamela’s slight touch.

'Penalty 2: Clearest of the four as Younes Kaboul wiped out David Silva.

'Penalty 3: This was the most interesting, and watching Martin Demichelis you can see he trips Roberto Soldado when tracking from behind. It was a foul but contact was just outside the area.

'Penalty 4: Moss right to award it as Federico Fazio clearly fouls Sergio Aguero but the red card was wrong as it was not clear and obvious that Aguero would have met the cross or scored.'
