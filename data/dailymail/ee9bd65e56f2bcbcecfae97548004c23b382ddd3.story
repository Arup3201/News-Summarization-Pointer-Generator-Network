The mother of the actor who sang the popular 1986 hit 'The Chicken Song' has been killed by her own car in a bizarre accident after fly-tippers blocked a country lane with rubbish. 

Olive Stevens, the mother of actor Michael Fenton Stevens, was driving down the lane in Orpington, Kent,  when she and other drivers had to turn around because of rubbish blocking their passage. 

The 88-year-old was standing behind her car while a kind passer-by reversed it for her, but was tragically knocked over and later died of her injuries. 

Olive Stevens, the mother of actor Michael Fenton Stevens (pictured together) died after being hit by her own car in a bizarre accident caused by fly-tippers near her home in Orpington, Kent 

Mr Stevens, the voice of The Chicken Song from the 1980s programme Spitting Image, has spoken of his outrage that the road had been blocked by fly-tippers. 

'It was a terrible tragedy but we don't hold any ill-feelings or malice towards the driver. 

'The only thing about this I do feel resentment for is whoever thought it was ok to just throw rubbish on a road. 

'They think that it's only a cost to the council to clean up, but this shows there are human consequences to any accident.' 

'My mother was 88 and lived a long life. What if it had been a bus filled with schoolchildren, who had not been able to stop in time?

'This sort of thing needs to be clamped down on.'

Mr Stevens, who has also appeared in The Bill and Who Dares Wins, said his 'caring' mother may have become flustered when she had to turn her Nissan Micra around. 

'My mum was driving along this single-track lane when she had to stop because there was a load of fly-tipped rubbish strewn across the road.

Mrs Stevens was described by her son as 'loving and caring towards everyone'. She died in hospital after suffering a head injury when she was knocked over 

The 88-year-old became a full-time carer for  her neighbour following the death of her husband 10 years ago

'She couldn’t get past and then quite a number of vehicles ended up stopping behind her, including a dust lorry tasked with cleaning up the mess, I think.

'People were reversing and trying to turn around in this narrow lane, and my mother was struggling.

'A man got out of another car and offered to help.

'From what I gather, he got into her car and as she opened the passenger door, something happened and the car went backwards.

'My mother was thrown to the ground with some force and suffered broken ribs and quite severe grazing.

'The blow to the back of her head caused a bleed in her brain which killed her.'

A 55-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and was bailed until next year pending further enquiries. 

Mr Stevens however said the family did not hold him accountable for the tragedy.   

'I’m sure my mother got a bit panicked by the mess and some kind-hearted passenger offered to help her turn round. 

'As far as I am concerned, that man was simply trying to help an old lady, and sadly the consequences were tragic.'

The actor with his mother as a child. Mr Stevens said he only felt resentment to the fly-tippers who blocked the street as their actions had 'human consequences' 

The actor said he did not hold the driver responsible for his mother's death, adding he was certain the man was 'kind-hearted' and was trying to help her when she became panicked

Mrs Stevens, who was on her way to the hairdresser when the accident happened, was described as the 'life and soul of the party' by her son who has appeared in The Bill among other television programmes 

'A remarkable woman': Mr Stevens added his mother was 'sprightly' and 'extraordinarily caring' to all she met

Mrs Stevens, a retired nurse, became a full-time carer for one of her neighbours following the death of her husband 10 years ago. 

She was described as 'loving and caring towards everyone,' by her 56-year-old son. 

'She was a remarkable woman - she was still so sprightly and active and extraordinarily caring to all she met.'

Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident.

A Met Police spokesperson said: 'Police were called at 0826hrs on Thursday, 6 November to reports of a collision in Skeet Hill Lane, Orpington involving a Silver Nissan Micra and a pedestrian.

'It is believed at this early stage that the victim was unable to continue her journey through Skeet Hill Lane due to a lorry blocking the road that was removing fly-tipped refuse.

'A passenger from a second vehicle offered to assist the victim in reversing her Micra down the lane.

'The victim was not inside the vehicle when it was moved. While reversing, the Micra collided with the victim, causing serious injuries.

'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found an 88-year-old woman with serious injuries.

'She was taken to a south London hospital where she later died.'
