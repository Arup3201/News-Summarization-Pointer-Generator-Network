David Cameron invoked the vision of Margaret Thatcher’s favourite political guru yesterday in an attempt to fight back from the shattering Tory defeat in the Eastleigh by-election.

He refused to ‘tack right’, but said he would pursue ‘common ground’ policies on welfare, immigration, the NHS and crime to woo ordinary voters.

The Prime Minister’s ‘common ground’ theme is a tribute to one of Mr Cameron’s Tory heroes, Sir Keith Joseph.

Inspiration: David Cameron with Baroness Thatcher in 2007

Sir Keith was the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism, but was nicknamed ‘the mad monk’ by Left-wing critics for his ascetic manner and some of his more controversial views.

Mr Cameron’s response to the Eastleigh result, where the Conservatives finished third behind the Lib Dems and UKIP, came as:

Mr Cameron’s vow to stay on the ‘common ground’ followed pressure from Tory Right-wingers to take a tougher stance on Europe and other issues to counter the UKIP threat.

His refusal to ‘tack right’ is  a clear message that he will not abandon policies such as gay marriage, which have enraged his Right wing.

But by praising Sir Keith, he is trying to convince activists that he has not renounced the Party’s  Thatcherite heritage.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We are engaged in a battle for Britain’s future... it is a battle we will only win if we reject the cynicism, the political calculation and the easy ways out – and stick to the course we are on.

‘The right thing to do is to address the things people care about – to fix yourself firmly in what Keith Joseph called the “common ground” of politics.’

A No 10 source said: ‘We have shown we can occupy that ground by cutting immigration by a third, introducing a welfare cap and imposing a tough  but fair criminal justice policy.

'But it is not just as an appeal to the Right – we will continue to ring-fence health spending.

'And we are taking the right decisions on the number one issue facing the country – the economy. These are all common ground issues. Labour aren’t there at all.’

Sir Keith Joseph was the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism

Sir Keith, who is regarded as one of the chief architects of Thatcherism, believed that the out-of-touch political elite had to find ‘common ground’ with ordinary voters.

He was widely acclaimed  for his brilliance and sincerity, but admitted that he lacked the  judgment, personality or stamina to be leader.

He was a candidate to succeed Edward Heath in the 1974 Tory leadership election – until he gave a speech in which he argued the poor should not have more than two children per family.

He said the ‘balance of our population, our human stock’ was ‘threatened’ by the higher number of children in poorer families.

After being accused of advocating selective breeding, or eugenics, he withdrew from the race, and backed Thatcher instead.

Sir Keith later said it would have been ‘a disaster for the party, country and me’ if he had become leader.

In 1981, he clashed with Michael Heseltine by opposing plans to rebuild recession-hit Merseyside and suggesting a ‘managed run-down’ of the area instead.

Sir Keith, who died in 1994, held three Cabinet posts. His political soul mate Lady Thatcher said the two politicians who had most influence on her were Sir Keith and the equally controversial Enoch Powell, both of whom she called ‘very great men’.

Triumphant Mr Farage used his party’s stunning second place finish in Eastleigh to reveal that he intended to go one better by winning a by-election in his own right before the next Election.

He told The Mail on Sunday that if another by-election occured in the immediate run-up to 2015, he intended to stand.

Mr Farage’s allies say he ‘bitterly regrets’ not standing in Eastleigh. Many commentators believe his popularity would have enabled him to win it.

Mr Farage said: ‘I would certainly consider standing in a by-election once the Euro elections in 2014 are out of the way.’

He also launched a new personal attack on ‘dishonest’ Cameron, stating: ‘The aspirational classes who supported Thatcher won’t touch Cameron with a bargepole because we are the only party who want to take those on a minimum wage out of paying tax altogether and who know bright children from poorer backgrounds will benefit hugely from more grammar schools.

‘If Cameron thinks that printing leaflets in UKIP colours, as they did in Eastleigh, will bring him votes then he’s wrong – all it does is highlight the Tories’ dishonesty.’

A confidant of Mr Cameron said: ‘It is high time Farage’s fantasy politics and economics of the mad house are exposed.

'Just because you smoke and drink pints at 11am does not make you a good leader. When UKIP is subjected to scrutiny, they will crumble.’
