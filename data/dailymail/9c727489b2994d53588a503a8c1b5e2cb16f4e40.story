Mesut Ozil was signed by Arsenal to be the matchwinning difference in their biggest games, but in the club's most pivotal match of the campaign the German international again failed to live up to the hype and expectation during their FA Cup Final 3-2 comeback win against Hull City.

The Gunners' record £42.5million transfer for the midfield maestro in September was met with mild fanfare by fans at the start of the season as they looked to end their nine-year trophy drought.

However, the former Real Madrid star proved relatively ineffective against Steve Bruce's side in another disappointing big-game performance.

On the ball: Ozil tries to escape the attention of David Meyler during their Wembley showpiece on Saturday

The 
25-year-old was signed by Arsene Wenger as the man that could be the 
go-to-guy for the Emirates outfit but on the basis of his first season 
in England this notion has a lot to be desired.

Playing
 'in the hole' behind Olivier Giroud, Ozil failed to cause the Hull 
defence any problems with either a penetrating through ball or a piece 
of skill that his reputation commanded at the start of the season.

The
 midfielder played 84 passes with an impressive accuracy of 82.1 per 
cent, but none of note that hurt Tigers captain Curtis Davies and his 
team-mates.

Trailing
 2-1 in the first-half, Ozil squandered a fantastic opportunity to bring
 his side level completely missing the ball from a low cross - when a 
goal looked like an inevitable outcome.

That
 chance was Ozil's only notable contribution to the game as he looked 
neat in possession, but when compared to team-mates Aaron Ramsey and 
Santi Cazorla the duo were far more effective at Wembley - highlighted 
by man-of-the-match Ramsey scoring the winning goal in extra time.

Disappointing: Ozil contributed just one shot and a 33% cross completion rate during the Wembley encounter

Cazorla
 started the Arsenal comeback with a sweetly-struck free-kick in the 
first-half and his stats show he made 79 passes and with a better 
accuracy than his team-mate of 89.9 per cent.

Arsenal's hero Ramsey was as equally as impressive as the Spaniard, making 105 passes with an 87.6 per cent accuracy.

This
 is evident furthermore by Ozil's total contribution of one blocked 
shot, and a 33 per cent cross completion rate during the Wembley 
showpiece.

There
 have been accusations that the German needs world-class around him to 
perform like he did at Real, but if so what does that mean say about the
 ability of Ozil or Arsenal's squad?

At
 the Bernabeu he was surrounded by the ilk of Cristiano Ronaldo and 
Karim Benzema and while the Gunners can boast the likes of Giroud and 
Theo Walcott - it is a fair assessment that the latter two are not in 
the same calibre as the former – but then shouldn’t the 25-year-old step
 up and deliver for his team-mates in the biggest of games?

His
 signing was meant to be the Gunners' game-changer but as Real look to 
add the Champions League title to their Copa del Rey triumph this 
season, it can be heavily questioned if Arsenal did really get what they
 bargained for.

To
 Arsenal supporters it may not matter as they finally ended their trophy
 hoodoo and everyone’s entitled to the odd bad game. But, for a 
£42.5million investment, they should expect better from Ozil.
