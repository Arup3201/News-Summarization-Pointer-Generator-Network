A Chinese couple who were caught having sex in the street carried on despite pleas for them to stop.

Astonished passers-by in Bengbu, in China's northern Anhui province watched as Lei Mei Ni, 25, and her boyfriend Dong Jen, 26, romped on a bench in a car park.

A car park attendant then made his way over to the couple and shouted at them urging them to stop.

A passer-by shouts at Lei Me Ni and her boyfriend Dong Jen who were caught having sex in the street in China's Anhui province 

But despite being caught and asked to stop, Mr Dong said to the attendant 'Hang on, I'm nearly there' and just carried on.

A video of the couple was shot by local man Jian She, 30, and shows the couple together on the bench.

A stunned Mr Jian said: 'At first I thought he was asleep or just lying on top of her.

'But then I saw the tell-tale signs. His trousers being down also gave it away.

'But when the guard came over, rather than cover up, he just started to speed up.

A car parking attendant went over to the couple and urged them to stop but they carried on regardless 

But despite being caught by the attendant, Tain Yu, 40, he decided against reporting them to the police.

He explained: 'I wouldn't say it was shocking, more weirdly comical.

'I was shouting at them to stop and they were saying they were nearly finished.

'I took down their names but in the end did not report them. They were very drunk.'
