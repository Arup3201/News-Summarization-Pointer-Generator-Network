A teenage girl has vanished after taking out rubbish to put in a bin outside her home.

Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, of Newport, south Wales has not been seen since she stepped outside to go to the bins at her home in Linton Street at 8pm on Saturday, December 28.

Police sniffer dogs and up to 40 police officers, some on horseback, are today searching open areas around her home in teeming rain.

The teenager, whose disappearance is out of character, is also in need of medication without which she is likely to become anaemic

Extra officers have been drafted after they became available when bad weather caused the cancellation of the Newport County vs Oxford City football match.

The teenager, whose disappearance is out of character, is also in need of medication without which she is likely to become anaemic.

Chief Inspector Daniel Taylor, who is leading the Gwent Police search operation, said both police and her family are increasingly concerned for her welfare.

'She has gone missing from her home address, that is particularly the reason for the concern. There is no motive for it,' he said.

'As far as we understand it she went out to the bins at the premises. That was the last time she was seen.'

He said that forensic teams had examined the area and extensive searches have been carried out in the neighbourhood.

He added: 'There is no forensic evidence that she has been taken.'

He also appealed to anyone who may know Nida to come forward with any information they may have about her social circle.

'There must be other people out there who know Nida who are not necessarily known to the family,' Chief Inspector Taylor said.

A police spokesman added: 'Nida is of Asian-Pakistani appearance and has long dark hair, is slim and is five feet three inches tall. She was last known to be wearing blue jeans and a black top.

'To go missing is particularly out of character for Nida, and officers and her family are increasingly concerned for her welfare due to that fact that she hasn't been in contact, especially over the New Year period.

'We are also concerned for Nida because she hasn't taken her medication with her and is likely to become anaemic without it.'

He added: 'Specially trained search officers with the assistance of dogs and horses are undertaking enquiries in numerous areas of Newport today.

'Local officers will be in the area distributing leaflets and conducting further house to house enquiries.

'If anyone can assist us with our enquiries to locate Nida, they are asked to call 101 and quote log number 448 28/12/13.'
