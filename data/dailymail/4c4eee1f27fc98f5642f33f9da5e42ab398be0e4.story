Britain's communications regulator Ofcom said it expected mobile operators to be able to provide faster, fourth-generation services from May next year as it set out its long-awaited plans for a 4G spectrum auction.

Ofcom said prospective bidders would be able to submit their applications with an initial deposit from December 11, with bidding beginning in January and licences granted in February and March.

Ofcom said the reserve prices for the spectrum would be a combined total of £1.3bn ($2.1bn).

January: The principal stageBidding begins.  February/March: The assignment stage where bidders are informed what they have won and its cost. February/March: The grant stageLicence fees are paid and licences granted. 

May/June: New 4G services launched

'Today marks an important shift from preparation to the delivery of the auction, which will see widespread 4G mobile services from a range of providers,' Ofcom Chief Executive Ed Richards said. 

Mobile operators Vodafone and Telefonica's O2 are desperate for the auction to begin after market leader EE, owned by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, rolled out its new service to great fanfare last month.

EE was given the go ahead by Ofcom to launch its service early on existing spectrum.

The decision was a calculated move to kick-start 4G, and make the operators agree to a timetable for the spectrum auction and delivery of services after lengthy delays.

Ofcom said download speeds on initial 4G networks could be around 5 to 7 times faster than those provided by 3G networks, paving the way for a superfast broadband era where consumers can watch video and surf the Internet on the move.

The announcement comes amid growing fears over the disruption 4G networks could cause to Freeview TV signals.

Hundreds of homes that have their 
television signal wiped out by the latest 4G mobile phone networks will 
have to be reconnected at a cost of up to £10,000 each, it was claimed 
yesterday.

Millions of households will suffer interference, ranging from image distortion to the total loss of some channels.

Most
will be able to use a filter to block the signal, but for families 
living closest to the 4G base stations, the problems are expected to be 
so severe that this will be ineffective.

Freeview users are expected to be 
worst hit and there have been warnings that hundreds will be unable to 
switch to satellite or cable providers, leaving them without access to 
normal television services.

New era: EE recently launched its superfast 4G mobile internet service - but will face competition from May next year, Ofcom has revealed.

Experts have warned that up to 
2.3million homes could suffer some form of interference when the 4G 
networks – which offer phone users much faster internet connection – are
rolled out across the country next year.

Ministers have promised a £180million 'help scheme', funded by the mobile phone operators, for those hit by the problems.

But MP John Whittingdale, chairman of
the culture, media and sport select committee, called for the national 
launch to be delayed while local trials are conducted.
