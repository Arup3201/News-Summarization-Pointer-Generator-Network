HOW TO THINK LIKE EINSTEIN by Daniel Smith (Michael O’Mara £12.99)

Here’s a little bit of wish-fulfilment to keep you warm through the long winter months. Anybody, says Daniel Smith, can think like Einstein —although I had always assumed that an enormous brain was an essential qualification.

As it happens, Einstein had a slightly smaller brain than average, according to the men in lab coats who sliced it up. That’s what happens to great thinkers after they die. Even their skulls aren’t sacrosanct.

Smith’s previous titles include How to Think Like Sherlock, How to Think like Steve Jobs and How to Think Like Mandela. He has thought more about thinking than most of us ever will. But he may have hit the jackpot this time.

For all the fun it might be to emulate the thought processes of a fictional character, a computer salesman or everyone’s favourite smiley peacemaker, Albert Einstein is the motherlode. Genius is a pathetically overused term but no one argues about it here.

Einstein was no infant prodigy. One of his teachers, Dr Joseph Degenhart, said he ‘would never get anywhere in life’. (This is the only thing poor Dr Degenhart is remembered for.) Young Albert graduated fourth out of five from Zurich Polytechnic in 1900, failed to get an academic position and, after much frustration, was compelled to take the lowly position of Technical Expert (Class 3) at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.

And yet, just four years later, he produced a series of papers that turned the world of science on its head. In one of them he posited the special theory of relativity. In another he calculated that E=mc². Even then, he didn’t receive his first junior professorship for another four years — or a Nobel Prize until 1922. ‘All of which goes to prove that even for an intellect as stellar as Einstein’s, slow and steady wins the race,’ writes Smith.

‘I have no special talents,’ Einstein himself said in 1952. ‘I am only passionately curious.’

‘I have no special talents,’ Einstein himself said in 1952. ‘I am only passionately curious.’

To him, the development of science was driven by the need to satisfy the longing for pure knowledge. He also believed that the answers were out there somewhere, waiting to be discovered. ‘Without the belief in the inner harmony of our world, there could be no science,’ he wrote.

So Einstein could combine a sense of wonder at the world with the belief that he would be able to work out what lay behind those wonders.

It helped that he could ‘see’ what the vast majority of us simply cannot. Huge thickets of higher mathematics simply unravelled under his gaze. But once you have seen what only you can see, the next thing to do is look further. ‘I believe in intuitions and inspirations . . . I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am,’ he said.

Not the thunderbolt of genius we might expect but a considered philosophical approach to the inner workings of the universe.

These are not the ways of a dull conformist. Einstein disliked authority and being told what to do. He was careless with personal relations. It’s possible he loved women a little too much.

But he not only saw the art in science, he made sure the rest of humanity knew about it too. ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge,’ he said in 1929. ‘Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.’

Call me an old softie if you like, but I love this.
