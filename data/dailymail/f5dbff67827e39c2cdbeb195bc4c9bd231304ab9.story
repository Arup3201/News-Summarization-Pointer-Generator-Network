Louis van Gaal isn’t the type of man to look backwards when looking forwards is available. To find the early reasons why his immediate future is log jammed with problems, though, we do need to look over our shoulders, back to a time when Manchester United were winning trophies and widening cracks were being covered by shiny silver and gold paper.

That was when today’s troubles really started at Old Trafford, back in the glorious days of Sir Alex Ferguson. It sounds ungrateful to say it; impertinent, rude and sacrilegious. But it’s true, nevertheless.

United continued to win trophies during Ferguson’s latter years at United but the future, it transpires, was not adequately being taken care of. This is the future that Van Gaal has inherited and one reason why the current United manager has arrived at Old Trafford to find a squad so desperately short of quality.

Final triumph: Sir Alex Ferguson holds the 2012-13 Premier League trophy shortly before retiring

Tuesday night’s embarrassing defeat at Milton Keynes cannot be blamed on one individual. It contained dreadful playing errors.

Nevertheless, it is impossible to view the current picture of United’s predicament without placing their greatest ever manager somewhere in it as the recruitment statistics of Ferguson’s last six years in charge make for startling viewing.

During that time, United won four Barclays Premier League titles, two League Cups and a Champions League as a core of previously and expertly recruited players – Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Park Ji-sung, Michael Carrick, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney - combined seamlessly with the last vestiges of the Class of ’92 to ensure Ferguson’s remarkable team remained eminent.

Nani (£17m)

Anderson (£27m)

Ashley Young (£17m)

Bebe (£7.4m)

Owen Hargreaves (£17m)

Tomasz Kuszczak (£2m)

Zoran Tosic (£7m)

Dimitar Berbatov (£30m)

Gabriel Obertan (£3m)

Mame Biram Diouf (£3m)

Javier Hernandez (£6m)

Chris Smalling (£7m)

Nick Powell (£6m)

Alexander Buttner (£4m)

Wilfried Zaha (£15m)

During those last six years, however, Ferguson, despite the restrictions of Glazer ownership, invested in the region of £160m of the club’s money on a string of players he believed would form the club’s future.

Some have certainly contributed during better times but none have ultimately endured and this, in hindsight, represents the beginning of a decline exacerbated by David Moyes’ erratic season last time round.

Between the summer of 2007 and the January of 2013, Ferguson’s United bought Nani (£17m), Anderson (£27m), Ashley Young (£17m), Bebe (£7m), Owen Hargreaves (£17m), Tomasz Kuszczak (£2m), Zoran Tosic (£7m), Dimitar Berbatov (£30m), Gabriel Obertan (£3m), Mame Biram Diouf (£3m), Javier Hernandez (£6m), Chris Smalling (£7m), Nick Powell (£6m), Alexander Buttner (£4m) and Wilfried Zaha (£15m).

Set against those purchases is the arrival of the more successful Rafael da Silva, Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, David de Gea and, of course, Robin van Persie.

To question Ferguson’s legacy in this way is a very uncomfortable thing to do. It is more fashionable, more palatable, to blame Moyes entirely.

Nevertheless it is equally difficult to examine the two lists of players above and ignore the very obvious connection between then and now. Ferguson’s incredible man management skills endured to the end but his judgement in the transfer market seemingly did not.

During his latter years, United were winning. In reality, though, they were also hanging on as the world changed around them. Paul Scholes retired once and was lured back, eventually quitting for good at the age of 37. Ryan Giggs played until he was 40. There were reasons for this.

Anybody who saw United play regularly during that time will have recognised the marginal regression in their football that was not always hidden beneath generally positive results. Back then, Manchester City and Chelsea were coming on strong and players like Van Persie and De Gea were never going to hold back the tide on their own.

Senior sources at Old Trafford have admitted that the 2013 title, Ferguson’s last, surprised them. They didn’t expect it. They had seen the quality of the squad wane.

A poor summer in the market after Moyes’ appointment didn’t help and had Van Gaal’s predecessor inspired his players a little more maybe United would have squeezed another year out of Vidic and Evra.

Regardless of that, Van Gaal’s first challenge now is to arrest this decline and then find first gear. Certainly, what he has found will have alarmed him.

The Dutch coach has inherited, for example, a Premier League squad without a fully functioning defensive line and he must ask himself how a club of United’s standing and stature has allowed that to happen.

This is why he suggested after Tuesday’s failure at MK Dons that results this season haven’t surprised him. Van Gaal does do a neat line in sarcasm but this wasn’t one of them.

Looking ahead to Saturday’s Premier League game at Burnley, Van Gaal’s most pressing concern will be his system and how to fit record signing Angel di Maria in to it.

Just as Juan Mata struggled to fit in to Moyes’ team last January, so Di Maria does not look a natural fit for the 3-4-1-3 formation that Van Gaal has placed so much faith in thus far.

Van Gaal hinted after Tuesday’s game that he may change his tactics and indeed he may have to. The 62-year-old has attempted to engrain the system in all levels of football at United’s Carrington training ground and clearly saw a long-term future in the formation he used to great effect with Holland at the World Cup.

Already, though, it is looking shot to pieces. United’s defenders do not look comfortable with it and Di Maria arrives as a player seemingly ready-made to slip in to 4-3-3.

Van Gaal will surely be a big enough man to perform a volte face if he needs to but any move away from his current formation would leave him with a problem connected not with dented pride but where to play his captain Rooney and indeed the aforementioned Mata.

Sketch a United starting XI on to paper and it will look competitive enough. Injuries are currently hurting them to the extent that they appear worse than they actually are.

Van Gaal is not fooled, though. There are fissions in this squad that will not be solved in one transfer window. The cumulative effect of six years of questionable judgement now weighs heavy.
