Well, today the boats were well and truly pushed out. For the service at St Paul’s Cathedral the Queen wore a soft mint coat dress: as for the flotilla on Sunday, it is again designed by her dresser, Angela Kelly.

It is of silk tulle, embroidered with flowers, using silver thread. A chiffon drape is a lovely, soft touch: it is studded with Swarovski crystals, and a matching drape adorns the hat.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s nude lace dress by Sarah Burton for McQueen was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the Thames – and while I loved it, the fastening of the belt, seemingly made from bias binding, is a little disappointing.

Thumbs up! Liz Jones applauded The Queen, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall for their fashion choices

Kate (and Sarah Burton) need to understand that the Duchess will often be seen from behind, and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful:  pearls or diamonds, with hand embroidered loops, not just a hook and eye.

And I do want to wrestle Kate out of her platform patent pumps from LK Bennett. She needs delicate lace shoes, encrusted with pearls, by Manolo Blahnik, say, or an English shoe couturier, such as Georgina Goodman. The platform is a little too casual for such a formal occasion.

But Kate still looked stunning, especially as her eye make-up has been softened: I love the subtle veil over her eyes, on a hat by her favourite milliner, Jane Taylor: £790, available on the milliner’s website.

The real surprise of the day was that both Beatrice and Eugenie looked fresh, young and appropriate. Beatrice wore a blue and white striped coatdress by London Fashion Week designer Kinder Aggugini. Italian born, he studied at St Martin’s, and learned his craft on Savile Row and working for designers including Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano.

Lady in red: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a 
swathe through the gloomy weather as she stepped on to 
the Spirit of Chartwell wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen 
dress - on her lapel, Kate wore a maritime-themed brooch featuring two 
silver dolphins

'I am starting to love these two young women,' Liz Jones says of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie

This dress was teamed with tan stilettos
by Gina, a Stephen Jones hat and a Lemaresca bag, made by sisters 
Giulia and Cecilia Maresca, who worked at Tod’s and Vivienne Westwood 
before striking out on their own. This rock and roll bag label is made 
from start to finish in Italy, not merely ‘finished’ there, as so many 
are these days. This bag would have cost about £1,000.

Princess Eugenie chose a royal purple dress by Suzannah (her lovely, small boutique is at 6 Bristol Gardens, in Little Venice); a Stephen Jones hat; Gina nude stilettos and a Loro Piana bag.

I am starting to love these two young women: they champion brand new talent, know how to mix and match different labels, and have the good sense to wear Gina shoes, which are expensive but super stylish and comfy. Kate should follow suit, and abandon those high street platforms. She has such great legs: she really could take a dagger heel.

Samantha Cameron wore a rose print dress by Paul Smith that we’ve seen before, but at least she wore a hat, by Stephen Jones.

The Duchess of Cornwall wore a graphic, basket weave coat by Bruce Oldfield, and a ginormous Philip Treacy hat. Both items tell me she is feeling much more confident, starting to abandon those safe creams. All in all, a triumph.
