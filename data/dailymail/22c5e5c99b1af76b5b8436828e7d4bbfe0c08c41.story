A Russian TV news presenter who said the country's behaviour in Ukraine was 'wrong' during a live broadcast is being sent to Crimea by the channel's bosses.

Abby Martin, a presenter on the Russia today television channel - which is funded through the Kremlin - denounced Russian action live on air.

She said she 'would not sit here and apologise or defend military aggression,' before saying her 'heart went out' to the Ukrainian people who she described as 'the real losers here.'

In an extraordinary move, Russia Today responded to her statement - saying they would be sending the presenter to Crimea to 'give her an opportunity to make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story.'

Abby Martin, who works for Kremlin-funded Russia Today, said Russian action in Crimea was 'wrong' during her a broadcast

Ms Martin, a hosts on the American version of the channel, made her statement at the end of her show Breaking the Set.

She said: 'Before I wrap up the show, I wanted to say something from my heart about the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine and Russia's military occupation of Crimea.

'Just because I work here, for RT, doesn't mean I don't have editorial independence and I can't stress enough how strongly I am against any military intervention in sovereign nations' affairs.

'What Russia did is wrong.'

Speaking live from the show's Washington Studio, she continued: 'I admittedly don't know as much as I should about Ukraine's history or the cultural dynamics of the region, but what I do know is that military intervention is never the answer.

'And I will not sit here and apologize or defend military aggression.'

'Furthermore, the coverage I've seen of Ukraine has been truly disappointing from all sides of the media spectrum, and ripe with disinformation.

The presenter added she 'would not sit here and apologise or defend military aggression'. Russia Today responded by saying they would send her to Crimea to 'make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story'

'Above all my heart goes out to the Ukrainian people, who are now wedged as pawns in the middle of a global power chess game. They're the real losers here.

'All we can do now is hope for a peaceful outcome for a terrible situation and prevent another full-blown Cold War between multiple superpowers.

'Until then, I'll keep telling the truth as I see it.'

Russia Today later released a statement saying: 'Contrary to the popular opinion, RT doesn’t beat its journalists into submission, and they are free to express their own opinions, not just in private but on the air.

'This is the case with Abby’s commentary on the Ukraine.

'We respect her views, and the views of all our journalists, presenters and program hosts, and there will be absolutely no reprimands made against Ms. Martin.

'In her comment Ms. Martin also noted that she does not possess a deep knowledge of reality of the situation in Crimea.

'As such we’ll be sending her to Crimea to give her an opportunity to make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story.'

Today in Crimea, Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base fired warning shots into the air.

About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching towards them without any weapons, not to get any closer.

They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance.

The stand-off came as Vladimir Putin ordered thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine's border to return to their base.
