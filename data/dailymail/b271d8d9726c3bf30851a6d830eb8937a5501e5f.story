The tense moment a weatherman was forced to flee a Mississippi television studio seconds before a a massive tornado hit, was broadcast to the station's viewers.

WTVA Chief Meteorologist Matt Laubhan 
was reporting on the damaging twister as it approached Tulepo yesterday - one of numerous Southern cities rocked by a string of tornadoes which have killed at least 30 people.

During the broadcast, Laubhan switched to the station's tower camera, which showed 
a dark cloud cloud approaching.

'Basement, now. Basement now,' the calm presenter ordered station crew after the broadcast feed stalled. 'Let's go!'

Laubhan stayed on air until the final moments to warn viewers to stay safe during the 'tornado emergency'.

'This is a tornado ripping through the city of Tupelo as we speak,' he said. 'This could be deadly.'

Laubhan ordered station crew to head to the basement, before following them down. Later, the station tweeted 'We are safe here.'

KLTV reported that, at  2.43pm, weather spotters reported a tornado near the city moving at around 50mph.Â 

The tornado caused massive damage in Tulepo, destroying homes, bringing down power lines and uprooting trees. While people were injured, emergency crews said no one died.

WREG reported an 8pm curfew was ordered in the city last night, with storm shelters on North Front Street and the Haven Community Center on Willie Moore Road.

Police were also going house to house searching for victims and trying to stem any gas leaks that could fuel fires.

At least 30 people across six states have been killed by a vicious storm system that unleashed dozens of tornadoes from Sunday and was threatening to cause more damage in heavily populated regions of the U.S. South today.

The hardest hit states have been Arkansas and Mississippi where 23 people have been killed and more than 200 injured by tornadoes over the past three days that have flattened neighborhoods, reduced homes to splinters and snapped trees like twigs.

Deaths were also reported in Oklahoma and Iowa on Sunday, and Alabama and Tennessee on Monday.

A large 
cluster of thunderstorms pelted Alabama, Georgia and the Florida 
Panhandle on Tuesday, with tornadoes likely touching down along the 
Alabama-Georgia state line, forecasters said.

'The
 main severe threat today is down in the central and eastern Gulf 
Coast,' National Weather Service meteorologist Brynn Kerr said, adding 
there was potential for severe conditions in Tennessee and the Ohio 
Valley later on Tuesday.

Tens
 of thousands of customers along the path of the storm were without 
power on Tuesday morning, with the worst outages in parts of Alabama and
 Georgia, utility companies reported.

In
 western North Carolina, fire department personnel used boats to rescue 
people from homes and vehicles deluged overnight by flash floods.

In Arkansas, residents of central Faulkner County, where most of the damage occurred, sorted through the rubble as they tried to piece their lives back together.
