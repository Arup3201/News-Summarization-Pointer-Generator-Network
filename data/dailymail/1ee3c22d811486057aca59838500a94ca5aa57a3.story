Serena Williams had to dig deep in a tough first set before the world No 1 eventually eased over the finish line to progress to the third round of the Australian Open.

Serena saved three set points against world No 203 Vera Zvonareva in the first set before battling back for a 7-5, 6-0 victory.

Zvonareva, a former world No 2 from Russia, has been plagued by injury in recent years and now sits at a lowly ranking after playing just five tournaments last year.

But Williams made a sluggish start and appeared to struggle to serve into the sun as she went 5-3 down in the opening set.

However, 33-year-old Williams showed her fighting qualities and saved three set points as she reeled off four games in a row to take the opening set in 58 minutes.

Zvonareva never recovered and failed to win another game as Williams dominated to wrap up the match in one hour and 25 minutes.

Williams said: 'She started out really well. She was really agressive and I was a little bit too passive.

'Once I got down, I said "Serena, you have nothing to lose here, enjoy yourself" and I started to play better.'

Earlier, sister Venus also reached the last 32 as the 34-year-old beat compatriot Lauren Davis 6-2, 6-3 in one hour and 16 minutes.

It is the 12th time Venus has progressed to the third round at Melbourne Park, though she has never won the title here, with her best performance being an appearance in the 2003 final against Serena.

The earliest the two sisters can meet this year is in the semi-finals, although Venus will do well to get there considering she has a tricky encounter against feisty Italian Camila Giorgi next and a potential last-16 clash with No 6 seed Agnieszka Radwanska.

Venus will not be content, though, unless she leaves Melbourne a week on Sunday with the trophy in her hands.

She said: 'For me, I've won in my life. I've won a lot of things. For me it's about titles, so no matter what the title is for me, [getting] to the finals is the same thing as the third round if I didn't win.

'For me, it's about hopefully trying to take titles home. Last year I got in the circle to hopefully [win] titles quite a few times and sometimes came up short.

'That's pretty much where I want to be. My focus really is how close can I get myself to be in that winner's circle.'

Venus's resurgence - which included victory at the Auckland Classic two weeks ago - after being hindered by illness and injury in recent years - has also acted as motivation for her younger sibling.

Serena said: 'She is really motivating. She is playing so well, she's doing so good right now. It makes me look behind my shoulders and I have to play better and I want to do better.

'I always want to be able to stay ahead as much as I can. So I think that's been, for our whole careers, we've kind of motivated each other. We hopefully continue to do that.'Â
