You have to wonder whether John Bostock ever crossed Dele Alli's mind when he signed for Tottenham on Monday.

Like Bostock before him, Alli - one of the hottest prospects outside the Barclays Premier League - has taken the decision to continue his footballing development at White Hart Lane.

Alli will hope, however, that's where the similarities will end.

Tottenham signed 18-year-old Dele Alli on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to MK Dons

Spurs were convinced they'd signed the future England captain when they plucked Bostock from Crystal Palace in a hugely controversial move back in 2008.

As we know, it didn't turn out that way; Bostock made four substitute appearances for Spurs in five years.

His failure to make the grade remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern-day English football.

Fast-forward seven years and Alli, when he joins Tottenham next season, will be hoping for a much different outcome.

He'll be joined by young central-defender Milos Veljkovic, who is well-placed to discuss the obstacles facing Alli when he arrives in the summer.

The Serbia Under-21 international has been at White Hart Lane since he was 15 - arriving from Swiss club FC Basel.

The MK Dons youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the League One side so far this season 

After signing from Crystal Palace back in 2008, Bostock endured a frustrating spell at Tottenham

Having made three senior appearances for the club, Veljkovic spent a spell at Middlesbrough before joining Charlton on loan until the end of the season.

Veljkovic will head back to White Hart Lane in the summer intent on, like Alli, proving his worth to Mauricio Pochettino.

And the 19-year-old says the arrival of the Argentine manager means youngsters like Alli and himself will now be given a fair crack of the whip.

'The manager has shown he is ready to give young players a chance,' Veljkovic told Sportsmail.

'And there is John McDermott (academy manager), and Paul Mitchell (head of recruitment and analysis) as well, they are looking for the youth.

'There are now more training sessions with first team for the Under-21s and the first team coaches are having a look at the U21s more often now; it wasn't like this in the past so its getting better.'

However, Alli shouldn't expect to walk straight into Pochettino's first-team plans next season.

Having played regularly in Tottenham's pre-season tour of the USA last year, Veljkovic found first-team opportunities hard to come by when the season started - prompting his loan moves to Middlesbrough and Charlton.

'I don't know too much about Alli, but I think it'll be the same for him as me,' said Veljkovic.

'Maybe he will play for the U21's, and then train with the first team and if he's good enough he could make the bench.

'It'll be step-by-step. Maybe he could go on loan, which was the right step for me.

'The manager said to me in the summer that he wanted me to go to America with them, so I went and played quite a bit.

'But when the season started, in my position there is quite a few players. I gave 100 percent but it was difficult.

'I didn't really get an opportunity, so I spoke with the gaffer and he told me I needed more experience so that's why I went on loan.

'But the manager will give you a chance, so my plan is to play as much as I can at Charlton and then go back to Spurs for pre-season and impress the manager.'

You won't be the only one, Milos.
