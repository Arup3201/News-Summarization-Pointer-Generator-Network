Rapper Drake performed in New York last night - and, contrary to rumours beforehand, he was not arrested over his role in a vicious nightclub brawl with Chris Brown.

However, the notorious fight did make an impact on Drake's Long Island show on Saturday, as he appeared to refer to his troubles twice during his set.

The concert came as it emerged that the nightclub where Drake and Brown fought over R&B star Rihanna, sending several injured people to hospital, has been closed 'indefinitely'.

Performance: Drake managed to get through his New York concert without being apprehended by police

Drake performed at the Jones Beach Theater in the town of Wantagh, and opened his set by saying: 'When I woke up this morning, I had to think about a lot of things.'

But he continued: 'But the only thing I gave a f*** about was that I was in New York City tonight,' according to the Daily News.

Later in the set, he seemed to make another reference to Wednesday night's scuffle, when he said: 'It's last call and you're really too drunk to give a f***.

'A n***** in the corner is standing there looking at you funny. You bump elbows with him on the way to the bathroom, but really there's only one n***** that you got to think about.'

NYPD sources had suggested that the star could be arrested at the concert if he did not turn himself in, but by the time the evening came around there was no sign that he would be taken into custody.

Meanwhile it was reported by TMZ that W.i.P., the nightclub in New York's SoHo district, has been shut down indefinitely over a number of violations apparently unrelated to the A-list brawl.

Earlier a second bystander released photos of her injuries that were a result of the flying bottles during the fight.

A woman named Veronica told TMZ that she was sitting at a table near the two rappers when she saw the beginning of the brawl.

Veronica had to get stitches on her right hand and has a bruise in the middle of her forehead. 

'I heard people screaming ... so I tried to get away from the action and hid behind a couch,' she told the site.

What she didn't know at the time was 
that the fight, which left the club looking like a war zone with broken 
bottles everywhere, was supposedly caused by notorious rapper Chris 
Brown sending Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, a bottle of
champagne.

While the gesture may seem nice, the 
closest connection that the two men have is that they have both been 
romantically linked to Rihannna.

That appears to be too close for 
comfort, as Drake reportedly sent the bottle back to Brown with a note 
reading 'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal with it'.

Though Brown, who was famously plead 
guilty to the felony charge of assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 
2009, was enraged by the note, he claims that he was not the one to 
start the fight and points the finger at Drake and his entourage 
instead.

Police seem to agree, as the New York 
Post reported that while they are considering Brown a 'witness and 
victim', they are now on the hunt for Drake.

'I believe the police are building a case against Drake and his thugs,' Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos told the paper.

Said 'thugs' included fellow rapper Meek Mill and a bevy of security handlers.

Another serious question comes for 
Brown, however, as some of his own posse may have been known gang 
members, which would be a violation of his probation agreement for his 
previous assault charge.

An unidentified source told The Post 
that a number of members of the notorious Crips gang might have been 
with the 23-year-old rapper when the fight happened around 4am Thursday 
morning.

While the specific Crips members have not been identified, two other Brown pals have announced their injuries.

Recovering: Actress Eva Longoria's husband Tony Parker (pictured left, speaking on Friday) claims he was in the club and suffered damage to his eye. Right, Big Pat can be seen with a wound on his head

Basketball star Tony Parker, who was 
previously married to actress Eva Longoria, said that he has to sit out a
week of training for the Olympics because his cornea was scratched 
during the fight.

'I was quietly with my friends when a fight broke out. 
Bottles started flying everywhere. I tried to protect my girlfriend and I
got everything,' Parker told French website Direct Star.

'The
cornea is affected. I cannot do anything for seven days. Wear a 
therapeutic contact lens and I get drops. I was lucky, that I almost had
to get stitches.'

The most serious of the injuries came 
from Big Pat, Brown's large security guard. The rapper posted a picture 
of the bodyguard with a large bleeding cut across his forehead while he 
was lying down on a hospital gurney.

Chris Brown was also injured. He 
posted a picture of a gash on his chin, apparently sustained from the 
fight with Drake. His female companion was also hurt.

Drake has denied he was involved in 
'any kind last night at W.i.P.' His spokeswoman said in a statement: 'He
was on his way out of the club when the altercation began.

One of the club-goers caught in the middle of the fracas was Hollie C, an Australian tourist who was rushed to Bellevue Hospital after 
she was smashed in the head with a flying bottle during the fight.

A gruesome photo shows a gash in her head and her face covered with blood. She needed 16 stitches to close the wound.

Hollie told TMZ.com
she went to W.i.P. with friends on Wednesday night, unaware they were 
sitting in between two angry rappers and their entourages. Suddenly, all hell broke loose.

'Within a few moments of noticing glass being thrown around, I saw a glass bottle headed towards me, consequently hitting me in the head.' she told TMZ. 'I immediately started to bleed and proceeded to fall in and out of consciousness.'

In the wake of the horrific injuries, 
the New York City Council has called for an emergency meeting with 
nightclub owners and police to look into policies for selling bottled 
drinks.

City Council Speaker Christine C. 
Quinn released a statement on Friday that read: 'I am deeply concerned 
by reports of the bottle throwing melee that injured more than five 
people in SoHo this week.

'That is why I have immediately 
convened an emergency meeting next week between my office, the NYPD, and
the nightlife industry.'

The true details of the event are tough to come by because the surveillance footage handed over by the club was 'useless'.

Earlier it was revealed that police are investigating whether shots were fired during the fight.

Witnesses told the NYPD they heard a gun go off amid the ruckus in the early hours of Thursday, although none said they saw the weapon.

'We are investigating the possibility of gunshots fired at the club,' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne told reporters.

‘While none so far reported seeing a 
gun, several witnesses have told NYPD detectives that they heard what 
they believed was a gunshot inside the club during the disturbance.’

Tug of love: Rihanna, seen in New York last night, is at the centre of a
war between former love Chris Brown and rapper Drake who is she 
previously had a fling with

Brown and Drake have had a war of 
words since both being romantically attached to Rihanna. The fight will 
further fuel rumours regarding the closeness of Rihanna to Chris Brown.

Earlier this week, Brown and Rihanna partied at the same club for the 
second time in as many days, leaving within minutes of each other.

TMZ reported the pair 
were in the club together for around 30 minutes and Brown spent some 
time with the 'Rude Girl' singer at her table.

Sitting
in different booths, the couple still 'kept a close eye on each other' -
and Brown sent her over two bottles of Ace of Spades Champagne.

A video surfaced earlier this week of the pair leaving the club minutes apart.

The lovelorn pair have been linked 
together several times already this year, after it emerged that they had
recorded songs with each other.

She was not at W.i.P. on the night of the melee.
