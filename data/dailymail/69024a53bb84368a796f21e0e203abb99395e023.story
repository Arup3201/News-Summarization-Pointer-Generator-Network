This Eastern Screech Owl knows exactly how to get out of a tight spot... he simply hides in one.

The bird of prey camouflages itself by wedging its entire body in a hole in a tree in Providence in Rhode Island, New York, giving it the perfect place to hide during the day from any unknown dangers.

The owl was pictured in its cosy perch by photographer Peter Green - after he was tipped off by friends about the quirky behaviour.

But catching it on camera would be no walk in the woods.

Peter spent two years lying in wait for the bashful bird to return before he finally took the picture this week.

The Eastern screech owl is a small bird most common in North America, Mexico and Canada.

They are strictly nocturnal, roosting in holes in trees by day and hunting for small mammals at night.

They especially well known for their mating call which, far from a screech, sounds more like a flute-like whinny.
