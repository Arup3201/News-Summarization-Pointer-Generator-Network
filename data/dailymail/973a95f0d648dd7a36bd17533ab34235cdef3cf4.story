A grandmother has been arrested following horrific allegations of abuse.

Linda Brantly of Orange County, Florida has been accused of chaining her three elementary school-aged children to her washing machine with dog collars and forcing them to sleep on the floor.

She would also make the children to plank or raise their hands in the air for extended periods of time as punishment.

Even worse, these allegations were discovered as the three children were being interviewed about possible sexual abuse they had suffered at the hands of a family member.

According to WKMG, deputies did find two two leashes on Brantly's laundry room floor along with dog collars, which the children said she would attach to their wrists. 

The children did not appear to have any injuries.

'This mode of alleged discipline is completely unacceptable,' DCF spokesperson David Ocasio told the Orlando Sentinel.

'While this pattern of child abuse did not cause physical harm, the emotional scars to young children can lead to long lasting damage.'

Out: Brantly, who has custody of the three children, has denied these claims of abuse, and was released from jail Thursday on a $5,000 bond

Brantly, 58, who had custody of the three children, was booked on charges of child abuse Thursday and released soon after on $5,000 bond. 

She has denied the abuse charges and the statements made by her grandchildren.
