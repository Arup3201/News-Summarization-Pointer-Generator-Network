Aston Villa fans are proposing a large-scale protest in the Holte End for the visit of Liverpool to mark their frustration at the club’s direction.

Three supporter websites are calling on match-goers with tickets in Villa Park’s famous stand to leave their seat vacant until eight minutes has elapsed.

That timing reflects the number of full seasons Randy Lerner has owned the club, while leaving 82 minutes on the clock for supporters to back their team. Villa won the European Cup in 1982.

An open letter has been posted on the www.thevillablog.co.uk, www.myoldmansaid.com, and www.avillafan.com and requests fans vote with their feet to make a statement.

Villa have only scored 12 times in 23 games this season in all competitions – the lowest total of any in English football’s top four tiers. Paul Lambert’s side are 13th, three points above the relegation zone following a run of two wins in 17 league games.

This letter hasn’t been easy to write and it’s also taken time to decide if we should, but as Aston Villa supporters can we really go on any longer like this?

Our three sites have come together to write this letter because there has been a lot of talk the last few days of protests. Add to that, unsavory scenes between Villa supporters in the stands at recent games, both at home and away, it’s now time to do something.

As Villa supporters, we all want the same thing - We Want Our Villa Back.

We believe there is no better way of showing the board how we feel than having an empty Holte End for the first eight minutes of the Liverpool match this weekend, one for the past eight seasons under the current regime. After the eight minutes then take your seat and support the team fully for the remaining 82 minutes, a number synonymous with Villa’s finest hour.

Under the previous Chairman, when the Holte End wanted to be heard, Doug Ellis would hear and more often than not, he would act. In truth, he often acted before it got this bad. Our current owner can’t hear the Holte End as he’s sat thousands of miles away, so let him see it. We Want Our Villa Back

Why have we gone this far?

For reasons only a few people know, Paul Lambert was awarded a new contract this season after two seasons of under achievement. But as it’s the decision of the Club to stick with the manager and in our role as supporters, knowing the owner isn’t going to change his mind while trying to sell the club, we have to play our part.

However, things are not right at Aston Villa and it’s not just under Paul Lambert. There have been too many seasons of under achievement and this great Club and its supporters deserve better. It’s clear to the footballing world that things are not as they should be at Aston Villa and unless things change soon, the decline will continue.

This is a peaceful demonstration followed up by good old fashioned Aston Villa support. This is a message that if absolutely everything is not done to drive Aston Villa forward, it’s possible that more supporters are going to leave the Holte End, but this time not come back.

And if you’re reading this, you have a big part to play, even if you don’t sit in the Holte End. Download this letter, print as many copies as you can and hand it out to fellow Villans at Villa Park this weekend. And don’t forget to sign your name to it.

Saturday is fundamentally a warning sign and we truly hope that by acting together as supporters, we’re demonstrating that our role is still one that should be considered very important by the Club. #WeWantOurVillaBack.
