They say third time lucky and after two musical flops it appears Patricia Krentcil - aka Tan Mom - is back for one last shot.

The 46-year-old mother-of-five from Nutley, New Jersey, was photographed in the recording studio  as she sang lyrics from her new pop song 'Rock My Freakin' Body'.

Shots show her apparently lost in the moment, failing to realize that her strappy  top is literally slipping off her shoulder to reveal an eyeful of cleavage.

Singing at the top of her lungs: They say third time lucky and after two musical flops it appears Patricia Krentcil - aka Tan Mom - is back for one last shot 

She appears to be dressed for sunny weather, in a pair of tiny hot pants and sandals, suggesting the shots were taken last year or she jetted of to warmer climates for her musical exploits.

Her new dance track is a collaboration with singer-songwriter Adam Barta and produced by Jake Benson.

The same duo were behind the peroxide blonde's other disco failures 'It's Tan Mom' and 'Life of the Party'.

In her new song Krentcil - who once admitted that she topped up her tan 20 times a month - sings about her outrageous adventures like spray tanning at the airport and running on the beach topless.

She also croons about her stint in rehab: 'If you think I’m drinking wine, ain’t no more since I did time, at the rehab with Michael Lohan, got all sober and now I’m flowin!' 

Rock My Freakin' Body is currently available to download for 99 cents and is yet to break into the top ten charts.

When she's not singing, Krentcil's other passions include nightclubbing and going in for Botox injections.

Out of control: Krentcil (pictured her in 2012) was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 after being accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter, Anna, to a tanning booth

Krentcil was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 after being accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter, Anna, to a tanning booth.

The girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on her skin.

Krentcil denied taking her daughter to a tanning booth and said the child was burned by the sun while she played outside. 

In 2013 Krentcil filed for divorce  from her husband Richard. According to reports she decided to call off the eight-year marriage after he failed a lie detector test about his infidelity on a television show called The Test.

However, it's not known where the couple's relationship stands now.
