A dying 23-year-old mother married her partner in a hospital chapel after GPs repeatedly failed to spot that she was suffering from cancer.

Iveta Kelesova, from Brixton in south London, married Mikulas Keles, 24, at the Royal Marsden Hospital’s chapel in May. She died just days later.

The couple’s two-year-old daughter, Victoria, acted as a bridesmaid.

Iveta Kelesova, 23, married Mikulas Keles, 24, at the Royal Marsden Hospital's chapel in May. She died just days later from cancer which was so advanced that doctors could not work out where it originated

Mrs Kelesova first visited her doctor at the end of last summer suffering from a persistent cough, night sweats, and pains in her limbs.

During the following six months she returned to her doctor more than ten times to ask for help but her husband said that she was always told that she was healthy, and that there was nothing wrong with her.

Mrs Kelesova used the female version of her husband's surname, Keles.

Mr Keles said: ‘Iveta went to the doctor many times and he only joked “She is a healthy woman, she will never be strong like you though”, but it wasn’t right. I knew she was very ill.’

Eventually, Mrs Kelesova developed dizziness and breathlessness and lost one and a half stone.

She was finally referred to the Accident and Emergency department at King’s College Hospital, in Denmark Hill, south London, on March 28 this year.

Mrs Kelesova (pictured with her husband and their daughter, Victoria, two) visited her doctor repeatedly for six months suffering from night sweats, pain, and a persistent cough but was told she was healthy

At the hospital she was diagnosed with 
adenocarcinoma – a cancer originating in the glandular tissue - which 
was so advanced that doctors were unable to establish where it 
originated.

By the time she was diagnosed it had spread to her bones and lymph nodes and was incurable.

She was transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital, in Sutton, for treatment.

Mr Keles said: ‘It was a big shock. Suddenly they said she had cancer and was very sick and we that we had to go to another hospital.

‘Iveta was in so much pain. How can my doctor have seen her like that and say she was healthy?’

Knowing that she did not have long to live, the couple decided to marry in the hospital’s chapel. The wedding took place on May 2.

Mrs Kelesova was eventually diagnosed with adenocarcinoma - a cancer originating in the glandular tissue - when she was referred to the A&E at King's College Hospital in south London

Speaking about the wedding, Mr Keles said: 'Iveta looked beautiful but very tired and I was worried she would close her eyes and go at any time'

Mr Keles said: ‘It was so hard. Everyone was trying to smile but it was a sad occasion really.

‘Iveta looked beautiful but very tired and I was worried she would close her eyes and go at any time.’

Mrs Kelesova died on May 15.

Her husband said: ‘It is so hard. Iveta used to look after [our daughter] Victoria and I would work to support them as well as my mother and father who are unwell.

‘Now I have to look after Victoria but we still need money and there are still bills to pay.

‘Victoria is cheeky and naughty and she reminds me of Iveta very much. She has a good spirit.’

Mr Keles says that Victoria cries every time she sees a picture of her mother and that she did not like seeing her in hospital. He says that she is very cheeky and reminds him of his wife

When Mrs Kelesova was in hospital Mr Keles stayed by her bedside every day and every night sleeping in a chair. He says that he held her hand to make her feel safe

He added: ‘Victoria cries every time she sees a picture of Iveta, which breaks my heart.

‘She didn’t like it in the hospital at all and was sad seeing her mum with all the wires. She understands that Iveta has gone up to heaven but she misses her very much.

‘In the hospital I stayed next to Iveta every day and night. I slept in the chair next to her bed with my hand on hers to make her happy, keep her safe.’

The couple, who are originally from Slovakia, have been supported by CLIC Sargent which is the UK’s leading cancer charity for children, young people, and their families.

Dara de Burca, CLIC Sargent Director of Services, said: 'Clearly, this is a tragic case. But unfortunately, we frequently hear from young people that they made repeated visits to their GP over weeks or months before being diagnosed.

'Cancer in young people is rare, so it’s often difficult for GPs to recognise the symptoms in patients.

'On average, a GP will see only one case in their career. Support for GPs must be improved – key to this is providing them with better information and resources so they can spot these rare cases. Getting young patients diagnosed earlier would save lives.'
