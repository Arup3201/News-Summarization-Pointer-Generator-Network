A megachurch pastor who called women 'penis homes' has resigned amid allegations of bullying and corruption.  

Mark Driscoll, stepped down from his position as elder and lead pastor at Mars Hill, Seattle, after a group of church elders recently ended an investigation into a series of formal charges brought against him.

Announcing the decision on the church's website on Wednesday, he said: 'It would be best for the health of our family, and for the Mars Hill family, that we step aside from further ministry at the church.'

Driscoll, whose church grew to attract more than 12,000 at branches across five states, took a leave of absence in August so church leaders could investigate whether he was fit to lead after accusations that he bullied members, threatened opponents, lied and oversaw mismanagement of church funds, the Seattle Times reported. 

But the church's board said on its website that Driscoll was not asked to resign, and they were surprised to receive his resignation. 

His resignation letter, which was obtained by Religion News Service, said: 'Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill.

'There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.' 

Domineering spirit: Pastor Mark Driscoll wrote that women were created to give homes to men's penises

The board Driscoll has been 'guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner.'

The board said that while it believes Driscoll needs to address those areas in his life, 'we do not believe him to be disqualified from pastoral ministry.'

The church noted that Driscoll, the only pastor it has known since it was founded 18 years ago, was never charged with immorality, illegality or heresy. 

It said most of the charges involved the domineering style of leadership, and that they found some accusations 'unfair or untrue.'

Driscoll founded his megachurch, 18 years ago. It has branches across five states but some have been forced to close last month 

A phone and email message left with the church was not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon.

Other charges had previously been addressed by Driscoll, the church noted. 

In 2001, under a pseudonym, William Wallace II, Mark Driscoll wrote:

'The first thing to know about your penis is, that despite the way it may see, it is not your penis. Ultimately, God created you and it is his penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while.

'While His penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home, sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in.

'Knowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home.

'Therefore, if you are single you must remember that your penis is homeless and needs a home. Though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home, it is not,' he wrote. 

'And, though women other than your wife may look like a home, to rest there would be breaking into another man's home.' 

The best-selling author has been accused of plagiarism and criticized for his stance against homosexuality and female preachers.

In July, Driscoll apologized for crude comments he made posting under an alias in an online discussion forum in 2000.

And last month, his church was forced to close several of its branches after comments Driscoll made calling women 'penis homes' emerged online. 

Since 1996, the church has grown quickly to attract thousands of followers in 15 branches in five states. 

Last month, the church announced it was closing some of its branches and making plans to lay off dozens of employees. 

The Seattle Times reported that financial problems in the wake of falling attendance forced the cutbacks.

Combined attendance at all Mars Hill branches had dropped from more than 12,000 a week at the start of the year to less than 9,000, a church spokesman said last month.

The board now is planning for the future.

'We would ask for patience as we now make plans for the first transition of pastoral leadership in the history of Mars Hill Church,' the church's board said on its website.
