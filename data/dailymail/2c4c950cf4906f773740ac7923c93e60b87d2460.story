A renowned journalism professor has been accused of framing an innocent man for murder so he could advance his campaign to abolish the death penalty in Illinois.

Alstory Simon, 64, confessed to a double murder in 1999, mainly because of an investigation from a team of students at Northwestern University, led by Professor David Protess.

It helped free death row inmate Anthony Porter just days before his execution, a case that was cited when the state announced a moratorium on capital punishment in 2003 and its abolition in 2011.

Simon was released from the Jacksonville Correction Center last week after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office re-examined his conviction.

Now, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claims the team of journalists and their professor, as part of Northwestern University's Innocence Project, framed his client so Porter could become a 'poster boy' in the bid to end executions in the state.

Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of the investigator, Paul Ciolino in conjunction with Protess could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness at the time.

However it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out.

Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry.

'I'm not angry at the system. I'm angry at the people who did what they did to me,' he said, crying as he told reporters that his mother had died while he was behind bars. 

Simon was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15.

But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals. 

Alvarez said he was tricked by a private investigator who stormed into his home and showed him a videotape of a man who said he had seen Simon pull the trigger.

The man turned out to be an actor.

'In the best interest of justice, we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction,' Alvarez said.

The Porter case helped lead former Gov. George Ryan to declare a moratorium on executions in 2003, and he cleared death row by commuting the death sentences of more than 150 inmates to life in prison. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011. 

Alvarez did not say whether she believed Simon is, in fact, innocent, but she said there were so many problems with the case.

Frustration: Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry at 'the people who did this to me'

One of them was what she called a coerced confession and the deaths of a number of key figures, making it impossible to determine exactly what happened on the morning of Aug. 15, 1982, when two people were shot to death as they sat in a park on Chicago's South Side. 

She also said there remains powerful evidence that Porter was the gunman, including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements.

'As I stand here today, I can't definitely tell you it was Porter who did this or Simon who did this,' she said. 

Protess, who retired from Northwestern in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods, has not responded to phone calls for comment, but has previously defended his methods and results. 

Ciolino, who like Protess has denied acting improperly, released a statement that emphasized that Simon confessed multiple times, including to a TV reporter and his own lawyer.

'You explain that,' Ciolino said. Nonetheless, he added, no one should be in prison if the state did not meet its burden of proof.

Advancing claims: Porter spent 16 years on death row prior to his release. Illinois put a moratorium in place on executions in 2003 and the death penalty was abolished in 2011
