It seems that designing a fashion range is a pretty 'reem' thing to do in Essex and Lauren Pope is the latest TOWIE star to turn her hand to designing.

The model and DJ has teamed up with womenswear e-tailer inthestyle.co.uk to launch an exclusive fashion range just in time for SS14.

The 25-piece collection is Lauren's first foray into fashion design and she promises that it's full of affordable and on-trend casual and eveningwear.

Lauren, who already has her own hair extension brand, has big plans for the future and says that the collection will grow over the season with up to 60 pieces set to be unveiled.

Lauren says that her range, which includes collared floral dresses, embellished party wear, pastel jumpsuits, casual tees and pencil skirts, is catwalk inspired.

Pretty pastels: The 25-piece collection is Lauren's first foray into fashion design and she says she's taken cue from the seasons biggest trends. Jumper, £19.99

Expansion: The business woman, who already has her own hair extension company, is hoping to develop the range into a 60-piece collection. Jeans, £24.99, shirt, £24.99

'Bringing out my own fashion line has been a dream of mine for a long time, but I needed to find the right brand to collaborate with so I could have input into the design,' said the 31-year-old.

'The range includes both amazing partywear but also glamorous day wear such as embellished jumpers and cool lounge wear as I often struggle to find nice comfy clothing for everyday.'

Lauren said that she took her price range (£15-£70) into careful consideration.

'Price was also key for me, I didn't want anything to be too expensive as I know how annoying it is when you see a celebrity in something that you just can't afford!,' she said.

Lauren isn't the first star of The Only Way Is Essex to unveil a clothing collection. The Faiers sisters, Gemma Collins, Lydia Rose Bright and Lucy Mecklenburgh all have their own.
