These four newly hatched tortoises appear more than happy to adjust to their new surroundings from the comfort of their mother's back.

Staff at Lake District Wildlife Park, near Keswick successfully bred four baby African spurred tortoises for the first time.

And the newly hatched tortoises, named after the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, have wasted little time getting to know their mother who was photographed yesterday giving the four a ride on her back.

Staff at Lake District Wildlife Park believe the warm British summer helped the eggs to hatch

Zoo staff now believe the soaring summer temperatures may actually have helped the tiny 2in babies to hatch.

Park manager Richard Robinson said Donatello, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo were successfully incubated for 100 days.

He said: 'We have had eggs in the past but we never managed to get everything in place.

'I would like to think the wonderful weather we had helped things along.

'We also have a very good reptile keeper who incubated the eggs successfully, so the skill and dedication of the staff had a big influence.'

They are African spurred tortoises, also known as sulcata tortoises.

They can live to be 150 years old and keep growing - weighing up to 14 stone (90kg).

The four babies are still very small and fragile. At the moment they measure about 2in long
