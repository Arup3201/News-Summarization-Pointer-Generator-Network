When William first introduced Prince George to the world, he quipped that luckily their newborn had inherited his mother's looks, to which Kate replied 'I'm not sure about that'.

But judging by yesterday's snaps of His Royal Highness Prince 
George Alexander Louis of Cambridge, who put on a perfect display of royal 
etiquette on one the biggest day of his life so far, he really is the spitting image of his mother as baby.

As the former Kate Middleton carried her son out of the service, dressed in a handmade replica of Queen Victoria’s daughter’s christening robe, it was impossible to miss the resemblance between the pair.

Spot the difference: As the Duchess of Cambridge left her son's christening, it was impossible not to notice the similarities between the pair

Little George has inherited his mother's head shape, chubby little cheeks and the Middleton button nose.

And it isn't just his mother's looks that the youngster has acquired.

According to aides, there wasn’t ‘even a peep’ out of the three-month-old future king as he was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace.

‘He went in smiling, came out smiling and, as far as we are aware, smiled throughout,’ said one.

His good behaviour seemingly resonates that of his mother.

George Brown, a 68-year-old former neighbour of the Middleton family told the Mail on Sunday: 'Catherine was a good 
baby. She was always very well turned-out and there weren’t any 
problems. 

'She was very content. Carole and I would often take the girls
 for walks together and have a coffee, and there was never much crying.’

So where did it all begin for Kate?

Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on January 9, 1982, the eldest of three children to British Airways stewardess Carole and her trainee pilot husband Michael Middleton, who had been married for two years.

The
 christening of Catherine took place on June 20, 1982 — the day before 
her future husband was born — at her local church, St Andrew’s, in 
Bradfield on the banks of the River Pang, Berkshire.

Her
 father Michael sported a traditional dark suit with striped tie for the
 occasion and posed proudly with Kate and Carole, who wore a Laura Ashley floral dress for the down-to-earth family event.

William's baptism was very different to Kate's small village gathering.

He was baptised in the Music Room of 
Buckingham Palace on August 4 (the 82nd birthday of the Queen Mother) by
 the then Archbishop of Canterbury,  Robert Runcie.

Princess Diana, just 21 and wearing a
 fuchsia pink, blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a 
rakish angle, looked radiant. But she later confided to friends that it 
had been a trial.

‘No one 
consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with William’s schedule,’ 
she said. ‘I was totally excluded, totally exhausted and the photos went
 on and on. I blubbed my eyes out.’

George's intimate christening, which saw just 23 guests in attendance, was a far cry from William's, but the little boy has definitely inherited some of his father's key features.

Prince George has inherited his father's eyes and ears, and his late grandmother Diana's face shape.

'Prince George is a very bonny baby, just like his father,' said Clarissa Campbell Orr, a historian of the monarchy at Anglia Ruskin University.

'The resemblance to his father during the christening was particularly striking because he wore an identical christening robe.

'The robe is a replica of one first used by Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter and then subsequent royal christenings, including the Duke of Cambridge’s.

'The original is now too fragile so the replica was commissioned by the Queen and used for the christening of Prince Edward’s son James, Viscount Severn, and Prince George.'

In an historic 
ceremony which brought together four generations of the Royal Family, 
the three-month-old future king was christened by the Archbishop of 
Canterbury in the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace.

Big day: George wore an ivory gown made of delicate Honiton lace and white satin, worn before him by every baby born to the British Royal family since 1841

When he was welcomed into the faith, George wore an ivory gown made 
of delicate Honiton lace and white satin, worn before him by every baby 
born to the British Royal family since 1841.

Royal
babies were traditionally, until 2004, christened wearing the intricate
lace and satin gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, 
Victoria, Princess Royal in 1841 and used for generation after 
generation of royal infants including the Queen’s father King George VI,
the Queen, Charles, William, Prince Harry, with Lady Louise 
Mountbatten-Windsor the last royal baby to wear it in 2004.

Crafted from layers of delicate, hand-made Honiton lace and ivory satin, it was 
used for all royal christenings until 2004 when
Queen Elizabeth decided the gown was past its prime and ordered an exact replica to be crafted by her personal 
dressmaker.
