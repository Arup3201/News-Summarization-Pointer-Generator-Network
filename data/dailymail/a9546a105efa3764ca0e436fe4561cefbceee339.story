Jose Mourinho didn’t say much when he entered the Bradford dressing room after their sensational FA Cup shock, merely telling the League One giant-killers they had ‘big balls’.

Striker Jon Stead – who scored the Bantams’ first goal as they astonishingly clawed their way back from 2-0 down to dump Chelsea out at Stamford Bridge – revealed just what went on at the full-time whistle.

Mourinho walked into Bradford’s jubilant confines, shook hands with the entire staff, before praising the League One side’s character.

And that show of professionalism wasn’t something that went unnoticed.

‘He is an incredible manager and an incredible guy and that was a touch of class from him.’ Stead told talkSPORT.

‘He came in, he shook everyone’s hand, came round all the staff and players, and as he was going he said, “big balls, big balls!”’

It’s not the first time Mourinho has opted for that expression this season, either.

The Portuguese scribbled the term on a pad of paper back in October after being asked why the Blues beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

It is a term of endearment for Mourinho, who has emphasised the need for courage more than ever this year.

He can’t fail to have been impressed by Phil Parkinson’s Bradford as they reached the fifth round of the famous old tournament.

Stead believes the manager’s calmness at half-time had the desired effect after he himself had pulled a goal back just before the break.

‘The goals were quickly brushed aside to get rid of any negativity,’ he added.

‘The goals we conceded were self-inflicted and had gone against everything we’d said during the week. But we were there with nothing to lose. We could still somehow enjoy the day the best we can.

‘To get in at 2-1 gave us something to play for and a platform.

‘It was an incredible day and it is still sinking in. Second half we were fantastic. We didn’t just score a lucky winner in the last minute.’
