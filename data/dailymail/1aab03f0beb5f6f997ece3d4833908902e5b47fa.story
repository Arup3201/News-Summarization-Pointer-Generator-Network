A resilient Florida woman has recovered her stolen phone after hunting the thief for a week using an app that emailed her selfies and the location of the culprit.

Cathy Carter, of Lakeland, stopped by her doctor's office last week to get a prescription and didn't think twice about leaving her Buick windows down -- she just assumed nothing would happen while she was inside for a couple minutes.

Then she came back outside to discover that her Samsung Galaxy Exhibit, which she'd forgotten on the seat, had been stolen.

At first, she thought the phone was a goner. Then a few hour later, Carter received an email with a picture of a woman and a map indicating where her phone was last seen.

'I remembered her because she was wearing
 the ugliest dress,' Carter, 59, told WFLA, recognizing the thief as someone she'd run into at the doctor's office. 'All I could think is how ugly 
that green dress was.'

Caught: Cathy Carter used this selfie to capture the thief who swiped her phone, who police later found to be a trailer park resident

On the hunt: the app Carter used, called Lookout, sent her maps showing the location of the thief from the moment she swiped the phone

As
 it turns out, one of Carter's friends had recently installed on the 
device an app called Lookout, which detects when someone is trying to 
unlock a stolen device and snaps pictures of the thief.

The app also emailed Carter maps of the location where the phone was last used.

She started posting the thief's pictures everywhere and even enlisted the help of her local news station. One of Carter's friends saw her on TV and told her he recognized the thief
 as a resident of the Citrus Center trailer park nearby.

She went over to the neighborhood and 
peppered it with flyers with the woman's face front and center. Then she waited for the police to call.

'They just found her!' she told MailOnline on Friday afternoon. 'I'm going over to pick up my phone right now.'
