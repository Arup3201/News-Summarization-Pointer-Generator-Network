Brighton have been hit with a £90,000 fine by the Football Association and warned over their future conduct for admitting breaches of the governing body's agent regulations.

The charges relate to the Seagulls' acquisition of midfielder Dale Stephens from fellow Sky Bet Championship side Charlton at the end of January 2014.

Three authorised agents have also been sanctioned and warned to their future conduct for their roles in the same case.

Brighton have been punished by the FA after breaching agent regulations during a transfer last year

Dale Stephens joined Brighton in January 2014

In explaining the decisions, the regulatory commission decreed Brighton had 'in the events which have happened, benefited from the non-payment of most of the commission'.

It was revealed the south-coast club were charged under rule C.2, which states that a club 'must not so arrange matters as to conceal or misrepresent the reality and/or substance of any matters in relation to a transaction or contract negotiations'

They were also charged under rule F.1, which states 'an authorised agent, club and player shall ensure that the name, signature and licence or registration number of each and every authorised agent or exempt solicitor carrying out any agency activity in relation to a transaction or contract negotiation (whether directly or indirectly) is shown on all relevant contracts and documents as is required from time to time.'

Stephens, 25, has played 18 times for the Seagulls, with only four appearances coming this season.

Agents Alex Levack and Matthew Kleinman have been fined £7,500 and banned from all agency activity and intermediary activity for 14 months, with half of that suspended. Ali Rahnama has been suspended from all agency activity and intermediary activity for a period of nine months, with six months suspended.
