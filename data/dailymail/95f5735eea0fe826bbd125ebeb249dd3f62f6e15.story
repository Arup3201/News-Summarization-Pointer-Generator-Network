It turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.

This is the heart-warming and hilarious moment a baby teaches the family pet how to jump.

As baby Alexis bounds up and down in her door bouncer, Dakota the dog cautiously watches her shadow on the kitchen floor before deciding to join in.

During the scene, in an unknown location, the dog repeatedly leaps in the air – with all four legs off the floor – and pounces on the little girl’s shadow.

Alexis giggles in delight as the perplexed pet lands on her shadow and then steps back and leaps again.

The one-minute video has been watched over 20,000 times since mum Sabrina Sauve uploaded it to YouTube last Thursday.

It has been a hit with viewers, with one user writing: ‘Love them both!’

Another added: ‘That moment when you realize your dog is trying to protect your baby from the monster living underneath your house. ’

The dog is actually leaping on the baby's shadow, which keeps moving on the floor, something which apparently it has always loved to do.
