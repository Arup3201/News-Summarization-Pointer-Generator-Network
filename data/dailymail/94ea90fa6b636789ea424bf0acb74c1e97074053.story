This is the comical moment a brazen spider 'photobombed' a live BBC news bulletin when it crawled across the screen to catch an insect.

The creepy-crawlie, which appeared to be a giant in the shot, invaded the early morning edition of Reporting Scotland when it crept across the lens of the roof camera.

Newsreader Graham Stewart looked unperturbed as the spider grabbed the insect before retreating.

Determined: The spider was not bothered about appearing on national television as he pursued his meal

After realising what had happened he tweeted: 'Never mind the pandas: giant hungry spider invades Reporting Scotland at breakfast time!'

He later added: 'I was completely unaware of what was going on until viewers began tweeting us. I'm sure people were shouting out "He's behind you".

'I hope our viewers weren't put off their breakfast - I know the spider certainly wasn't.' 

The clip drew widespread attention on social media, with more than 200 retweets on Twitter in just over an hour.

Mike Wilson tweeted: 'Did anyone see Graham Stewart almost get his head eaten by the giant spider on BBC Breakfast?? Scary stuff. Good job he didn't turn round.'

Ruth McAvinia wrote: 'Awesome spider attacks BBC!'

Another tweeter, Sam Benshoof, posted: 'I for one welcome our new giant spider overlords.'
