George Osborne has slapped down Vince Cable over his warning that house price rises mean Britain risks ‘repeating the mistakes of Gordon Brown’.

The Chancellor dismissed the Business Secretary's criticisms and told the Cabinet that while the property market is rebounding ‘relatively quickly’ in London, there is little evidence of rapid increases elsewhere.

Mr Osborne insisted ministers should be 
reassuring voters that the coalition’s reforms mean that the Bank of 
England has taken back responsibility to step in and deflate any 
unsustainable house price bubble.

Senior Liberal Democrats claim that 
the Chancellor is prepared to see the housing market overheat in the 
run-up to the 2015 general election, boosting economic confidence and 
increasing the chances of a Conservative election victory.

But
 Government sources told MailOnline that Mr Osborne dismissed Mr Cable’s
 warnings at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting. ‘In London prices are going up
 relatively rapidly but in many parts of the country that’s simply not 
the case,’ said one.

‘The Bank of England now has responsibility to look at house prices and intervene if it thinks it necessary.’

Another
 source said: ‘Of course the Government has to be vigilant about any 
kind of imbalance, not just in terms of housing. That’s what we have 
reformed financial regulation in the way that we have.

‘Vince
 and others should be out there making a virtue of the fact that we are 
the Government that has given the Bank that power.’

Tougher affordability checks are coming into force following a review of the mortgage market by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.

This will mean banks and building societies being required to do new ‘stress tests’ on borrowers to ensure they will still be able to afford their loans if interest rates go up.

Figures show that house prices last month experienced their biggest monthly rise for more than four years.

The
 average cost of a home rose by 8.4 per cent last year, according to the
 Nationwide building society. Despite the rises, the average cost of a 
home, at £175,826, is still five per cent below its pre-financial crisis
 peak in 2007.

UK house 
prices are set to rise by as much as a further eight per cent in 2014, 
according to the most optimistic forecasts by economists and property 
professionals.

Last week Mr 
Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, opened up another split 
in the coalition as he described house price increases as a ‘worrying’ 
development that could threaten the economy.

‘The
 Government has done really good work turning the economy around: we 
can’t now risk it being derailed by a housing bubble repeating the 
mistakes of Gordon Brown,’ Mr Cable said.

Under Mr Osborne’s changes to Labour’s failed regulatory system, the Bank also has the power to rein in schemes such as Help to Buy and to demand that lenders limit mortgage borrowing.

It has already scaled back the mortgage element of the Funding for Lending scheme, offering cheap credit, to focus on business lending.

The Bank has held rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 and flooded billions into the financial system to keep borrowing costs down.

With the economy now recovering, there is increasing speculation about when the Bank will start raising rates, with most expecting the first small increase next year.
