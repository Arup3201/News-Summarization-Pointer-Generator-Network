A vast ocean graveyard of British and German vessels sunk during the First World War has been discovered by a team of explorers.

A total of 41 German U-boats, as well as three English submarines, have been unearthed at depths of up to 50 feet close to Englandâ€™s southern and eastern coasts by a team led by underwater archaeologist Mark Dunkley.

The find is expected to clear up a number of mysteries about the fates of ships that sank fighting in the conflict.

The discoveries could bring to light the fate of a number of vessels which disappeared. Two German submarines, the U35 and U42 (pictured), surface off the Mediterranean coast

Mr Dunkley, who is is employed by English Heritage, said: 'We owe it to these people to tell their story.

'We divers only approach the boats with great caution. Venturing inside would definitely be extremely dangerous.'

He says his team will now to use robots to cut through the hull to find the mysteries that lie within.

'Perhaps we'll find a cup or a sign with a name on it,' Dunkley told reports German news magazine Der Spiegel.

Several U-boats with the German 
Imperial Navy are still officially considered missing to this day. Lists
 provide details on which of the U-boats the German naval forces
 had lost by the time the war ended in November 1918, but the fate of 
many is still shrouded in mystery.

One such mysterious vessel is UB 17, which vanished with its crew of 21 men. Another is the UC 21, commanded by naval Lieutenant Werner von Zerboni di Sposetti, a minelayer that disappeared with all 27 hands. Dunkley believes he has found both.

He know hopes to find memorabilia that will give a clue to the identity of those who died in what were undoubtedly horrendous and terrifying circumstances.

The Germans used the submarines to inflict heavy losses on merchant shipping in the Great War.

They only had 28 of the relatively new U-boats at the beginning of the war, but as the technology proved its effectiveness production was ramped up significantly.

'Many have forgotten how successful the German U-boat fleet was for a time,' added Dunkley.

However, the risks to the crew were enormous. Torpedoes often misfired, killing crew, and aiming them was a difficult and uncertain process. If they missed, the slow-moving vessels were easy prey for warships, which would ram them or use depth charges.

Nearly half of the 380 U-boats used by the German navy in World War I were lost.
