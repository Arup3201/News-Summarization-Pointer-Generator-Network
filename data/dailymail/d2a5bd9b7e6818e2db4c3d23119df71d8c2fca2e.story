A breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast.

Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up.

The mother-of-four said: ‘I was having a late breakfast with two friends and Louis needed feeding - so I fed him. To me it’s all the same, syringe, boob, bottle - you’re just feeding your baby.

‘So I was shocked when a member of staff, who claimed to be the manager, came over with a dirty dishcloth - the sort you use to wipe down the bar and said “you’re disturbing the other customers".

'(He added): "Can you cover up?” I stood up and asked the other customers - there were only about 15 of them - if they had a problem and they all said "no".’

The mother, who has breastfed her three other children, Eva, five, Luke, four, and Jennifer, two, has now decided to take a stand - by holding a ‘Wetherspoons boob and bottle feed in’ at the pub.

After the incident last Sunday, she added: ‘What he (the employee) has done is against the Equality Act which came into force in 2010 and Wetherspoon are supposed to be breast-feeding friendly.

‘I want people to know about this so I’ve organised mums to go along and feed their babies in whichever way they choose at 10am tomorrow.

‘I don’t think they’ll like it but I didn’t like the way I was treated - it was completely unfair.’

So far, more than 50 people have agreed to attend the ‘Wetherspoons Boob and Bottle Feed In’, which has been publicised on Facebook.

Commenting on the event page, Troyangel Vydelingum said: ‘I think it’s disgusting, been asked to cover up with a dish cloth as well.’

Katherine Nykola added: ‘He broke the law under the Equality Act. It’s the same law that makes racism illegal. This is a big deal for someone trying to do what’s best for their baby.’

A Wetherspoon spokesman said: ‘We apologise wholeheartedly to the lady. This should never have happened. Our pubs are welcoming to mothers who wish to breastfeed their children.

‘The Wetherspoon staff member made a judgement error in this case. There are no excuses and we do not offer one. We completely understand that this incident upset the lady in question and hope she accepts our apology.’

Miss Pozniak's Twitter profile describes her as a 'single mama of four perfect babies', adding that she likes 'slings, wine, cake, outdoor adventures and the ever-elusive five minutes’ peace’.

The Wetherspoon chain - which is known for its cheap prices on food and drink - has more than 800 pubs in Britain and claims to serve more than 350,000 breakfasts every week.
