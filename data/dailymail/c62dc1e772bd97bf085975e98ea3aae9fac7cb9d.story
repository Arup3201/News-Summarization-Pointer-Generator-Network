Last week, a stranger told me how sexy I was. Or rather, he told my friend Matthew, with whom I was having dinner.

‘Do you know how lucky you are to have such an attractive companion?’ the man asked him while I was at the bar.

Immediately, Matthew puffed up to twice his size — but I could scarcely believe my ears. Surely they didn’t mean me? At the age of 70? Perhaps this man needed his eyesight testing.

Liz, 70, says that in the last ten years she's been besieged by dating offers from men in her own age group (Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin in It's Complicated) 

Still, I was secretly thrilled. Who wouldn’t be? No one ever paid me such a compliment when I was younger and had the looks to deserve it; yet now, someone was honestly wowed by me. I felt great. Sexy, even.

I’m not exaggerating when I say this wasn’t an isolated incident. Over the past ten years, since my partner died, I have been besieged by dating offers from men in my age group.

And not just dating. Far from thinking that it’s not possible to have a fulfilling sex life in later life, I have to tell you I’m very satisfied.

While I am still single, I do have a male friend (not Matthew) whom I see every now and then. Our relationship is not exactly romantic, but it is certainly red-blooded. In today’s rather coy slang, it is a ‘friendship with benefits’.

Sex is in no way off the agenda because of my age. Yes, it really is true — like many women my age, at 70 I’m sexier than ever.

Even Matthew later told me that he was in complete agreement with the stranger. ‘It’s true,’ he insisted, as I suppose he felt he had to. ‘You really haven’t lost your sex appeal.’

Traditionally, sexiness is a short-lived commodity, fleetingly bestowed upon the young and quickly lost — like sand running through your fingers.

Liz (pictured) says she sees women in their 60s and 70s everywhere who still think, 'look and act sexy'

In our 70s, goes the received wisdom, we become old crones and ‘little old ladies’ living out our days in a care home or alone in a one-bedroom flat with only a cat for company.

We are grannies or aged spinsters, a burden to the NHS and even to our families. For someone of my age, sex appeal is supposed to be a distant memory.

Yet it simply isn’t true. When I look around me, I see dozens of women in their 60s and 70s who still think, look and act sexy.

Indeed, this is a generation that refuses to accept the passing of sexiness; that rejects the notion we’re past our prime the moment we pick up a pension.

Could it be, in fact, that we’re just coming into it?

This is such a new and radical thought that it requires a significant culture change. But — and it’s a big but — it doesn’t just happen by itself.

In my opinion, sexiness at our age has to be worked at. We might not be crones, but gone are the days when we can walk into a room with unbrushed hair, wearing a tacky T-shirt and flip-flops. That works for gorgeous 20-year-olds, but not for us. After dinner, I talked about this at length with Matthew, who is a psychologist and himself over 70. And, while his views may verge on stuffy, they do come from the horse’s mouth.

‘In my view, all older women should dye their hair because grey or white immediately says: “You’re old, you’re past it.” It says you don’t care any more,’ he says.

‘And most men, including myself, are not interested in a woman who doesn’t care what she looks like.’

Liz says that celebrities like Tina Turner (pictured in 1969) show that older people can still be sexy

And yes, we do have to submit to the pedicurist and manicurist, and wear make-up all the time. In order to keep the old chassis more or less on the road, we must polish it and buff it up.

‘You also have to smile,’ says Matthew. ‘A young person can get away with looking moody, but there is nothing worse than a miserable old person.’

In fact, I admit to keeping several High Street beauty shops more or less in business these days. The local nail salon, brow bar, tanning shop and even the dentist thrive on my custom.

I go to the gym, too, for while it might be possible to be sexy and overweight in your 20s, no one is going to ask for your number if you look flabby at 70. Men will think your heart is about to give out, and the only new relationship you’ll forge is with a cardiac surgeon.

Cher, who is 68, (pictured in 2013) is an example of how women who are nearly 70 can have the energy and vibrancy that make them sexy

I’m afraid to say that a good figure at this age requires an intense effort — but it’s worth every moment on the cross-trainer. At least nowadays there are gyms that cater for this level of vanity.

It’s also true that I have had some work done: a facelift five years ago that has held up reasonably well and removed a lot of the ‘old lady’ look. While this might be cheating, at £12,000 it certainly wasn’t cheap.

In any case, I don’t regret it and am considering a tummy tuck, too — though whether I can put myself through the expense and trauma, not to mention the scarring, remains to be seen.

I don’t have any particular beauty regime. Products by Simple have always seemed to me as good as anything more expensive. Hands are a perennial problem, and over the years I have tried every kind of hand cream, from cheap to pricey to really very dear indeed — and none seem to make any difference.

Same with the neck. Once again, the only real solution is a neck lift. And as for the decolletage: well, just don’t have too much on show.

Yes, it all takes more time and effort every year. And, of course, I sound extraordinarily vain. I also never wear flat shoes, except trainers for the gym.

But really it is about attitude — and I am certain that is what my admirer at dinner picked up on. I looked animated and lively and fun to be with — perhaps because I was dining with a relatively new friend rather than a grotty old husband of 50 years (I’m sure that helped, in any case).

Energy and vibrancy are probably the sexiest qualities of all in older people. Look at Tina Turner, who is 75, and Cher, nudging 70.

Look at the way they project and light up a stage — they are at least as sexy as they were 30, 40, even 50, years ago.

Cosmetic surgery has helped them, too, but it’s their lust for life that has truly kept them hot.

And then there is the fantastic former ballerina Dame Gillian Lynne, still with a lithe dancer’s body and working at the age of 89.

I am not the only one enjoying herself so thoroughly at this late(ish) point in life. Recently, a 70-something girlfriend confessed that she was having a torrid affair with a married man, which, at any age, is morally dubious and extremely exciting.

Liz also refers to former ballerina Dame Gillian Lynne (pictured in 2014) who still has a lithe dancer’s body and is working at the age of 89 

Because of this, she knows there is no future in the relationship and, in any case, he lives abroad so they cannot meet very often. But he is so besotted with her that he Skypes or phones at least five times a day, and is always emailing her love poems he has written.

He is distraught when he cannot make contact, and tells her she is the sexiest woman he’s ever met.

I wish I could say that she didn’t go to enormous efforts to remain attractive — but the opposite is true. I have never seen her without full make-up, manicured nails and high heels. She also always exudes a delicious but subtle aura of expensive scent — another little touch older women often forget.

No wonder her lover can’t wait to get on a plane and book a five-star hotel.

Yes, we 70-year-olds of today are sexy, youthful and raring to go. Now all we’re waiting for is men of the same age to catch up.
