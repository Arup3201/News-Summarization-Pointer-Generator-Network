Television presenter Gail Porter had to be consoled by friends after witnessing ugly scenes outside a bar.

She was photographed looking shocked and upset while police and paramedics treated a man believed to be her friend.

The 21-year-old was taken to hospital after being apparently hit in the face with a glass. The incident happened outside Forty Dean Street restaurant and bar in Soho, central London - yards away from the famous Groucho Club.

The 42-year-old had earlier made an appearance with her friends at the Society of Golden Slippers - an exclusive club for entertainment industry 'insiders'.

Miss Porter has had a well publicised battle with depression and drink.

She has been sectioned under the mental health act, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had to battle the emotional trauma of losing her hair to alopecia.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Police were flagged down by members of the public at 11.40pm on Tuesday June 4 after a man was injured following an altercation outside a restaurant in Dean Street, central London.'
