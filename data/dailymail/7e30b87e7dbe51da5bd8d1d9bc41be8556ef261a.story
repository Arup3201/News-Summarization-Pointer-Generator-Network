An unemployed chef won £2,500 after betting £5 on Germany to beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup.

John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a ‘premonition’ the day before Tuesday’s semi-final match and had ‘the numbers one and seven in my head’, before deciding to place the bet.

The aspiring DJ and Arsenal fan claimed he had received signs such as the time on the clock being 17:17 and a package being delivered with ‘71’ on the slip - rather than his actual flat number.

Winner: John Moore, 28, of Woodford, east London, claims he had a 'premonition' the day before Tuesday's semi-final match and had 'the numbers one and seven in my head', before deciding to place the bet

He said: ‘I had this premonition the day before and had the number one and seven in my head. There was a lot of signs, I remember looking at the clock and the time being 17:17.

‘[Also], we live in a block of flats and someone had put a note through the door saying we had a package to collect from the front desk - but they had put number 71 on the slip, not our flat number.

‘I like putting bets on big scores and this whole tournament I have been trying for 4-2s and 3-2s but I never thought the one I’d get would be Germany 7 - Brazil 1.

‘But when I saw the odds of 500-1 I thought “why not?”. I knew Brazil didn’t have Diego Costa and Neymar was out - I thought it was worth a punt.

‘And as an Arsenal fan I don’t rate David Luiz - and he was exposed in the game. (Chelsea manager José) Mourinho must be thinking he’s quids-in selling him for £50million.”

Germany
 swept aside Brazil in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night to qualify for 
Sunday's final against Argentina, and were astonishingly 5-0 up at 
half-time - a scoreline they reached in just 29 minutes.

Mr Moore even admitted cheering when Arsenal favourite Mesut Özil missed an eighth chance to keep the score only at seven in the second half of the match.

And when Brazil snuck in a 90th-minute consolation goal, Mr Moore said he must have been the only person in the world in carnival mood.

Mr
 Moore - who had the biggest win in Britain on a correct score bet for 
the game - said he was planning on spending his winnings on a street 
food business as well as buying some DJ equipment.

A
 Paddy Power spokesman said that three other people had correctly 
predicted the score, adding: 'A 7-1 prediction was a long shot - but John definitely deserves to take a bow for that one now.'

However, Mr Moore was not the biggest UK winner on the game, after Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone made a profit of £14,250 after betting £15,000 on Germany going through at 19/20.

According to the Daily Mirror, the delighted model, 30, later tweeted: ‘Think it's safe to say my investments for tonight are safe!’

In addition, online gambling website Betfair said three English gamblers had correctly predicted the 7-1 score and won a total of nearly £6,500 from only £6.50 of bets.

But a spokesman said: ‘I feel sorry for the punters who had £31 at 999-1 on 7-0 Germany.’

Meanwhile, a student in Altrincham, Cheshire, staked 80p on Germany taking a 5-0 advantage into the break at odds of 300/1 and claimed £280 for their troubles.

A William Hill spokesman said: '5-0 was such an improbable scoreline that someone probably placed the remaining 80p in their account in hope rather than expectation on the most unlikely of halftime scores, but that punter is now £280 better off.'

All wrong: Some 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, but not one managed to predict the correct score

Despite 121,026 bets being placed with William Hill, not one managed to predict the correct score.

The spokesman added: 'It’s the first time since 1999, when we introduced online betting, that not one William Hill punter has predicted the correct score in a football match.'

But some people got carried away in the middle of the game, with a Coral spokesman revealing one online punter placed a £2 bet on Germany winning 13-0, when they were 6-0 up, at odds of 300-1.

Elsewhere, a Brazilian woman Anna Guerra, 44, won her office sweepstake after successfully predicting that Germany would thrash Brazil 7-1.

The artist only came up with the idea of betting on that scoreline because her sleep-walking husband told to her to when she confronted him.

'He said Germany,' said Mrs Guerra. ‘I asked him what the score would be and he said "7-1".’ The woman scooped around 200 Brazilian real (£55) from her colleagues for her 10 real bet.
