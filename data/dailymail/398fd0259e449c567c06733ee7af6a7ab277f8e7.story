Lukas Podolski recently posted a picture of himself on Twitter sitting comfortably on a cloud high up in the sky overlooking the London landscape.

Arsenal are familiar with forwards possessing lofty opinions of themselves, but in the dying seconds of their Champions League encounter at Anderlecht, Podolski delivered a goal to match his high self-esteem.

In fairness to him, the cloud shot was posted more in praise of England’s capital than anything but it raised a smile nonetheless. Someone had been busy on Photoshop.

While he still has plenty of doubters, Podolski thanks those who have been behind him all the way 

‘For 2.5 years now I've lived & played in London, I like this great City,’ Podolski wrote to accompany the image, including hashtags ‘londonisred’ and ‘thebigsmoke’. If only this reporter could come up with a pun like that last one.

The point is that while Podolski has been frozen out to a large degree by Arsene Wenger, he remains a cult hero to many Arsenal fans who like his breezy manner and humorous tone on social media.

He has posted more than 3,100 tweets to his 2.23million followers. To date, he shows off 708 smiling, stylised pictures on Instagram, where he has almost 1.8m subscribers.

‘If only he could be as productive on the football pitch,’ Wenger might well scorn.

That added-time goal in Belgium, six minutes after coming on, was his first of the season for Arsenal on his sixth appearance.

He has however only had 145 minutes combined throughout this campaign. Only one start.

Wenger simply doesn’t trust a man with 120 international caps to his name to do the business over 90 minutes, to offer work-rate with his supreme striking ability.

Make no mistake, his goal against Anderlecht was huge. Had Arsenal drawn that match, their hopes of progressing to the knock-out phase of the Champions League for a 15th consecutive season would have been in doubt.

It was a match they should really have lost on balance of chances. Instead, they are in position to qualify from Group D behind Borussia Dortmund.

For that Wenger should be grateful to the player he signed for £10.9m from Cologne in 2012.

Speaking this month after winning his latest cap for Germany in the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland, Podolski said: ‘I have assessed my position in the team, and it has to change now. Let’s see what happens in the winter. The fact is that I'm not happy with it, that's clear.’

Almost ever since that day though it has seemed likely Podolski will leave. Still only 29, he wants more playing time than he is receiving, quite understandably. A January transfer is not out of the question. 

Arsenal fans who have taken him to heart would be sad to see him go. His goal against Anderlecht may alter that eventuality.

What is for certain, he will not be heading to Tottenham. ‘Hell would freeze over before this transfer would happen #Poldi #aha #AlwaysAGunner #Nevercheatyourclub #afc #RedArmy.’

More hashes than welcome in a full English breakfast, and more reason for Arsenal supporters to hold him in special regard.
