Former Fulham forward Clint Dempsey scored on his return to the USA team and helped Jurgen Klinsmann's side beat Turkey at Red Bull Arena.

The USA captain missed the 2-0 win over Azerbaijan with a sore groin, but he was on the score sheet against Turkey in an end-to-end game on Sunday in New Jersey.

Fabian Johnson had earlier given USA the lead in the first half following a neat one-two with Michael Bradley and a cool finish into the bottom corner.

Selcuk Inan scored a penalty in the 89th minute for Turkey, but it was too little, too late for Fatih Terim's side.

'Overall, I thought it was good, open game,' said USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann.

'I think, defensively, especially in the first half, we needed to make some corrections at halftime, we need to close the gaps a bit better and we still have some work ahead of us.

'But overall, it was a good game to watch ... and you can tell that everybody is getting more and more excited about the World Cup.'

USA

It will be tough but Turkey coach Fatih Terim said: 'I believe they (the US) can do a very good job at the World Cup.

'They are a solid team with good players and I have a lot of confidence in Jurgen Klinsmann.'
