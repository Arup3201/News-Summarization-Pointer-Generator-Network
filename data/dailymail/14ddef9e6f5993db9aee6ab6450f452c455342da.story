A driver killed a university lecturer when he ploughed into him because he was distracted by the air fresheners and soft toys hanging from his rear view mirror, a court heard.

Matthew Campbell, 27, struck Dr Nicholas Musgrove, of Walsall, as he walked to Wolverhampton University with such force he was sent hurtling through the air 'like a rag doll', jurors were told.

Despite being rushed to hospital Dr Musgrove, 64, died later of the injuries following the collision which happened at 6.15am on December 20, 2012.

Matthew Campbell, pictured outside Wolverhampton Crown Court, has denied one count of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. The case follows the death of university lecturer Dr Nicholas Musgrove in December 2012

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Campbell had eight air fresheners, a pair of glasses, a soft toy and a key ring hanging from the mirror of his black Mazda 2.

Campbell has denied one count of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.

Nicholas Tatlow, prosecuting, told the court there were a 'number of factors' that could have caused the crash.

He said: 'From his rear view mirror the defendant had hanging no fewer than eight car air fresheners, a pair of glasses, a soft toy and a key ring.

'That bundle of objects from his rear view mirror would have formed a partial obstruction when he was looking ahead and to the left.

'Of course, ahead and to the left is where Dr Musgrove was to be found.'

He added that Campbell, of Wolverhampton, should have seen Dr Musgrove as he crossed the road at the junction of Stafford Street and the Wolverhampton ring road, but there was no suggestion he was speeding or had run a red light.

Peter Hately, a colleague of Dr Musgrove at Wolverhampton University, told the court that he was waiting to cross the road when he saw the accident happen.

He said: 'I never made it across because as I looked up Nick was crossing the road.

'He was possibly just leaving the first lane going into the second lane and was looking towards the oncoming traffic.

'The car went by and there was an impact.

'Then he went in the air, twisting and turning like a rag doll, and he came down with an almighty bump.'

Mr Tatlow also read out a police interview with Campbell.

In the interview, Campbell said: 'By the time I had seen the pedestrian it was too late. I was in shock for 30 seconds and just sat there.

'Then I saw the glass and thought ‘oh my gosh’ and put my hazard lights on and called an ambulance.'

He also said in the interview that he did not believe he had applied his brakes but had taken his foot off the accelerator.

The trial continues.
