He spends his days immersed in the works of Verdi and Puccini as musical director at the renowned Royal Opera House.

But world-class conductor Sir Antonio Pappano has revealed a penchant for rock and roll, after claiming children today don't know enough about the Rolling Stones or the Beatles.

The 53-year-old - who also described R'n'B megastar Beyonce as 'amazing' - said young people should be taught about the history of rock and roll, adding that any kind of exposure to the arts was 'a good thing'.

Philistines: Sir Antonio Pappano, one of the world's leading conductors, has said children today should be taught about the Beatles and the Rolling Stones

'Kids now don't know about the Beatles, 
the Rolling Stones, The Who and Chuck Berry; they don't know about the 
history of rock 'n' roll,' said the conductor, The Daily Telegraph reported.

'You need to be exposed to history; your brain 
will expand at the same time.'

The musical director's comments came just days after he voiced his frustration at what he claimed was modern day opera singers' tendency to pull out of productions too easily. The conductor branded them 'weaker in body' than stars of the past.

Sir Antonio said that while some instances were down to illness, others were due simply to a lack of commitment on the part of singers.

In his latest interview with the Sunday Times the conductor said he believed Britain has become a country of philistines, and that opera was viewed solely as the reserve of the 'toff'.

He compared his experiences in Italy -
where prime minister Mario Monti took him for dinner after he conducted
the Orchestra dell-Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome - to 
working in Britain, where he claims ministers prefer not to be seen at 
the opera because it might imply a privileged background.

The Royal Opera House should be a 
'crown jewel' in British culture, but instead there is a 'stigma' 
attached to the building,' he said.

'... it should be okay for important 
and busy people to come and experience something that might emotionally 
and intellectually enrich them,' he said, adding that to suggest 
otherwise was 'childish'.
