When Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic step into the Arthur Ashe stadium for Monday night's US Open final they will know a place in the history books awaits.

Not only will the pair be battling to win their maiden Grand Slam, they will also cap a remarkable year for tennis as it will be the first time since 1998 that eight different players – four men and four women - have won the major tournaments.

2014 started with shock wins for Stanislas Wawrinka and Li Na at the Australian Open and on Sunday saw Serena Williams become the fourth female Grand Slam winner this year after Na (Aus Open), Maria Sharapova (French Open) and Petra Kivitova (Wimbledon).

Impressive: Marin Cilic swept aside five-time champion Roger Federer to reach the US Open final

Talented: Kei Nishikori, No 8 seed on the ATP World Tour, goes into Monday's showdown as slight favourite

And 24-year-old Nishikori - who stunned world No 1 Novak Djokovic in four sets - and Cilic - who overpowered Roger Federer – will be aiming to follow in the footsteps of Warwrinka (Aus Open), Rafael Nadal (French Open) and Djokovic (Wimbledon).

For Nishikori, it will be an even more momentous occasion as he becomes the first Japanese player to play in a Grand Slam singles final, a victory would see him become the first male Asian winner of the 'big four'.

It will also be the first Grand Slam final since the Australian Open in 2005 that none of Nadal, Federer or Djokovic will appear.

Emulate: Cilic says Wawrinka's success at the Australian Open has given him renewed belief he can succeed

Speaking before Monday night's final Cilic told BBC Sport that Wawrinka's success at the beginning of the year had given other players a greater hope this season saying: 'Wawrinka opened the doors for us from the second group.

'Most of the guys have now bigger belief they can do it at the Grand Slams. It's a bit of a change-up year.'

Cilic's coach, Croatian Wimbledon 2001 winner Goran Ivanisevic, added on the match-up: 'It's going to be the first final for both of the guys,' added Ivanisevic.

'They're going to be nervous but whoever wins is going to be on top of the world - Mount Everest!'
