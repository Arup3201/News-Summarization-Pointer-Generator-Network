They star as lovers with a taste for the kinkier side of the bedroom in Fifty Shades Of Grey.

But as Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan unveiled the trailer for the movie on Thursday they couldn't help but admit the sex scenes for the BDSM fantasy were 'more of a task' than hot and steamy to film.

Dakota, daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, explained on The Today Show that simulating the racier scenes on set was not a 'romantic situation'.

The 24-year-old said: 'It's not, like, a romantic situation. It's more, like, technical and choreographed and less ...
 it's more of a task.'

Which got a rise out of her 32-year-old co-star, who plays Christian Grey, as he sighed heavily uttering a simple 'wow'.

Dornan was quick to point out that the pair had an undeniable chemistry while filming the project.

'We had chemistry!' The 32-year-old actor said they worked well together on set

'That's a big part of it ... having 
trust,' he explained.

'Because, you know, we got ourselves into situations 
that don't feel that sort of natural and they're not that easy and you 
need to have the trust there.'

But as far the version of the trailer shown on Today, they were both quick to point out that it was a heavily edited version that made it appropriate for breakfast TV.

Dakota, who plays Anastasia Steele, said she didn't really want her famous parents to see the film.

'If it were them doing a (sexy) movie I wouldn't want them to see that (either),' she explained humorously while laughing.

Fifty Shades Of Grey is an erotic romance novel written by EL James and has now been adapted for a film version set to hit theatres on February 13 2015.
