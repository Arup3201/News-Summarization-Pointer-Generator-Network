Tragedy: Luci Roussel was in Stratford, Quebec, when she stepped on a wasp nest on Sunday

The mayor of a Quebec town has died after being stung more than 15 times by a swarm of wasps while at her summer cabin on Sunday.

Luci Rouseel, 51, was vacationing at her lakeside home when she stood on the nest and was attacked by more than 15 wasps.

The mother-of-two leaves behind two children, age 19 and 18 and the citizens of Montreal suburb, La Prairie have been left stunned.

Laurent Blais, the town's deputy mayor, said that Rouseel was not allergic to wasp stings and everyone is in shock.

'Oh she was respected a lot,' said La Prairie resident Sylvie Trepanier to CTV.

'She was a wonderful woman and a fair woman and a woman of heart. She cared for us all those years.'

Experts who spoke to CTV said that sometimes an allergy is not revealed unless someone is stung within quick succession of each other.

Speaking to CTV, Dr. Joseph Shuster, an allergist at McGill University Health Centre, said dying from an insect sting is extremely rare.

The fact that Roussel was stung many times was porbably the reason why she passed away.

Her friend Reine Herbert said that she feels for her children, who also lost their father six years ago.

'I’m thinking about her family,' said Reine Hebert, a former colleague.

'They lost their father a few years ago. And it’s like, you can’t do that to the family…it’s so sad.'
