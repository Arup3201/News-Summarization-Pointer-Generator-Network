High end High Street brand French Connection likes to cause a stir.

Ever since the introduction of the FCUK logo caused national outrage in the 1990s the company has been building on its reputation as the naughty kid on the block and its new season images are designed to once again get people talking. And buying.

From Sketch to Store features images of naked models covered (just) in sketches of the brand's new season clothing next to images of the models then dressed in the real thing.

French Connection has teamed up with fashion photographer Rankin to create a racy new ad campaign

In one set of pictures a willowy blonde plays with a satchel, in another a muscular male model rubs his eye while wearing a beanie.

The concept is the brain child of renowned fashion photographer Rankin and his new creative agency, and was unveiled at a star-studded event at his East London studio last night.

Rankin, whose celebrity subjects have included Kate Moss, Kylie Minogue and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, created the pictures by photographing three models completely naked before illustrator Jo Bird sketched new season clothing designs on top of the prints. The models were then shot in the real pieces from the new autumn/winter collection.

The two-day shoot involved three models and illustrator Jo Bird who was on set to create instant sketches as the models posed

A spokesman for French Connection said: 'Our unique design process is pretty simple: collections godirectly from a designer’s sketch, to store. Based on this process, photographer Rankin and the team came up with a concept with a cheeky twist for our Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign.

'Our first shoot in black and white maintains French Connection’s irreverent sense of humour, which our customers have come to love and adore. The two-day photo shoot, saw our two female and one male model, having fun in Rankin’s London studio bringing a sense of relaxed ease and naturalness to the shoot. Jelly London's talented illustrator Jo Bird attended and got her inks out on set to begin workstraight away, on large scale prints.'

Rankin said: 'As our first 360 degree fashion campaign as an agency, The Full Service was incredibly excited when French Connection approached us to realise their AW13 campaign.

'I’ve always admired the brand for striving to push boundaries, and for their fearless approach to captivating campaign concepts.'

The concept was unveiled at a star-studded party at Rankin's East London studio on Wednesday
