Police have for the first time released photos of the couple who were jailed for breaking a baby girl’s legs and fracturing her skull, leaving her with permanent brain damage.

Grzegorze Lis, 35, was jailed for 10 years nine months last week for the attack on an eight-week-old girl which has left her blind and deaf and in need of around-the-clock care.

His partner Joanna Skrodzka, 22, will spend two years in jail for child cruelty after refusing to alert authorities while the child was left in agony for almost a week in a bid to protect Lis, St Albans Crown Court heard.

Hertfordshire Police released the pictures of the couple, who shared a flat in The Maltings, Hemel Hempstead, today.

The court heard last Friday that the injuries to the baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were inflicted by Lis.

Both the baby’s legs were broken at the lower shin area close to the ankles. Both thigh bones had also been broken.

Jane Bickerstaff QC, prosecuting, told how in March the girl - born just two months earlier - was attacked and violently assaulted by unemployed Lis on a number of occasions.

The child suffered a fractured skull caused by a massive impact injury and there was evidence that she had been violently shaken in a separate incident causing bleeding on the brain and leaving her starved of oxygen, which left her blind.

The child had been severely bitten on her left forearm by Polish-born Lis.

But Skrodzka, who is also Polish-born, turned a blind eye to the terrible pain the baby was suffering, the judge was told.

As a result, no medical help was given to the little girl.

It was not until almost a week later that staff at Watford General Hospital saw the baby for the first time and she was immediately transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

In passing sentence, recorder Amanda Tipples, who had presided over Skrodzka’s trial, told her: 'You failed to get any medical help for her even though you were aware something terrible had happened to her and she was unwell.'

She said a 'right thinking person' would not have waited more than five minutes once they was realised the child was ill.

Recorder Tipples said that she thought the injuries had been inflicted sometime between Thursday, March 1, or Friday, March 2, this year by Lis.

Lis was jailed last Monday for two offences of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the baby girl with intent and causing her actual bodily harm.    

During Skrodzka’s trial, expert evidence was given by a doctor that in 600 cases he had been involved in, this was one of the worst cases of brain damage he had ever seen where the child had survived.

The court heard how the child is now incontinent because of her injuries and will need 24-hour care for the rest of her life.
