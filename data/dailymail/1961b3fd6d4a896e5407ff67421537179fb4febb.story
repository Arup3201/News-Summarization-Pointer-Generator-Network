Police have confirmed that remains found on New York's Long Island this week are those of missing prostitute Shannan Gilbert, who vanished last December after fleeing a client's home in a panic.

Searchers found the bones on Tuesday morning in a dense wetland, not far from the neighbourhood where the 24-year-old disappeared in May 2010.

While the medical examiner has positively identified the remains, police have not yet determined the cause of her death.

The New Jersey woman went missing after 
fleeing from a client's home in Oak Beach. She was last seen racing into
the night, toward the marsh where her remains were discovered Tuesday.

Police began searching for her last 
December when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide
victims' remains.

They were strewn along several miles of thicket along
a parkway leading to Jones Beach.

Police have said that they believe Gilbert may have drowned 
accidentally while fleeing a client's home for an unclear reason.

Two weeks ago, a search turned up Gilbert's purse, containing her ID, cell phone and lip gloss, as well as her jeans and shoes.

The body was found about a quarter of a mile from where her belongings were found in an area with thick, overgrown brush.

The 24-year-old Gilbert was a prostitute who advertised her services on Craigslist

Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said: 'We went in with the idea we were going in one last time to see if we could find anything and we did.

'This is very tough brambled area, difficult to traverse, you can't walk through that area and this is why it has taken us so long to find.'

He said the location of the skeleton suggests that Gilbert may have been trying to flee across the wetland to a causeway.

He suggested that she had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which he called a 'tough, desolate, tangled mess'.

He said: 'The terrain would have made it impossible. Our people who were in there over the last few days had to cut through that brush and bramble area, before she was located.'

Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site.

Gilbert's disappearance prompted the investigation which led to five bodies found in burlap sacks on Gilgo Beach last December.

The bodies have been positively identified as prostitutes advertising on Craigslist.

Since then, five more bodies have been found which have yet to be identified.

Police said they think Gilbert's disappearance is unrelated to the other bodies but a single killer may be responsible for the ten dead.

Relatives of Megan Waterman and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose bodies were among the ten found, visited the scene on the first anniversary of the grisly discovery.

'It's been a living hell,' Waterman's mother Loraine Ela told reporters on Monday. 'It really is. Not a day doesn't go back where I don't think of Megan.'

Relatives of some of the murdered women are due to hold a vigil today from 2pm to 5pm to mark the anniversary of when their loves ones’ remains were found.

A police officer and his cadaver dog were following up on the disappearance of Gilbert when they came across the first set of human remains on December 11, 2010.

Two days later, three more bodies were found.

By April, the total had risen to 10 bodies, all strewn along several miles of Ocean Parkway, on a barrier island south of Long Island that leads to Jones Beach.

Authorities at first believed several people could be involved, but Police Commissioner Richard Dormer has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade.

The victims included eight women, an Asian man wearing a dress and a toddler.

Police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was wearing women’s clothing.

The toddler is believed to be the child of one of the prostitutes.
