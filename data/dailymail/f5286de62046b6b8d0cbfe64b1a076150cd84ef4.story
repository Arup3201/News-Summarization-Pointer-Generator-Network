Anne Dobson, 39, was jailed for two years and four months after stealing money from the families of three residents at the care home where she worked

A conwoman who used her job working at a care home to steal £116,000 from the families of vulnerable residents used it to pay for a lifestyle she could not afford.

Anne Dobson, 39, splashed £20,000 on a wedding ceremony, another £4,000 on the honeymoon, and bought herself a new car worth £16,000.

She tricked the families of three residents of Broomfield Grange Care Home, Essex, into paying their monthly bill of around £1,200 directly into her bank account.

She then passed the money on to her employer Embrace All Care Homes, but not before taking £400 from each bill for herself.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she began taking the funds in order to pay down debts she had racked up, but soon went on a spending spree than included a £1,000 holiday.

Andrew Jackson, QC, prosecuting, said: 'In 2013 she was marrying again and needed to pay for her wedding and she could not afford the sort of wedding she wanted so continued to defraud the company.

'She paid for her own wedding which she told police had cost about £20,000 and on top of that a honeymoon to the tune of £4,000, all of which were funded by the ongoing fraud.

'By 2013 she was on top of her debts and she freely admitted that it was to pay for the wedding.'

The 'simple' scheme worked like clockwork each month, the court was told, until one of the residents' families thought to question the amounts being paid. 

When interviewed by police, Dobson admitted her actions, telling officers she felt 'crap' for what she had done.

At one stage the mum from Witham, Essex, even wrote a £7,000 cheque to one resident in a bid to relieve her of her burden of guilt.

Mr Jackson added: 'It was a gross breach of the trust that the company placed in her.

'She played a leading role - she was the author of this fraud - there was an abuse of her position of trust and responsibility.'

Miss Penny Summers, mitigating, said Dobson was 'absolutely and thoroughly ashamed of herself' and had yet to tell her children of her actions.

She said: 'In the beginning, she was in financial difficulties - however she explained to me that there was no excuse for it ongoing.

Dobson (right) gave her personal bank details to three families, collected their monthly bills, skimmed £800 off for herself, then paid the rest to her employer. She then spent some of the money on a £20,000 wedding

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Dobson also paid £4,000 for a honeymoon, £16,000 for a car, and another £1,000 on a holiday. She also used the money to pay off debts

'The money was used to pay for her wedding and honeymoon.'

Dobson, who wore a black jacket and scarf, black skirt and knee-high black boots, sat with her head bowed in the dock listening to the evidence. She sobbed as she was sentenced.

Sentencing her to two years and four months in jail, Recorder Mark Ockelton, told her: 'You were not in debt at the time - it was committed in order to give you a lifestyle of the sort you thought you ought to have.

'£20,000 on a wedding, another £4,000 on a honeymoon, then you bought a new car for £16,000 and spent £1,300 on holiday and that still leaves tens of thousands of pounds unaccounted for.'

A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later this year in order to try to recoup some of the missing money. 

Dobson had joined the Embrace care company as a receptionist before being promoted to the role of administrator - a role which gave her access to residents personal files.

Mr Jackson said: 'It became plain that she has been syphoning considerable amounts of money.

'Her role was to update the company head office with regards to what residents or patients would be paying for care - that amounts having been agree with the residents and the care home.

'Once the fee for the care has been agreed, what should happened, by direct debit or standing order, the resident would pay weekly or monthly the required amount direct to the care home.' 

Dobson admitted a single charge of fraud between July 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014.
