Sitting at your desk feeling stuffed following an indulgent Easter weekend? Join the club.

A staggering 70 per cent of us chose to forgo any diets or attempts at healthy eating across the four-day Easter period, a new survey has revealed.

Despite the summer months fast approaching, the survey highlighted that this Easter weekend, Brits made indulgent food and drink the priority.

Remorse: A staggering 70 per cent of us let our diets slip this Easter weekend and are now embarking on our beach body countdown

The survey found that almost half of respondents (48 per cent) admitted that calorie-laden sweet treats like chocolate, hot cross buns and cakes were the thing they looked forward to the most at Easter - and 75 per cent of us confessed to bingeing on up to four chocolate eggs over the weekend.

Tellingly, only 10 per cent of people said that they looked forward to celebrating Easter for the religious aspects. This highlights the seismic shift in attitudes: a move away from a religious celebration to one more focused on indulgence - but without observing Lent beforehand.

A nation of chocoholics: Almost half of respondents admitted that calorie-laden sweet treats are the thing they look forward to the most at Easter - and 75 per cent of us confessed to bingeing on up to four chocolate eggs

The survey also found that over half (55 per cent) said that they stayed at home all weekend to indulge in food and drink and 23 per cent spent the weekend drinking alcohol.

An indulgent 35 per cent of us admitted to sinking 10 or more alcoholic drinks this weekend, and in stark contrast, only 9 per cent of people spent their weekend doing outdoor activities, revealed the survey by LighterLife.

In light of our overindulgence, today has been identified as the official date when many of us will start our beach body countdown.

Insecurities: Only 4 per cent of British women think that they have a good beach body with one in ten admitting they lack confidence in their body

With only three months until the majority of the UK begin their holiday season, the fear of fitting into swimwear sets in and women embark upon a mission to get ready to reveal (almost) all on the beach.

The research, by the Dukan Diet, revealed that only 4 per cent of British women think that they have a good beach body with one in ten admitting they lack confidence in their body.

Furthermore, 20 per cent of women will not go swimming or havenâ€™t in the past due to feeling embarrassed about what they look like in swimwear.
