A horse named Gerrard's Slip came third last in the 12.40pm at Doncaster on Saturday,  five minutes before Liverpool vs Chelsea kicked off at Anfield.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard can't escape the slip that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insisted  'gave the title to Manchester City' last year in the Barclays Premier League.

Gerrard's Slip and his trainer, B Smart, were 18-1 to win at Doncaster but ultimately took nothing from the six furlong race.

The horse is owned by Middleham Park Racing who appear to have a soft spot for Premier League champions City, with Kool Kompany and Captain Dunne also on their books. 

Mobsta, the favourite, won the race on a miserable-looking day in Doncaster, with Beardwood and Thahab coming second and third respectively. 

Gerrard gifted Demba Ba the goal that shattered dreams in the red half of Merseyside last year, but on Saturday Liverpool will be keen for revenge.

Mourinho began his mind games on Friday, saying Chelsea weren't bothered about the game that 'meant nothing to us' but everything to Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool.

Liverpool are yet to establish the form of last year that saw them  challenge for the title, as they currently sit 12 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea.
