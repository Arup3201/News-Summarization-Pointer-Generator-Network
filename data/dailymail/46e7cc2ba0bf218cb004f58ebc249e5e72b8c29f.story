An elderly patient is suing the hospital where she was left blind after the surgeon collapsed during her routine cataract operation.

Hazel Lockwood’s operation was halted when Jaheed Khan told colleagues that he felt dizzy, lay down on the operating theatre floor and said: ‘I am not fit to do it.’ 

It took 30 minutes to find another surgeon and the delay cost Mrs Lockwood her sight, according to legal papers lodged at the High Court.

The botched operation has had a devastating effect on the great-grandmother, say her family. Mrs Lockwood relied almost totally on the sight in her right eye as her left eye had been badly damaged in a childhood accident.

When specialists examined her right eye the next day, it was found to be ‘completely blind’.

Mrs Lockwood, 84, is suing the world-famous Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, which was in charge of her care, for more than £50,000.

The former secretary and mother of four had been reluctant to have the cataract operation because she was worried it could go wrong.

Although the cataract was slowly clouding her vision, affecting her ability to read small print and do crosswords, its impact was otherwise limited. But after her husband Denis had a successful cataract operation in April 2011, she finally agreed to go ahead with surgery.

That September, she went to the Moorfields Eye Centre at St George’s Hospital near her home in Tooting, South London, for surgery. It is one of the specialist hospital’s ‘district hubs’ and employs its own staff.

When she arrived, she was still ‘very worried’, according to the court papers. Mr Khan apparently tried to reassure her but in doing so, according to her lawyers, he neglected to outline the full risks of the operation. 

The surgery involves making a slit in the eye, taking out the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear plastic one.

The court papers claim: ‘Mr Khan nodded and smiled but did not engage in any discussion about the risks and benefits of the surgery.’

Mr Khan, who is deeply saddened that Mrs Lockwood has lost the sight in her right eye, denies the allegations, saying Mrs Lockwood was made aware of the risks of the surgery. He says he did engage in a discussion with her on the day of surgery. His position is that she was given a consent booklet several weeks before her operation and when she was asked if there were any outstanding questions or concerns there were none and she signed the consent form.

Mrs Lockwood then signed a consent form warning that the operation carried a one-in-1,000 risk of severe and permanent sight loss.

However, lawyers claim that because of Mrs Lockwood’s particular circumstances, the real risk to her was actually one in 333. Just minutes into the operation, Mr Khan ‘said he felt light-headed and dizzy with tightness across his chest,’ according to the court papers. 

They state that he ‘lay down on the floor’ and told a trainee surgeon: ‘You need to get a consultant surgeon now. You can’t do this one yourself. I am not fit to do it.’

Mrs Lockwood, who had received local anaesthetic but was conscious, then had to wait about 30 minutes for a qualified surgeon to arrive.

The consultant, Antonella Berry-Brincat, ‘noted that a large proportion of the intraocular contents were outside the eye’. 

She closed the cut with five sutures. Another surgeon arrived minutes later, ‘removed the remaining eye contents and sutured the eye closed’. Tests the next day showed Mrs Lockwood had no vision at all in that eye.

Her lawyers claim Mr Khan was exhausted because he had been overworked.

‘On the balance of probabilities,’ they claim, his collapse ‘occurred as a result of extreme fatigue caused by a work schedule which required him to work on Wednesdays from early morning until late in the evening without the opportunity to take regular breaks or to eat meals’.

Mrs Lockwood’s daughter Julia Laine, 53, said last night the operation had deeply affected her mother and the whole family. ‘It has completely stopped life as she knew it,’ she added.

The family was later told that because Mrs Lockwood had high blood pressure and was lying on the operating table with no lens, her eye ‘gel’ had leaked out.

Moorfields said: ‘It would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage as the claim is subject to ongoing legal proceedings.’
