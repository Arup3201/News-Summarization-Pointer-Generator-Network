Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. 

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. 

Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try.

Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations

Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match 

Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster

Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. 

After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side.

'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. 

Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20.  

All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey 

Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game.

Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . 

Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto. 

Patriotic: Harry chats to a member of the army - he announced this week he will quit the army in the summer

Pointing the way: The Prince is an avid rugby fan - England and Wales host the World Cup later this year

The Six Nations is the last competitive rugby tournament before England host the World Cup later this year.

The tournament begins on September 18 with England taking on Fiji at Twickenham.  

In 2014 Prince Harry was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which aims to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019.

Charismatic: The Prince - patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, jokes with the girls before a photo shoot 

He is also Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation.

Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. 

His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.
