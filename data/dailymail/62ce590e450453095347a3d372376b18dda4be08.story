Accused: Leeds United youth player Simon Lenighan is standing trial over the alleged rape of a woman in a city centre hotel

A Leeds United youth team player raped a drunk woman in a hotel after a night out and filmed the attack on a mobile phone, a court heard.

Simon Lenighan, 18, is alleged to have carried out the sex attack on the woman with another man, Nathan Campbell, 23, in the Etap Hotel in Leeds.

Leeds Crown Court heard the woman was woken by a chambermaid the next morning and had no idea where she was how she got there.

The court heard that Lenighan and Campbell had left and her mobile phone and money were missing.

Police were contacted and video footage was found on Campbell's mobile phone, the court was told.

Robin Mairs, prosecuting, said: 'What we say is both Campbell and Lenighan used their video phones to film (the woman) while she lay naked in bed.'

Mr Mairs said the men were laughing on the video but did not want to be seen on camera.

He added: 'This video, the Crown says, is more than simply a sordid souvenir of what happened in that hotel room. It is more than a lack of decency.'

Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice.

Campbell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape, one of sexual assault and perverting the course of justice.

Mr Mairs said Lenighan and Campbell met each other for the first time on the night of the alleged incident, August 29 last year, when they were drinking in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds.

The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men.

Mr Mairs said the girl had been drinking vodka and friends had been concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink.

The jury heard staff at the Etap, which is now the Ibis hotel, noticed that the woman was 'particularly drunk' and the two men appeared 'more sober' when they checked in at 4.15am.

One worker was so concerned that he followed them to the room and listened at the door but couldn't hear anything and left.

After they were arrested both men claimed the woman was a willing partner in the sexual intercourse that took place between them.

Mr Mairs said: 'If someone becomes so intoxicated, so drunk, that they no longer have the capacity to choose, then there cannot be any meaningful consent.'
