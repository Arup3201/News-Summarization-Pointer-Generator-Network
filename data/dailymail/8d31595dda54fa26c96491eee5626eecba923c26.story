Turkey's bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup is on the rocks over concerns about the environment.

Turkey are competing against Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain to host the biennial match between Europe and the US.

But the developments needed to the Montgomerie Maxx Royal, which was nominated as the Cup course and is this week hosting the Turkish Airlines Open – have been deemed too significant, with the removal of between 6,000 and 15,000 trees necessary to modify the infrastructure.

The Turkish sports minister, Akif Cagatay Kilic, said on Thursday that a new course and infrastructure will need to be built to accommodate the competition. The country is also considering a bid for the staging of the 2026 Ryder Cup.

‘Unfortunately the problem of hosting the Ryder Cup in 2022 is that the Montgomerie course is a resort course and not designed for a big scale golf tournament like a Ryder Cup or even a Turkish Airlines Open,’ said Ahmet Agaoglu, President of the Turkish Golf Federation.

‘If you notice there is not one grandstand on the golf course this week and there is just no place for them due to the enormous amount of trees.

‘We have calculated we would have to cut down 6,000 to 7,000 trees and something like 15,000 trees on the Faldo Course (at the nearby Cornelia) just to make way for everything that goes with hosting a Ryder Cup.

The event was held on the PGA Centenary Course, which was modified for the biennial showpiece 

‘All the trees are numbered and licensed and environmentally it would be impossible to get permission to cut them down.’

He added: ‘We estimate the Ryder Cup will cost Turkey between 100-200 million euros to host and we have shown our commitment to big tournament golf with the hosting again this week of the Turkish Airlines Open.

‘One way or another we will be hosting the European Tour's Final Series until 2023 - that will be the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey.

‘That gives us another nine years and along with the Challenge Tour event, we are already going to spend something like 70-85 million euros on these tournaments.

‘So together with this continued investment and the new Ryder Cup course we will build, that will cost an extra 30-40 million euros, it will show our commitment to European golf.’
