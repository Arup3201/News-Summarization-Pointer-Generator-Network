The car belonging to a Georgia couple who disappeared after traveling to meet a man claiming to sell a classic Mustang was found in a lake Monday with two bodies nearby.

Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said the bodies were found in the car 69-year-old Elrey 'Bud' Runion and his wife, 66-year-old June Runion, had been traveling in toward McRae, in southern Georgia. 

Steverson says the bodies have not officially been identified as the Runions and authorities have been in touch with the family. He said the car was found not far from McRae.

The grisly discovery came just hours after 28-year-old Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' was arrested in connection to the couple's disappearance and charged with giving false statements and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception.

Steverson says Towns, who surrendered himself to police earlier today, was the last person to speak with the couple by phone. 

During a press conference held Monday afternoon, Sheriff Steverson told reporters that Bud and June Runion's Champagne-colored 2003 GMC Envoy was discovered drowned in a lake.

Two bodies - a man and a woman - were found not far from the submerged vehicle.

‘It’s not the outcome we had hoped for, but obviously it’s one we have to deal with,’ said the sheriff, according to 11Alive Atlanta. 

He added that officers on the scene will collect evidence and analyze the vehicle and the bodies in order to find out what happened.

So far, Towns has not been charged with harming the Runion couple, but Steverson said he believes the 28-year-old had something to do with their disappearance.

Last Thursday, Bud Runion, a Vietnam War veteran, and his wife set out on a 180-mile journey from Marietta to McRae to meet a would-be seller of their dream car, a 1966 Mustang.

Drwam car: The missing couple's daughter say their father had wanted a 1966 Mustang ever since he had returned from duty in Vietnam in 1966

They were reported missing by their daughter after failing to turn up at her home to baby sit their grandchild.

The couple's last phone call was to Towns, police claim.

Daughter Virginia Owens said she became suspicious after her parents failed to show up to babysit her children on Friday and didn't answer their cell phone.

The couple were driving a champagne colored 2003 GMC Envoy and cell phone data shows they made it to McRae by Thursday evening.

Police say the phone number the Runions called traces back to a disposable cell phone, signals from which they are tracking in hopes of finding the couple.

Holding out hope: The bodies found Monday near the Runions' car have not been officially identified as the missing couple

A missing person's report has been filed with Cobb County police.

Owens and her sister, Stephanie Bishop, say the last conversation they had with their parents was one in which they had expressed excitement over the car.

They said their father had wanted the car ever since he returned from duty in Vietnam in 1966

the Runions' grown children have set up a Facebook page to assist in the search and provide updates.
