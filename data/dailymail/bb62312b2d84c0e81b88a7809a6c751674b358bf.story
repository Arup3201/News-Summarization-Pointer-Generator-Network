A man who proposed to his girlfriend by lighting 900 candles to spell out the words ‘will you marry me?’ has told how he feared he was in trouble with the police when a force helicopter spotted the romantic gesture.

Utpal Kanbia’s elaborate proposal to 22-year-old girlfriend Meena Rabadia was seen by the Metropolitan Police’s helicopter as it flew over Gladstone Park in Dollis Hill, north-west London, on Saturday night.

The 23-year-old electrician from Wembley has now revealed how he feared he may have been in trouble when the helicopter hovered overhead as he got down on one knee in the park where the couple had their first date six years ago.

Mr Kanbia, 23, got down on one knee in front of the 900 candles in London's Gladstone Park on Saturday night

The couple confirmed the proposal had gone to plan by uploading a photograph of them cuddling in front of the romantic etching onto an anonymous Twitter profile. They captioned the image with: 'She said yes!!!!'

He told LondonLive: ‘We heard the helicopter hovering overhead us and I started getting worried.

‘I started thinking “Are we allowed to do this sort of stuff in a public park? Are we breaking any laws?”

‘But to be honest we had everything covered in that sense. We had a standby fire extinguisher and water bottles in case it did get out of hand.’

Mr Kanbia’s proposal, which has seen him be dubbed the ‘most romantic guy in London’, went viral after Metropolitan Police shared an aerial picture of the flaming candles on its Twitter page.

Accompanied with the caption, ‘We think we have just seen the most romantic guy in north London’, the image was seen by more than 96,000 followers and retweeted by thousands.

On Monday, the couple – who remained anonymous until today – took to Twitter under a secret profile to confirm that the proposal had gone to plan and they were engaged.

Metropolitan Police posted an aerial image of the romantic proposal on its Twitter account @MPSinthesky after the aircraft's heat-sensitive camera picked up the flaming candles, the couple and the friends who helped

The force posted several photos to its 96,000 followers in the hope of finding the couple to give them the photos

However, they have now revealed their identity to speak about the proposal, which saw Mr Kanbia’s friends lay out the hundreds of tea lights while he brought his girlfriend to the park.

Miss Rabadia said she was delighted with her partner’s proposal and added: ‘He got down on his knees and he did it the way a man should do it.’

It is understood the couple are planning to tie the knot in November.
