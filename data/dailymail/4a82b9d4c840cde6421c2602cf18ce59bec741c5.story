Microsoft could face a multibillion-dollar fine after being charged with breaking EU competition rules.

The US software giant has been accused of failing to fulfill a pledge made three years ago to allow users of its flagship Windows software equal access to rival web browsers.

Microsoft had agreed to the condition in order to settle an EU investigation - and avoid a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual turnover.

But
the European Commission, which acts as competition watchdog in the EU, said the firm had failed to fulfill this agreement between February 2011 and
July this year.

The decision by Joaqu√≠n Almunia, the European Union's antitrust commissioner, opens the firm up to a substantial fine for defying the terms of the settlement - reached in 2009.

Mr Almunia warned that when a company enters into commitments - 'they must do what they are committed to do or face the consequences.'

'Companies should be deterred from any temptation to renege on promises or even to neglect their duty,' he told a news briefing.

He said he had also warned Microsoft about access to rival browsers on Windows 8, the latest version of the company's flagship product which will be released on Friday.

'We have been in contact with them regarding Windows 8. I have precisely transmitted ... what are my concerns, what kind of presentation should be avoided if they don't want to take the risk of a new investigation,' he said.

A sanction could top $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 - but the final figure is expected to be lower, as the infringement covered a relatively short period of time.

Microsoft, which has been penalised 1.36 billion euros ($1.76 billion) in the last decade for infringing EU rules, apologised.

It has four weeks to reply to the Commission's 'statement of objections.'

'Although this was the result of a technical error, we take responsibility for what happened, and we are strengthening our internal procedures to help ensure something like this cannot happen again,' the company said in a statement.

Mr Almunia told the briefing he had no reason to go after Microsoft's operating system for tablets, a market that includes rivals Apple and Google.

'We have looked at Windows RT and, on the basis of our investigation so far, there are no grounds to pursue further investigation on this particular issue,' he said.

The Commission said in July that several companies had accused Microsoft of only allowing its own Internet Explorer browser to be installed on devices running Windows 8 on Windows RT tablets.

With the Microsoft case heading for resolution, the next battle for the Commission is likely to be with Google, the target of complaints by Microsoft and more than a dozen other rivals over its core search engine business.

The world's most popular search engine is now in talks with the EU watchdog that could help it avoid sanctions which could amount to some $4 billion.
