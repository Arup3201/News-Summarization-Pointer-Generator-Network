Sarah Palin said she would 'baptize' terrorists by waterboarding them at a NRA rally on Saturday.

Palin was a speaker at the group's 'Stand and Fight Rally,' held at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

The Republican former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee's remarks followed her criticism of of policies she said were coddling to 'enemies that would annihilate America - they who'd obviously have information on plots to say, carry out jihad.

'Oh, but you can't offend them, can't make them uncomfortable, not even a smidgen.

Criticism: Sarah Palin criticized 'coddling' policies against America's and said if she were in charge she would baptize them through waterboarding

'Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists,' she said. Her remarks were met with loud applause.

As pointed out by Raw Story, Palin's remarks on Saturday differ strongly from those of her 2008 running mate Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

'In my personal experience, the abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence, but often produces bad intelligence because under torture a person will say anything he thinks his captors want to hear –- whether it is true or false –- if he believes it will relieve his suffering,' McCain said in 2011.   

Too harsh? Elsewhere in her speech, Palin said that gun-free zones are 'stupid on steroids'

Palin also criticized an 'intellectual 
elite in a far-distant capital' that she said wanted Americans to 
abandon Revolutionary War ideals.

She also implied that the government is trying to control the people.

'Look, if you control oil, you control an economy,' she said. 'If you control money, you control commerce. But if you control arms, you control the people and that is what they're trying.'

Elsewhere in her speech, she called the idea of gun-free zones as 'stupid on steroids' and dismissed the idea of gun stores being linked to crime.

'Gun stores are an accomplice to crime - and that fork made me fat,' she said.
