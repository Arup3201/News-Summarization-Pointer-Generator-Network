Bill Cosby's TV wife Phylicia Rashad has claimed she was misquoted in an interview discussing the mounting accusations against him - before claiming the allegations are just an orchestrated effort to keep him off television.

In an interview that was published on Showbiz411 on Tuesday, Rashad was quoted as saying 'Forget these women' - referring to the more than two dozen women who have stepped forward in recent months to accuse the comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting them. 

But in another interview that aired on Wednesday night, she told ABC that she had been misquoted.

'That is not what I said,' Rashad, 66, explained. 'What I said is, "this is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy".'

Denial: Phylicia Rashad said in an interview with Nightline on Wednesday, pictured, that she did not tell people to 'forget' Bill Cosby's accusers but instead wanted them to focus on his damaged legacy

She went on: 'I am a woman. I would never say such a thing. I would never think such a thing.'

Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable in the long-running Cosby Show, said she never saw anything inappropriate while they worked together and that Cosby's wife, Camille, would often visit the set.

So when she heard the first allegations against him, she was suspicious, she said.

'My initial reaction to the allegations was, "Hmm someone has a vested interest in preventing Cosby's return to network television",' she said.

Although she has not spoken to him recently, she said that no doubt the accusations have 'not been easy' for Cosby.

'I did talk to him towards the beginning of all of this and his comment was the internet has given some anonymous people a very loud voice,' she said.

'It's difficult for me to watch this legacy be erased, as if [it] never happened... I think in the hearts and minds of people he is still held in high regard.'

She also dismissed the suggestion that she was defending him so the show would continue to air and she would receive royalties. She said she no longer receives much money this way.

Her interview came after comments appeared on Roger Friedman's Showbiz 411 column on Tuesday, sparking uproar.

'Forget these women,' she was quoted as saying. 'What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated.'

Director Judd Apatow, who has posted a stream of tweets denouncing Cosby and those who have rushed to his defense, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Phylicia - how many women need to be raped before you realize he destroyed his own legacy? 40? 50? For me it's one.' 

After the outcry, Friedman published another post on Wednesday night saying he was removing the 'forget these women' line from his interview because he thought it had been misconstrued.

'I did not misquote Phylicia Rashad,' he said. 'But she didn't mean for it to be taken the way it was, and I should have punctuated... She meant, "those women aside" – as in, she's not talking about that, she's talking about Cosby's legacy being destroyed.'

Cosby's career unraveled after his accusers came forward, with a TV project halted and at least 10 stand-up comedy tour performances canceled or indefinitely postponed.

Anger: Outside the theater, in sub-freezing temperatures, crowds gathered to protest the comedian

The 77-year-old, who has been accused of drugging or sexual abuse by more than 20 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, has denied the allegations.

Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show from 1984 to 1992, earning a reputation as 'America's Dad,' has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations, and through his representatives he has denied them. 

A 2005 lawsuit by a Pennsylvania woman was settled before it went to trial. 

Scandal-plagued Cosby returned to the stage in Ontario on Wednesday night for the first time since November - and was met with empty seats and a sea of protesters brandishing signs reading: 'Rape is no joke.'

Wearing a sweater saying 'hello friend,' Cosby performed his set beneath two giant posters showing him with Nelson Mandela. There were no disruptions during the performance.

But as he was leaving the Centre In The Square Theatre following the performance, a heckler approached Cosby, who was well guarded by security and other entourage members.

'Congratulations on your first show of 2015. Talk about starting the year with a bang! We hope it was consensual, Billy!,' the man can be heard shouting out in a video captured by NBC. 

More voices: Three women who allege they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, Lynn Neal, Linda Kirkpatrick and 'Kacey' sit with lawyer Gloria Allred on Wednesday as they stepped forward to accuse him of attacks

The three performances in Canada come after Cosby saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour. 

He next appears at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Ontario, on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday.

Hours before he took the stage, attorney Gloria Allred said three more women are accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting them in Las Vegas or Los Angeles between 1981 and 1996.

Allred said at a news conference in Los Angeles that the accusations are too old for criminal charges or lawsuits.
