Queens Park Rangers are considering a loan swoop for LA Galaxy and Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane.

A three-month loan deal to Loftus Road during the MLS off-season could be on the cards for Keane with QPR manager Harry Redknapp due to meet owner Tony Fernandes this week to discuss it further.

Keane, 34, was last week named the MLS most valuable player and scored an extra-time winner on Sunday against New England Revolution to win a fifth MLS Cup for LA Galaxy.

Redknapp told the Express: 'The MLS market is one that we've got to look at.

'Robbie's a good shout, he's a good pro. He would be the ideal type to have around for sure because he would give us something.'

Keane played under Redknapp during his second spell at Tottenham Hotspur from 2009 to 2011.
