Links: The four horses are believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer Barney Curley

Bookmakers were estimated to have lost millions in just a few hours yesterday after four heavily-backed horses won at races across the country.

One bookie has estimated the losses could be as high as £15million, but other industry estimates have suggested about £2million could have been lost.

Each of the horses were believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer Barney Curley.

Bookmakers had been on red-alert from early morning after latching on to the well-backed quartet, all of which were returning from lengthy absences and struck at Lingfield, Catterick and Kempton.

A Paddy Powers spokesman told The Mirror the Irish bookmaker believed the industry could have lost £15m.

But David Williams, of Ladbrokes, said: 'It was a bad day at the office, nothing more and nothing less.

'We dodged most of the early morning frenzy but you can’t stop moving trains and we got caught up in some of it as the day panned out.

'Suggestions of a multi-million pound bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we’re not going to lunge for the violins just yet.

'Our decision not to price the Kempton races up until as late as possible helped protect us from the worst of it and we certainly weren’t exposed to any of the overnight business where most of the fancy prices were snapped up.

'We are satisfied that the systems we 
have in place at our end are sufficient to protect us as best we can 
from circumstances like today.

'Ultimately we have a responsibility to keep on top of the rumours and trade accordingly, which we managed to do.'

Coral’s David Stevens said: 'Although we avoided laying some of the larger prices overnight, we did see a number of multiple bets featuring these four horses both online and in shops, and throughout the day this number increased as word of the gamble that was taking place gathered momentum.

'Victory for all four horses has cost us a six-figure payout, and based on our losses we would estimate the industry has been hit for something in the region of £2million, which although still costly, is perhaps lower than some claims.'

Rory Jiwani for Stan James said: 'We 
had one punter who took £100k out of us before we slashed the odds. So 
it was a bad day, but not horrific by any stretch.'

Bet365
 priced up the races early, and any punter who got on with a £1 
accumulator bet at the reported prices relating to the four particular 
horses linked to Curley could have expected to pick up around £13,000, 
although not all firms marked up the races in the morning or overnight.

Curley could not be contacted by Press Association Sport.

The
 first horse to win was Eye Of The Tiger at Lingfield, who went off at 
Evens favourite having been at 20-1 the previous evening.

He had not run for 481 days and had not beaten a horse on his last four runs.

He was previously trained by Curley but is now in the care of Dan Donovan, who trains at a Curley-owned stable in Newmarket.

Mr
 Donovan, who denied any knowledge of the bets placed on Eye of The 
Tiger, said: 'We have had him seven months and have had problems with 
him but he is a genuine horse.'

bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we’re not going to lunge for 
the violins just yet'

The Lingfield stewards held an inquiry into the apparent improvement in form of Eye Of The Tiger.

Officials heard from Mr Donovan, who stated that the horse had been in his care for seven months having previously been trained by Curley and its absence from the track was due to back problems and a near fore tendon injury.

Having heard his evidence, and received comments from the handicapper, the explanation was noted and Eye Of The Tiger was ordered to be routine tested.

Like Eye Of The Tiger, the Sophie Leech-trained Seven Summits was a former Curley inmate and won its race at Catterick.

The 9-4 favourite, which had been off the track since finishing third in a novice event at Fontwell in June, won by a length and a half under jockey Paul Moloney.

Ms Leech’s husband, Christian, told Racing UK: 'He’s bandaged in exercise and when he’s in his stables and we just have to mind him very carefully, that’s why he’s got so few miles on the clock.

'I didn’t (have any money on). Someone just said that (there had been a gamble). He was 7-2, 4-1 in the paper anyway and Tony Carroll’s was very well fancied and that was a non-runner, so I’m not sure about that. I don’t know.'

Mr Donovan also trained the third leg of the accumulator, Indus Valley, who was sent off at 4-6 favourite on his first run for 700 days. He had also been available at 20-1 the night before the race.

Mr Donovan said: 'He only just scrapped into this race with his mark of 45 and I ran him here last year and he pulled way too hard. He has always shown ability but we were lucky the second just turned it in.'

He was also interviewed by the Kempton stewards, stating that Indus Valley had been trained on his own following a year’s break, as he was known to be a hard puller in his previous races, and was better suited by being dropped back to six furlongs. The explanation was noted and the gelding ordered to be routine tested.

The gamble was completed by John Butler-trained Low Key at Kempton who was returned the 7-4 on favourite on his first start since finishing seventh of seven over two miles at Southwell last February.

Quizzed by the stewards, Mr Butler stated that Low Key had been gelded since its last run and had benefited from the drop in class. His evidence was noted and the horse routine tested.

William Hill said it saw trickles of money for some of the runners on Tuesday night, coupled with new accounts opening and various permutations attempted across the group of runners, but estimated only a £200,000 group-wide pay-out.

British Horseracing Authority spokesman Robin Mounsey said: 'We were aware of, and have been monitoring, the situation today. In the cases of those horses who have shown an improvement in form an inquiry was held by the stipendiary stewards and all horses were routine tested.

'It is BHA policy not to comment on specific investigations or speculation surrounding potential investigations, however an investigation would only occur if there is any evidence of Rules being breached.'
