Dan McNamee, guitarist from Australian band Art Vs. Science, is campaigning for drugs sniffer dogs to be banned from music festivals because he claims they cause panic induced overdoses.

McNamee argues the Liberal government need to stop ‘taking their marching orders from police’ to make sure the health and well being of festival goers is the priority.

He said: ‘We need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health. We need non-politicians and people, maybe like me, to think of solutions that aren’t about force, rules and restrictions.

'We’re a nation descended from convicts, we’re going to break the rules!'

McNamee argues that less forceful solutions would be more effective.

'The problem with the Liberal government is that they’re taking their marching orders from the police, much like the lock out laws. That results in solutions that are about violence and power. Ask police how to fix the problem and they will naturally say ‘more tasers, more restrictions, more dogs’ to try and get more power to do what they do best.'

On Monday, McNamee posted an open letter on Facebook to almost 90,000 followers, hoping to take action to ‘reduce dangerous drug taking practices’, arguing that the use of sniffer dogs contributes to the misuse of drugs at music festivals.

In the letter, McNamee asks to trial a ban on drug detection dogs from this year’s Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay, in Northern New South Wales.

He hopes the decision will potentially decrease the number of people hospitalised for drug use.

McNamee argues that sniffer dogs cause the potentially fatal ‘panic-induced overdose.’

In 2009, 17-year-old Gemma Thoms died at the music festival Big Day Out in Perth of a drug overdose.

According to her friend, she swallowed ecstasy tablets out of 'fear' of being detected by sniffer dogs.

McNamee says that the use of sniffer dogs by police isn’t just ineffective; it’s also harmful.

‘We shouldn’t be creating fear and risking lives, trying to stop behaviour that simply will not stop. Sniffer dogs don’t stop people doing drugs at the festival ground. If the concern is to prevent drug taking, why not look into the use of drug testing stations, like in Spain?”

McNamee's open letter was addressed to Don Page, the local minister for Ballina in Northern New South Wales, the region where Splendour in the Grass will take place next week from from July to 27.

Today, Mr Page confirmed he received the letter on July 2 of this year, and that he has approached the Federal government with the proposal.

'I passed on his request to the Ministers for Police and Health respectively for their consideration and response. I have no response from either Minister at this stage.'

The Australian Drug Foundation’s National Policy Manager, Geoff Munro supports McNamee’s argument that there are risks with using sniffer dogs.

'Sniffer dogs, while they may be a deterrent for some people who might carry drugs into an event have the potential to scare people and may make them panic.

'Reports on high hospitalisations from people swallowing their drugs to avoid detection concern us greatly.'

Mr Munro is backing the proposed trial, to make safety at festivals the main concern.

He says: “We would support police and festival organisers using other measures to keep festival goers safe and healthy during the event…

'The Australian Drug Foundation knows the reality is that many people take drugs at musical festivals, so we need to work together to make sure people come home safely.'

Art Vs. Science is due to perform at next week’s annual Splendour in the Grass festival for the fifth time.

He speaks frankly about his observations of the drug culture and music festivals.

'At this point, it’s clear that people are going to do drugs at festivals no matter what, so we have to do everything we can to keep them safe.

'We need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health. We need to value people’s lives more than we are.'Mr McNamee says drug use has become an inevitable part of music festival culture.

‘I’m not apologising for drug use, but the reality is drugs have become an ingrained part of the festival culture.

'The more police crack down, the more festivals are affected. People will stop going. An example of that is how Big Day Out’s going under and we’re starting to see more underground festivals.'

Dan McNamee says people need to be more proactive than just ‘liking’ the post on Facebook. McNamee urges Australians to take the debate away from the screen and contact members of government.

'A proper democracy is about having a debate. Today I found people have liked my letter, but then go off and forget about it.

'That doesn’t do much, that's not the point. Democracy only works when constituents are constantly in touch with their local members, but people have a rant on Facebook or call up talkback radio and that satisfies them.'

McNamee hopes that new strategies will be considered to potentially create a safer environment at music festivals.

'What I want is to open up logical debate, so based on evidence we can work out the safest option. Having a trial will at least give us some numbers to work with.

'Some say removing sniffer dogs from festivals will make people take more drugs. I'm not sure, but if it results in less hospitalisations then it's a positive thing.'
