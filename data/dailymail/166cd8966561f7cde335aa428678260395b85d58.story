Harry Kane's goalscoring debut came as little surprise to his England team-mates, with Phil Jones expecting nothing less from the 'on fire' striker.

A sold-out Wembley witnessed the latest chapter of the 21-year-old's fairytale rise, which has seen him go from Tottenham squad player to the country's most lethal frontman in just a matter of months.

Kane was welcomed by a standing ovation when he came on as a second-half substitute and it took just 80 seconds for him to get the fans back on their feet, heading home with one of his first touches to wrap up a 4-0 win against Lithuania.

After the Euro 2016 qualifier centre-back Jones was asked whether he was surprised by Kane's goalscoring impact, to which he responded with a laugh: 'No!

'He has been doing it in training as well this week. He is on fire and we're delighted for him.

'He has been brilliant this season. He thoroughly deserved his call-up and the lads are delighted for him in the dressing room to score his first goal. He has been lively, he is a great lad and he has been scoring a lot of goals.'

The victory against Lithuania continued England's 100 per cent start to Group E - a cake walk which makes Tuesday's friendly in Italy an important test.

The Three Lions have won seven successive matches since returning embarrassingly early from the World Cup and have a chance to lay some ghosts to rest against a side they lost to in Brazil.

'That will be a big test for us,' Jones said. 'We're going to Turin, it is a big stadium, a big crowd. It is always a tough game against Italy. We're going there wanting to win the game.

'We highlighted that (we are on an impressive run) in the pre-match talk, that we want to keep that run going and hopefully we can do that in Turin as well.'
