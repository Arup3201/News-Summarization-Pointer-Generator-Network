A derelict block of public toilets certainly doesn't jump to mind when thinking of your ideal holiday home - yet these crumbling conveniences on the Cornish coast could fetch a staggering £100,000, thanks to the stunning view.

The 502 sq ft block, which looks out over St Austell Bay and its historic harbour, would make the perfect getaway for one lucky bidder, auctioneers have claimed.

Of course, the toilets, in Charlestown, on the south coast, will need a revamp at least - if not completely rebuilding.

Auction: This block of toilets on the south Cornish coast could fetch £100,000 last this month

Stunning: The view across St Austell Bay make it one of the best residential opportunities in Cornwall today, according to Graham Barton, auctioneer and regular on BBC One's Homes Under The Hammer

The block is being auctioned later this month and has a freehold guide price of £75,000 to £95,000 - a bargain in the small town, where the average property price is £260,400, according to property website Rightmove.

Plymouth-based Graham Barton, auctioneer and regular on BBC One's Homes Under The Hammer, said: 'This is arguably the most gloriously located residential development opportunity for sale in Cornwall today.

'It has stunning panoramic and jaw dropping sea views. The property looks southwards across St Austell Bay with the historic harbour at its western edge.

'We are expecting strong interest at auction as there is huge potential for a fantastic family home or holiday home with extension or complete replacement among the options subject to planning consent.'

The auction, by Clive Emson, will take place at the St Mellion International Resort, near Saltash, at 11am on Thursday, March 26.
