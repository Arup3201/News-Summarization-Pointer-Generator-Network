Grace Dunham, the younger sister of  Lena Dunham appears to have finally responded on Twitter to claims that she was molested as a child by the Girls creator.

They appear to address a claim by right-wing website Truth Revolt last week, accusing her older sister of sexual abuse. 

The website  cited an excerpt Lena Dunham's recently-published collection of personal essays 'Not That Kind of Girl' as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'.

In the extract Lena writes about looking at her one-year-old sister's vagina out of curiosity when she was seven. 

Today her Grace apparently condemned the article in a series of tweets.

Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. 

She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.'

While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world.  

The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 

'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1.  

The passage that Truth Revolt called out details a conversation Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs.

In the course of the conversation, 7-year-old Lena then asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 

'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds

'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes 

'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.

'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”

'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 

'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' 

Truth Revolt  responded excerpted the essay and other parts of her the book in an article titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'  

The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” 

In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' 

They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. 

Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published.

The website has refused to apologize for the article, and it still appears prominently on their home page.
