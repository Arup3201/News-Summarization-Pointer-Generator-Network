It was launched to great fanfare as the much-sought-after solution to noise and air pollution on the streets of Paris.

But the French capital's new car-sharing programme was dealt a rather embarrassing blow when one of its silent electric cars knocked over a pedestrian - because she apparently didn't hear it coming.

Police say the woman was struck as she crossed Rue Taine in the city's 12th Arrondissement yesterday, just hours after the Autolib' program got up and running.

Too quiet? A car from the Autolib' vehicle-sharing program in Paris like the one which knocked down a pedestrian because she apparently didn't hear it

Unfortunate: The accident happened as the pedestrian stepped into road in Rue Taine (pictured) in the 12th Arrondissement

It is believed the pedestrian walked into the road against the light. She was taken to Saint-Antoine hospital with pain in the hip, shoulder and bruises to her face, but her injuries were not life-threatening.

The Mayor of paris, Bertrand Delanoe, who launched the Autolib' programme, said it was an unfortunate accident and there was no evidence to suggest a connection between the crash and the fact the car was silent.

Autolib' was built on the success of the city's bike rental scheme - much like the 'Boris Bikes' in London - in an attempt to reduce noise and air pollution.

Paris claims it is the biggest programme of its kind - 250 vehicles went out on the streets yesterday, while 2,000 are expected by next summer and 3,000 within the next two years.
