Accident: Lord Vestey, one of Britain’s richest men and a close friend of the Royal Family, was taken to hospital after the riding accident

The Queen’s Master of the Horse has been injured falling from his saddle.

Lord Vestey, one of Britain’s richest men and a close friend of the Royal Family, was taken to hospital after the riding accident.

Buckingham Palace yesterday said the Queen was being ‘kept informed’ of the situation.

Multi-millionaire Lord Vestey, 71, attends important ceremonial occasions as the man responsible for the Royal Mews and the Queen’s carriages and horses.

He is the third Great Officer of the Royal Household and has held the title Master of the Horse since 1999.

His duties include being present at the State Opening of Parliament and he was due to be on horseback at next month’s Trooping the Colour.

The former chairman of Cheltenham racecourse watched the 2011 Derby with the Queen at Epsom and accompanied her at Cheltenham in 2009.

He is regularly photographed with the monarch at equestrian events and was alongside her at the Royal Windsor Horse Show earlier this month.

The Vesteys, who own the 6,000-acre Stowell Park Estate in Gloucestershire, were among the guests in St Paul’s Cathedral for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

The Vestey family has an estimated £750million fortune through the family meat business, Vestey Foods Group.

The company – which once owned Dewhurst butchers – has been privately owned since it was founded in 1897 by brothers William and Edward Vestey.

Two months ago it was drawn into the horsemeat scandal after it emerged that it supplied products contaminated with horsemeat to one of the world’s biggest catering companies.

Lord Vestey falls at a fence in Hickstead in 1975. The Queen has been informed of his latest accident

It sold minced beef and minced halal beef to Sodexo which supplies hospitals, schools and the Armed Forces.

Lord Vestey is also a close friend of Prince Charles and his wife Cecilia is Prince Harry’s godmother.

She nearly died when she suffered a serious stroke in 1995. Lord Vestey was told by doctors at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, that his wife had less than a one in ten chance of survival.

She recovered after neurosurgeons removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball from her brain and said afterwards it was the support of her husband that gave her the strength to recover.

‘He is my hero,’ Lady Vestey said. ‘He was a tower of strength.’
