A man who collects DeLorean cars has transformed the classic Back To The Future vehicles into a monster truck, a limousine, a hovercraft, a convertible and a Time Machine Replica.

Rich Weissensel, a software engineer from Chicago, Illinois, is fanatic about the two-door sports car and owns five custom creations - including a stretched DeLorean Limousine - and three stock DeLoreans.

The 50-year-old has re-modeled the stainless-steel shape of the iconic cars into bizarre and brilliant automotive creations in an ongoing, 14-year series of projects.

Fanatic: Rich Weissensel, a software engineer from Chicago, Illinois, is fanatic about the two-door sports car and owns five custom creations (pictured)

Stretch of the imagination: The DeLorean limousine stretches the length of a school bus with six distinctive gullwing doors and uses parts from as many as six different damaged cars

Monster motor: Rich's first custom creation - a huge monster-truck, dubbed the D Rex, is based on a 1981 DeLorean's body but mounted onto the running gear of a 1979 Chevrolet K5 Blazer SUV

The projects started after Rich met the car's founder John DeLorean at the Cleveland DeLorean Car Show in 2000 and showed him some of his ideas and sketches.

Rich's first custom creation - a huge monster-truck, dubbed the D Rex, is based on a 1981 DeLorean's body but mounted onto the running gear of a 1979 Chevrolet K5 Blazer SUV.

The huge hybrid is fitted with custom wheels and 44-inch tall tires, twice the size of the average cars and a V8 motor.

The Time Machine Replica: The car enthusiast will only use damaged DeLoreans for his projects, as there were under 10,000 of the DMC-12 model ever made before the company went bankrupt.

The convertible: He said, 'I have so many different ideas for custom DeLoreans, I'm not sure if time, money or age will stop me from building them but as long as I'm able I'll continue to build them'

Rich said: 'Even though the monster truck is a huge project, it actually only took me and my team a month to build it.

'We married the two vehicles together, DeLorean body and 4x4 chassis, and then we did a few monster-sized upgrades.'

The DeLorean limousine stretches the length of a school bus with six distinctive gullwing doors and uses parts from as many as six different damaged cars, all on a custom fabricated, stainless steel stretched frame.

His hero: The projects started after Rich met the car's founder John DeLorean at the Cleveland DeLorean Car Show in 2000 and showed him some of his ideas and sketches

The original: His DeLorean obsession pre-dates the Back to the Future movies to when he first saw the DeLorean prototype as a young man in the 1980s (pictured, in a scene from 1990's Back the the Future III)

It is 26 feet long and it took Rich several years to acquire all the parts needed from numerous damaged DeLoreans.

Rich said: 'It's got three pairs of gull wing doors, so we have six fully operational doors on there, and having six standard-sized gullwing doors has never been attempted, as far as I know, on any kind of limousine.

'Probably for good reason, since gullwing doors are very difficult to try to align exactly right.'

Rich from Chicago, Illinois, built a custom hovercraft using the stainless steel panels of the DeLorean and a hovercraft cushion which allows the DeLorean to float over any surface.

Rich said: 'My friends all know me as the guy with the DeLorean, all my co-workers know me by the guy with the DeLoreans.

'My family obviously knows I've been rather obsessed with DeLoreans since I bought my first one back in 1985.

'I have so many different ideas for custom DeLoreans, I'm not sure if time, money or age will stop me from building them but as long as I'm able I'll continue to build them.'
