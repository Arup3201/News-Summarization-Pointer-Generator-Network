Twitter users were facing another day of disruption today as the firm struggled to fix issues that have locked millions out of their accounts.

Users of the firm's Android apps were unable to use the service at all, while many reported tweets appeared to be set to the wrong date.

Twitter acknowledged the issue in a post on its Status blog last night.

Users of the firm's Android apps were unable to use the service at all, while many reported tweets appeared to be set to the wrong date.

Experts believes the problems was related to Twitter's servers being set to the wrong date due to a bug in the code they run. 

Twitter said the issue 'was due to a bug in our front end code, which has been patched'.

The issue 'was due to a bug in our front end code, which has been patched', the company said, and apologised for the problems. 

Many users were locked out of Twitter on Saturday, too, with tweets not showing up on feeds or the site failing to load at all.

'Something is technically wrong,' the microblogging service's welcome page said on Sunday. 

'Thanks for noticing?we're going to fix it up and have things back to normal soon.' 

Users also reported problems on Twitter apps for Android and iPhone smartphones, with tweets via TweetDeck showing up as having been posted a year ago. 

The initial outage began around noon on Sunday, and lasted until 5.25pm.

Experts believes the problems was related to Twitter's servers being set to the wrong date due to a bug in the code they run. 

However, some users reported problems this morning as well, although is was unclear if they were related to the same issue.

Earlier this month the firm overhauled the way users report abuse and harassment on the social media platform.

Following major problems with online 'trolls', it has now made it far simpler to block and report people.

The company said it will now require less information from users flagging inappropriate content and that it will be easier to submit tweets and accounts for review, even when wrongful behaviour is simply observed and not received directly.
