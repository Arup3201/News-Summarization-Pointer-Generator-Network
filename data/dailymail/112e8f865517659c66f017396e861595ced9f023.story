Britain will carry on shivering its way into spring with snow and sub-zero temperatures over the next few days.

But winter will feel well and truly left behind by the weekend as temperatures are expected to reach a balmy 13C (55F).

Parts of the country were battered by snow showers and freezing conditions yesterday, making driving perilous.

And forecasters last night warned that there is more bad weather to come this week – with plummeting temperatures expected to bring a fresh flurry of blizzards today.

Freezing temperatures will persist tomorrow with a low of -3C (27F) in the South. And parts of north-west England and Wales are expected to wake up to at least two inches of snow. However, that will all change this weekend as temperatures leap by as much as 15C (59F). By Friday the mercury is set to rocket to a maximum of 13C (55F) in the South and 12C (54F) in the North.

Forecaster Gemma Plumb, from MeteoGroup, said: ‘From the weekend and going into next week, we’re going to see a high-pressure system sitting across much of the UK. That will bring mainly dry and fine conditions, with some risk of rain in the North West.’

And Met Office forecaster Kate Brown said: ‘Any chance of terrible wet and windy weather for the rest of the month looks small. It will be colder at nights but temperatures will stay closer to average for this time of year.’

Yesterday north-west England and Northern Ireland saw several inches of snow as Manchester dropped to -1C (30F). In London, though, it was a brisk 5C (41F) with bright sunshine a hint of the warmer week

Photographs taken across the UK this morning show cars abandoned at the side of the road as drivers in northern and western parts of Britain struggled against poor visibility and icy conditions.

One car was seen flipped over on the side of the M6 in Cumbria today, where people woke up to blankets of snow and colder-than-average temperatures. And in Birmingham, people were forced to carry umbrellas as plunging temperatures caused showers to turn snowy.

Commuters in Stowmarket, Suffolk, were faced with blizzard conditions as they drove to work, whilst others in Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire also saw snow flurries. 

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for snow and ice from 6pm today to 10am tomorrow in Northern England, Northern Scotland and Western Scotland. Some areas could see 3cm of snow and up to 8cm is expected on higher ground.  

Though it is not yet known how much snow has fallen across Britain, forecasters predicted yesterday than around 4in of snow may fall over the Pennines and the Scottish Highlands on land above 1,300ft (400 metres). And 2.4in of snow was forecast to fall in western Britain. 

While daytime temperatures mean that it is unlikely snow will settle over the course of the day, more is expected to fall as temperatures plummet tonight.  Northern Scotland is expected to see the worst of the cold weather, with forecasters predicting readings of -1C in some areas.

It means parts of the country that see snow today could wake up to snow on the ground tomorrow, according to Met Office forecasters.

Spokeswoman Laura Young said: 'There is a little bit more to come, definitely for the first part of the week.' 

But she said warmer weather was expected by Wednesday and Thursday, with parts of southern England seeing temperatures reaching double figures.

Bands of higher pressure mid-week will mean that there is less rain or snow by Wednesday. But clearer skies will also herald colder overnight temperatures - with the last frost for a while expected on Thursday morning.

Despite the wintry weather this week, the country has experienced a very mild few months. Provisional Met Office statistics show that the UK has had its sunniest winter in records dating back to 1929. 

The weekend weather will see a divide between the north and south. People in the north and north-west can expect it to be cloudy and windy with outbreaks of rain, while in southern England it will be generally drier with good sunshine. 

'There will be a wintry feeling today and Tuesday, but as we head towards the weekend temperatures will gradually go up to the mid-teens,' said Helen Roberts, of the Met Office.

'It will be quite a contrast to the start of the week, we will generally see temperatures of 12 or 13C but there may be the odd 15C in isolated areas in the South.'
