A model famous for a second place in Brazil's popular Miss Bumbum-competition is fighting for her life in intensive care after a botched cosmetic surgery.

Andressa Urach, is in a 'serious condition' in a hospital in the southern city of Porto Alegre after removing gel from her thighs, which had previously been injected for cosmetic purposes.

The 27-year-old's surgery wounds became infected following a second operation to drain her thighs  and she is currently being sedated, her mother Marisete De Favari said. 

Botched surgery: After discovering that the fillers in her legs were causing her leg muscles to rot, Miss Urach made several attempts to 'drain' the thighs, but instead they became infected

Miss Urach tweeted this picture from her hospital bed at the weekend, but her condition worsened on Tuesday and she went into septic shock

Miss Urach came second in the 2012 Miss Bumbum competition, which scours Brazil for the most attractive behind in the land. 

Ahead of the competition, Miss Urach, who hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim he strenuously denied, had injected two types of 'body fillers', hydrogel and PMMA, into the upper legs to fill out the thighs and lift her bottom.  

In July this year the model discovered that the products were causing her leg muscles to rot, leaving her in excruciating pain.

In an interview with Brazil's R7 website, she said: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot.

'That's why I am feeling such strong pains. I'm taking morphine every four hours and antibiotics to alleviate the suffering.'

All personality: Miss Bumbum runner-up Andressa Urach, underwent surgery to remove two types of 'bodyfillers' which she had injected into her legs to enlarge her bottom and thighs

Miss Urach underwent an operation in July to drain 400ml of hydrogel from each leg, but the model continued to complain of discomfort and pain.

On Saturday she was rushed to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg.

She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures on Sunday and Monday, according to reports. 

On Tuesday, Miss Urach went into septic shock and was taken to the intensive care ward, where she remains sedated in a 'serious' state.

The thigh augmentation surgery was one of at least nine cosmetic procedures the Miss Bumbum runner-up had done in the last five years, according to reports.

They included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, boob job, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction.

A friend of Ms Urach, who didn't want to be named, said the TV presenter had been unable to perform physical exercises for four months.

She said: 'She was always in a lot of pain. She knew that the liquid was dripping inside of her and she didn't want to use shorts or miniskirt.'

Another Miss BumBum contestant, Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said: 'Everyone is in a state shock.

'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. We were slaves to beauty.'

Ms Urach's agent, Cacau Oliver, who is also the creator of the Miss BumBum competition, on Monday night asked fans of the model to pray for her.

He said: 'We are all praying fervently, now is the time to pray.'

And Ms Urach's mother, Marisete De Favari, who hasn't left her daughter's bedside, last night thanked fans or their messages of support but asked the to keep praying.

She wrote on her Facebook page: 'A beautiful, intelligent woman, a girl full of dreams, who has fought to get where she is, who never gave up even though nothing was easy, who just wants the best for her family, a girl who fears God.

'For this, I am certain, by by faith, that she will be cured. Thank you all from the heart and I ask that you keep praying, because this will be one more fight and my baby will come through it victorious.'

Miss Andressa infuriated Real Madrid striker Ronaldo in April last year by claiming he had cheated on girlfriend Irina Shayk with her.

She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund.

The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.'

He accused Andressa in a statement of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel she claimed they made love at for an interview with a reporter.

The pretty brunette greeted him wearing only a coat of patriotic Portuguese red and green body paint when he arrived at his country's base camp hotel in Caminas near Sao Paulo at the start of the World Cup in June.

Six days later she was ejected from Portugal's public training session at a nearby football stadium and told to stay away from the Real Madrid star.
