The app-based car service Uber has called on the NSW government to implement the 'illegal' ride-sharing platform in a bid to make it a permanent transportation option.

It pledges to create thousands of jobs for drivers, and customers who use their ride-sharing service UberX will get cut-price fares by taking trips in private cars driven by available drivers in their area.

The submission by the company to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal review said it's services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers' as well as offering job opportunities to areas of high unemployment rates in Sydney.

Uber's Senior Vice President David Plouffe announced on Tuesday that the company is committed to creating 20,000 new job opportunities in Australia this year

'When comparing the areas Uber partners live and the unemployment rate in certain regions, it is clear they come from those areas where unemployment and under-employment are high,' the company said.

'Uber is helping to provide flexible economic opportunities for people who have previously not had access.

'In New South Wales Uber does not accept any partner that has any Australian criminal history recorded with CrimTrac or who has had their license suspended or has any record of a drink or drug driving record in NSW.'

But a Transport for NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that it is illegal for drivers in NSW to participate in 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX.

'While Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, drivers transporting passengers for a fare do,' the Transport for NSW spokesperson said.

'Any driver operating in these circumstances are potentially committing a number of offences, including driving without authority and offering a service without accreditation.

'Ride-sharing is a significant issue that - as we have said - needs to be worked through including via consultation with customers and industry, and nothing has changed.

'The safety of customers must be paramount in those discussions. Compliance activities will continue, to ensure the safety of passengers.'

The submission, which was made last month, said NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian had refused to meet with representatives of Uber.

However, Uber's Senior Vice President David Plouffe announced on Tuesday that the company is committed to creating 20,000 new job opportunities in Australia this year.

'Thousands of Australians have already found flexible work driving on the Uber platform. These partner-drivers are made up of a broad range of people including retirees, students, or mums and dads looking to supplement their income,' he said. 

Mr Plouffe explained that Uber will help people 'earn a good income quickly'

'We also have people who have found themselves unemployed but still need to pay the mortgage and provide for their families and Uber has provided them a way to earn a good income quickly. 

'We are setting ourselves a challenge which we believe we can achieve through partnership with governments and organisations who share our vision of opening up economic opportunity in every city.' 

An Uber spokeswoman has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the company is in 'constructive dialogue' with the government and 'have now met with Minister Berejiklian' but could not comment further on the matter. 

Uber said their services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers'

Uber's director of public policy Oceania Brad Kitschke wrote in the submission that '100 percent of partner drivers who passed Uber's background checks were subsequently able to obtain government authority from the Roads and Maritime Service'.

The Transport for NSW spokesperson added that: 'Roads and Maritime Service has issued 33 infringement notices totalling $28,500 to Uber X drivers. Additionally, 10 court attendance notices have been issued.'
