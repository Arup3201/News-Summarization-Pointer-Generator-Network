The chambers led by leading Left-wing 'celebrity' barrister Michael Mansfield QC is closing down, blaming Government cutbacks to legal aid

The chambers led by leading Left-wing ‘celebrity’ barrister Michael Mansfield QC is closing down, blaming Government cutbacks to legal aid.

A spokesman for Tooks Chambers said the reforms were ‘devastating’ and ‘threatening the rule of law’.

It comes after a revamp was announced in April to slash £220million from the £1billion a year criminal legal aid bill.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also wants to cut the fees paid to fat cat lawyers, reducing payments by 30 per cent in ‘very high cost cases’ that last more than 90 days.

Tooks Chambers last night attacked Mr Grayling’s policies, despite admitting that 90 per cent of its barristers’ work is funded by public money.

A statement on the firm’s website announced its dissolution ‘with great regret’.

It added: ‘The dissolution of Chambers is the direct result of Government policies on legal aid. The public service we provide is dependent on public funding.’ 

The firm will cease operations on October 11 before being formally dissolved on December 27.

However, it said it will try to develop ways of supporting publicly-funded lawyers who are ‘committed to continuing the struggle for social justice’.

Self-styled ‘radical lawyer’ Mr Mansfield has benefited from legal aid throughout his lengthy career.

He was paid £743,421 during the Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday, which cost taxpayers £195million. 

He has also been involved in some of Britain’s most significant legal cases, including Stephen Lawrence, the Birmingham Six, Jean Charles De Menezes and the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster.

Mr Mansfield, currently representing the family of Mark Duggan at the inquest into his death, declined to comment further yesterday.

However, a Ministry of Justice spokesman last night said the legal sector ‘cannot be immune’ from efforts to get better value for taxpayers’ money.

Before the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act came into effect the highest-paid QCs were making £500 a day for advocacy, plus up to £150 an hour for preparation work.

Prisoners will also be restricted from accessing legal aid as well as households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more under the reforms.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman added: ‘We have one of the best legal professions in the world but cannot close our eyes to the fact legal aid is costing too much.

‘All businesses have to consistently innovate and adapt to changing circumstances to remain successful.

‘At a time when major financial challenges are being felt by businesses and households across the country the legal sector cannot be immune from the Government’s commitment to getting better value for every penny of taxpayers’ money we spend.’

Mr Mansfield, who is currently representing the family of Mark Duggan at the inquest into his death, declined to add any further comment last night.
