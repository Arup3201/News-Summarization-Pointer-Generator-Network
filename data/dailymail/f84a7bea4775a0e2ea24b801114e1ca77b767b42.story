A photographer turned make-up artist has combined her two passions by intricately painting her own lips and capturing them on film.

Eva Senin Pernas, 26, from La Coru√±a, Spain, was inspired by the movies to create some of her designs resulting in homages to films including Breakfast At Tiffany's and The Lion King.

Eva uses lipsticks, lip liners, liquid eyeliner and colour pigments to make her masterpieces and embellishes them with glitter and gem stones.

Lip service: Eva Senin Pernas intricately paints her own lips with film-inspired designs such as, The Hunger Games, showing the Mockingjay symbol

Magic: For the Harry Potter inspired design, Eva used black eyeliner splattered with fake blood

Diamonds are a girl's best friend: Eva said the Breakfast At Tiffany's inspired design was the hardest she has done

Disney fan: The Lion King look recreates a sun rise

Eva said she has been a make-up fanatic since she was a teenager but only recently took the step to make her passion a career.

She writes on her blog: 'The last year I decided to make one 
of my dreams come true and I became a make up artist. I've always loved 
makeup and all that involves it. So this is now the main theme of my 
photography.'

Homage: Here, Eva takes her cue from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas

No entry: The make-up artist used a finger print and etched police tape to make her lips a crime scene

Check-mate: Here, Eva painstakingly creates a chess board

Eva sells pictures of her lip art 
through her website. The designs were initially inspired by films such 
as The Hunger Games, where she paints the Mockingjay symbol on a red and
orange background, and The Lion King that features a sun rise backdrop 
with small accurately etched tree.

A
Harry Potter inspired design called 'The Deathly Hallows' features a 
symbol from the books. Eva described how she created the look: 'I drew 
the symbol with black eyeliner over my lips. I splattered some fake 
blood over as the final touch.'

Galaxy quest: The Spanish make-up artist mixed a variety of colours and used glitter to create this night sky she calls 'fly me to the moon'

Get fruity: Eva used miniatures to mimic a kiwi, left, and orange

She said The Breakfast At Tiffany's inspired work, featuring rows of diamantes was 'he hardest piece that I've done in my whole life'.

Creative Eva then moved on to other ideas including fruit designs using miniature lemons, oranges, and limes, and a lip scene mimicking a galaxy.
