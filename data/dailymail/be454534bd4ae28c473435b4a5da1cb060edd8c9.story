Britain's decision not to back a European law banning plastic bags has caused friction with Italy and stunned environmental campaigners.

Italy's Environment Minister has criticised Britain's lack of support for the law, describing it as 'astounding' particularly for a seafaring nation.

Environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by Britain's move earlier this month, especially given the Coalition government's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife.

Under threat: British beautyspots like Tynemouth, North Tyneside and marine life are under threat from the growing problem of waste plastic bags - which Britain chose not to ban under EU law

However, a Government spokesperson 
said: 'While we are determined to 
tackle the blight caused by discarded carrier bags, the proposed Italian
 scheme is illegal under EU packaging law.'

Andrea Orlando, Italy's environment minister, pointed out the risks to the environment of adopting Britain's position.

Quoted in The Daily Telegraph, he 
said: 'The bags are a serious problem, above all at sea, and it is 
astounding that Britain, which is serious about the environment and has a
 seafaring tradition going back centuries, does not want to defend the 
seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine 
animals.'

Three years ago, Italy's coastline had one of the worst records for plastic bag pollution; Italians consumed one quarter of all Europe’s single-use plastic shopping bags. A study showed that plastic bags accounted for 72 per cent of the waste washed up on its coasts.

But since 2011, Italy has introduced a ban on supply of the carrier bags; supermarkets and shops are only allowed to provide biodegradable plastic bags or thicker reusable ones.

The Mediterranean country now wants to go one step further; to be able to impose fines on shops that fail to comply with the rules. To do this, it needs an EU law to rubber stamp the ban.

Eyesore: The Daily Mail's Banish The Bags campaign calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags

This month a report by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) revealed that for every mile of Britain's coastline, there are on average 72 disposable shopping bags washed up. The problem is also getting worse.

To tackle the growing problem, Scotland has pledged to introduce charges and
 Wales and Northern Ireland have already imposed fees resulting in bag 
use dropping by up to 96 per cent in some supermarkets.

The Daily Mail also backs a move to rid the country of plastic bags, with its Banish the Bags campaign – which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers. 

But England has fallen short of imposing a ban.

Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has campaigned for years for plastic
 bags to be banned as long as alternatives are adequately highlighted, 
people and shopkeepers have enough time to prepare, and it does not have
 a 'disproportionate impact on the poor'. 

British ex-pat and waste expert David Newman, who lives in Rome called the British position 'astonishing'.

Mr Newman, head of the Italian 
Composting Association, told the Telegraph: 'The UK has been called to 
order on this at home yet it is opposing it in Brussels – it’s 
paradoxical.'
