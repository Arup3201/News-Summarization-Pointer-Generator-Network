Brendan Rodgers bemoaned Liverpool’s lack of attacking threat as they stumbled to defeat at Newcastle – but he refused to blame Mario Balotelli.

The Italian and his team-mates managed just three efforts on target as they failed to score for the third time in four matches.

Rodgers concedes that the sale of Luis Suarez – and the injury to Daniel Sturridge – has left his side short of confidence in the final third, but says misfiring Balotelli was not the reason for their 1-0 loss at resurgent Newcastle.

Mario Balotelli endured yet another frustrating afternoon as his side lost 1-0 to Newcastle

‘It wasn’t Mario’s fault we lost the game, we lost it collectively,’ he said when asked about the £16million frontman, who is yet to score in the Premier League for the Reds. ‘I don’t want to talk about Mario, it wasn’t his fault.

‘I didn’t think we deserved to lose but didn’t do enough to win it. We had enough of the ball but just lacked that bit of creativity and invention in the final third.

‘Over the last 18 months we have been a team with a real threat going forward but we have lost 80 per cent of our goals from the team, with Luis going and Dan (injured). We can’t keep going on about it but it is an item as to why we’re not getting so many goals.

‘When you’re a team that can scores goals then it gives the team confidence. We’re finding the goals a little bit harder to come by right now.’

Newcastle’s Ayoze Perez nicked the only goal, seizing upon an error by Alberto Moreno, and Rodgers reflected: ‘We made a mistake and that has unfortunately cost us the game and that is the biggest disappointment.

‘If you can’t score goals to win it, then it’s important you don’t concede goals to lose it. Up until that point we were solid.’

Rodgers, though, felt the hosts should have been reduced in number when Moussa Sissoko landed his studs on the back of Joe Allen’s leg.

‘Sissoko’s challenge on Joe Allen should have been a sending-off,’ he said. ‘He looks a big, honest player Sissoko, but he’s running back and jumps in and Joe was lucky, his foot was planted and it could have been a horrendous challenge.’

Liverpool now face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday with their Champions League campaign already in danger of a premature conclusion after two defeats and one win.

But Rodgers said: ‘It’s a wonderful game for us against the best team in the world at the moment. We will go into the game hoping to get something out of it.

‘There is pressure in every game at Liverpool, not just Tuesday. There is always that expectation, it’s there every time we play. We understand that and accept it. It is part of being involved as players, coaches and manager at Liverpool.’
