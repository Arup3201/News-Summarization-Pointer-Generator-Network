When Belfast bank manager Neil, 30, began losing his hair in his early twenties, he was both devastated and embarrassed.

But his problems got worse when, after spending months saving up, he splashed out on a seven-hour hair transplant operation that left him with even fewer working follicles than before.

Now he says the backfiring treatment has left him humiliated and self-conscious and says he has had to resort to using a dust-on dye to cover what's left of his locks.

Disaster: Bank manager Neil has been forced to rely on a powder dye after his hair transplant went wrong

'I feel that everyone's looking at me and that I look older than I am,' he explains.

'The powder works from a distance but if someone gets up close and personal, they can definitely see it and know something's not right.'

His problems began when his hair started to thin in his early twenties, receding rapidly from his hairline and crown.

But when his hair transplant failed to take, he was left with hair that was even thinner than before - and an unpleasant set of scars to boot.

'I thought the hair transplant was going to be worth it in the end but it didn't work out,' he adds.

What lies beneath: With the dye powder washed away, the true state of his hair is revealed

Miserable: Neil says that because of his receding hairline and botched transplant, he won't go out without a hat

Getting better: Neil has since had another hair transplant and says his mane is getting thicker

The impact on his self-esteem was huge, with Neil admitting that for a while, it left him so low he was virtually unable to leave the house.

'I was wearing a hat and stayed in the house as much as possible because I didn't want people to question me about it,' he explains.

Worse, he says that despite suffering from thinning hair for almost a decade and discovering the powder, spotting his balding pate in the mirror is still enough to leave him miserable.

'Every morning I get out of bed and see this [hair] and it just brings my confidence right down to rock bottom.

Speaking on TLC documentary, Extreme Beauty Disasters, he added: 'I just need and want to have a full head of hair.'

Happily for the 30-year-old, it seems a solution might soon be in sight as Neil, although initially reluctant, has since attempted a second hair transplant in a bid to repair the damage.

Following the operation, he said: 'There's much more hair and I can see it
 continually growing. The changes is phenomenal.

'I can see my hair 
getting thicker day by day. In the past when I looked in the mirror, I 
used to cringe whereas now I'm more happy with myself, more content. I'm
 delighted - it has changed my life.'
