The World Cup is just 23 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up.

The first sign is the closed merchandise store in the hotel lobby. More subtle hints soon follow, the near-empty beaches, the complete lack of even a solitary flag or street decoration. But nothing could have summed it up better than the match fizzing out of the television at the beach hut bar across the road.

There are eight sports channels available on even the most basic Brazilian satellite package, ensuring that the cradle of football is never left wanting, never at risk of running dry.

And yet yesterday lunchtime, in this Rio de Janeiro suburb, across the road from the Royal Tulip Hotel that Roy Hodgson and England will call home in a couple of short weeks, it was Montpellier and Castres who were being beamed out on the widescreen...rugby...French Top 14 rugby at that.

Peaceful: England's World Cup base while in Rio is the quiet Royal Tulip hotel in sleepy Sao Conrado

Calming influence: Roy Hodgson's England team will hope to keep their mind on the job in their quiet hotel

While the rest of the host nation begins to rapidly pick up the pace and catch World Cup fever (about time, given that there's just three weeks to kick-off now), Sao Conrado is the definition of seaside sleepiness.

And it might just suit England fine. It might just be the coastal oasis they didn't know they needed.

Okay, a Monday afternoon in winter is never likely to be the most hectic of time slots but the contrast between the slumbering surrounds of the Royal Tulip and the Caesar Park a mere six kilometres back up the coast couldn't be more stark.

The latter hotel is smack bang in the middle of Ipanema Beach, the red-hot centre of Rio's tourist hub, a landing spot for a fair whack of the 600,000 expected to descend on Brazil pretty soon. It also happens to be the base chosen by Holland and Louis van Gaal.

There's a bone dry joke to be made about the fact that it is England and not the Dutch who will call a place with a giant golden tulip on the edifice home during the World Cup.

Given that the incoming Manchester United manager was once labelled a 'dictator, without the slightest sense of humour' by Zlatan Ibrahimovich, Van Gaal probably wouldn't appreciate the joke.

But, with the already intense spotlight being ratcheted up a couple of hundred watts in the wake of yesterday's confirmation from Old Trafford, he'd arguably appreciate the peace and quiet that his English counterpart will enjoy here in Rio.

Party time: England have avoided the hussle and bussle of Rio's Ipanema Beach, where the Dutch are staying

Sao Conrado is cut off from Ipanema, Copacabana and the heart of the city by a soaring rock outcrop called Dois Irmaos.

It translates as Two Brothers and together they'll give the Three Lions a shield from the hype and the hoopla and the heat.

Not that they are actively running away from it, they may just have found welcome shade by accident (the original hotel they picked was on the seafront in Copacabana but Hodgson and advisors quickly changed tack when FIFA unveiled plans for a massive fan fest and big screens across the road).

It may not be an official FA diktat but across the board relaxation, a loosening of the leash, appears to be the theme of the planning behind this campaign. Unlike Rustenburg last time out and the circus of Baden Baden before that, England's team hotel will not be closed off to the public.

If you'd been prompt enough last year you could have booked a room and a spot next to Steven Gerrard and the boys at the breakfast buffet or the balcony pool.

Football crazy: The locals of the Ipanema Beach practice their moves ahead of this summer's World Cup

The Royal Tulip has undergone an expensive refurb with finishing touches still being made to the grounds yesterday, while inside all was deathly quiet. The bar was empty, the restaurants, including a well-equipped burger bar, equally short of punters.

The lobby's World Cup shop - featuring only Brazilian merchandise, not a St George's Cross in sight - was shut but two luxury jewellery shops on site, including H Stern, were open for business, readying for the invasion of the WAGS perhaps. The Fashion Mall (not a whole pile of imagination used in coming up with that name) next door is equally looking forward to Colleen and Co pitching up.

But Monday lunchtime was very much the calm before that storm. The always frantic Rocinha favela - with a population estimated somewhere north of 200,000 - may be a six-minute walk away from the hotel's door (in its previous guise as the Intercontinental, there was a hostage shoot-out here just four years ago) but it is passing buses that make the only racket outside the grounds.

There aren't a whole pile of other hotels about, instead Sao Conrado is primarily where some of Rio's affluent escape home to after a day in the chaos and gridlock of the city, which admittedly England will have to partly navigate on their daily trek to their training pitch at the military academy in Urca 15kms away.

Wayne Rooney, Gerrard and the rest will move in on June 8 when their preparations in Miami are complete. Yesterday Sao Conrado looked like it couldn't care less.

Wannabe surfers practiced in the whitewash, one in an Argentina shirt with Messi emblazoned on the back, a cyclist whizzed by on the prom in an AC Milan jersey but that's about all the football you got until four locals begin a languid game of foot-volley on the beach.

Fittingly, by Brazilian standards, it's low-key. That might just suit England fine.

Hectic: Holland boss Louis van Gaal and his players will be staying right in the heart of the action in Ipanema

Oh ye of little faith! With a whopping 24 days to spare (what was all the rushing about?), the venue for the opening game of the World Cup held its first proper football match on Sunday and passed the test with, not quite flying colours, but airborne shades of white and grey.

Arena Corinthians, which will also play host to what shapes to be England's decisive clash with Uruguay in Sao Paulo, welcomed 36,000 through the turnstiles.

There were issues with the unfinished roof and FIFA today confirmed another last-minute test match on May 29 just to be really sure but in what was a hit-or-miss moment, this was a hit, apart from the small matter of what happened on the field.

Corinthians were humbled by bottom boys Figueirense, a timely reminder that after all the build-up there is the small matter of delivering on the pitch too.

Unfinished: The Arena Corinthians - where England play Uruguay - hosted its first match on the weekend

Okay, if it seems like we feature Fred every other week, that's probably because we do. But there's just no escaping the big man down here.

As the figurehead of Phil Scolari's 2014 incarnation, the targetman is, well, a target. Opposing defenders love nothing more than going toe-to-toe with the man the nation will depend upon in a few weeks.

And they know how to wind him up. It all got too much for Fred this weekend when two yellow cards in 90 seconds - the second courtesy of a disgraceful dive from Gremio's Alan Ruiz - saw the Fluminense man sent off.

Scolari might be glad to see his lynchpin get some rest. But if his No 9 can't keep his cool against a wiry antagonist in the domestic game, can he rely on him to take on the world next month?

Remember me? Maradona (Argentina/Enfant Terrible)

Think you've seen Maradona in every ridiculous environment imaginable? Unless you've seen him play a human chair, you might just have to think that one over again.

Pele may the one truly cleaning up on the endorsement front with nearly £20million in sponsorship deals already secured.

But that doesn't mean there's no room for Maradona aboard the gravy train. The Argentine is far from hated in these parts and seems as game for a laugh as ever if this ad for a Brazilian version of eBay is anything to go by.

Part of the World Cup furniture? You bet.

Flustered: Brazil boss Phil Scolari believes a public inquiry into his finances is 'malicious'

Quote of the week:

'If it is a confidential inquiry, why has it been made public? Because it’s something malicious.'

Big Phil Scolari not all that enamoured with the Portuguese authorities for going public with their investigations into his alleged tax irregularities, the timing of which was a little too convenient for the host nation's liking.

Travellers tip: Attack of the cloners

This one, unfortunately, comes from personal experience. But seeing as we're just 22 days away now, the first waves of the estimated 600,000 overseas visitors will be pitching up in Brazil's international airports from this week onwards.

So a word of warning - don't use the airport ATMs. Entry points are absolute blackspots for credit and ATM card cloning with Rio de Janeiro's Galeao Airport the most notorious of the lot...even the major international banks who have machines at the terminal.

Having fallen victim to the skimmers ourselves, and endured a six-week wait for new cards to arrive, just do yourselves a favour and have enough cash for the taxi or bus into the city.

Amazon forecast: How’s the weather up in Manaus?

Okay, we've fretted over the heat and humidity and tropical Amazonian deluges for a fair few months now.

Things don't look like changing there any time soon but maybe we should be more worried about Sao Paulo if this weekend was anything to go by.

A winter World Cup in Brazil should still have promised plenty of sun but we're not so sure fans signed up for hail storms last seen the other side of the Old Testament.

These pictures of locals wading through feet-deep hail paint a not so pretty picture. Give us humidity any day!
