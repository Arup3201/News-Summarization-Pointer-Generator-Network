A seagull has become the surprise star of a horse race - after it was caught in a photo-finish pipping a top jockey to the post for second place.

The bird swooped down to clinch second spot by a beak after it photo-bombed the dying seconds of the 19.10 at Brighton on Tuesday.

The race was won by 7/2 favourite Jewelled, ridden by Richard Hughes.

This is the incredible moment a photo finish revealed a top jockey was pipped at the post into third place - by a seagull

Luke Morris, riding Sagesse came in second at the East Sussex racecourse, despite being just edged by the seagull.

Spokesperson George Hill said: 'In all my years of racing, I’ve never seen a finish quite like that before.

'I don’t know what the odds are of that happening, but the bookies still gave Sagesse its proper result.

'We are about a mile-and-a-half from the sea, and there are a lot of seagulls around, but this has never happened before as far as we are aware.

'The bird just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and was captured on Event Image’s photo finish.'
