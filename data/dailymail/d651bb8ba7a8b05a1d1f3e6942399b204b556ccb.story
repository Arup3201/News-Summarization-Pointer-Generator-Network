Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has opened up about his management style, using the analogy of making a suit to measure to describe his role, whilst also suggesting being a coach in England is ‘paradise’.

The Blues boss, since returning to Chelsea in the summer of 2013, has assembled a star studded squad which is perched at the top of the Premier League and in the last 16 of the Champions League.

Mourinho, who has won league titles in Portugal, Spain and Italy, insists you need to treat each player differently to harness their potential.

‘To manage a player is like to make a suit by measure, because all of them are different I cannot go to a shop and buy some 38, some 40, some 42, some 44 and arrive in the dressing room. No. It has to be by measure, it has to be perfect,’ Mourinho told Sports Illustrated.

‘So the personal relationship with the players is something very very important. Obviously there is also the collective leadership and I have to try and adapt my collective leadership to the profile of group I have,’ added the Blues boss.

‘But I think the suit by measure is the perfect way to explain what I think is fundamental – every man is a man, I read them and the better I can interact with them the better the team can be.’

Mourinho told Grant Wahl Chelsea have been a success in the transfer market because they don't panic

Chelsea had a strong summer in the transfer market with the acquisitions of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic proving excellent additions and have propelled the Blues to the top of the Premier League. The 52-year-old puts his transfer success down to composure and research:

‘First of all we didn’t panic. I came here in the first season (2013-14) and we decided not to buy just because we want to win desperately,’ added Mourinho.

‘If we have to wait one year ok, to be more sure about the profile of the type of player we want to bring. We had to be very sure of what we wanted to do.

‘After that it’s a lot easier not to make mistakes, analyse everything, try everything, know the players deeply, know if the players have the potential to improve or not under your guidance.

‘So when the summer market arrived we were in a great condition to make the right decisions to improve our team.

Mourinho is clearly relishing life back in London despite disputes with officials and an apparent ‘campaign’ against his Chelsea side.

‘Firstly it’s paradise for the social life, In Europe the power of football made our lives complicated and in England people look at you in a normal way. You can walk in the street, shop with your family, go to a restaurant,’ said the Portuguese.

‘The social life is much more relaxed. There is an expression in England that the passion for the game lasts 90 minutes a week and after that everything is calm.’
