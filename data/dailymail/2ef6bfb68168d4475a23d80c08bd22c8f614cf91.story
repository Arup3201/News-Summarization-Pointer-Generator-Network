For a billionaire power couple enjoying a romantic getaway, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan do not exactly look the picture of happiness.

The glum looking pair, pictured while on holiday in Budapest, Hungary, walked with heads down and with less than warm body language.

This month marks a full year since Mr Zuckerberg married his college sweetheart.

The couple sported casual wear and Mark wore swapped his now-famous sandals for a pair of comfortable looking trainers, teamed with a hooded jumper and dark blue jeans

The notoriously down to earth pair wed in May 2012 in Zuckerberg's backyard in Palo Alto, California - after telling their unwitting guests the celebration was solely to mark Chan's graduation from medical school.

The couple sported casual wear on their city break and Mark wore swapped his now-famous sandals, which are parodied by Jesse Eisenberg in the film about Facebook, The Social Network, for a pair of comfortable looking trainers, teamed with a hooded jumper and dark blue jeans.

His wife wore a beige jacket, scarf, and skirt over opaque tights and a pair of sensible pumps

Mr Zuckerberg finally cracked a smile for the photographers as he and his wife made his way to a waiting car

His wife wore a beige jacket, scarf, and skirt over opaque tights and a pair of sensible pumps.

The couple met at a college party in 2003 as they stood in line for the bathroom at Zuckerberg's Jewish fraternity at Harvard University, Alpha Epsilon Pi.

'He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,' Chan has previously told the New Yorker.
