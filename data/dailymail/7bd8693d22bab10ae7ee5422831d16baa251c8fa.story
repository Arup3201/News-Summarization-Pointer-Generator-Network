Ronda Rousey recorded the fastest-ever finish in a UFC title fight as she submitted Cat Zingano after just 14 seconds in Los Angeles.

Rousey was expected to face the toughest examination of her reign as bantamweight champion against the unbeaten Zingano.

But having avoided a flying knee in the opening seconds, Rousey took her opponent down and set to work trying to execute her trademark armbar.

Rousey had landed on her head but the champion gracefully flipped Zingano on to her back, got up and manoeuvred swiftly into position to wrench Zingano's arm grotesquely. Rousey forced the challenger to tap out.

'We were expecting that she might come out and do something flying at me right away,' Rousey said. 'That's not usually how you land an armbar at that angle, but it works. It was a lot like judo transitions, where you scramble the second you hit the ground.

'I made that up on the fly, to be honest. But it was kind of funny: We were going toward the ground, and I kind of reverted back to judo mode and was thinking, 'Don't touch your back. It's a point.' 

'That's where the acrobatic thing came from, was thinking about not touching your back in judo.'

It was hard to work out who was more stunned, Zingano or the sell-out 17,000-crowd at the Staples Center.

'She's really good ... but that wouldn't happen again,' the beaten challenger said. 'It was a knee and then a throw and then a scramble, and then she was wrapped around my arm. I got caught. I was ready to do a million different things. I planned on getting in a fist fight tonight.'

For the first time in the promotion's history, two women's fights headlined a pay-per-view event as boxer Holly Holm made her debut with a split-decision victory over Raquel Pennington in the co-main event.

Middleweight champion Chris Weidman originally was scheduled to fight Vitor Belfort but had to withdraw injured. 

Zingano had earned her title shot two years ago with an upset victory over Miesha Tate, but was forced to wait after suffering a serious knee injury before she was hit by her estranged husband's suicide last year.

Holm, meanwhile, ended an 11-year pro boxing career to concentrate on MMA two years ago but looked far from the complete package against Pennington.

Both fighters landed big shots during a stand-up fight, and while Holm finished with a bloody nose, she left Pennington with a swollen left eye.
