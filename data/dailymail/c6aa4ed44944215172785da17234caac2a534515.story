Fears for the health of Pope Francis have surfaced, after he cancelled two days of engagements

Fears for the health of Pope Francis have surfaced, after he cancelled two days of engagements. 

Following an intense working weekend, the 77-year-old decided not to hold Mass in Santa Marta this morning and cancelled his appointments for the rest of the day.

He had already had advisors clear his schedule yesterday to rest, after hosting a diplomatically tricky prayer meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents on Sunday.  

A few weeks ago he called off a visit to a Marian shrine near Rome ‘lighten his schedule’ before his three day trip to the Holy land. 

He has previously cancelled engagements because of a cold, or a light fever.

The Vatican said:'Following a very historic and full weekend, the Holy Father has chosen to rest on Monday afternoon and today Tuesday.' His condition is 'not serious' the Holy See said.

Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi said the two day absence was 'nothing to worry about.'

The pope, who rises at 4.30am every day has kept up a whirlwind of activity since his election more than a year ago, but his advisers are hoping that he will take some time off this summer.

Close collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras said: 'We have been asking him to have holidays this year.'

'Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired.'

'So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest.'

Traditionally popes moved to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome during the summer months.

Last year Francis worked straight through the summer.Papal aides reportedly say that Francis thrives off a fast pace and 'eats work,' and finds it hard to relinquish control to others.

But he has some underlying health problems, including sciatica, a back problem and is missing most of one lung due to an infection in his youth.

Some observers have claimed the pontiff has gained weight since his election and is having difficulty breathing, which could be a sign of a heart condition.
