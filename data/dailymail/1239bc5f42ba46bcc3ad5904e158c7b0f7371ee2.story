Jose Mourinho says that the additional games on New Year’s Day for Premier League clubs could make this FA Cup third round one of the most exciting yet.

Mourinho, who won the FA Cup with Chelsea in 2007, will make extensive changes for the game against Watford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

And the Chelsea manager says that the fact that the Football League clubs did not have a game on New Year’s Day, unlike the Premier League, means that the ties will be evened up.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says FA Cup shocks are more likely due to the Premier League's busy fixture list

Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Cahill, Filipe Luis; Mikel, Matic; Schurrle, Oscar, Willian; Drogba

‘The Championship clubs will be in a better condition than the Premier League clubs,’ said Mourinho. ‘But at the same time normally the Premier League clubs have more potential and more qualities, so maybe it’s a way to make things level. 

One team has more quality and another team is fresh and ready for the game so maybe this is a way to level things between Premier League teams and the Championship teams.

‘We don’t have to analyse whether it’s fair or not fair – it’s the way it is. In relation to fixtures and accumulation of matches and fatigue and this kind of thing, it is the way it is, so we have to accept that.’

And Mourinho has refused to use the exceptionally-busy Christmas period for the Premier League, which sees Chelsea playing their fifth game in 15 days on Sunday, as an excuse for the 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year’s Day.

‘It the same for everybody,’ said Mourinho. ‘When it’s for everybody, you have to accept it. You know it’s difficult for the players but it is not difficult for my players, it is difficult for every player. My respect to every player of every club because it’s hard to do it. It’s the only country where they do it (the Christmas fixtures) and they do it with lots of pride.

Eden Hazard and Diego Costa are among the stars likely to be rested but nevertheless Mourinho has repeated his call for referees to protect the Belgian star, who he says he is being targeted by Premier League defenders.

‘The first free kicks of every game is somebody kicking him,’ said Mourinho. ‘He has fouls and fouls and fouls. I don’t see many yellow cards. Sometimes the yellow cards are the consequence of violent conduct but I also think that the accumulation of small fouls is violent conduct.

‘And he is suffering the consequences of that but playing amazingly well and against Tottenham he was amazing even with the second half and a difficult result to face, to have the determination to keep believing to the end, he was fantastic.’

Mourinho was furious at the treatment he felt Eden Hazard was receiving during Chelsea's loss at Spurs
