Filming of Channel 4’s Immigration Street – the planned follow-up to its controversial Benefits Street show – has repeatedly been interrupted by angry residents who pelted camera crews with eggs and flour.

Hostility to the project, set in Derby Road in Southampton, has grown so great that programme-makers are considering changing the name.

Angry residents have put anti-Immigration Street posters in their windows to discourage filming while an alliance of public, private and voluntary organisations in the city has accused Channel 4 and Love, an independent production company, of trying to destroy the community it wants to portray.

Outcry: Residents speak out against filming of Immigration Street, set in Derby Road in Southampton

Meanwhile, the programme-makers have been forced to retreat to side streets to complete filming for the series, due to be broadcast next year.

An open letter to Channel 4, signed by Southampton’s police and crime commissioner Simon Hayes, along with health bodies, educational establishments, business organisations and local MP Alan Whitehead, has asked the station to reconsider its decision to push ahead with the ‘ill-named and ill-advised’ project.

The letter says Derby Road is a ‘harmonious, open, thriving, successful and diverse community’ and adds that residents ‘do not want [it] to be stigmatised or damaged’.

The letter continues: ‘We have tried to work with the production team but have been unsuccessful due to their reluctance to work constructively with the local community and us.’

Labour MP Mr Whitehead says he is attempting to force a parliamentary debate on the subject. ‘People feel powerless,’ he adds.

Follow-up: The programme comes after controversial Benefits Street, which made a star of resident White Dee

‘They don’t want this programme to be made. You can perhaps understand how frustrations arise and why they might manifest themselves in TV crews being pelted with eggs and flour.’

Satvir Kaur, a third-generation Sikh resident and a cabinet member on Southampton City Council, said: ‘I was really angry when I found out about this programme.’

Channel 4’s Nick Mirsky said that Love had invested significant time in meeting local people and organisations and was committed to ‘reflecting the authentic experience of people who live on or use Derby Road’.
