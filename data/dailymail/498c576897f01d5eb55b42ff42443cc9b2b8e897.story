A pregnant mother and her toddler were stabbed to death by  her deranged ex-lover after police failed to warn her they were at ‘high risk of homicide’, a jury ruled yesterday.

Andrew Cairns, who had a history  of mental illness, killed Rachael  Slack and their 23-month-old son  Auden days after twice being held by police – the second time for threatening to kill her.

The inquest heard that despite the golf tutor telling Miss Slack ‘You have no idea what I’m capable of … I will kill you and take him [Auden] with me’, he was freed on bail pending further police inquiries.

Killer: Andrew Cairns, who had suffered from declining mental health over a number of years, stabbed his former partner and her child to death before turning the knife on himself

Five days later, Cairns delivered on his horrifying promise, brutally attacking Miss Slack with a kitchen knife at her village home as a neighbour looked on in horror, before stabbing himself to death.

Last night Cairns was branded a ‘ticking timebomb’ by Robert Barlow, the father of Miss Slack’s unborn child, as an inquest jury ruled Miss Slack, 38, and her son were unlawfully killed.

The jury said the deaths were ‘more than minimally contributed to by a [police] failure to impress upon’ Miss Slack the conclusion of a risk assessment conducted by officers which placed the pair, of Holbrook, Derbyshire, at high risk of death or serious injury.

The inquest heard that while police had called Miss Slack, a human resources manager, to warn her that Cairns had been released on bail, officers failed to tell her of their own risk assessment.

The jury ruled police had also failed to advise Miss Slack of  steps she could have taken to address the potential of harm towards her son, such as asking neighbours to look out for Cairns – whose bail conditions barred him from approaching the mother and son.

Following the jury conclusions, coroner Dr Robert Hunter said that he would write to Home Secretary Theresa May, the Department of Health, Derbyshire Constabulary and the Association of Chief Police Officers.

He said he would share his concerns about deficiencies in police powers to deal with suspects who breach bail over alleged domestic violence and the sharing of information between mental health services and police.

Triple deaths: Rachael Slack, her son Auden and her former partner Andrew Cairns were all found dead in this property in Holbrook, Derbyshire

Victims: Auden and his mother Rachael Slack who were both discovered dead in Holbrook, Derbyshire in June 2010. Today an inquest jury ruled that police failures contributed 'more than minimally' to their deaths

After the case, Mr Barlow told the 
Daily Mail the police should be ‘damned’ for the ‘shocking’ failure to 
warn his partner that her life and that of her son was at risk.

He said that he and Miss Slack - who 
planned to call their unborn son George - ‘were not given a good enough 
chance to prepare ourselves for the possibility of Andrew turning up at 
the house’.

Mr Barlow added: ‘We could have looked
at moving to stay with a relative while they investigated him for 
threatening to kill Rachael.

‘Instead, we carried on with our normal routine – Rachael and Auden remained in the cottage while I went off to work.’

The 42-year-old joinery company boss 
said Cairns was always liable to erupt because he could not accept Miss 
Slack had moved on with her life and settled down with a new partner.

Brutal killing: Ms Slack was stabbed 32 times in the back and chest during the attack in her home, the five-week inquest heard

The family of Miss Slack said  that 
instead of spending last  weekend celebrating her 42nd birthday and 
reflecting on Auden’s first term at school, they had spent six weeks in a
coroner’s court, ‘hearing about the failings of Derbyshire Police’.

The inquest heard Derbyshire 
Constabulary and NHS mental health services had countless opportunities 
to prevent the deaths in the run-up to the tragedy at Miss Slack’s 
village home. Cairns, who had been separated from the trained artist and
human resources manager for 18 months, had been in the care of 
Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust since mid-2008.

Over the following two years he was 
seen by two consultant psychiatrists and numerous other health 
professionals and had been diagnosed as having a ‘narcissistic 
personality disorder’. In the week before the bloodbath, Cairns’ mental 
health rapidly deteriorated.

On May 26 he was held under  the 
mental health act after Miss Slack was forced to drive to Ripley police 
station when he refused to get out of her car.

Killing: Ms Slack had driven to a police station with Cairns in her car after he refused to get out days before she was stabbed to death, the inquest heard

The following morning, he turned up at
Miss Slack’s cottage without  warning. The terrified mother took him to
a park with Auden, a ‘ploy’ to kill time until she could collect Mr 
Barlow from work. It was at the park that Cairns issued his chilling 
threat to Miss Slack’s life.

Mr Barlow and Miss Slack reported the sinister promise to police that evening and Cairns was arrested but later released.

Just two hours before the June 2 
atrocity, Cairns visited his GP in  an ‘agitated’ state and clutching  a
picture of Auden. He warned  the medic: ‘Today will be the  most 
important day of your career.’ The jury found Cairns had taken his own 
life.

Dr Hunter, the coroner for South 
Derbyshire, said the inquest  had shone a spotlight on a national 
‘epidemic’ of domestic violence and he would ‘urge’ the Home Secretary 
to amend legislation to give police more options when detaining suspects
accused of violent or sexual offences.

Dr Hunter said he would also  ask the 
new College of Policing to consider drawing up national guidelines for 
investigating domestic violence, so that officers across the country 
work to the same ‘robust’ standard.
