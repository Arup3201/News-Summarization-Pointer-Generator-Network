A conman was caught out by an online viral video after making a false £17,000 insurance claim that he suffered a horror injury in flash flooding.

Stephen Robinson, 30, told Newcastle City Council he broke his ankle when a drain collapsed as he walked through water on a road near his home.

The local authority passed the case to its specialist insurance firm who set aside a taxpayer funded cash pay-out.

Stephen Giles claimed he broke his ankle when he walked over a collapsed drain but after a video went viral it was discovered that he broke it jumping into shallow flood water (pictured, his foot hangs at an angle)

But officials discovered a YouTube video which showed Robinson acting up to a huge crowd as he leapt into the pool of water.

Dozens of people cheered the show-off as he took a running jump into the flooded road, only to collapse onto the ground seconds later.

There are then gasps of horror as he pulls his leg clear of the water to show his foot sticking out of his leg at an unnatural angle.

Yesterday, Robinson was fined £600 and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work after admitting fraud by false representation at Newcastle Magistrates' Court.

He admitted willingly jumping into the water in Pooley Road, Slatybridge on June 28, 2012, as the city was struck by flash flooding.

Investigators discovered the heavyset fraudster landed on top of a hidden metal drain, which contributed to his injury.

Giles can be seen leaping into the flood water to cheers from dozens of onlookers after flash flooding hit the area near his home in Slatybridge, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, in June 2012

Soon after he jumps in the water there are gasps of horror as he pulls his leg out to show his foot sticking out at an angle from his leg

The YouTube video has since been viewed more than 5,000 times, despite the efforts of a family member to have it removed.

Asking for it to be taken down, a cousin said: 'He's traumatised by it as he is not the same person since it happened.

'He has heard it has been used in documentary on TV and is not happy about it! And does not want reminded of what happened to him please take it off.

Another viewer wrote in the comments: 'Felt the need to say that not all people from Newcastle are as stupid as this.'

DC Kate Sibley, of City of London Police, said: 'Stephen Robinson deliberately tried to defraud Newcastle Council and their insurers to financially benefit from his broken ankle.

'He broke his ankle because he was showing off in front of a crowd of onlookers.

'This posing caused his downfall as the incident was uploaded to the internet and viewed by thousands of people.

'Insurance fraud is not a victimless crime, it is those who pay their council tax in Newcastle who would have lost out if they had paid compensation to Stephen Robinson.'

Veronica Dunn, of Newcastle City Council, said: 'I am delighted with the outcome of this case. Stephen Robinson attempted to defraud the city council and the council taxpayers in the most despicable way.

'We investigate all suspected fraudulent claims, and on this occasion received an invaluable tip-off from a member of the public who viewed the footage on YouTube.

'This has cost him dearly, and I hope it sends out a clear message that Newcastle City Council will not hesitate to call in the police and prosecute anyone who attempts to defraud the public purse by submitting fraudulent insurance claims.'
