'Harry Kane reminds me of a young Thomas Muller,' Owen Hargreaves said on BT Sport before the game. 

Perhaps an ambitious claim at this early stage of his career, but that a young Englishman is being compared to a World Cup-winning German is testament to Kane's progress this season.

His stats are impressive. 15 goals in all competitions this term, second only to Sergio Aguero in the Premier League standings, and level with Arsenal's star man Alexis Sanchez.

Fifty Tottenham appearances, 20 goals. And now a chance to impress against Manchester United. 

Louis van Gaal's side are a team on the up, but have struggled with injuries defensively this season. Against Spurs on Sunday, they started with Phil Jones, Paddy McNair and Jonny Evans. A British back three for an English forward to attack.

And attack he did. It took just six minutes for him to make an impact, nearly threading the ball through to Ryan Mason after brushing McNair off with ease. 

The game was quiet for large spells. Nobody was outstanding, and it finished goalless. Nevertheless, Kane was impressive, as always.

There was a moment midway through the second half that summed up his performance. He was anonymous at times, but worked hard behind the scenes.

The 21-year-old Englishman did not set the pitch alight, but his work behind the scenes is very effective

Drifting into the midfield, the 21-year-old Englishman intercepted a United pass, knocked the ball to a team-mate and drove into the opposition half. They lost the ball, and two minutes later Kane was back repeating the same task.

This time, he nicked the ball from a United man and took the ball with him, bursting through a gap in the midfield. 

He wasn't creating chance after chance as he sometimes does, but instead working hard for his team in a deeper area of the pitch. When Spurs are attacking, Kane is the main man. When they are on the back foot - as they were for large parts of Sunday's game - the Englishman drops in and fights to regain possession for his team-mates.

As with the early chance, Kane was the provider for a Spurs attack late on in the match. A golden opportunity to win it, in fact.

He did what he does best, running at the United back-line with speed and power. Cutting inside, he could have shot, but instead threaded a deft ball through to Mason. It was blasted over the bar, but gave a glimpse of what Kane can do. 

He is from the same east London borough as former England captain David Beckham. Roy Hodgson will be watching his progress closely, and at just 21 there is a strong possibility Tottenham's star turn will become a stalwart in the England ranks too. 

Hugo Lloris rightly took the plaudits after a brilliant goalkeeping display, but Kane was there again, discreetly going about his business.

He tirelessly worked for 90 minutes without ever being outstanding. Quietly efficient - exactly how the German team are routinely described. Perhaps that Muller comparison isn't far out, after all.
