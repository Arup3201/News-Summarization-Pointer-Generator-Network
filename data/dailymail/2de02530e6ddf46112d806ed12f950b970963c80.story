Unimpressed: Mark Zuckerberg is apparently not a fan of Facebook's rival social network Twitter

Mark Zuckerberg is apparently not a fan of Facebook's rival social network Twitter.

The Facebook founder allegedly once told close friends that '[Twitter is] such a mess, it’s as if they drove a clown car into a gold mine and fell in.'

The claim is made in Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal, a book by the New York Times' Nick Bilton analysing Twitter's evolution.

It is not clear when the 29-year-old made the comment, but the book claims he made it 'within the last three years, Bloomberg reported. 

The book claims that twice Zuckerberg tried to acquire Twitter through official channels and via co-founder Jack Dorsey.

He apparently made the comment after both acquisitions failed. 

Last Thursday Twitter went public on the New York Stock Exchange.

Twitter shares retreated Friday a day after a sizzling debut on Wall Street, as some of the frenzy about the popular messaging service faded, but analysts say there's no cause for concern.

The stock slipped 7.26 per cent to close at $41.64 -- a day after a stunning gain of 72.69 percent on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange after a $1.8billion initial public offering.

It closed at nearly $43 on Monday.

The New York Stock Exchange celebrates the public debut of Twitter last Thursday

Company
CFO Mike Gupta's goal in their IPO was not to repeat the mistakes made 
by Facebook when it debuted on the stock 
market in May 2012.

Twitter ultimately decided to price its IPO at $26 a share, even though underwriters thought about pricing it as high as $28.

Twitter
thought that it made sense to leave room for shares to jump on the 
first day, which they did, rising 73 per cent. Had the company priced 
its shares at higher levels, it could have raised more than $1 billion 
extra.

Facebook, which 
priced its IPO at $38 a share, saw underwriters battle to keep its 
shares from dipping below the IPO price on the first day of trading.

The
shares continued to drop, falling as low as $17.55 in the months 
following the company's public debut. It took over a year for the stock 
to recover.
