A special education teacher has been accused of sending explicit pictures of herself to a 14-year-old student and sexually assaulting them.

Kayla Zittrouer, 22, from Guyton, Georgia, was arrested on Tuesday after she shared the 'obscene images' and had inappropriate sexual contact with the youngster.

The faculty member had only started her job at Effingham County Middle School near Savannah in January. 

Her mother Mary Lynn celebrated her appointment in December by uploading a picture of the pair arm-in-arm to Facebook.

Marking the occasion: The teacher's mother Mary Lynn (right) uploaded a picture with her daughter in December to celebrate her appointment. She said she was 'so proud' of her 'middle child'

A message alongside the image read: 'So proud of my middle child Kayla Zittrouer! She got hired today by Effingham Middle!!! This mom and dad are so excited.'

However Zittrouer resigned from her position on Monday after the school district began an investigation into her conduct 

A day later she handed herself in to police and was taken into custody.

Zittrouer faces three counts of computer pornography, cruelty to children in the first degree, sexual assault by a teacher or other administrator engaged in sexual contact, enticing a child for indecent purposes and child molestation.

According to WTOC she is being held in Effingham County Jail and has not been granted bond. 

Accusations: Zittrouer faces multiple charges including three counts of computer pornography, cruelty to children in the first degree and sexual assault by a teacher 

The victim's mother, who has not been named, told the station:  'As a parent, you're a protector and it seems like since birth I've been protecting my child and then this happens.

'The last thing you think is you'll get a call saying: "Hey, we need to talk to you. One of our teachers is sending your child a nude picture".'

County Superintendent Randy Shearouse said: 'It is definitely an unfortunate situation. We do take situations such as this very seriously. When we learned that something was going on, we immediately started our investigation. 

'The teacher was placed on administrative leave while we conducted our investigation then the Effingham county sheriff's office was called in and we've been working with them since last Friday.'
