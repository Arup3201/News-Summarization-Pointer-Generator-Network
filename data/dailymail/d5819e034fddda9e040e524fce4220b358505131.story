Accused: Michael Cope has been charged with the murder of Linzi Ashton

A man has been charged with murder of his ex-girlfriend after he handed himself in to police following nearly a month on the run.

Michael Cope, 28, is accused of killing mother-of-two Linzi Ashton, 25, who was discovered dead in her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, last month.

The suspect was arrested on Friday night after police were called to an address in Leigh, Greater Manchester.

Cope, of no fixed address, is also charged with separate offences of rape and assault, said Greater Manchester Police.

A reward of £25,000 had been on offer to anyone with information that led to the arrest and conviction of Cope, while the appeal to find the suspect featured in Thursday's edition of BBC1's Crimewatch.

Miss Ashton's two daughters, Daisy, two, and Destiny, seven, were not at the address when she was found dead.

In a statement issued shortly after Miss Ashton's death, her family said: 'She was the most beautiful, generous, caring person anyone could ever wish to meet. She would never harm anyone and was always there for her children and family.

'Life will never be the same again without her. Our whole family and friends have been devastated by her death. The whole community is in shock.'

A Home Office post-mortem concluded Linzi died as a result of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries.

Cope is due to appear at Manchester and Salford magistrates’ court tomorrow.
