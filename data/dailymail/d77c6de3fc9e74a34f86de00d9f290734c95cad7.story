A Satanist nurse who posted pictures of herself next to dead and dying pensioners at the care home where she worked has been fined £800 by a Swiss court.

Blaze Binder published the photos next to messages saying she was the 'soul thief' and 'Hail Satan'.

She asked her 2,000 friends on Facebook, where she goes by the name Ghostinthedark Satania Blaze, to guess if the pensioners were dead or alive.

After the day job: Binder also advertises her services as a dominatrix on her Facebook page, describing herself as the 'queen of pleasures'

The Filipino-born 37-year-old, branded the devil nurse by local media, also posed in a nurse's uniform outside an ambulance and in other images as a latex-clad dominatrix.

Binder, who is married to a Swiss man, had been working at the care home in Mogelsberg when she took the pictures, but only published them after the facility closed.

In one comment, she wrote: 'Gonna send them to Hell where some belong, the rest in the compost pit for fertilizers - hehehe'.

In response to a comment suggesting the posting was improper, the woman wrote: 'I can put anything I want in my Facebook (page) it's mine.

'People who doesn't want what I post they can juz up and die death is normal people die all the time!'

Brought to justice: A court in St Gallen in Switzerland, around 85km from Zurich, found her guilty of 'violating the peace of the dead' and breach of trust

Twisted: When interviewed by daily newspaper Blick when the case was first revealed, the tattooed Binder called the pictures 'beautiful pictures' and said death was part of everyday life at the nursing home

The Swiss Association of Nurses said it was 'shocked and upset' by the pictures.

A court in St Gallen in Switzerland, around 85km from Zurich, found her guilty of 'violating the peace of the dead' and breach of trust.

In addition to the £800 fine, the court issued a suspended fine equivalent to 120 days of pay.

When she was interviewed by daily newspaper Blick when the case was first revealed, the tattooed employee called the photos 'beautiful pictures' and said death was part of everyday life at the nursing home.

'I do not understand that people are upset about the photos.'

Perverse: Binder posing next to an ambulance (left) and (right) some of her whips and other dominatrix tools

Relatives of one dead woman reacted with outrage to the posting.

'The images must instantly disappear from the internet,' the woman's son Ruedi Forrer, 66.

'I do not understand for the life of me how such a thing can happen in a retirement home.'

Adding to the scandal were additional pictures on the internet of the Filipino as a 'dominatrix', her other profession.

On her Facebook home page, she advertised her services in the Saint Gallen area as the 'queen of pleasures'.

Other photos showed the whips and other 'tools' that the woman uses for her work.
