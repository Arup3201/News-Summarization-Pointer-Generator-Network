A deadly duo of massive, relentlessly fast-moving tornadoes rained down terror in northeast Nebraska on Monday evening.

Photos from the tiny town of Pilger, Nebraska show a community devastated after 200MPH winds ripped though and leveled entire neighborhoods, gutted the town's middle school and destroyed it's Farmer's Co-Op and much of its farming infrastructure as corn silos crumpled in the face of the winds.

As
 Monday evening turned to night, two casualties had been 
reported, with at least 16 critically injured in the area. At least one of those killed was a child.

The National Weather Service continued to warn of possible tornadoes over large swaths of both Nebraska and Iowa, as well as the flash floods and severe thunderstorms also birthed by these powerful storm systems.

'I’m standing in Pilger, and I see devastation,' Stanton County Commissioner Jerry Weatherholt told the Lincoln Journal-Star. 'It looks like a war zone. It absolutely looks like a war zone.'

First responders swarmed what was left of Pilger, but some witnesses described the gut-wrenching rescue efforts as disorganized at best.

'There are a lot of people around not too much organization,' said Weatherholt.

The initial efforts proved daunting as rescuers were faced with the chaos of near total destruction.

'We're still digging people out,' Stanton County emergency manager Sanford Goshorn told CNN on Monday night.

At least three tornadoes were reported in the area Monday evening, with more potentially to come through early Tuesday.

Two of the menacing storms are believed to have had an intensity of EF-4, which are some of the deadliest and most destructive.

Experts, some of whom had never seen the double twister phenomenon, made it clear that the rare occurrence was one for the record books.

'This is a significant storm, and one that I have never seen the likes of, ever. Really,' said Weather Channel severe weather expert Dr. Greg Postel.

Meteorologist
 Barbara Mayes says the tornadoes that touched down were about a mile 
apart, near the towns of Stanton and Pilger, 100 miles northwest of 
Omaha.

While storm 
clusters are sometimes seen with multiple tornadoes, usually one is the 
dominant storm while the other less powerful twisters rotate around it.

In
 an almost unheard of occurrence, the Pilger tornadoes were almost 
equally powerful as both were capable of producing 200MPH winds.

'It
 was like God dragged two fingernails across the the land,' witness 
Gregg Moeller told the Norfolk Daily News. 'Oh my God, the damage is 
unbelievable.'

The 
titanic storm systems that formed these deadly twisters have also 
brought with them into the region golf ball sized hail, severe 
thunderstorms and damaging non-cyclonic winds.

'We've had reports of brief touchdowns as the storms near Sioux City, Iowa,' National Weather Service Meteorologist Todd Heitkamp told CNN as the weather system that destroyed Pilger moved on to wreak havoc elsewhere.

'We've had widespread wind and flooding damage due to the series of storms that have been ongoing today. We've had reports of up to 4 inches of rain within an hour in the tri-state area. The main thing is widespread tree damage,' he said.

Meteorologists report that three tornadoes likely touched down in northeast Nebraska, with the twin EF-4 tornadoes doing the most damage. Here, a single twister barrels along US 275 near Norfolk, Nebraska

'There's no street signs left,' he told Omaha.com. 'Cars are tossed.'

Davidson said he even saw a car inside a home.

'It's very chaotic here right now,' he said.

Pilger's nickname for itself, 'The Town too Tuff to Die' may seem a bitter irony now that so much of the village appeared to have been blown away like dust.

Emergency crews and residents spent the evening sorting through demolished homes and businesses in the town roughly 100 miles northwest of Omaha.

‘More than half of the town is gone - absolutely gone,’ Weatherholt said. ‘The co-op is gone, the grain bins are gone, and it looks like almost every house in town has some damage. It's a complete mess.’

Victims were taken to three regional hospitals, and at least one had died from unspecified injuries, hospital officials said.

Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger estimated that 50 to 75 percent of Pilger was heavily damaged or destroyed in the storm. The local school is likely beyond repair, he said.

‘It's total devastation,’ Unger said.

Unger said five people had to be rescued from a rural home
day care northwest of Stanton. That home was hit just before the storm moved
into Pilger.

Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman declared a state of emergency,
and the National Guard was preparing to deploy to assist local emergency
responders and help with the cleanup. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency
was expected to arrive in town Tuesday morning.

Pilger was evacuated for the night, and the Nebraska State
Patrol closed all roads into town. Most residents made their own arrangements,
but some were taken to a shelter in the nearby town of Wisner, Unger said.

Tornadoes also caused damage in Cuming and Wayne counties,
the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said in a news release.

‘We are still in a response mode in these communities,’ said
Earl Imler, NEMA's operations officer. ‘We are collecting damage reports from
local officials on the ground.’

Faith Regional Health Services in nearby Norfolk was
treating 16 patients with critical injuries, and one person had died, said
hospital spokeswoman Jodi Richey.

Providence Medical Center in nearby Wayne treated three
tornado patients, including two who had lacerations, said hospital spokeswoman
Sandy Bartling. Two were released Monday evening, and the third patient was in
stable condition, she said.

Meteorologists with the National Weather Service were also
tracking a tornado near the town of Burwell, in central Nebraska.
