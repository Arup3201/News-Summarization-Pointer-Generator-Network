From Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year to Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year, a tongue-in-cheek list of GQ Awards’ winners has been unveiled.

The mocked-up winners’ list, which was posted on Twitter today, appears to have been prompted by Tony Blair’s surprise Philanthropist of the Year award.

The former Prime Minister picked up the gong for his efforts in ‘establishing three charities’ at the central London awards ceremony – much to the surprise of the star-studded audience which was said to be ‘muted’ as his name was read out.

Twitter users were less-than-impressed with Tony Blair being awarded Philanthropist of the Year by GQ

The GQ Men of the Year awards are a popular fixture among celebrities with many A-listers attending the event last night, including Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa, model Cara Delevingne and Kim Kardashian West.

However, while the likes of Ringo Starr, Colin Firth, Pharrell Williams and Iggy Pop actually picked up awards – the dummy winners’ list which emerged today appears to mock Mr Blair’s charity award.

On receiving his honour at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, the 61-year-old, said: ‘I would like to dedicate this award to the people that work with and for my organisations. I feel the pulse of progress beating a little harder.'

He and his wife Cherie have a property empire worth an estimated £30million, having bought homes for their children, and since stepping down from office in 2007 he has established three charities - The Tony Blair Sports Foundation, Faith Foundation and the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative.

However, his recognition didn’t go down well across the country, with thousands taking to social media to question the award.

Labour MP John Mann said ‘it sends the wrong message’, adding: ‘This sort of award should go to an unsung hero who has given up their time for charity.’

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair picked up Philanthropist of the Year award at last night's GQ Men of the Year awards ceremony for his work in establishing three charities - much to the shock of the star-studded audience

Mr Blair's award was met with a wave of criticism on social media including this response from Gary Lineker

Others expressed their shock and questioned why the charity award was given to the former Prime Minister 

 Dozens of people referenced Mr Blair's award on Twitter overnight, with many surprised at his recognition

And even Gary Lineker said: ‘Apparently, Tony Blair has won GQ’s philanthropist of the year award. Finally these awards have grasped irony!’

The shock award, dubbed a PR stunt by many, appears to be the reason for the mocked-up winners' list which was posted on Twitter by @JamieDMJ this morning.

The photo - a digitally altered version of the leading magazine’s actual winners’ list - shows nine unlikely winners of some of GQ’s biggest awards.

The Skeletor is hailed Man of the Year, Scrooge McDuck as Philanthropist of the Year, The Queen Alien as Woman of the Year and Paul Ross as TV Personality of the Year.

Another image circulating on social media (above) shows Mr Blair with his GQ award but has been digitally altered so the words 'The Irony' appear on the photo. One Twitter user described it as the 'joke of the year'

It also awards Solo Artist of the Year to disgraced Rolf Harris, Legend of the Year to fictional character Cthulhu and Ivan Drago as Sports Personality of the Year.

However, two of the most alarming ‘winners’ are Russian President Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year and North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year.

The mocked-up list has already been shared dozens of times on Twitter, with one user – called Andy – jokingly adding: ‘That’s gonna put some pressure of the Nobel prize list.’

The GQ Men of the Year awards ceremony is an annual event with gongs being dished out to high profile figures who have contributed in some way to society. Last year, Sir Bobby Charlton, Piers Morgan and boxing champion Carl Froch picked up awards.

The awards are decided by a judging panel at the leading magazine, which is a monthly fashion and lifestyle publication for men owned by Condé Nast.
