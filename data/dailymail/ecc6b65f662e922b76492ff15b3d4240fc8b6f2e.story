Taking a stand: Ann Hodges took pictures showing evidence of drug use and displayed the photographs at the entrance of the building

A tenant in a block of flats blighted by drug abuse has been forced to remove photos of syringes and blood stains she pinned to a ‘wall of shame’.

Ann Hodges snapped discarded needles and other drug paraphernalia she found at Denaby Court in Hull – and then displayed the evidence in the entrance hall of the high-rise.

But the 62-year-old has now been forced to remove the images by city councillors after they claimed it caused a ‘great deal of concern’ to other residents.

Mrs Hodges, who has lived at the flats for ten years, said: ‘I don’t go round with my eyes shut and I’ve found needles with spoons and foil, blood spattered up the walls and white powder that’s been dropped.

'I’m aware this sort of thing goes on in cities, but when it stopped being underground and was starting to appear outside our homes I started  taking pictures.

‘We’re dealing with drugs, urine and  faeces on a daily basis, and there are children coming here to see their relatives. Why should we have to live in these conditions?’

Denaby Court, which is owned and maintained by Hull City Council, originally only housed the elderly and a number of tenants with disabilities, however there are currently no age restrictions other than they will not allocate a high-rise flat to families with children under 12.

However, Mrs Hodges, who is the chairwoman of the Denaby Court Residents' and Tenants' Association, says 'hooded' groups of people have begun hanging around the building.

She decided to highlight the living conditions by creating 'a wall of shame' in the entrance hall next to a poster saying: 'This is happening in Denaby.'

However, she was soon told to remove the pictures by Hull City Council which she claims 'is not doing anything about it'.

Mrs Denaby said: 'It was hard not to miss when you came in, and I really wanted it to hit home.'

The photographs also include one of human excrement on the floor in a communal room where residents dispose of their rubbish via a waste shoot and two blood-splattered walls where Mrs Hodges believes drug users had been injecting themselves. 

Another elderly resident, who did not wish to be named, said she even confronted one stranger who she suspected had been taking drugs in a chute room.

She said: 'I was going to put my rubbish in the chute and he was in the room. 

'When he saw me he just stood there and eyeballed me. I love my flat, but it's getting frightening living here.'

Mrs Hodges said she is now being driven mad by the conditions of the flat but she refuses to move. 

She said: 'If I move, who is going to stand up for the people who can't. 

'I abide by the guidelines in my tenancy agreement and these people are bringing down the area. 'There are younger people here who respect where their live and we respect them. 

'When you live in a block of flats you have to consider the people who live around you and not just yourself. Everything you do impacts other people.

'Most of the older residents will look into the lifts before they get in them and if they don't feel comfortable with the people in them, they will walk downstairs and these are people with mobility difficulties.'

Laura Carr, City Neighbourhoods and Housing Manager at Hull City Council, said: 'The Neighbourhood Nuisance Team, Area Team, Housing service and Humberside Police have recently met with met with the chair of the residents' association, to work together to tackle anti-social behaviour within the block of flats. 

'The Council and Humberside Police are committed to dealing with any issues and are taking the appropriate action to ensure residents are safe within the area.'
