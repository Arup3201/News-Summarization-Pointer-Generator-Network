Republicans are cheering over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to dig in his heels by not compromising with President Obama over the mandated $85billion in spending cuts.

Because no deal was reached, the President had to order the beginning of the drastic sequester, forcing federal agencies to cut billions in accordance with a dramatic way to cut down the deficit.

Though his blatant show of partisanship may strike some as callous, it is winning him a lot of points from conservative members of his party who previously felt that they were being ignored.

Facing public scrutiny: Neither side looks particularly good from the sequester fight but Republicans are very supportive of Speaker John Boehner's tough approach and his refusal to negotiate

President Obama cast blame on Congress for failing to avoid the sequester cuts

'He’s doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and I think it’s working to our favor and to his,' Representative Mick Mulvaney said to The New York Times.

'I get the feeling that our party is probably more unified right now than it has been at any time in the last several months.'

At the beginning of the year, Mr Boehner was not the most popular man in his party and there were even rumblings that he may be unseated. The tides have clearly shifted as he leans in towards the right of his base. 

'We asked him to commit to us that when the cuts actually came on March 1, that he would stand firm and not give in, and he’s holding to that,' conservative Republican Steve Scalise told the paper.

'I think Friday will be an important day that shows we’re finally willing to stand and fight for conservative principles and force Washington to start living within its means. And that will be a big victory.'

Mr Boehner has also won himself a big-name fan in Mitt Romney, but his support comes more at Mr Obama's expense rather than as a result of Mr Boehner's tactics.

'Well, no one can think that that's been a success for the President,' the former presidential candidate said in his first post-campaign interview with Fox News Sunday.

'He didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening, but to date, what we've seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. That causes the Republicans to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It's a very natural human emotion.

'The President has the opportunity to lead the nation and to bring Republicans and Democrats together. It's a job he's got to do, and it's a job only the President can do.'

President Obama officially signed off on the $85billion in spending cuts on Friday night after congressional leaders fail to compromise on a replacement deal, leaving thousands of Americans in fear for their jobs. 

Sharing his thoughts: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that the sequester is not a good move for President Obama and he blamed his former opponent for 'forcing' Republicans to dig in their heels

The letter was formally sent to Mr Boehner at 9pm on Friday night and was welcomed by no one involved, as both the Republicans and Democrats agree that it is a bad deal that can drastically damage the country's economy but neither are willing to give in.

'The Joint Committee sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It was never intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way for our Nation to achieve deficit reduction,' the formal letter kicking off the seven months of spending cuts reads.

The President made his displeasure with the deal known in a formal statement from the pres briefing room.

'Starting tomorrow, everybody here, 
all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol … They're going
 to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a 
pay cut, and they got to figure out how to manage that,' Obama said.

'That's real... that's not a scare tactic.'

Obama made the remarks from the White
 House following a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Democratic leaders Nancy 
Pelosi and Harry Reid.

Boehner emerged from the
 meeting and told reporters that taxes were off the table as an option 
to avoid the spending cuts, making it clear that no compromise had been 
made.

'The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over,' he said. 'It's about taking on the spending problem.'

In an interview with NBC later in the day, Boehner said he never really saw a path forward that avoided the sequester.

'If I did, that meeting at the White House today might have gone better,' he said.

Obama blamed Republicans for the country's predicament, claiming that there are many conservatives on Capitol Hill who agree with him, but are unwilling to say so publicly.

'We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and the country on this,' he said.

President Obama wanted to replace the so-called sequester with a plan that would raise revenues as well as make a series of targeted spending cuts. But after making concessions on taxes in December by raising rates on the wealthiest of Americans, Republicans said they were unwilling to include new revenues in a plan to avert the sequester.

Asked why Congress was not even in 
session on the sequestration deadline day, Obama snarled that he could 
not employ a 'Jedi mind meld' to force cooperation between lawmakers.

'I'm not a dictator,' he said. 'I'm the president.'

The

 immediate impact of the reductions remains uncertain, even as Obama has
 declared it would mean 'hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.'

The

 administration has pulled back on earlier warnings of long lines 
developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms.
 Because of those claims, Obama has been accused of posturing and exaggerating the effects of the cuts.

His warnings of economic doom appeared to be a partial attempt to avert blame in the future if the economy begins to contract.

'Every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month, two months or six months...  We'll know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act,' he said.

'I don't anticipate a huge financial crisis, but people are going to be hurt. The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have,' Obama said

Industries most affected by the cuts 
will be those that rely heavily on government funding, including the 
military and defense contractors.

'Communities near military bases will take a serious blow,' Obama said. 'Border patrol agents, FBI agents ... 
all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.'

While Obama warned off mass layoffs and smaller salaries as an immediate result of the cuts, he also hedged his warnings, saying, 'This is not going to be an apocalypse... It's just dumb.'

He urged Congress to continue working on a plan to eventually replace the sequester.

'I don't anticipate a huge financial 
crisis, but people are going to be hurt, he said. 'The economy will not grow as 
quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it 
would have.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch 
McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Senate Republicans would pursue a plan to maintain the sequester cuts but target them more intelligently.  He reiterated 
that tax increases were off the table.

'I want to make clear that any 
solutions will be done through the regular order, with input from both 
sides of the aisle in public debate,' he said. 'I will not be part of 
any back-room deal and I will absolutely not agree to increase taxes.'

The meeting at the White House between Obama and congressional leaders, which
 lasted just under an hour, ended around 11:10 a.m. No
 breakthrough was expected to come out of the talks. But the meeting was 
an opportunity for all sides to stake out their fiscal positions with 
the threat of a government shutdown looming less than four weeks away.

Boehner said Congress will move next week on a measure to maintain government funding after March 27th.

On the Senate floor Thursday, a Republican 
proposal requiring Obama to propose alternative cuts that would cause 
less disruption in essential government services fell to overwhelming 
Democratic opposition, 62-38.

Moments later, a Democratic 
alternative to spread the cuts over a decade and replace half with 
higher taxes on millionaires and corporations won a bare majority, 
51-49, but that was well shy of the 60 needed to advance. Republicans 
opposed it without exception.

In a written statement after the votes, Obama lambasted Republicans.

'They voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class,' he said.
