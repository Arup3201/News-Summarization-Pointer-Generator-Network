Two Asian women accused of working in a brothel controlled by alleged 'Pimp Daddy' William Thomas have had their cases dismissed due to lack of evidence.

Jung Lee, 28, and Rei Spain, 38 were accused of selling sex from the house on East 50th Street in Manhattan's Midtown.

But their case was thrown out by the Manhattan Supreme Court after prosecutors were unable to link the women to a sum of cash recovered from the premises.

The pimp next door? Brooklyn stroller dad of four Will Thomas lived a 
double life as a doting father and the alleged mastermind behind 
Manhattan brothels

Thomas, 42, who is charged with 
running an Asian prostitute ring, was known around his Brooklyn 
neighborhood as a doting father-of-four.

The former IT expert, allegedly set up websites that sold sex with Asian women for $300 an hour.

The two women were arrested in an undercover sting last October when they offered sexual services to a cop posing as a punter.

According to court papers, Lee told the officer that she gave 'Girlfriend Experience' which means sex without a condom.

When
the cop asked for a Japanese girl Rei Spain replied, '(They) don’t do 
full service, only massage and “happy ending” for $100 plus $40 tip,' 
according to court papers.

Available for hire: The E4A website provided photographs of escorts in various outfits

Thomas is charged with running brothels in the Financial District, midtown and Hells Kitchen, court records show.

Websites E4AKorea.com and E4ANY.com have now been taken down but advertised for the 'authentic girlfriend experience'

A
source said Thomas married his second wife, half-Korean beauty So 
Young, who apparently had the connections he needed for his business 
venture.

They had a daughter, now three, but divorced in March, a source told the New York Post.

Thomas
was arrested and charged with promoting prostitution after an 
undercover cop posed as a customer who wanted to have sex with an Asian 
woman.

He connected with 
Thomas on websites www.E4AKorea.com and www.E4ANYC.com. The 42-year-old 
was arrested on October 11 and posted $10,000 bail two days later.

Hookers are shown posing topless and in lingerie on his website, for services at his brothels.

The
undercover officer kept in touch with Thomas by email and text and 
'became a member of the E4AKorea private men’s club', prosecutors said 
in court.

Neighbors said he 
had been living quietly in an apartment in Fort Greene with his 
one-year-old son, the boy's mother and his three-year-old daughter from a
previous marriage.

'There was nothing suspicious or anything,' one neighbor said.

Another resident said he 'is a nice guy, very friendly, always says hello.'

The 11th-grader added: 'My dad is the upcoming story on nbc news if anyone wants to watch...

'Pretty
surreal to hear your dad’s name on the news in connection to a massive 
prostitution ring bust. had to happen eventually i guess.'

His last comment suggests he already knew something about the allegations or the arrest.
