Leopards are considered one of the deadliest predators in India thanks to their amazing ability to blend into the background before launching a surprise attack on its victims.

These images show the true extent of their camouflage, almost disappearing into the surrounding nature in a leopard camp in India.

Big cat conservationist Adam Bannister spent several months documenting the lives of 21 leopards for a a research project at the Sujan Jawai Leopard Camp in Rajasthan, and found that they often move very close to human settlements due to their ability to hide in plain sight.

Can you see it:  A leopard spotted in the Sujan Jawai Leopard Camp, Rajasthan, India managed to nearly completely disappear into its surroundings

Found it!: The leopard from the top picture has been circled - hiding at the foot of a rock among the dry grass

He said: ‘Leopards are responsible for
 numerous deaths in India, so when I heard about a village where people 
and leopards lived such in close quarters without incident, I had to see
 it for myself.

‘I have 
worked with the big cats in three continents, and experienced 
human-wildlife conflict first-hand and this area is truly unique in 
terms of how humans and leopards co-exist.

‘They see them more in a spiritual context. And there are still many more leopards out there - I'm sure of it.’

An easier one: The white markings on the tail of this leopard makes it less of a hassle to spot

Another tough one: The big cats are ambush hunters and rely on their patterns to be able to blend into the background and surprise their prey

Tiny cat: The leopard in this picture is easier to locate as it is silhouetted against the grey sky

Double trouble: Not one, but two leopards can bee seen roaming on the rocks in this photograph from Rajasthan, India

Peekaboo: The leopards' amazing camouflage is not just useful for hunting squirrels as in this picture, but provides necessary cover against their natural predator - man
