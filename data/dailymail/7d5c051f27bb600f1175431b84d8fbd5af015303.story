A mother who allegedly helped two thugs beat a man to death with a baseball bat had her three children in the house as the attack took place, police say.

Candie Dominguez, 35, is accused of helping to batter 35-year-old Jose Menchaca to death along with Daniel Lopez, 28, and Gabriel Moreno, 32, at her home in San Antonio.

A witness, who was in the house at the time, said Dominguez ordered him to take her three children into another room where they listened to Mr Menchaca's screams as he died.

Dominguez, Lopez and Moreno then dismembered the corpse, put in into trash bags, and hid it in the garage, concealing parts of the body on top of a grill, investigators say.

The attack took place at the end of September last year, and Dominguez and Lopez were arrested on October 3. Blood was found in Dominguez' bedroom, where officers think the attack took place.

Moreno was taken into custody three weeks later, and today officers raided another house in the northwest of San Antonio, saying they have recovered new evidence linked to the killing.

Gabriel Moreno, 32, was arrested along with Dominguez and Lopez last year. Police have today raided another house in search of more evidence

This morning officers raided a home on 9100 block of Canter Horse Drive, located in Northwest Bexar County, though they have refused to say what was discovered.

According to an affidavit filed back in October, officers spoke to a friend of Dominguez who was inside the house at the time of the murder.

He told police that Dominguez and Lopez had been arguing with the victim shortly before the attack took place on September 30 last year.

At one point, Dominguez told him to take her three children into another room where they heard the attack take place.

The youngsters reported hearing screams and a man shouting for help, and said they later saw a large amount of blood in their mother's bedroom.

The witness added that he saw Dominguez and Lopez putting Mr Menchaca's body into the trunk of a Chevrolet Suburban.

The man, who has not been named, later told a relative of Mr Menchaca about the attack, at which point the police were called.

Officer searched the house, discovered blood and signs of a struggle, and then discovered the dismembered corpse in the garage. Half a pound of methamphetamine was also discovered.

Dominguez, Lopez and Moreno all remain in custody charged with murder. 

Officer Doug Greene told Fox San Antonio: 'The investigation is not over. We will continue to investigate. We want to make sure we have all evidence that we can present a good strong case to the district attorney.'
