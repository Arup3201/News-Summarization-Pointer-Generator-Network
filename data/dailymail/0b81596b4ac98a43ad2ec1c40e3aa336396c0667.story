Princess Beatrice was in high spirits as she turned out to support Sam Branson and his team at the launch of the Virgin STRIVE Challenge today.

The 25-year-old, who is the sixth in the line to the throne, looked stylish and summery in a black and white houndstooth dress, which she accessorised with a matching handbag and classic black cardigan.

She was joined by Isabella Calthorpe, Sam's wife, who happens to be Prince William's one-time love interest and the half-sister of Cressida Bonas.

Today was the first time Holly has been seen out since announcing news of her pregnancy earlier this week.

Holly, the eldest daughter of Sir Richard Branson, announced on Tuesday that she is expecting twins.

The 32-year-old doctor shared the exciting news on her father's company website, as well as via her Twitter account.

Writing on Virgin.com, she explained that she wouldn't be taking part in
 the Virgin Strive Challenge with 
her family because of her pregnancy.

Happy news: Holly Branson told fans via Twitter today that she and husband Freddie are delighted to be expecting twins

In a
 blog post entitled 'Why I’m supporting, not joining, the Virgin Strive 
Challenge', she wrote: 'There are just days to go before the Virgin 
STRIVE Challenge begins and the whole team is getting very excited - and
 a little bit nervous!

'The
 epic journey from London to the Matterhorn starts with a marathon from 
the O2 Arena to Gravesend on August 7th. The core team of 10 people will
 be striving to reach the summit of the Matterhorn entirely under their 
own steam, with marathons, rowing, cycling, hiking and climbing all to 
come on a route of more than 1,000km.

'My brother Sam, cousin Noah and the team have been training and fundraising hard, and having a lot of fun along the way. As well as an adventure of a lifetime, the Virgin STRIVE Challenge is aiming to raise £750,000 to support young people in the UK to develop the life skills they need to reach their potential. 'Life skills is this year’s main focus for Big Change, and it is great to see the money raised by the Virgin STRIVE Challenge going towards such important and innovative projects to help young people thrive in life.'As one of Big Change’s Trustees, some of you have been asking why I’m now not taking part in the Virgin STRIVE Challenge myself.'Well, Freddie and I are delighted to share the happy news that we are expecting twins!'.She continued: 'After telling our families and all of the Virgin family too, we thought it was time to let everyone know - plus I don’t want anybody thinking I wasn’t up for the challenge of doing Strive!!'Thanks to everybody for their well-wishes and support so far.'
