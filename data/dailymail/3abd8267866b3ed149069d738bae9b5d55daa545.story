Kim Jong-un has rounded up the engineers and architects behind the deadly collapse of a North Korean apartment block and executed them by firing squad, it is claimed today.

More than 500 people, including high-ranking intelligence and police officials, are thought to have died when the 23-storey building crumbled in the capital, Pyongyang.

Kim, who was pictured touring a glass factory in photographs released today, was reportedly unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy last week, thought to have been caused by poor workmanship.

According to a Japanese newspaper with sources in North Korea, the key officials and engineers behind the building of the apartment complex have been rounded up and handed down deadly or severe punishment.

Four design and construction engineers were 
executed by firing squad and a military official in charge of the 
project was sent to a prison camp, a source told the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper.

One official has been photographed making a grovelling public apology to a large crowd near site of the collapse, which 
was then reported - unusually - by North Korea's official news agency.

But the photo was carefully shot so as not to include the debris from the collapse - instead it showed another apartment building close by.

Damage: The exact cause of the accident remains unclear, but shoddy construction is likely to be the cause as on-site directors and workers often smuggle away steel and cement to sell on the black market

The Japanese newspaper said that although the exact cause of the accident remains unclear, shoddy construction is likely to be the cause because on-site directors and workers often smuggle away steel and cement to sell on the black market.

Another Japanese newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, reported that the building was inhabited by top intelligence and police officials, which might account for Kim Jong-un's wrath.

The building is also thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party, and although it had not been finished, residents had started 
moving in around late November because it is understood only some 
interior work remained to be completed.

At
 least 92 households were believed to be living in
 the apartment complex when it came down.

Kim Jong-un has been known to order immediate death warrants against those who cause him serious grief, among them his uncle Jang Song-taek and members of his family, including children, it has been claimed by North Korean watchers.

The leader started an aggressive construction drive in the capital in 2009, but the projects were plagued by a shortage of construction materials, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun.

However, Kim pressed workers to continue building, including working hard and fast to complete a vast ski resort earlier this year in the Masik Pass in the eastern mountains.

Photographs released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency today showed him inspecting the Taegwan Glass Factory in North Pyongan province.  

Last month, satellite photos showed that the roof of a luxury villa belonging to leader Kim Jong-Un had collapsed, also due to faulty construction.

An American satellite image expert said the building appeared to be an aquarium that was built in 2011.

Kim Jong-Un had used material imported from Italy and Germany and had then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life including dolphins brought in from China.

North Korean defectors said that military engineers were responsible for building Kim's person villas.

A source told the South Korean newspaper: 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing.

'This frantic push to meet deadlines is everywhere causing problems with quality.'
