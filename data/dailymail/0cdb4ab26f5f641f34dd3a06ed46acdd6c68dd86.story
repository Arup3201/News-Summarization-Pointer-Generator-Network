Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said today that she will run to keep her job, and appeared combative as a reporter asked a question in regard to the 72-year-old's age.

While the mood in the room was predominantly light, tensions rose when the question was posed by NBC News reporter Luke Russert.

Russert asked Pelosi about 
the impact of her decision on a younger 
Democrat hoping to rise up the ranks and energize the party.

He
asked: 'Some of your colleagues privately say that your decision to 
stay on prohibits the party from having a younger leadership and hurts 
the party in the long term,' he said. 'What's your response?'

At first, Pelosi shrugged off the question as her supporters blasted the question as 'age discrimination.'

But
then Russert asked again: 'No, excuse me. You, Mr Hoyer, Mr Clyburn, 
you're all over 70. Is your decision to stay on prohibiting younger 
members for moving forward?'

Pelosi
pushed back, saying: 'Let's for a moment honor it as a legitimate 
question, although it's quite offensive. You don't realize that, I 
guess.'  

Eventually, however, Pelosi got the final word with an answer to the question: 'No.'

Russert is the son of longtime Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2008.

Pelosi said she would remain as Democratic leader in the House after a pair of elections that kept the party in the minority there even as Democrats gained seats in the Senate and a second term for President Obama.

'My colleagues made it very clear: "Don't even think of leaving,"' she recalled at a news conference, surrounded by female lawmakers.

'I have made a decision to submit my name to my colleagues to once again serve as the House Democratic leader.'

Republicans reacted to news of her decision to remain with scorn.

'There is no better person to preside over the most liberal House Democratic caucus in history than the woman who is solely responsible for relegating it to a prolonged minority status,' said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. 

'This decision signals that House Democrats have absolutely no interest in regaining the trust and confidence of the American people who took the speaker's gavel away from Nancy Pelosi in the first place,' he said.

Pelosi has represented a San Francisco area district in the House, and was first woman in history to serve as speaker.

The tea party-fueled political wave of 2010 forced the gavel from her hand to Rep John Boehner, an Ohio Republican.

Holding a news conference Wednesday morning, Pelosi said 'we're very, very proud' of how large a role women played in the November 6 election.

'We don't have the gavel' of majority 
status in the House, she said, 'but we have unity. I think our caucus 
this morning demonstrated that very clearly.'

'We must have the further empowerment
of women,' said Pelosi, who noted that when she came to Congress there 
were 23 women in the House compared to over 60 of the seats in the 
House.

'Not enough. We want more,' she said.

Even after the 2010 elections, when her party lost 63 seats, Pelosi was reelected Democratic leader by her caucus.

Pelosi's colleagues had said for days that the top leadership post was hers if she wanted it in the next Congress that begins in January.

She refused to reveal her plans for a week after the November 6 elections failed to give Democrats gain they wanted.

It was a disappointing, but not unexpected result of a bitter year of elections that focused on the tight contests for president and control of the Senate.

Throughout, Pelosi raised millions of dollars for Democratic House candidates and insisted that the 25 seat gain was within reach.

But in the end, Democrats will gain at most eight seats and Republicans will keep their majority.

Waiting in the wings of Democratic ranks was Pelosi's deputy, Democratic Rep Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the party whip, whom she has known since they were congressional interns, and South Carolina Democrat James Clyburn, assistant to the Democratic leader.

Pelosi is the daughter and sister of former Baltimore mayors.

Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., served as mayor of Baltimore for 12 years after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also served as mayor.

If Pelosi, 72, hadn't sought the Democratic leadership post again, it probably would have gone to either Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland or Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.

She said she didn't want to lose her place at the negotiating table with Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Boehner.

She said 'he thought of four men at that table' wouldn't exactly square with her longtime goal to 'empower women in the workplace.'
