Kristina Chesterman, a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was killed by a suspected drunken driver last year before she ever got a chance to travel, learn how to fly a plane or ride a camel.

But now Susan Vieria, 64, has made a commitment to fulfill all the wishes on the bucket list of the young woman whose heart is beating in her chest.

Chesterman, from Livermore, was left brain dead after a car operated by 19-year-old Riley Hoover slammed into her bike just a block from her home near Chico State University campus last September.

The beautiful college sophomore was studying to be a nurse because she wanted to save lives, and she was also a registered organ donor - a decision that ended up giving at least five people, Vieria among them, a second chance.

Three days after Chesterman’s horrific accident, the 64-year-old South Bay resident, who had suffered congestive heart failure, got a call from Stanford University Hospital saying that a match has been found.

‘I never dreamed in my life, how they would remedy my heart,’ Vieira told the station KCRC.

Later that same night, Vieria underwent a successful heart transplant.

With her health on the mend, Vieria took to Facebook in order to find her donor's family and express her gratitude for Chesterman's selfless act.

The 64-year-old woman and Chesterman's mother, Sandra, met face to face for the first time two weeks ago.

‘I felt an instant connection,’ Sandra Chesterman said. ‘I felt that I've known her for a long time. I felt comfortable right away. Even on the phone talking to her, I felt a connection.’

Although she is in her golden years, Vieria has vowed to Kristina's family that as long as she is physically capable, she will do all the things their daughter had aspired to do in her lifetime.

According to the late student's mother, some of the items on Kristina’s extensive bucket list were learning how to pilot a plane, travel around the world and ride a camel.

‘Kristina's waiting there to advise me,’ Miss Vieria said while sitting next to her donor’s mother.

According to San Jose Mercury News, the young woman also dreamed of running through a poppy field and flying in a hot-air balloon.

Besides Vieria, Chesterman has given a new lease on life to four other people, including two babies, one of whom got a portion of her liver, and family friend Sakariah Pappachan, who received a kidney.

Sandra Chesterman told the paper in February that ever since she was a little girl, Kristina was passionate about helping others. She often donated blood, and at age 18, she registered as an organ donor because it was ‘the right thing to do.’

The student’s family are currently working on building a health clinic in Nigeria that will bear Kristina’s name.

Meanwhile, her friends also have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, including skydiving, which Bridget Kline did over the ocean off San Diego recently.

Another fiend Chris Leslie took Chesterman’s photo with him when he flew first-class to Japan - something she always wanted to do.

‘You wonder why someone like that is taken so young, but I believe Kristina was one of those very rare people who was so complete as a person already. ... The rest of us are just a work in progress,’ Leslie told the paper.

Riley Hoover, the driver who crashed into Chesterman’s bike September 22, 2013, and then fled from the scene, is currently awaiting trial. He could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted of hit-and-run, DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter.
