The founder of UKIP has set up a new Eurcosceptic organisation for those who feel his old party have become 'racist'.

Professor Alan Sked, 66, hopes the centre-left party, called New Deal, is a step away from the set-up under Nigel Farage, which he believes has become 'anti-immigrant and 'anti-intellectual.'

He also hopes to challenge the Labour Party and has considered opposing Ed Miliband in his Doncaster seat at the 2015 General Election.

New direction: Professor Alan Sked in 1993 when he launched The UK Independence Party.

Some of the policies the organisation will push include the re-nationalisation of railways and the scrapping of the bedroom tax.

He also believes many voters in Britain want to leave with the EU, but will not side with UKIP because they are too extreme.

His criticism of Farage's party began after a number of council candidates were exposed for having extreme 
right-wing links or homophobic views.

The new party could pose a significant threat to Labour as leader Ed Miliband faces increasing criticism for weak leadership and being vague on policy.

There are also plans for a candidate to stand against deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in his Sheffield constituency.

Sked, a lecturer in international 
history at the London School of Economics, told The Sunday Times he 
wanted a party dedicated to leaving the EU but was not too 
right wing.

'I think the majority of the people in this country want out of the EU,' said Sked.

'They would like a party devoted to the cause, but couldn't vote for one that was extremely right wing.

'They will now be given a serious alternative to the major parties and UKIP.'

Despite plans from David Cameron to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU, Sked believes the Conservative leader is 'trying to pull the wool over the eyes' of the country and his party.

The name New Deal is based on policies introduced in the United States by President Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1930's to lift America out of the Great Depression.

The party's draft manifesto states 
tolerance for minorities and is supportive of immigration which it 
believes is 'fundamental to the growth of an economically prosperous and
 civilised society'.

Other
 new deal policies will include the ending of welfare payments for those
 earning more than Â£100,000 a year, oppose the privatisation of Royal 
Mail and scrap the government's controversial high-speed rail plans.

It was officially registered as a party last week by the Electoral Commission and intends to field candidates at the 2015 General Election.

But, in contrast to UKIP, it will not be standing in European elections because Sked believed it would be 'hypocritical'.

Sked pointed out that when he founded UKIP, it had very limited financial resources and is ready to raise funds to help boost the new party.

His first involvement in politics was with the Liberal Party in Scotland but later rejected their pro-European stance.

In 1993 he stood in two by-elections, one in Newbury where he was supported by Enoch Powell.

He came fourth behind the major parties in both elections which prompted the Anti Federalist League (AFL) to change its name to UKIP.

Last month Godfrey Bloom, UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, provoked outrage after referring to countries in Africa which received aid from Briatin 'Bongo Bongo land'.

Sked added: 'These are the tired and false representations of a disappointed man.'

The party, which has been led by Farage since 2010, denies being racist or anti-immigrant.

A spokesman for the party said: 'Alan should be pleased with how well we are doing and the successes of the party he created.'
