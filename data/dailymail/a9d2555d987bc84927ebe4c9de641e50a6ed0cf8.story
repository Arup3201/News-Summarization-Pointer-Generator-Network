The Metropolitan Police has produced a 'need to know guide' on how to write an e-mail.

The 10-point list, which has been given to its 31,000 officers, offers advice on how not to 'prattle on' when  writing and sending messages.

Published in the latest edition of staff magazine The Job, the guidelines urge officers to 'write as they would speak' to avoid emails becoming too long and full of buzzwords.

Some of the advice offered appears obvious, such as 'check your email for mistakes before you send it' or 'give your email a subject title that explains what it's about'.

There are also tips on how to make emails more concise. Officers are encouraged to 'use-subheadings to break up the text' if their message is more than one screen in length. 

Including additional information via a link to another website rather than in the email itself is another helpful hint given to staff. 

If officers are writing to a large group of people, the list suggests 'putting the names in the "bcc" box to save space when the email is read or printed. 

The guide is published on the last page of the February/March edition of The Job under the head 'Put it simply'.

The article reads: 'Many of you frequently say that the emails we share inside the Met are too long and full of 'management speak. 

'Don't prattle on': One of the tips given to officers. Above, the Metropolitan Police's London headquarters

'If someone has to decipher what you've written, they probably won't bother to read it. 

'But if you can get your message across simply and clearly, they are more likely to respond'.

An orange box at the bottom of the page contains the 10 tips to help officers achieve this.

But not all officers think that the advice is necessary, according to The Times.  

A Met Police source told the newspaper: 'Most officers are either young enough to have been taught all about email at school or are old enough to have figured it out in the past 20 years or so.

'This guide might be helpful to someone who has just beamed down from outer space, but for most of the world it is like teaching your grandma to suck eggs.

'Who knows what's next? Perhaps a guide to tying shoelaces'. 

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'Like many other organisations, we encourage people to use plain English as standard practise.

'It was just a quick corporate communications reminder.' 

1. Give your email a subject title that explains simply and clearly what it's about; never leave the subject field blank.

2. To help people prioritise, include the words 'For action by [date] or 'For information'.

3. Write as you would speak - the words we use every day are words people can easily understand.

4. Start your email with a summary sentence that provides a quick view of why it was sent, for example, 'This email explains a new initiative and how you can take part.'

5. Be as concise as possible.

6. Rather than include lots of information in the email or in an attachment, link to information online and embed the link behind a word. If you have to include an attachment, save it as a PDF before sending.

7. If your email is more than one screen in length, use sub-headings to break up the text. You could also include a short contents list at the start.

8. Avoid forwarding the entire trail of previous emails unlesss it's essential that people see the history.

9. If you're emailing a large group of people, consider putting the names in the 'bcc' box to save space when the email is read or printed.

10. Check your email for mistakes before you send it.
