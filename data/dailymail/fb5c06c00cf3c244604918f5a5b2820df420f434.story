A neurologist has been stripped of his license by the NJ State Board of Medical Examiners after allegedly sleeping with a patient.

Dr. Jonathan Fellus allegedly had a sexual relationship with an unidentified woman, 33, who had suffered from a mild brain injury. 

She had been hurt in a car accident in February 2008 and subsequently suffered from episodes of weakness, collapse, seizure, emotional maladjustment and physical injury.

She was referred to Fellus by a neuropsychologist and the pair began a relationship, including sexual encounters, in 2008.

The relationship ended in March 2009 when investigators say he severed contact.

During their relationship, the doctor determined that she suffered a mild brain injury and some elements of post-traumatic stress disorder.

'The facts clearly show that Dr. 
Fellus engaged in a relationship with this patient, even though he knew 
or should have known she was suffering a diagnosed cognitive disorder 
and was physically debilitated by injuries she suffered in a car 
accident,' Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman told NBC Philadelphia. 'This 
relationship violated long-standing ethical standards and a specific 
Board of Medical Examiners rule prohibiting sexual contact between 
physicians and their patients.'

He had been placed on administrative leave while the case was underway and resigned in 2011.

Besides operating Advanced NeuroCare, he operated a private practice and was chief medical officer for the International Brain Research Foundation.

After three years, the doctor could be reinstated

The board said his actions “constituted gross 
malpractice, professional misconduct, lack of good moral character, and 
failure to comply with the Board’s rule prohibiting sexual conduct with a
 patient.'

'The Board of Medical Examiners’ 
prohibition of sexual contact with patients is intended to protect those
 who are vulnerable and who are attempting to heal,' said Division of 
Consumer Affairs Acting Director Steve Lee. 'The Board of Medical 
Examiners took the right action by revoking the license of this 
physician for violating this essential requirement.'

He must now transfer his patients to new doctors within 30 days, as well as pay a fine of $10,000 along with $34,450 in costs to the State.

Three years from now, he may have a chance to be reinstated.
