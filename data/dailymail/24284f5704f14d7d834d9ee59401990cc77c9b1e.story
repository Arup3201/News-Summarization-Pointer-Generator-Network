President Barack Obama has signed a new executive order that authorizes his administration 'to impose sanctions not just on individuals but on key sectors of the Russian economy,' he said Thursday morning.

Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One en route to Florida, he also announced a new raft of anti-Moscow choke-holds that the White House is attempting immediately to 'impose additional costs on Russia.'

'We're imposing sanctions on more senior 
officials of the Russian government ... [and] other individuals who 
provide material support' to them, Obama said in a brief statement.

He also announced new sanctions on Bank Rossiya, which he said 'provides material 
support to these individuals.'

Showman: Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) spoke Tuesday at a rally celebrating his annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol after what the U.S> and other governments called an 'illegal referendum'

Obama spoke for just a few minutes before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, en route to Florida for an economic speech and a Democratic Party fundraiser

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control listed the new targets on its website as Obama spoke.

'We've continued to be deeply concerned' about Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions, he said.

'We've seen an illegal referendum in Crimea [and] an illegitimate move by the Russians to annex Crimea.'

Putin's moves, he said, 'have been rejected by the international community and by the government of Ukraine.'

He said the world would back 'the notion that nations do not simply redraw borders ... simply because they are larger or more powerful.'

A senior White House official told reporters during a conference call following the president's remarks that new sanctions announcements could continue to roll out, and poked at some Russian officials who have portrayed a similar announcement on Monday as 'a slap on the wrist.'

It's 'very important to tell Russia that if they further escalate they will be met with severe consequences,' another senior official said on the call.

'Russia is far more vulnerable and would be severely isolated if we were to move forward with additional sanctions.'

'A whole slew of Russian officials' are being targeted, he said.

They include 16 prominent men with close ties to Putin, the Kremlin or the Russian military establishment.

Also, four non-officials are on the White House's newest list of 'designated' entities, including Yuri Kovalchuk, a billionaire who controls Bank Rossiya.

That financial institution is Russia's 17th largest bank, with about $10 billion in assets.

It 'will have any assets in the United States frozen,' the official explained, and 'will be barred from doing any business in the U.S.'

Rossiya 'will be frozen out of the dollar' to 'prevent it from operating to the greatest extent possible,' he said.

Reporters on the call heard a stern declaration that 'key sectors of the Russian economy are in play for additional sanctions' if Putin escalates the crisis by invading more of Ukraine, or other nations.

Those economic sectors that the president is focused on, the official said, include financial services, energy, metals and mining, defense and related material, and engineering.

Obama is traveling to Florida on Thursday for a Democratic fundraiser and a speech about the U.S. economy.
