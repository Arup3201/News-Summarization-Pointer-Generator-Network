An Afghan farmer is suing the Ministry of Defence for £300,000 after accusing British soldiers of beating him during his arrest and handing him over to the Afghan authorities to be tortured.

It is believed to be the first time an Afghan citizen has taken legal action against British soldiers and, if successful, could open the floodgates to further civil claims costing taxpayers millions of pounds.

According to papers lodged at the High Court in London, father-of-two Serdar Mohammed, 24, was irrigating his crops in Helmand province in April 2010 when a helicopter carrying British soldiers landed in a nearby field.

He claims the soldiers handcuffed and blindfolded him before  frog-marching him to a spot a short distance away where there were rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and an RPG launcher.

After telling the soldiers the weaponry was not his, Mr Mohammed was punched on his head and back, according to the court papers. In July that year, British forces transferred him to a detention centre in Helmand where he was allegedly beaten.

Mr Mohammed claims he was then moved to a detention centre in Kabul, where he was tortured into confessing he was part of the Taliban. The writ states that in a court case seven months after his arrest, without a lawyer present, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in jail, reduced to ten years on appeal.

Rosa Curling, of Leigh Day  & Co, which is representing Mr Mohammed, said: ‘The abuse our client has suffered must not be allowed to happen to anyone else.’

The MoD said: ‘The UK works hard to monitor the treatment of all UK-captured detainees transferred to Afghan custody.’
