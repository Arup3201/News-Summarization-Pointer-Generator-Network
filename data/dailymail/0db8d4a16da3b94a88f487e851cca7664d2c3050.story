She was renowned as a Hollywood star and style icon.

And now Audrey Hepburn is to be celebrated with a photography exhibition at London's National Portrait Gallery.

An exhibition about the actress's life and career will open in July and include family images of her at ballet practice and pictures taken during her early days working as a model in London.

Celebration: An exhibition of photos of Audrey Hepburn - including this shot taken by Norman Parkinson in 1955 - will open at the National Portrait Gallery in July 2015

Photographs from Life Magazine, taken during the making of her 1953 film Sabrina, will also go on show alongside posters for some of her most famous films.

The Belgian-born actress performed at Ciro’s nightclub, which now forms the gallery’s archive and study room, in a series of revues in 1949 and 1950.

The gallery’s deputy director Pim Baxter said: 'Audrey Hepburn was one of the world’s most celebrated actresses.

'I am delighted that the National Portrait Gallery will hold a major photography exhibition exploring the life and work of such a significant and much-loved figure who spent the formative early years of her career in Britain.  

The exhibition about Audrey's life will include pictures taken during her days working as a model in London - as well as this image, which was a publicity shot for 1954's Sabrina

The exhibition includes this photo taken by Sir Cecil Beaton in 1954. The Belgian-born actress performed at Ciro's nightclub, which now forms the gallery's archive and study

'It is particularly appropriate that the exhibition will be staged in such close proximity to where she performed as a young woman at the very start of her career.'

The exhibition runs to October 18.

As the world continue's to celebrate Audrey Hepburn's impeccable style, her granddaughter is continuing her legacy.

After spending most of her life out of the spotlight, Emma Ferrer is starting to make herself known.

The 20-year-old art student was seen at New York Fashion week in July strolling past the Lincoln Center accompanied by Harper's Bazaar British editor, Glenda Bailey, who last month crowned Emma as the magazine's September issue cover star.

Emma, whose 54-year-old father is Sean Hepburn Ferrer, Audrey's oldest son, was raised in Los Angeles and is currently in her third year at the Florence Academy of Art, in Italy. 

And although art is her primary focus, Emma is clearly taking tentative footsteps into the world of fashion as well.

Last month's coveted Harper's Bazaar cover saw her effortlessly re-create her grandmother's iconic poses, in a stunning spread shot by Michael Avedon, grandson of legendary photographer Richard Avedon, for whom Audrey was a longtime muse.

While her grandmother lost her life to cancer in 1993, a year before Emma was born, there's no denying that her legacy lives on within her.

'I've been questioning a lot lately what she means to me,' Emma told Harper's Bazaar.

'I knew her image, of course, and that I happened to be, by pure chance, related to her. But as a child I couldn't really relate to Audrey Hepburn, the actress. To me, she was family.'

And despite never getting the chance to meet her grandmother, Emma's father Sean told the publication that his daughter's similarities to Audrey are plenty.

'My mother was the same as she was on the screen: unassuming, humble, funny, emotional, strong, delicate,' says the father-of-three, who has also pursued an acting career as well as helping run the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund.

'Fortunately Emma has much better boundaries than either Mom or I ever had. But the genes are strong - and the comedic gene is alive and well.'

For Emma, the associations between her and Hepburn are unavoidable, and it's something she is slowly coming to terms with.

'Sometimes when I was younger, I felt confused toward what having a grandmother like her could mean in my life. But I am now understanding,' she said.
