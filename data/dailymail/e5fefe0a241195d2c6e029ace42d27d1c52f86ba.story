When Craig Parkinson had thousands of pounds worth of equipment stolen from his farmyard, the police took a statement, gave him a crime reference number, and drew up a list of the missing items.

But when a week later they appeared no nearer to catching the culprit, Mr Parkinson decided to take matters into his own hands.

The farmer and part-time mole catcher logged onto internet auction sites and searched first for a pressure washer similar to the one that had been stolen.

Not only did he find someone trying to sell a model identical to his, but when Mr Parkinson clicked on the seller's other photographs, he saw boxes of his stolen gear lined up in the background.

After duping the seller into agreeing to a viewing, Mr Parkinson carried out a secret reconnaissance of his property - then handed over his dossier of information over to police.

Officers acting on Mr Parkinson's information raided the home of Christopher Taylor in Southport, Merseyside and arrested him and recovered the stolen goods. Inquiries revealed he had carried out 15 other raids.

During the raid officers found items worth around £15,000, including two expensive mountain bikes, that had been stolen from more than a dozen West Lancashire farms.

This week Taylor, 27, was jailed after admitting burglary at Liverpool Crown Court. 

Father-of-two Mr Parkinson, who owns a flock of 60 sheep and runs a separate mole catching business in Tarleton, Lancashire said: 'I was delighted to get the stuff back but I was very disappointed in the initial police reaction.

'They go on about rural crime killing business in the countryside and I agree with them, but it seemed they weren't taking this burglary seriously enough.

'I'm sure what I did is no different to the old days of victims of burglary going round the second-hand shops to see if their stolen stuff is up for sale. But I do wish police would do their bit more too.

'I'm sure that if I had not done what I did, I probably wouldn't have got my stuff back.'

Mr Parkinson discovered around £4,000 of machinery and stock had been stolen from one of his outbuildings in an overnight raid last September. Among the items taken were tools, fencing and containers.

He initially reported the theft to Lancashire police but lost patience when they had not tracked the thief down, and decided to do some digging for himself.

Within minutes of logging on to eBay, he saw his Ryobi pressure washer being sold by a man in Southport.  Other photographs posted by the vendor showed boxes of farming equipment stolen from Mr Parkinson's farm piled up in the background.

Mr Parkinson said: 'I couldn't believe the gall of him when I saw pictures of my stuff for sale.

'In the pictures, I could even see the rest of my stuff in boxes in the background. I said to my wife, Eve: "Come and look at this, it's unbelievable!".

'It was amazing that all of my stuff had been stolen and just days later I could see it all brazenly up for sale on the internet. I certainly didn't hold out much hope that I would ever see any of the items again but there it all was.'

'I rang the police to tell them about my lead and yet no one called me back. I was so worried I might lose my lead I sent the seller a message on eBay saying I was interested in buying the pressure washer.

'Amazingly he sent me a message back saying it was fine to take a look and gave me his address so I could come and view it.'

Mr Parkinson then staked out the house, noting down vehicle registration numbers of cars coming and going from the property and trying to see if he could spot any of his stolen items.

He printed out all of the pictures from eBay and gave them to Skelmersdale CID with his other information.

He added: 'I told them "That's all of the evidence, now go out and arrest them".

'It wasn't particularly difficult what I did; I was just so frustrated that no-one in the police seemed to be taking the case seriously.'

'I was really disappointed in the police but mainly I just wanted to stand up for small businesses. I didn't think that they were taking the burglary seriously so I took matters into my own hands.

'To me £4,000 is a lot, and I know that most of the time victims of crime like this don't get the stolen items back.

'I'm pleased he's been caught: these yobbos need to know that their behaviour is not acceptable.'

At Liverpool Crown Court Taylor was given a five-month prison sentence plus an additional eight months after inquiries revealed he carried out his raids whilst under a suspended jail term for wounding.

His lawyer Michael Hagerty said Taylor had been unemployed and in financial difficulties at the time of the offences.

Sgt Steve Monk, from Lancashire Police, said: 'The warrant was issued after we received community intelligence. We are always grateful for this and do rely on local residents helping us to fight crime.'
