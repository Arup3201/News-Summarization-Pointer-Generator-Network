Tragic: Andrew Holt had only married Lydia nine months before he collapsed and died from a rare heart condition while playing football

A newlywed husband collapsed and died aged just 23 from a previously undiagnosed heart defect whilst playing football with his friends.

Andrew Holt was taking part in a five-a-side match when he suffered a cardiac arrest and fell to the ground.

Staff at a leisure centre where the Stockport, Greater Manchester resident, was playing battled to save him but he died later in hospital.

An inquest was told Mr Holt, an insurance administrator,Â  had only married wife Lydia nine months before his death on April 16.

He never knew he had been suffering throughout his life from a rare condition which affects only one in 500,000 people.

The condition known as anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) - meant a main blood vessel to one of the heart's chambers was not carrying oxygen-rich blood.

The Stockport hearing was told inquest heard how Mr Holt, who worked for Swinton Insurance in Manchester, was a 'fit and healthy young man' apart from the ALCAPA.

He loved football and would play up to three times a week. Tragedy struck when he was taking part with friends in a regular five-a-side match at Priestnall School in Stockport.

Dr Mary Shepperd, a consultant cardiopathologist, told the court that the condition did not show any symptoms and usually became apparent when people suddenly died, often during childhood.

She added that Mr Holt's heart had compensated over the years but the congenital defect meant one of the chambers had become scarred, eventually leading to cardiac arrest.

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'He lived a life for 23 years with a very serious condition, completely unaware and with no symptoms. It was a rare condition that was no doubt the cause of his death.'

After the inquest Mr Holt's family said in a statement: 'We are still absolutely devastated and in shock and find it very difficult to carry on without him.

'He was a warm and very caring person, he really loved people and was always willing to help.

'He was held in high regard and with such warm affection by so many people.'

At the time of his death, it emerged Mr Holt had become an uncle for the first time just a few hours before he died after his brother Nathan had a son.

Friend Liam Mcleod said: 'He will always be remembered for his loving personality and amazingly funny sense of humour, making everyone he knew laugh.

'Everyone who knew him will have a special place in their heart for Andy because of how loving, special and funny he really was. His unforgettable smile that was so cheeky and charming.

'He really was a loving and devoted husband, a treasured and affectionate son, an incredibly loved brother and an amazing friend to have.

'Anyone who knew him was blessed to have spent time with him. We miss you Andy and we will always love you. My personal love goes out to his friends, family and his wife.'

In a joint statement, Stockport council said: 'Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of the young man following this tragic event.'

Carolyn Callan, director of Swinton commercial where Mr Holt worked said: 'We are absolutely devastated. Andy was an all-round lovely guy.

'Nothing was ever too much trouble for him. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.'

Happy: The couple and wedding guests. Andrew was desrcibed as a 'loving and devoted husband, a treasured and affectionate son, an incredibly loved brother and an amazing friend to have'
