From Amy Childs to Lauren Goodger, the stars of The Only Way Is Essex are no strangers to cosmetic surgery.

So when Abigail Clarke, 23, from Chigwell, Essex, joined the reality TV show two years ago, she followed suit because she felt under pressure to look perfect.

She decided to have lip filler injected to enhance her pout but lived to regret it as she ended up with painful, swollen lips.

'When everyone looks amazing, you can think maybe I could do this, especially as some of the girls had work done. I asked them for advice,' she said of her decision to have the treatment after joining the cast of TOWIE. 

'I wasn't really thinking about the needles, just about the results.'

But the procedure didn't give her the look she'd hoped for. Her lips became swollen and painful as she had a bad reaction to the filler.

She explains: 'The filler reacted in my lips and I got a wedge of it that was pushing out on either side. I thought if my lips crack, that will be it, my face will be ruined for life.'

The swelling did subside but the lumps of filler remained making her lips look and feel uneven. 

'I regret how my lips are now, I can hide the lumps of filler with make up but it feels disgusting,' she told TV presenter Katie Piper on Channel 4's Bodyshockers.

The make-up artist agreed to appear on the Channel 4 show in the hope she would make other people think twice about having surgery to change their looks.

She said: 'Now my lips are bruised and painful, I didn't realise how fake the filler would make me look. I have ruined my looks for nothing. I didn't really need them done.'

Explaining more about her motivation to have the injections, Abi said she thought having a fuller pout would boost her self-esteem. 

'I thought my lips were going to make me happy and the one thing that would give me that confidence - but it made me more upset,' she said. 'I have realised that confidence doesn't need to come from my lips, it needs to come from me. 

'I need to have the confidence to be myself and to not want to look like all the other celebrities.'

Abi's parents reveal on the documentary how they also wish their daughter hadn't 'ruined her face'.

Her father said: 'Her lips were fine as they were, no parent wants their child to be adjusting things. 

'Her lips don't look natural now, they look painful.'

Her mother agreed. She told Abi: 'It looks like a blow up dolly. It breaks my heart you had to do that as naturally you had lovely lips.'

In a bid to get back to her natural look, Abi arranged to have filler removal treatment while being followed by the Bodyshocker cameras.

This involves having more injections in her lips to inject a chemical to break down the filler.

Despite the area being numbed first, Abi squeals in pain as the needle is inserted in her upper lip.

Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal who carried out the reversal surgery on Abi said: 'Abi came to see me after a lip augmentation with dermal fillers had unfortunately gone terribly wrong. Dermal fillers carry real risk of cyst formation, infection, allergy and scarring and it's important to be aware of these as part of doing your research when seeking these procedures.

'Over several weeks I saw Abi in stages we worked to drain and remove deep cysts, free scar tissue and dissolve filler which had been misplaced.

'It was a painful process for her but she was been brave throughout, recovered well and is now looking better than ever.

'Cases like Abi's I see more and more, and it's important for patients to seek out the right qualified professional to undergo these procedures and not base their choice on cost. Finding a skilled professional you can trust Is priceless. They will always guide and help you and be there to help'you if things don't go as planned.'

Abi admitted the painful reversal treatments were worth it to rid her lips of the lumpy filler once and for all.

She said: 'I'm really happy, I feel so normal now but my lips will never be the same or as tight and nice as they once were.'

Abi said she's learnt her lesson and doesn't intend to have any more cosmetic surgery for the foreseeable future.

'I'm embracing the natural look now,' she said. 

AMY CHILDS  

Amy, 24, admitted last year that she became 'addicted' to plastic surgery after having her first boob job when she was 18.

After that she had another breast enhancement as well as Botox and multiple lip filler procedures.

She has since had the lip filler reversal treatment that Abi endured saying she regretted having so many procedures so young.

LAUREN GOODGER  

Lauren, 28, went under the knife to have a nose job in 2011. She also had a boob job which increased her breast size to 34E to D.

Since first appearing on TOWIE, her cheeks and lips have become noticeably fuller prompting speculation that she has had numerous filler treatments.

CHLOE SIMS 

Chloe, 32, has made no secret of her numerous cosmetic procedures. She's had Botox and fillers, teeth veneers, two boob jobs and a bottom lift.

In total she's spent more than £32,000 on treatments but she admitted in 2013 that she went too far and hated being nicknamed 'Plastic Chloe'.

Lauren, 32, had a nose job to rid herself of a bump on her bridge and has also had boob jobs. She had to have some implants removed after the PIP scare. 

She's also thought to have had Botox and fillers.

 Bodyshockers is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm
