Greggs the baker is being forced to change the name of its best-selling Cornish pasty under new EU laws because the product contains peas and carrots.

The new rules mean manufacturers must follow the traditional recipe of beef, potatoes, onions, swede and seasoning, if they wish to use the name.

Despite being one of the company's most popular products, Greggs have announced they will change their version to the beef and vegetable pasty in alignment with restrictions.

The baker is being forced to change the name of its product as, unlike in the traditional recipe, it contains carrots and peas

Cornish pasties were awarded PGI status in 2011 after a lengthy campaign by the Cornish Pasty Association to see their delicacy's name protected.

Protected Geographical Indication status prevents anything that is made outside the designated region from using the traditional name.

A Greggs spokesperson said this morning: 'Our great tasting Cornish pasties are available throughout the country, subject to customer demand.

'The name will change in 2014 because Cornish Pasties have achieved PGI status.'

They also prohibit anything that does not follow the traditional recipe of meat (no less than 12.5 per cent) and the selected vegetables (no less than 25 per cent). 

Though Greggs planned to buy stock from 
suppliers in Cornwall, the addition of extra vegetables to the recipe 
prevent them from using the name.

The baker is due to change the name of the pasty in the near future

Traditional pasties contain only beef, onion, swede and seasoning and are crimped on the sides

The company's website describes the product as a 'controversial' take on a West Country classic.

Other food and drink products that were awarded Protected Geographical Indication status in 2011 are Champagne and Parma Ham, as well as 42 other British delicacies. 

PGI status is one of three European designations created to protect regional foods that have a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics attributable to that area.
