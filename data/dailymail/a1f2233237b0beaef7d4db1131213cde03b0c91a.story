Families will have to prove their child¿s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts, said Labour MP Jon Cruddas

Parents should lose their child benefit if they refuse to immunise their children with the MMR jab, a senior Labour MP has suggested.

Families will have to prove their child’s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts, said Jon Cruddas, who is leading the party’s policy review.

The MP for Dagenham & Rainham suggested the measure, which is already in place in Australia, could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services.

However, Labour rushed to dissociate itself from the idea last night, saying ‘it is not part of the policy review’.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'There is no question of a Labour government ever taking child benefit away or punishing parents for choices they make on vaccinations.

'I don't know where that came from. It is not our policy. It is on the front of the newspapers but it is not true.

'We would never say child benefit is conditional on taking a jab,' he told ITV's Daybreak.

The idea emerged after the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has dropped to dangerously low levels in some areas.

The risks were underlined earlier this year when more than 1,000 people caught measles in Swansea. One victim, a man aged 25, died.

A senior party source said: ‘This is an example of the sort of measure which we want to see that ties public goods to how people behave as citizens.’

When he was still in power this summer, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that people who did not immunise their children would be denied some benefits to boost vaccination rates for diseases such as whooping cough and measles.

Exemptions would only be made on religious or medical grounds, he said.

Controversy has surrounded the MMR vaccine since the 1990s, when it was wrongly linked to autism in a now discredited study by the scientist Andrew Wakefield, published in The Lancet journal.

Dr Wakefield, who was struck off over the scandal, said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the MMR programme than they were about protecting children.

John Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham & Rainham, suggested the measure, which is already in place in Australia, could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services

He wrote on a website that in 1998, following an analysis of studies of the safety of the vaccine, he recommended the use of single measles vaccine in preference to the combined MMR jab. ‘This remains my position,’ he said.

In 2001, Tony Blair faced criticism after he refused to disclose whether his son Leo was vaccinated with the MMR jab. Although the Blairs hinted that Leo had been immunised, the former prime minister’s move to keep the decision a secret was blasted as it came at a time when there were public doubts over the safety of the vaccine.

It was not until seven years later in 2008 Cherie Blair confirmed in her autobiography Speaking for Myself that Leo had in fact been vaccinated.

Babies under six months cannot have the MMR vaccine. They usually have some antibodies passed on from their mother.

But Labour quickly distanced itself from the idea of linking jabs to benefits
