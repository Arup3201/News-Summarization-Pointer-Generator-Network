This new Volkswagen has a three-litre engine boasting 500bhp, can do 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds and costs a jaw-dropping £3.4 million.

The Volkswagen Golf Design Vision GTI is a one-of-a-kind superhatch, which has more than double the power of a standard Golf GTI.

With a top speed of 186mph, it is on a par with some of the world’s fastest supercars.

The new design's top speed, 186mph, means it is among the fastest in the world

While it bears some resemblance to a Golf GTI, the only thing it shares in common with the car is its windscreen

While it bears some resemblance to a 
Golf GTI, the only thing it shares in common with the big-selling German
 car is its windscreen.

It is slightly shorter, lower and wider than a standard GTI and has a set of huge 20-inch alloy wheels and 15-inch brakes to supply the four-wheel drive car with strong stopping power.

As a result, the car was incredibly expensive to produce, setting back Volkswagen around £3.4 million (4 million euros).

Volkswagen has no plans to put the Design Vision GTI into production, but bosses at the firm say the next generation Golf could take inspiration from it.

Klaus Bischoff, who headed up the team behind the Golf, said: ‘The design team's brief was to give a spectacular glance into the future of the GTI.’

TopGear.com described it as a ‘design study reflecting some of Volkswagen's greatest hits’.

In a road-test report, it said: ‘The GTI concept will do 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds and hit a top speed of 186mph. Not just fast for a Golf, but fast full stop.

‘We were under strict rules not to use full throttle, but after some heavy pleading, full throttle was briefly applied, and oh, our, God. The GTI just explodes in a hail of noise and more noise.’
