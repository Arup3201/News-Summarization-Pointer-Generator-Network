An employee at a South Carolina restaurant accused of being racist for throwing out a group of 25 black patrons has turned the tables on the customers - saying they were the ones who were using racist slurs.

Michael Brown went public earlier this month with his accusations that staff at Wild Wing Cafe in Charleston, South Carolina, asked him and his 24 friends - all African-American - to leave after a white customer said she felt threatened by them .

Mr Brown's post about the incident spread across social media with viral force and resulted in condemnations of the restaurant and the staff.

An employee contacted Radio Facts, a broadcast industry blog, and said it was actually the customers who were being racist.

The woman, who would not be named, 
told the site that because Mr Brown and his friends were such a large 
group, it took longer than expected to find seats for all of them 
together. While they waited, some customers - both whites and blacks - were seated before they were, she said.

'They
kept complaining about their long wait and were talking about how 
“whitey” was able to get seated, but they were not,' the woman wrote.

She added: 'They made this a racial issue before anything.'

As
they waited, the group became rowdy, the employee claimed and began 
refusing to get out of the way for other customers to enter or leave the
restaurant.

They also insulted a deaf girl because she did not move to let them through, the woman claims.

One
member also repeatedly used the N-word. That was when the female 
customer in question became uncomfortable and complained to an employee,
according to the woman.

Ignored: Brown says the restaurant's corporate office ignored his multiple calls to tell them about the incident

'When asked to stop, he threw out a long string of racial epithets against one of my co-workers,' the employee claims.

That version of events is totally at odds with the description Mr Brown has given.

'She
said there's a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by
your party, so she asked us not to seat you in our section, which 
totally alarmed all of us because we're sitting there peaceably for two 
hours,' Brown explained to WCSC. 'Obviously, if we were causing any conflict, we 
would have been ejected out of the place hours before.'

As Brown and the shift manager were talking, a member of his party began videotaping the conversation, which is when the manager became upset and refused to seat the group.

'I
asked her I want to be clear with you,' Brown told the station. 'I said so you're 
telling me I have to leave. She said I have a right to deny you service.
I said so you're asking me to leave because you're upset because he was
recording you, after we've waited for two hours, and after you've 
already pretty much discriminated on us, and she answered yes.'

Social Media: After Brown posted this on the restaurant's Facebook page, he finally got a call from the corporate office

Not satisfied: Brown says the restaurant's offer of a free meal isn't enough

Brown called the restaurant's corporate headquarters repeatedly to explain what had happened to the manager's superiors. But nobody ever called him back - so he turned to Facebook.

'I will never
go to Wild wings cafe in N. Chs again! We (Party of 25 family and 
friends) waited 2hrs, patiently and were refused service because another
customer (White) felt threatened by us. This type of racial 
discrimination is unacceptable and we have to put a STOP TO IT. The 
manager looked me dead in the face and said she was refusing us service 
because she had a right to and simply she felt like it. DO NOT SUPPORT 
THIS ESTABLISHMENT... PLEASE SHARE THIS POST... We need your help,' he posted on the restaurant's Facebook page.

After Brown's post started getting a bit of attention, the restaurant finally acknowledged Brown's complaint.

'We
got alerted through social media, so we always encourage our customers 
to respond to us or to comment on our social media pages,' Debra 
Stokes, the chief marketing officer for Wild Wing Cafe, told the station.

After the post, representatives for Wild Wing Cafe said they immediately responded and spoke to Brown.

'We
had a conversation,' said Stokes. 'It was a really good conversation. 
He and many of his family and friends were there about a month ago, and 
they are regular customers of ours. So, they were having a going away 
party, and they just didn't receive the experience that they have come 
to know and love.'

At no point did Stokes deny that Brown's story was true.

The restaurant offered Brown and his family a free meal for the entire group. But Brown isn't completely satisfied.

'We
weren't coming there for a free meal. When we came there that night, we
were coming to patronize the business. This is not a situation where 
you can just give us a free meal and everything is ok because it's 
deeper than that,' he said.

As of Sunday night, Brown's post was shared on Facebook nearly 3,000 times.
