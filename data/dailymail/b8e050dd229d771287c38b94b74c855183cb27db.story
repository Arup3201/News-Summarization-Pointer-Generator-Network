A man who murdered an underworld figure, dismembered his body, and dumped it in the ocean off Perth will spend 23 years behind bars.

Aaron Carlino shot 56-year-old Stephen Cookson twice in the head with a rifle as he slept on the couch in their East Perth apartment on December 15, 2012.

After the murder, the 30-year-old visited a brothel and a boxing match, then took more than a week to cut up the body into six pieces using an angle grinder and a knife, bury it on a private property, dig it up and dump it at sea.

The crime was discovered after Mr Cookson's plastic-wrapped severed head washed ashore the following month on a Rottnest Island beach, where it was discovered by a young girl beachcombing with her family.

'But for that fortuitous event, you might never have been caught,' Supreme Court of Western Australia Justice Stephen Hall said in handing down the sentence on Thursday.

Carlino pleaded guilty to manslaughter, saying he acted in self-defence after months of abuse by his mentor, but that was rejected by the prosecution.

During the trial, the jury heard a cash-strapped Carlino moved in with Mr Cookson after being promised payment of $500,000 to act as his driver, but soon became his personal assistant.

Carlino said he had amassed large debts during the global financial crisis as a result of a failed bar venture, and claimed he wanted to learn about legitimate business from Mr Cookson.

Justice Hall did not accept Carlino's assertion that he did not know his flatmate was a drug dealer.

The judge cited in his testimony that Mr Cookson had told him he 'knew too much' when he complained about the heavy-set older man's gambling and asked if he could leave.

Justice Hall accepted Carlino had been assaulted by Mr Cookson on that occasion - including having a spoon jammed into his eye amid threats it would be ripped out.

Mr Cookson also said he'd previously killed people, but it was not reasonable for Carlino to believe that meant he was next.

'You did fear him but your reason for staying was more complex than that,' the judge said.

'You ... still held out hope of being paid at the end of the year.'

But he eventually became angry and frustrated he had not received his money, Justice Hall said.

He said he accepted Carlino was traumatised by ill-treatment at the hands of Mr Cookson, but not to the extent that he did not know what he was doing or that it was wrong.

While Carlino felt trapped in a demeaning and abusive relationship, there was no real justification for what he did, the judge said.

He should have told police or his loving family, Justice Hall said.

'These events are of utmost seriousness,' he said.

Carlino's family wept as the sentence was handed down.

While the trial took three-weeks, it took the jury just a few hours to find Carlino guilty of murder.
