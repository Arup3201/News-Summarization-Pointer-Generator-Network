Police said Monday they were reviewing video of a fight in a restroom at Levi's Stadium that left one man in serious condition before the San Francisco 49ers game against the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the video, which has been widely distributed on the Internet, the two assailants and two victims appear to be wearing 49ers gear. 

The footage shows two fans raining punches down on two fellow fans, leaving one unconscious and the other lying on the floor desperately protecting his head.

Police said Monday they were reviewing video of a fight in a restroom at Levi's Stadium that left one man in serious condition

As punches are thrown other fans in the restroom can be heard urging those involved in the fracas to calm down.

The person filming the footage turns the lens towards himself and says 'wow', just before the clip ends. 

The suspects, Dario and Amador Rebollero, fled from the bathroom but were soon caught inside the stadium, said Santa Clara police spokesman Lt. Kurt Clarke. One victim was treated and released and the other was in serious condition. 

The Rebolleros were booked into county jail on suspicion of felony assault, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Clarke would not reveal the source of the video and said he did not know whether the suspects have attorneys.

Spokesman Bob Lange said the team is deeply concerned about the victims.

'We were appalled to see the video of the attack on the victims,' he said, expressing gratitude to the police. 'Maintaining the safety of all stadium guests is our highest priority.'

Levi's Stadium opened this fall after five years of planning and construction.

In Southern California, police were looking for three men suspected of brutally beating a man in the Angels Stadium parking lot after the Angels' playoff game on Friday night.
