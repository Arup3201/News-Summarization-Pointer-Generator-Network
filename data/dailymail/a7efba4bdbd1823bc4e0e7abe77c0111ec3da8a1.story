Maria Sharapova insists she will not get carried away by her ideal preparation as she looks to win the Australian Open for a second time in Melbourne.

French Open champion Sharapova warmed up for the first grand slam of the year by winning the Brisbane International last week, but is determined to keep her feet on the ground.

The 27-year-old Russian lost in the fourth round here last year to surprise finalist Dominika Cibulkova and said of her win in Brisbane: 'You can't be overly negative, you can't be overly positive. You just have to take things as they come.

'I wanted to start off well. I thought I did many things well. But, you know, I'm not going into next week throwing flowers at myself or anything. I'm starting from scratch. I'm hungry. I'm determined to do better. I lost in the fourth round here (last year). That's not a result I want. I want to do much better. I'm here to try to win the title.'

Asked if she considered herself the player to beat, Sharapova added: 'I'm sure I'm one of them, definitely. I mean, I'm number two in the world. I've had a great season last year, winning a grand slam.

'I think there are a lot of players that have an opportunity to win this tournament and I'm certainly one of them.'

US Open champion Serena Williams, who admitted she knew nothing about Belgian first-round opponent Alison Van Uytvanck, is the favourite to win a sixth title in Melbourne, but has not won Down Under since 2010.

The 33-year-old Williams said she believes she wants the title more than anyone else

'It would be really great,' the 33-year-old said. 'I've been going for number six for a number of years now. It would be really special for me. I would be really happy. I want it I think more than anyone else here. But that doesn't mean I'm going to get it, so I'll have to fight hard to get it.

'My preparation is okay. I'm not very happy with it, but I'm never really happy about my practice or preparation so maybe that's a good sign. I definitely feel better now than I did a couple of weeks ago but I still want to improve some things. I feel like I should be doing some things better.

'But every day I can see something coming through so there's a little light at the end of the tunnel.'

Sharapova will be in action against Croatia's Petra Martic in the evening session of the first day's play, but top seed Williams will have to wait until Tuesday to begin her campaign.

Third seed Simona Halep takes on Italy's Karin Knapp on Monday morning, with the likes of fifth seed Ana Ivanovic and seventh seed Eugenie Bouchard also in action.
