As Paris Fashion Week rolls on the major trends of the last month's global catwalk are already being dissected by the world's editors and style elite, and orders for the must-haves of next season are being placed by the fanciest fashion stores.

Despite being only a small part of a finished outfit, accessories are key in these thriftier times as consumers clamour to own a piece of their favourite label without the hefty price tag.

On Tuesday Stella McCartney showed off space-age sunglasses and skin-coloured heels at her show in the Palais Garnier, today Cara Delevingne showcased luxury backpacks and wonder wigs at Chanel, but it is belts all over the catwalks of New York, London, Milan and Paris that have caught the eye of the trend-forecasters.

For spring/summer 2014 designers including Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry and Pucci have all brought back the statement belt. The message is the bigger the better and huge buckles and extra hardware have added a tougher feeling to an otherwise feminine style.

Belts were a key look for the women of the 1940s and 1950s who defined tiny waists with full skirts and tight belts and for many design houses, specifically Christian Dior, it became a signature style.

Today we look at the trend from the current collections and possible inspiration from the archives.
