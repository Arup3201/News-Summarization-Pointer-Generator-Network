Tragic: Stephanie McLean, 23, had appeared to be fine before she collapsed and died at work

The family of a fit and healthy young woman who suddenly collapsed and died at work have paid tribute to the 'vibrant, sociable, witty and clever' 23-year-old.

Stephanie McLean, from Gosforth, Newcastle, had been planning to run next year's London Marathon to raise money for the British Heart Foundation and had even had a swimming trial for the Athens Olympics in 2004.

But her mother has now spoken of the pain of losing her child after she was struck down by sudden cardiac death.

Lesley McLean, 62, said: 'It is just devastating to lose a child. It has been very painful for us all and there is now an emptiness that can never be filled.

'Stephanie had hardly started in life. She has lost her chance to have a career, get married and have children. It is so heartbreaking.'

Miss McLean appeared to be fine as she worked at her desk at an online retailer in Wimbledon, London, before she collapsed and died in July this year. She was rushed to hospital but nothing could be done to save her life.

Her mother received the news of her death while she was on holiday in France.

She said: 'I got a call to tell me what had happened. It was dreadful and I flew back to Britain the next morning.'

Miss McLean's oldest sister, Joanna, 31, said she had been in contact with her just hours before she died.

She said: 'I was texting Stephanie the night before and I would never think that she was going to die the next day. That is something that you can never prepare yourself for.

Miss McLean said she, her sister Stephanie and their other sister Katie, 25, were very close and would often do things together.

She said: 'It is absolutely shattering what has happened and it has totally changed my life. We were friends as well as sisters and we were all part of each others lives.

'Stephanie’s death has left a massive gap that is never going to be filled, or could be filled. I love talking about Stephanie and want to talk about her as she will never be forgotten.'

Miss McLean's main ambition was to be a writer and had been working as a copywriter for Lensestore, a contact lens and optical advice website, to gain experience.

Miss McLean had been a competitive swimmer and even had a trial for the Athens Olympics in 2004.

She
was also a keen netball player. The last time she saw her mother was
when she had travelled back to the North East for a netball match held 
by her former school friends.

'Stephanie had hardly started in life. 
She has lost her chance to have a career, get married and have children.
It is so heartbreaking'

Miss McLean had planned to run next year’s London Marathon in support of the British Heart Foundation. Her boyfriend, Harry Tulip, 26, is now doing the run in her memory.

Mrs McLean said: 'I remember that Stephanie came home for the netball match and I was delighted to see her.

'When she left to go back to London I gave her a hug at the station and told her how much I loved her.'

It is estimated that up to 12 young people die suddenly each week in the UK of cardiac abnormalities, also known as sudden death syndrome or sudden cardiac death.

Sports activity in adolescents and young adults is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

It is believed sports activity can trigger an adverse affect on the heart's rhythm in athletes.

A charity walk in Durham for Cardiac Risk in Young People saw as many as 50 of Miss McLean's friends and relatives take part to raise awareness of sudden cardiac deaths in young people and raise funds to support medical research into the causes of the condition.

More than £11,000 has so far been raised by friends and relatives in memory of Miss McLean.

Her sister Joanna said: 'We want to raise the profile of young sudden cardiac deaths and make people aware that pre-emptive heart screening is available through CRY at their national screening days.'

Miss McLean's sister and mother have both said more heart screening should be available for young people. They have said they have also been 'overwhelmed' by the generous support of Miss McLean’s friends.

Her funeral was at West Road Crematorium, in Newcastle, where more than 200 people attended.

She also leaves behind her dad Neil McLean, 62, a plastic surgeon.
