Britain's Foreign Secretary condemned North Korea after it fired a long-range rocket to launch a satellite into space for the first time.

William Hague MP was among the international figures who described the move – which defied a world ban on ballistic missile tests – as 'provocative'.

It is feared the rogue state could be working towards a missile on which a nuclear warhead could be mounted.

Mr Hague summoned the North Korean 
ambassador to the Foreign Office to demand an explanation following a 
'clear violation' of at least two United Nations Security Council 
resolutions.

'This provocative act will increase  
tensions in the region. I deplore the fact that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea has chosen to prioritise this launch over improving 
the livelihood of its people,' he said.

Even China, North Korea's closest 
ally, expressed regret that a rocket was launched 'in spite of the 
extensive concerns of the international community'.

It was a rare show of Chinese 
solidarity with the White House, which labelled the rocket test 'a 
highly provocative act that threatens regional security'.

Japan angrily demanded an emergency 
meeting of the UN Security Council, which has punished North Korea 
repeatedly for developing its nuclear programme.

But the angry reaction did little to 
dampen spirits in the capital Pyongyang, where people danced in the 
streets after vans mounted with loudspeakers drove around streets 
announcing the news.

Its Unha rocket, named after the 
Korean word for 'galaxy', blasted off from the Sohae launch pad in 
Tongchang-ri, north-west of Pyongyang, shortly before 1am UK time 
yesterday. Pride in the scientific advancement appeared to outweigh the 
fear of greater international punishment and isolation.

After three failed attempts, North 
Korea, though struggling to feed its people, is now one of the few  
countries to have successfully launched a satellite into space from its 
own soil.

Bitter rival South Korea is not on the
list, although it has tried. North Korean space officials insist the 
rocket is meant to send a satellite into orbit that can study crops and 
weather patterns.

But Western experts note that  the 
technology involved in a  satellite launch is similar to that needed to 
develop a very long-range missile.

The launch of a rocket similar in 
design to one capable of carrying  an atomic-tipped warhead as far  as 
California raises the stakes in  the international standoff over North 
Korea's expanding atomic arsenal.

Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs.

However, experts believe the North 
lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile 
that could threaten the United States.

One part of the rocket landed
west of the Korean Peninsula and another part was expected to have 
landed east of the Philippines, according to reports.

American space expert Jonathan 
McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, said the 
three-stage Unha-3 rocket delivered the satellite into orbit and 
constituted 'a perfect success for North Korea.'

He said that based on his own calculations an object identified by US space command was from the North Korean satellite.

When North Korea announced its plans 
to attempt to launch a long-range rocket earlier this month Washington 
said such a move would be a 'highly provocative act'.

The
North has said the purpose of its Unha rocket is to put a satellite in 
orbit - but Washington regards the explanation as a cover for a test of 
technology for missiles that could be used to strike the U.S.

A
similar launch in April, which broke apart shortly after lift-off, was 
widely condemned, and this latest move is expected to provoke a similar 
reaction from the international community.

'It
was a surprise in terms of the timing,' said Bruce Bennett, senior 
defense analyst with the RAND think tank. 'They had talked about 
postponing for a week. To recover so quickly from technical problems 
suggests they have gotten good at putting together a missile.'

National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor called it 'another example of North Korea's pattern of irresponsible behaviour'.

In a statement, Mr Vietor said the US 'remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations', and will work with other nations and the UN Security Council 'to pursue appropriate action' against North Korea.

Japan also branded the launch 'completely unacceptable'.

Russia expressed 'deep regret' over the rocket launch on Wednesday, saying the reclusive nation had violated a U.N. Security Council resolution limiting its use of ballistic technology.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the North Korean launch had heightened instability in the region and called on other nations to refrain from further escalating tensions.

'The new rocket launch carried out by North Korea flaunts the opinion of the international community, including calls from the Russian side, and leaves us with deep regret,' it said.

The rocket launch was carried out on the orders of North Korea's Kim Jong Un, who took power after his father Kim Jong Il died on December 17 last year.

Ed Royce, incoming Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the launch showed that the new North Korean leader had no intention of giving up his nuclear weapons program.

Royce also criticized U.S. policy toward Pyongyang, calling it a 'long-term failure.'

'The Obama administration's approach 
continues to be unimaginative and moribund. We can either take a 
different approach, or watch as the North Korean threat to the region 
and the U.S. grows,' Royce said in a statement.

Rocket tests are seen as crucial to advancing North Korea's nuclear weapons ambitions.

Pyongyang
is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs, but is not 
yet believed to be capable of building warheads small enough to mount on
a missile that could threaten the United States.

North Korea has spent decades trying to perfect a multi-stage, long-range rocket. Experts say ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.

This is the fifth attempt at a long-range launch since 1998, when Pyongyang sent a rocket hurtling over Japan. Previous launches of three-stage rockets were not considered successful.

Washington sees North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as a threat to world security and to its Asian allies, Japan and South Korea.

North Korea under its new leader has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy.

The UN Security Council has imposed two rounds of sanctions on North Korea following its nuclear tests, and a 2009 resolution orders the North not to conduct any launch using ballistic missile technology.

The council condemned the failed North Korean launch in April and ordered seizure of assets of three North Korean state companies linked to financing, exporting and procuring weapons and missile technology.

Under Security Council resolutions, nations are also barred from buying or selling weapons with North Korea, a key source of revenue for its authoritarian government.

North Korea said it chose a safe flight path so debris would not endanger neighboring countries.

But there are still concerns over falling debris, and Japan's defence minister issued an order to missile units to prepare to intercept the rocket if it or its fragments threatened to hit the country.

Government spokesman Osamu Fujimura said that no debris hit Japanese territory.

The government was still confirming if there was any damage on Japanese territory from the launch, he said.

'We had strongly urged North Korea to refrain from the launch, but they went ahead nonetheless.

'This is completely unacceptable,' he said.
