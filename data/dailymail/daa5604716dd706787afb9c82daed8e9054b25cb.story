With a top speed of 1,320mph and a powerful 27mm Mauser cannon on board, the Eurofighter Typhoon can certainly pack a punch.

And this astonishing set of previously-unseen photographs documents life inside for RAF pilots inside the cockpit of the plane, which has a maximum altitude of 65,000ft. The set shows three Typhoons flying over the Falkland Islands, pilots training over airspace and performing in display formations.

There is also a cross-section of the aircraft - which has a length of 52ft and width of 36ft - and another photograph showing pre-flight checks. Also seen is the futuristic BAE Striker helmet, which enables the pilot to cue the Typhoon's sensors and weapons onto enemy aircraft simply by looking at it.

The images were released as part of a set featured in the RAF Typhoon Owner's Workshop Manual by Antony Loveless, which is out today.
