The unthinkable happened for many Google users on Wednesday morning when a number of its services simply stopped working for users.

Among the services affected were Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, Google Plus and YouTube.

Reports of outages began appearing on Twitter at 9:30 a.m. ET although it was 9:58 a.m. before the company first reported the problem.

‘We're investigating reports of an issue... We will provide more information shortly,’ the company posted.

By 10:40 a.m., Google reported that the problem had been resolved. 

‘We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and continued support,’ the company wrote on Google's Status Dashboard.

‘Please rest assured that system reliability is a top priority at Google, and we are making continuous improvements to make our systems better.’

Among the services impacted were Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, Google Plus and YouTube

Google said it received reports of problems from users in West Virginia, North Carolina, Nebraska and Georgia, reports CNN.

‘However, the issue was quickly resolved and is now over. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused our users there,’ Google said in a statement.

Google has not yet commented on what caused the outage and what was done to bring the systems back up.

Many of those impacted turned to Twitter to vent their frustrations or joke about the unusual state of affairs.

'#Gmail being down has brought my productivity this morning to a complete halt,' tweeted @whitnevgladden.

Adam Sullivan joked, 'If google is down... How will I ever google "why is google down?"'

Others used the opportunity to poke some fun at the recent NSA scandal.

‘Google and Gmail are down for me. Is the NSA doing an upgrade?,’ tweeted @averagesecguy.

The outage drove some users to rival search engines Bing and Yahoo, while prompting jokes on Twitter about the apocalypse.

Google goes down #1 search on Bing is 'Why is Google down?' and #2 search is 'What other search engines are there besides Bing?' @Fake_Dispatch.

‘Oh dear God it's the end of humanity as we know. Need to go buy bread and milk.#googledown,’ added Rebeccah Connelly.

'Google is like Walmart and Waffle House. It's supposed to be open 24/7. #GoogleDown,' wrote Grant McFerrin.
