The family of a seven-month-old baby, who was tortured and killed by his mother's de facto husband, has called on Immigration Minister Scott Morrison to ensure the killer is deported when he is released next week.

Ex-boxer Christopher Hoerler, 37, was sentenced to 14 years and four months - after prosecutors appealed the initial term of 11 years - for the manslaughter of Jordan Anderson-Smith in Wagga Wagga in 2000.

At the time of Jordan's murder, Hoerler was living de facto with Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson and Jordan's two half-brothers, who were aged 2 and 4.

Hoerler has been granted parole and is expected to be released next Thursday.

Jordan would have turned 15 on July 24.

The Crown prosecutor found that Jordan died from multiple injuries, including bruises and abrasions to his face, a torn lip, liver and bowel damage and crushed toes - which were inflicted when Hoerler put his then-girlfriend's son's toes in a clamp.

Christopher Hoerler will be released from prison on August 14 for the brutal murder of baby Jordan. Jordan's family are petitioning, to ensure Hoerler will be deported upon his release.

Baby Jordan died following a party at which his mother and her live-in boyfriend were drinking and smoking cannabis at their home in Wagga Wagga, NSW on February 25, 2000. Hoerler was tried for murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter 20 months after Jordan was killed.

Jordan choked on his own vomit after being beaten and tortured by Hoerler, with injuries including a lacerated liver, a torn lip, facial abrasions and broken ribs.

His toes had also been crushed by a clamp.

The forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem found that the baby's 'palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw, and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force'.

Jordan's injuries were so extensive that they took four days to document.

Jordan's father, Cecil Smith, had contacted the Department of Community Services when he believed Hoerler was showering with Jordan.

While Hoerler had his visa cancelled after he was convicted, and the parole board says he will be released into the custody of Immigration officials to be deported to Papua New Guinea, the family is not convinced and want assurances from the immigration minister.

The family has launched an online petition, calling on Mr Morrison to ensure Hoerler is deported when he is released on August 14. His sentence was due to expire in February 2016.

'The Smith family are extremely disappointed in the decision the parole board has made to release this convicted child killer back into the community' a statement on the petition website said.

In a statement, the State Parole Authority says in granting parole, it considered Hoerler's good prison performance and completion of programs addressing his offending behaviour.

Darcy Smith is appealing to the Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison to ensure Jordan's murderer, Christopher Hoerler, is deported when he is released from prison next week on August 14, 2014.

Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson, is pictured leaving her baby's murder trial in 2003. Christopher Hoerler was found guilty of brutally murdering seven-month-old, Jordan Anderson-Smith. Hoerler was Mrs Anderson's live-in boyfriend at the time of the murder.

Jordan's uncle, Darcy Smith has become the family's spokesman and is appealing to the public to support the petition and for the minister to 'step up to the plate' and ensure Hoerler is ousted.

Mr Smith believes Hoerler may appeal the deportation condition of his release because he had children in Australia and wanted to be a father to them, Fairfax newspapers say.

'He is trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to stay in the country,' Mr Smith said.

'I hope the minister is smart enough to see through that.'

Previously, Mr Smith has spoken of the family's intense and unrelenting grief.

'We are the ones living with the life sentence. We have to live without Jordan every day.' They explained that their mother, Jordan's paternal grandmother, visits Jordan's grave every Sunday.

The Smith family have previously explained that Hoerler had moved into the home only three weeks before he murdered Jordan.

Hoerler met Ms Anderson on New Year's Eve in 1999, but by less than two months later, on February 25, 2000, he killed her son.

The baby's father had attended school with Hoeler and once considered him a friend.

Two parole applications have been rejected since July 2012, when his 10 year 9 month non-parole period expired.
