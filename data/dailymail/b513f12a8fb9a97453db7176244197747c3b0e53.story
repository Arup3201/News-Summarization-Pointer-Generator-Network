The Briton accused of murdering his wife on honeymoon can face trial in South Africa.

Home Secretary Theresa May has rubber-stamped an order that Shrien Dewani be extradited to answer claims he masterminded the killing of 28-year-old Anni.

But the 31-year-old care home owner has signalled he will continue his legal fight and has 14 days to lodge an appeal.

Decision: Shrien Dewani is a step closer to being extradited to South Africa

Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, denies claims he offered to pay two hitmen £1,400 to carry out the killing.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo has already 
been jailed for 18 years after admitting his part in the crime. Two 
other men, one seriously ill with a brain tumour, face trial next year.

Police insist that Dewani is central 
to  the plot and plan to charge him with  conspiracy, murder, kidnap, 
robbery  and obstructing justice.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'On Monday September 26 the Home Secretary, having carefully considered all relevant matters, signed an order for Shrien Prakash Dewani's extradition to South Africa.

'Mr Dewani now has the opportunity, 
within 14 days, to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the 
District Judge and/or the Home Secretary.'

Mrs May's decision came after District Judge Howard Riddle ruled at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court last month that Dewani, 31, should be sent back to South Africa to stand trial.

Suspicion fell on him after Mrs Dewani, 
28, was shot dead when the couple's cab was hijacked in the dangerous 
Gugulethu township.

Victim: Mrs Dewani was just 28 years old when she died

Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit on his wife.

Dewani, who is said to be suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, denies any wrongdoing.

It was reported earlier this month that he had hired a team of private investigators to hunt for fresh evidence on his wife's death.

He is believed to have spent £40,000 on top lawyers to help fight his defence if he is extradited.

The company boss has argued that he would be denied a fair trial in South Africa, and said he could be abused in prison.

The Home Secretary's ruling was welcomed by Mrs Dewani's family today.

Ashok Hindocha, her uncle, said: 'We are very happy about this decision. We were expecting this but we weren't expecting the decision to come this early.

'It shows that finally the system is working and we're happy that this can come to a closure.'

The Hindocha family handed in a petition to the Home Office last week, imploring Mrs May to ensure Dewani was extradited.

Dewani standing trial is the only way they can get the answers they need, they say.
