A suspected Ebola victim has appeared at the window of the Spanish hospital's isolation ward holding up a placard with his temperature as the number of people being monitored for the deadly virus grows.

The unidentified man was pictured with the placard stating 36.1C and flashing a victory sign at the same Madrid hospital where Spanish nurse Teresa Romero is battling the infection.

It comes after it was revealed today that a total of 16 people are now being monitored at the Carlos III hospital for signs of the disease after coming into contact with her.

Those in the isolation unit are being held on the fifth floor on the hospital, while Mrs Romero, 44, is being cared for on the sixth floor.

It is thought that the man showed the sign bearing his temperature, as one of the first signs of the deadly virus is a fever. It is generally consider a normal body temperature can range from between 36.1C to 37.2C.

Also pictured leaning out of a window of the Carlos III hospital was Javier Limon Romero, the husband of Mrs Romero, who is also being held in isolation.

The three more people who came into contact with the infected patient include a hairdresser, another nurse and a cleaner and all were admitted to the isolation unit yesterday evening.

Today, medical staff wearing protective suits could be seen working on the sixth floor on the hospital where Mrs Romero is being treated 

There are now 16 people being monitored for signs of Ebola at the hospital, all of whom have come in to contact with Mrs Romero

Mrs Romero is so far the only person who has tested positive for Ebola through a transmission in the country.

She became infected at the same hospital by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as when treated him.

The 44-year-old remained undiagnosed for days despite reporting she had a fever, one of the symptoms of Ebola.

Reports yesterday suggested that she was still gravely ill but in a serious but stable condition.

People were protesting in Madrid again today after the Mrs Romero's pet dog Excalibur was put down after she contracted the disease 

People took their own dog's to the protest and hung signs on them with messages such as 'We Are All Excalibur' 

The protesters were also calling for the resignation of Spanish health minister Ana Mato 

Today some Spanish media said that Mrs Romero was now being treated with the drug ZMab.

The combination drug includes one of the agents used to make ZMapp, an experimental treatment which has been used on some Ebola sufferers, a number of whom survived.

Spain's Ebola crisis comes amid disquiet in the country over how the virus could have spread.

Today thousands of people gathered in more than 20 cities throughout Spain to show their solidarity with Mrs Romero and to protest against how Madrid authorities had euthanized her pet dog named Excalibur on Wednesday instead of placing it in quarantine. 

Some had painted Excalibur's name onto their faces and many carried placards saying "We are with you Teresa," "You are not alone" and "We are all Excalibur," and called on Health Minister Ana Mato to resign. 

Some officials initially deflected blame on to Mrs Romero, seizing on her admission that she may have touched her face with the gloves of her protective suit.

Yesterday angry health workers jeered Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday as he visited the hospital, throwing surgical gloves at his car, while unions and the public have also laid into the government for its slow response.

The protest came after it was reported staff there were working under stressful conditions 

The protest comes after it was reported staff were working under stressful conditions at the hospital as some nurses stay away from work, fearful they might catch the deadly virus.

Spain's health ministry and hospital authorities declined to comment, while the government had no immediate comment.

The latest outbreak of the disease has already killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in West Africa, and the Spanish case has raised concerns about contagion in Europe.

However, Brazil's health ministry confirmed today that a man under observation for a possible case of Ebola has tested negative for the disease.

The 47-year-old man arrived in Brazil on September 19 from Guinea, one of three African countries at the heart of an epidemic that has killed more than 4,000 people since March.

He went to an emergency room in the southern state of Parana on Thursday complaining of a fever, sore throat and a cough. Although he had only a slightly elevated temperature, the patient was kept in total isolation and transferred to a healthcare facility in Rio de Janeiro early on Friday.

The health ministry said the man remains in quarantine and will only receive a clean bill of health following a second exam scheduled to take place on Sunday.

Meanwhile officials in the U.S. have begun screening for West African passengers flying into John F Kennedy Airport in New York from countries being ravaged by the Ebola virus.

New screenings: Public health workers are now using contactless thermometers like the one above to screen potential Ebola victims. Pictured is a test taking place in Casablance, Morocco - much closer to the outbreak

As many as 150 travellers per day who arrive from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers in the hope of keeping the disease out of the United States.

Anybody who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an Ebola sufferer, and from there can be quarantined if necessary.

The new scheme, which began today, will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.

Thomas Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S, who died at a hospital in Dallas on Wednesday 

Between them the five airports carry around 95 per cent of passengers from the countries worst afflicted by Ebola.

However, even these measures are not a foolproof block on the disease. The extra screening wouldn't have identified Thomas Eric Duncan when he arrived from Liberia last month - because he had no symptoms while traveling.

Mr Duncan was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.. He died on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas.
