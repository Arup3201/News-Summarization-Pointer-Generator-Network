Some 150 years since Abraham Lincoln outlawed slavery in the U.S., a collection of rare Civil War-era photographs have been brought to life through painstaking colorization.

February 1 marks National Freedom Day, honoring the signing by President Lincoln of a resolution which became the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and abolished slavery.

The photographs, seen here, depict the battle-weary men who fought in the bloody conflict between 1861 and 1865, either for the survival of the Union or a strike out into independence for the Confederates.

A Union cemetery circa 1863. Around 620,000 soldiers died in the Civil War - following the Vietnam War, the amount of American deaths in foreign conflicts eclipsed the number who died in the Civil War.

Civil war broke out in 1861 when the South had seceded from the United States over  slavery and its expansion into the western territories.

The Northern states, led by President Lincoln were known as the Union, while the Southern states, the Confederates of America, marched behind Jefferson Davis.   

In one chilling picture, freshly-dug graves are shown at a Union cemetery in 1863. Around 620,000 soldiers died in the Civil War - it was only following the Vietnam War that the amount of American deaths in foreign conflicts eclipsed the number who lost their lives. 

Two-thirds of soldiers lost their lives to disease - with dysentery and typhoid fever the most common causes of death in filthy  camps with unclean water supplies and contaminated cooking pots.

Given the high number of wounded soldiers coming through the battlefield doctors' surgeries, amputation was often the quickest and most efficient way of preventing deadly infections, such as gangrene. 

Amputations were undertaken quickly, without anesthetic and using large saws similar to those now used to cut tree branches. 

Also pictured in the collection is civil war hero Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth shortly before the end of the war was declared in 1865 by his successor Andrew Johnson.
