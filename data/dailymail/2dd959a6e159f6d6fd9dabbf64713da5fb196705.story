A father has been forced to deliver his baby in hospital because staff were busy down the hall.

Zaheer Ali, 36, was left to deliver his daughter alone at Bethesda Hospital East in Boynton Beach, Florida when the doctor and nurse rushed out of the room to attend to an emergency C-section.

He helped his wife Indira as she gave birth to their third child, Aaliyah, who was luckily born healthy, weighing 6 pounds, 3 ounces, just after midnight on Sunday.

'I was scared, nervous, angry,' Mr Ali told MailOnline of the birth. 'Everything all in one.'

New addition: Zaheer Ali and his wife Indira smile with their new daughter, Aaliyah. Zaheer delivered the little girl when their doctor and nurse left their hospital room to attend to another patient

Their obstetrician, Dr. Elana Deutsch,
 returned to the room to find the newborn baby - and her upset parents. 
Deutsch had little more to do than cut the umbilical cord, the Palm Beach Post reported.

Mrs Ali was full-term when she started getting contractions on Saturday evening, so her husband rushed her to hospital, where Dr Deutsch agreed to meet them.

They were moved to a delivery area and the doctor felt as if Indira's labor was slowing down so gave her Pitocin to increase contractions.

Feeling more pain, Indira asked for an epidural, but never got one as another woman down the hall was suffering a complicated surgery that called the Alis' doctor and nurse away.

Left alone: The couple, left, were upset when their doctor, Dr Elana Deutsch, right, returned to the room. She also felt terrible, she said, and was shocked that Mrs Ali had given birth so quickly

Family: Aaliyah, who was born weighing 6lbs 3oz, will join the couple's other daughter and son

Dr Deutsch said she ordered the Pitocin drip to be stopped to slow down Mrs Ali's labor so she could rush and help the other patient. But the Alis didn't want her or the nurse to leave the room.

'My wife was screaming,' Zaheer Ali told MailOnline. '[The nurse] told us, "Just breathe" and that we had to wait because the doctor is doing a C-section and that takes priority over us.'

The nurse left the room - and then it was all up to Mr Ali.

'Less that a minute later my wife began to scream and the baby began to come out,' he said. 'More than half the baby's body was out. I held the head and began to press the call nurse button.'

He continued: 'After pressing the button no one came. I let the baby's head rest on the bed and ran to the hall, yelling for help.'

Dr Deutsch said she returned to find the baby on the bed.

'It must have happened very rapidly, 
because I was only in the C-section for 30 minutes,' she told the Palm Beach Post, adding 
that she felt terrible about the mistiming.

'The
 patient was obviously very upset. I was very upset,' Deutsch said. 'I 
think it was a new nurse, and I think she was nervous about being in the
 room alone.'

Mr Ali added that his wife and daughter 'are doing great'.

Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Kronhaus told the Palm Beach Post that there were the normal number of staff members on the ward during the shift. There are never more than two patients per nurse.

The hospital apologized and moved the couple, who also have a son and another daughter, to a VIP suite and assured them that they're investigating the incident.

'The hospital is saying, "Sorry," but I 
just feel itâ€™s wrong,' Zaheer told the Post. 'It's a hospital. There are supposed
 to be nurses and midwives. A nurse should be there with you.'

The couple were discharged on Tuesday morning.
