Badly Drawn Boy launched an abusive attack on his fans at a family concert in Northampton yesterday - forcing hundreds to leave in protest.

The indie-rock singer and songwriter, aka Damon Gough, 42, repeatedly swore at the crowd - which included dozens of young children - before moaning about being 'bored'.

At one point he was even seen calling a young mother, who had taken her four-year-old daughter to see him perform a 'c***'.

Fans watched in horror as the musician even slated the town, where he was performing at the Northampton Music Festival on Sunday evening.

He ended his bizarre rant by telling the crowd that he was having 'the worse year of my life'.

Videos of his performance, which were uploaded on YouTube, showed the shamed star hurling his tambourine into the crowd as he was booed.

He is also captured stopping half way through his songs before rambling about being 'bored'.

Fans yesterday took to Twitter to slam the artist.

Sarah D tweeted: 'Had an awesome time at Northampton Music Festival, left a little early due to Badly Drawn Boy’s horrendous language at a family event.

'Don’t think he’ll be invited back after today’s performance.'

Matt Round, on Facebook, posted: 'Badly Drawn Boy was nothing but an embarrassment. What a shame.'

Crystal Steele, wrote: 'Swearing loads, people in the audience shouting at him cos there’s kids in the audience. Deciding half way through a song he’s bored and stopping.'

Engineer John Townsend, 34, from Corby, Northamptonshire, was one of hundreds of fans to walk out of the gig.

He said: 'It was disgusting to see.

'At one point he targeted a woman who was with her young daughter and called her a ‘c***’.

'It was just horrible, he looked drunk and dishevelled and obviously didn’t want to be there.

'I felt sorry for all the young people who had queued to see him - he looked and acted like a foul-mouthed tramp.'

It is the second time the singer, from Bolton, Lancashire, has abused his fans.

In December 2010 he told a crowd in Los Angeles he was going to 'ruin his career tonight' before rowing with sound engineers and insulting his audience.

Badly Drawn Boy shot to fame in 2000 when his debut album The Hour Of Bewilderbeast went platinum, leading to him recording the entire soundtrack to 2002 Hugh Grant film About A Boy.
