Physiotherapist Christopher Lewis (pictured) bit a woman client's shoulder and growled 'like a baby lion' to satisfy sexual urge, a tribunal has heard

 A physiotherapist bit a client’s shoulder while she was lying on his table and growled 'like a baby lion' to 'satisfy his sexual urge', a tribunal has heard.

Christopher Lewis allegedly carried out the act after pressing his body against the woman and squashing her breasts during therapy on her fractured shoulder, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel was told.

Sophie Lister, representing the HCPC, said Lewis had spoken to his client about how physical injuries could affect sexual relationships during the session at Verulam clinic in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on May 13 last year.

'Towards the end of the conversation, Mr Lewis started to work her right shoulder and slowly leaned across and squashed her breasts, still keeping eye contact and bit the skin of her left shoulder playfully,' Ms Lister told the hearing in central London.

'It made her feel uncomfortable, vulnerable and shocked.'

Giving evidence, the woman, who cannot be named, said she thought Lewis made a noise as he bit her.

'It was a bit of a growl,' she said. 'It wasn’t a lion growl. Like a baby lion growl.

'There was no way this was a peck or a kiss.

'He had my skin in his teeth and shook his head in a similar way to a cat does when he does a bite.'

Lewis broke down in tears during his evidence as he told the hearing it was 'completely false' to suggest he bit the woman or that his actions were sexually motivated.

But the physio, who is facing a conduct and competence committee, has admitted squashing his client’s breasts with his torso 'in the context of a hug', his lawyer Nicholas Toms said.

Ms Lister said: 'We say Mr Lewis’s actions were motivated and done for his sexual gratitude, to satisfy his sexual urge and impulse.

'Notwithstanding what he will say, there is no other feasible explanation for his actions.'

She added: 'We say the intention was for his sexual gratification and no other reason.'

Following the physio session, the woman cancelled a future appointment after emailing Lewis to say his behaviour had 'blurred the lines', Ms Lister said.

Lewis sent a reply in which he said he realised he made a mistake and had not acted 'appropriately', the lawyer said.

He later telephoned the woman to apologise, she added.

Lewis told the panel the woman may have mistaken contact with his facial hair for a bite on the shoulder and he had been 'stupid' to hug her as she grimaced in pain during treatment.

'No bite took place,' he said.

'Looking back it was not something I would do now.

'It should never have happened.

'I wanted to show her, as a physiotherapist, I could sympathise with her and provide emotional support.'

Asked if he thought he acted appropriately, Lewis replied: 'No.

'It crossed physical boundaries.

'She did not come to the session to be hugged, she came for treatment.

'I completely accept what I did was wrong.

'I should have never given her a hug.'

Lewis said the length of his facial hair 'probably feels quite prickly' and the woman may have perceived that as a bite.

He told the hearing he felt 'terrible' when his client emailed him to cancel her next appointment.

'I knew as soon as I did it it was a stupid thing to do,' he said.

'When I received an email like that I was pretty distraught.'

During cross-examination, Lewis denied being 'aroused' when the woman mentioned during treatment that she had a female partner.

'I have no interest in the sexual orientation of my clients or what they do behind closed doors,' he said.

'I’ve been a happily married man for five years.'

Lewis told the hearing it was 'very hard ... to have been accused of doing something you haven’t done.'

'I’m not sure what I would do if I was not able to continue practising as a physiotherapist,' he said.

During her evidence, the woman admitted the alleged bite had not left a mark.

'It wasn’t a painful bite,' she said.

'It was a bite taking hold of my skin.'

She also denied that she had mistaken the feel of Lewis’s beard for a 'peck' on her shoulder.

'I have no recollection if he had a beard or not,' she added.

The woman, who gave evidence from behind a screen, said there was 'certainly no flirtation' towards the physio.

She added: 'The reason I didn’t challenge him at the time was I felt extremely vulnerable.'

The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.
