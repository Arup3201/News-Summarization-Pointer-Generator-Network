Peter Hain called for a de-facto amnesty, warning you cannot 'keep going back all the time¿

Terrorists responsible for bombing and killing innocent people during the Northern Ireland Troubles should not face future prosecution, a former Labour minister has claimed.

Peter Hain, Northern Ireland Secretary in Tony Blair’s last Cabinet, called for a de-facto amnesty, warning you cannot 'keep going back all the time’.

But David Cameron rejected the idea and Irish president Michael D Higgins said it would be wrong to ‘wipe the slate clean’ over the historic conflict, as he prepared to make a state visit to the UK.

There are around 3,000 unsolved murders from three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.

Tensions have mounted in recent weeks after it emerged some on-the-run IRA members had been sent ‘comfort letter’s to protect them from prosecution.

Mr Hain told The Times: ‘I think there should be an end to all conflict-related prosecutions.

‘That should apply to cases pre-dating the Good Friday agreement in 1998. This is not desirable in a normal situation.

'You would never dream of doing this in England, Scotland and Wales - but the Troubles were never normal.

‘You can keep going back all the time and you can keep looking over your shoulder or turning around all the time, but what that does is take you away from addressing the issues of now and the issues of the future.’

He added: ‘This is not going to go away. It's going to continue stalking the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the entire body politic there. The past just stalks them and they're either going to confront it and deal with it together or they're going to continue to be stalked by it.’

However, the idea has been rejected by
 London and Dublin. Mr Higgins said that progress in the Northern 
Ireland peace process should not be about forgetting the past.

He is making the first ever state visit to the UK by an Irish head of state.

The
 significance of the trip has been further deepened with the presence of
 Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and ex-IRA commander Martin 
McGuinness who will attend a banquet hosted by the Queen - a move 
unthinkable only a decade ago.

Mr
 Higgins will spend four days on the extended visit as a guest of the 
monarch, a sign he says is symbolic of the importance both countries 
place on the normalisation of relations more than 90 years after 
independence.

Mr Higgins said: ‘The peace process is that, it is a process that comes after the formal agreement at one level. Ultimately it is an exercise in consciousness at the level of community,’ President Higgins said.

‘The challenge is to hand to a future generation all of the prospects of the future. You are not inviting them to an amnesia about any deep dispute.

‘There are a lot of very difficult memories and it would be to my mind wrong to suggest to anyone that you should as it were, wipe the slate clean.’

Downing Street also insisted Mr Cameron would not support the idea. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view has not changed at all. As he did in opposition, as he does in government, he does not support the idea of amnesties.’
