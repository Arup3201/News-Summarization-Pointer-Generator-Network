The prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 as jails struggle to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders.

The Ministry of Justice today predicted the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade, despite predicting a fall just 12 months ago.

Labour branded the u-turn a sign of 'utter incompetence' but Tory minister Chris Grayling said it was proof that on his watch 'criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer'.

New forecasts from the Ministry of Justice show they now expect the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade, despite predicting a fall in the 2013 forecast

New projections of the prison population show that on the 'Central Scenario' of what is most likely to happen, the numbers behind bars will rise from 85,925 now to 90,200 in June 2020.

However, under 'Scenario 2' which includes the possibility of more criminals being jailed and judges handing down longer sentences, the prison population could hit 98,900 by 2020 - a 15 per cent increase.

When the same forecasts were published last year, the Ministry of Justice expected the prison population to fall from 83,400 to 81,000 by 2019.

It means thousands more prison places will be needed, because the current capacity is only 88,015.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Today's data exposes the utter incompetence of David Cameron's Government.

'It is embarrassing that they are having to throw in the bin previous projections due to a prisons crisis of their own making. It is humiliating for the Government but will be costly to taxpayers.

'What this latest revelation shows is that Chris Grayling has lost control of the prison system. Not only are prisons more overcrowded and violent, with less rehabilitation taking place, but they are storing up monumental problems at huge expense for the future because of their incompetence.'

Officials say the sharp change in direction comes after a rise in recent months in the number of people being handed custodial sentences.

'Despite the fact that overall crime is falling there has been an increase in recorded crime for certain offence types,' the MoJ said.

In particular, in the wake of high profile cases of sex abuse including Jimmy Savile, prosecutions for sexual offences are the highest in the decade.

The number of cases increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months ending June 2014.

Among celebrities jailed in recent months are broadcaster Stuart Hall, who is serving a total of five years in prison for sex offences, and entertainer Rolf Harris, who was handed a sentence of five years and nine months in July this year.

Sex offenders are also being jailed for longer, with average sentences increasing by 2.4 months to almost six years when compared to 2013.

Cases of violence against the person have also risen, leading to more attackers being imprisoned.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Some people aren't in favour of sending offenders to prison. I'm not one of them, and I think the public will be reassured by the fact that under this Government criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer. 

'We will always have enough places for those sent to us by the courts. By 2015 this Government will have increased the adult male prison capacity. 

We will have many more places than we inherited from the previous Government. 

'I remain committed to modernising the prison estate so that it delivers best value for hardworking taxpayers.'

The projections published today do not take into account any new laws which might be passed by future governments after the next election, which means they 'become less certain over time'.
