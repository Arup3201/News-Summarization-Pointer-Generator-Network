An English man woke from a stroke to discover that the only language he could speak was Welsh.

Alun Morgan, 81, was forced to re-learn his native tongue, despite the fact that he had never been able to speak fluent Welsh.

Indeed, he wasn’t entirely confident with his newfound talent and used a Welsh dictionary to make sure he was speaking it correctly.

Lost in translation: Englishman Alun Morgan woke up after suffering a severe stroke speaking fluent Welsh despite having never been to the country for 70 years

Since suffering the stroke, Mr Morgan
 has been diagnosed  with aphasia, which is caused by damage to the part
 of the brain responsible for using and understanding language.

While the condition can leave people 
with difficulties speaking and reading, the damage can also enhance 
other areas of the brain.

Doctors believe the stroke must have suppressed his memory of English, while bringing his knowledge of Welsh to the fore. 

Although Mr Morgan was brought up in 
England, he was evacuated to his grandmother’s house in Wales during the
 war when he was 12 years old.

The retired RAF Air Commodore, who lives with his wife Yvonne in Bathwick, Somerset, suffered the stroke in 2010.

'Not easy': Mr Morgan, 81, who was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War aged 10, but never learned the language, holds a sign that says 'I can speak Welsh'

Tongue terrified: Mr Morgan said his Welsh speaking gave his wife the shock of her life

He was taken to hospital where he spent three weeks being stabilised and assessed.

While he hadn’t lost the ability to speak, as happens to some stroke victims, doctors couldn’t understand a word he was saying.

He said: ‘It was clear something very funny was going on.

‘I was compos mentis but was speaking totally Welsh. It gave my wife the shock of her life.’

He believes his memories of the Welsh
 language stem from his childhood. He moved to a small village in 
Mid-Wales for a year in 1944 but returned home to London the following 
year and lived the rest of his life in England.

He said: ‘I must have picked up the Welsh because my nan, who I went to live with during the war, spoke terrible English.’

Both Mr Morgan’s parents also  spoke Welsh.

He added: ‘Having learned I was only 
speaking in Welsh and not English, I got myself a good Welsh dictionary 
to make sure I was speaking it correctly.’

Mr Morgan has been helped to overcome
 the condition by the Communication Support Service, run by the Stroke 
Association in Bath. He required lessons to learn to speak English 
again.

He said: ‘After the stroke it was hard going. Gradually the English words came back, but it wasn’t easy.’

But it seems his bilingual talents 
won’t last long. He added: ‘I’ve managed to remember English but I’ve 
almost forgotten Welsh again.’

Condition 'rewires the brain'
