Daley Blind insists he has Robin van Persie to thank for helping him bed into his new surroundings at Manchester United after his move from Ajax.

The Dutch midfielder, who arroved at Old Trafford for £14million late in the summer transfer window, has been impressive while not outstanding in his opening four games at the club.

And speaking to De Telegraaf, Blind says his fellow countryman Van Persie has shown him the ropes, right down to where he puts his footwear to avoid embarrassment.

Blind said: 'He has helped me a lot. He told where to put my shoes and all those little things you need to know when you’re new.'

He added: 'I imagine it can be difficult if you do not have someone to help you at a new club.'

With three wins out of the last four games, United's progress has been obvious yet not always simple. The disappointment of the 5-3 defeat at Leicester has been followed by two home wins over West Ham and Everton.

Blind teamed up with Van Persie to add to the Dutch connection at Old Trafford alongside boss Louis van Gaal.

And he admits that while Van Gaal's training sessions are tough, the team are improving every game, with three wins in their last four games.

'I think the players are getting used to [Van Gaal’s methods]. The players like to work with him. Everyone is picking it up very well,' he added.

'Training is very hard and very serious and we improve every day and you could see that in the first half [of the 2-1 win] against Everton.'

Blind should represent Holland for the 22nd time in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan on Friday.
