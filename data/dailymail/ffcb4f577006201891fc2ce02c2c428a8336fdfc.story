Caroline Wozniacki suffered a bizarre setback in her US Open win against Aliaksandra Sasnovich when her ponytail got tangled in her racket, causing her to miss a return.

The No 10 seed tried her best to hit a backhand despite the mishap, but could not make proper contact with the ball, and lost the point. 

The misfortune in the  second round match is up there with Andy Murray losing a point at the 2012 US Open against Tomas Berdych, when a ball fell out of the Scot's pocket mid-point.

Fortunately the Dane saw the funny side, and tweeted pictures of the incident with the caption, 'Hair trouble! Maybe I need a haircut!'

Wozniacki ended up wining the match 6-3 6-4, and will play 18th seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany in the third round. 

It remains to be seen whether she will snip her ponytail prior to the match.
