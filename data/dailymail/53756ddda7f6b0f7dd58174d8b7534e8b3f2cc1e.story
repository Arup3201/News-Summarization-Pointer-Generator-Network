Commuters in 4x4 vehicles are demanding larger railway station car park spaces so they can avoid being fined for straying over the white lines.

Irate commuters at Didcot Parkway railway station in Oxfordshire say parking bays are too small for their cars.

Motorists who have complained most drive the expensive up-market Range Rover models, which are popular in rural Oxfordshire.

Now, where do I park my car? Rows and rows of communters' cars parked at Didcot Parkway railway station

The entrance to the railway station. Drivers of 4x4s argue parking spaces need to be wider to avoid them being fined for parking over white lines

Drivers say allowances should be made for the rural location of the station and that spaces should to be wider to cope with their bulkier vehicles.

APCOA, which operates the car park, has so far declined to comment but the firm is a member of the British Parking Association, which recommends a minimum of 4.8m (15.7ft) x 2.4m (7.8ft), but this is not mandatory.

One commuter, Penny Reid, from Wantage, drives a Land Rover Freelander and recently received an £80 Civil Parking Notice at the car park.

She said: 'I can fit within the space, I'm a good parker - but if there is a car parked next to me I can't get out.'

Edward Hanrahan, from East Hendred, Oxfordshire, regularly parks his Audi A4, which he describes as a 'medium sized car', at Didcot Parkway.

He said: 'I got an £80 parking ticket, then three weeks later when I hadn't paid it I got a final demand and a doubling of the payment.

'Since then I've had another demand from a solicitor and debt collectors - it's all just scare-mongering.' 

Kelvin
Reynolds, from the British Parking Association, said their recommended 
minimum size for a parking space had 'survived the test of time'.

He added that although it does not regulate companies, the association does assist them to operate 'best practice'.

He added: 'Spaces need to be marked so the car park works efficiently - maximising space without compromising safety.'

A
spokesman for First Great Western train company, which operates the 
railway station, said: 'We haven't received any complaints about this 
issue previously, but we will now be investigating and assessing the car
park sizes.' 

The British Parking Association said it would also investigate the situation.
