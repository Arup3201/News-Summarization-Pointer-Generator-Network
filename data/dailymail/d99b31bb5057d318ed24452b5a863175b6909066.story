Swansea face a battle to hold on to striker Bafetimbi Gomis after Borussia Dortmund and Schalke stepped into the race to sign the France international.

The 29-year-old is keen to leave and play Champions League football but it would leave Swansea needing to sign two strikers in light of losing Wilfried Bony to Manchester City.

Crystal Palace have already lodged a £9.3million offer for Gomis but he wants a bigger club and Swansea had resolved to keep him until the end of the season when he has a clause set at £8m.

The prospect of Champions League football though has changed Gomis's outlook and he is keen to push for the move once Dortmund or Schalke match Swansea's valuation.

Swansea, meanwhile, are showing an interest in Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim but have had £3million offers for Tottenham full-back Kyle Naughton and Norwich City's Martin Olsson rejected.

Romania international Maxim, 24, drew attention from Liverpool last season and has won 19 caps for Romania.
