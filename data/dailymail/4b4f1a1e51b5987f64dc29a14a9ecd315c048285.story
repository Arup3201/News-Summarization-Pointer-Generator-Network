Republican Sen.Tom Coburn is no fan the president's politics, but when it comes to the man himself, the retiring Oklahoma lawmaker has nothing but praise for his former colleague and friend Barack Obama.

'I think he's a genuinely very smart, nice guy,' Coburn said in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes. 'I just love him as a man. I think he's a neat man. 

'You don't have to be the same to be friends. Matter of fact, the interesting friendships are the ones that are divergent,' the Tea Party aligned senator added.

Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn is seen here walking to the Senate floor for a series of votes on December. It was to be one of his last votes in Congress, as he is retiring this year due to a battle with prostate cancer

Coburn is pictured here greeting President Barack Obama before his second State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on January 25, 2011. The two men became unlikely friends in 2005 as freshman senators and have stayed close despite their vastly different political views

The two men met in 2005 when they were both green senators, freshly joining the elite ranks of the legislative branch's upper chamber.

Obama was a former community organizer turned politician who hailed from Chicago, Illinois, and had just won his first election to federal office.

Coburn was a seasoned obstetrician who did a three-term stint as an Oklahoma representative in the House of Representatives before fulfilling a campaign promise to hold himself to a self-imposed term limit.

The senators on opposing sides of the aisle acknowledged their friendship in the past and that their unique relationship is considered a rarity among Members of Congress from different political movements.

When Coburn was named to Time's 2013 list of the 100 most influential people in the world, Obama wrote his profile.

Noting that they entered office at the same time, Obama wrote that their 'wives, Michelle and Carolyn, hit it off at an orientation dinner.'

'Pretty soon, we did too. Since then, we’ve bonded over family and faith. And we’ve harnessed our friendship and mutual respect to find places where we can agree and work together to move this country forward,' he said.

Together, Obama said, they worked to increase government transparency and reduce earmarks.  

'The people of Oklahoma are lucky to have someone like Tom representing them in Washington — someone who speaks his mind, sticks to his principles and is committed to the people he was elected to serve,' he said.

'Each of us still hopes the other will see the light. But in the meantime, we’ll settle for being friends,' Obama stated.

And at a prayer breakfast this year Obama made special mention of Coburn, who had just been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

'Tom is going through some tough times right now. But I love him dearly even though we're from different parties,' Obama said.

Coburn is leaving Congress this year due to his advanced affliction.

'Everybody is gonna die from something. And so the deal is how to use each day to move things forward for both you and the people you love and the country you love,' he calmly told CBS News during his interview for 60 Minutes.

Bromance: Obama and Coburn shared a hug after their greeting at the 2011 State of the Union address. The two men have said numerous times that they 'love' each other

The Oklahoma senator has long spoke with  fondness of his rapport with Obama. 

Asked why they have such 'personal chemistry' by Political Capital host Al Hunt in 2011, Coburn said: 'I just think we truly like each other....He’s got a wonderful personality. He’s got a great wife and family. He is a very neat man, and I like him personally.'

Coburn attributed their contradictory viewpoints on their dissimilar upbringings and personal experiences.

'That doesn’t make him a bad man,' he said. 'I love the man. I think he’s a neat man. I don’t want him to be president, but I still love him. 

'He is our president. He’s my president. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95 percent of the issues, but that doesn’t mean I can’t have a great relationship,' he told the Bloomberg Television host. 'And that’s a model people ought to follow.'

The outgoing legislator told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl during their recent interview that he's 'proud' of Americans for electing Obama.

'I mean, it says something about us nationally,' he told her. 'You know, it's kind of like crowning your checker when you get to the end of your checker board. Here's another thing that says America's special: Barack Obama, president of the United States.'

Coburn admitted that Obama hasn't done as good of a job building a working relationship with his other former colleagues - many of whom have often complained that Obama doesn't seem to like or want to get to know them - but insisted that they shouldn't take it personally.

'The president hasn't done a great job of reaching out. It's not his personality style. I mean, you know, he's not well-suited to be a back slapper, sit down and let me tell you this dirty story before we get down to business,' Coburn said. 

'I mean, he's not one of those kinds of guys. He's a serious guy.'

The conservative lawmaker shared with 60 Minutes that he sometimes calls Obama to boost his spirits when he's being lambasted by his critics.

'I've told him, "Don't let the S.O.B's get you down,"....I'll call him up and say, "Hey, I'm pulling for ya," you know,' he said.

Coming from Coburn, it's quite the act of kindness. The Tea Party congressman has roundly criticized most of his fellow lawmakers as unfit to serve.

'I see 'em make decisions every day that benefit their career, rather than the country. And that's what's so sickening about Washington. To me, it's about our future. It's not about the politicians,' he told Stahl. 

'And we've switched things around where now it's about the politicians and not the future of the country.'

His solution? Kick them all to the curb.

'If I was king tomorrow, that's what I'd do,' Coburn said, not joking one bit.
