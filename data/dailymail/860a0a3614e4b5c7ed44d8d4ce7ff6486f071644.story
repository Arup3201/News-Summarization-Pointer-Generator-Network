The storm, make up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa, also engulfed Cairo for a second day.

Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years and the storm would last into tonight.

Israeli airports spokeswoman Liza Dvir said flights to and from the Red Sea resort city of Eilat were temporarily grounded due to the weather, though planes still flew through the country's main international hub, Ben Gurion Airport outside of Tel Aviv.

Israeli police said more patrols would be on hand to respond to emergencies brought on by the weather.

In Beirut, Lebanon's capital city, strong waves broke fences, tiles and tore away part of its corniche overlooking the Mediterranean. The storm also brought heavy winds, rain and snow to the mountains. 

Lebanese weather forecasters said the wind reached speeds of 60mph.

Even Prince Charles, who was on a visit to Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, was left windblown and relieved to be on firm ground after his plane experienced a tricky landing.

When Charles stepped off his chartered jet, he told Sultan that the landing had been 'bumpy' and he stuck his arms out and waved them up and down.

The combination of a strong crosswind and the dust storms meant the pilots had a more difficult touchdown than expected.

Swirling dust also plagued the visit to Al-Khuraibah, the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Lihyan, and other archaeological sites in and around Al-Ula

As Charles and the Arab prince walked to a 6th century settlement at Al-Khuraibah, where walls still stand three feet high, a small dust storm sprang up and briefly engulfed the entourage of the two princes.

Charles joked: 'Do you mind if I keep my sunglasses on? The dust will get in my eyes.'

The strong sandstorm first reached Egypt yesterday, temporarily closing Cairo International Airport to incoming flights and the weather front caused strong waves to crash into the coast, resulting in the closure of two seaports.

Mohieddin said during the closure of Cairo's airspace, four flights were diverted to another airport, while a fifth returned to Amman, Jordan.

The country's second-busiest airport outside of the city of Alexandria was closed to arrivals and departures, and flights were diverted to other airports unaffected by the storm, he added.
