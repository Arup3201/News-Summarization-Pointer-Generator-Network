High school graduation is supposed to be a time for celebration, but for the Murphy family, it was a time of mourning.

Beloved 17-year-old Alexis Murphy, who would've been walking up to the stage with her fellow students at Nelson County High School in Virginia, is presumed abducted and killed following her disappearance in August.

'Alexis, she should've been here to receive her diploma,' Angela Taylor, the missing teen's aunt, told Newsplex.

Instead her family accepted the certificate on her behalf, just days after Randolph Taylor, 48, was found guilty of the teen's murder, despite investigators never finding Murphy's body.

Many graduates showed support by wearing ribbons in Alexis' favorite color, pink, and decorating their caps with her name.

Missing person signs bearing Alexis' face still remain all around the county following her disappearance on August 3.

Her last Twitter entry at 6.40pm read: 'I actually look cute right now.'

She was later picked up by the CCTV camera of a gas station at 7.15pm.

Three days later police found her abandoned Nissan in Charlottesville, 39 miles from the gas station.

Footage also showed Randolph Taylor in Ultimate Bliss, an adult store two miles from where the Nissan was found, on the day Alexis went missing.

A witness had told police he saw Taylor sitting in his truck opposite the gas station where Alexis was last seen.

For now, Alexis' family says they are going to continue to celebrate her life and make a difference for others.

'We are in the works now of starting a scholarship program in honor of Alexis that will be awarded to a Nelson County High School graduate so we will be working to get that off the ground and hope to be able to present that as a scholarship next year,' Mrs Taylor said.

'I'm sure we will have family come over to the house and cook out and do what Alexis would've wanted to do,' Mrs Taylor said.

'Like, go out to other graduation parties for her fellow classmates and just celebrate.'
