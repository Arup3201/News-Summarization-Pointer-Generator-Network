Parents with pupils at Billericay School in Essex received a letter home this week warning about 'extreme haircuts' inspired by The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex

An Essex school has been branded 'ridiculous' for banning pupils from class if they have TOWIE style haircuts.

Parents with pupils at Billericay School in Essex received a letter home this week warning about 'extreme haircuts' inspired by The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex.

The pompadour style - shaved sides with longer hair slicked back on top - has had a resurgence in recent years with many of the cast of the Essex-based reality show sporting the cut.

Other stars who have the popular do include Canadian singer Justin Bieber, footballer David Beckham and rock 'n' roll legend Elvis Presley.

But now parents fear their children will have to sacrifice the 'reem' look to avoid being banned from the classroom. 

One parent, who asked not to be name, said: 'I can understand banning some extreme haircuts but this is just ridiculous.

'This haircut has been about since the 50s and it didn't even shock people then.

'There is nothing extreme about it but I'm not prepared to risk my boy's education over a haircut.'

In the letter to parents, headteacher Sue Hammond explained the controversial decision saying: 'Our school uniform policy provides clear guidelines as to those hairstyles which are acceptable in school and those which are not.

'I would ask for your support in refraining from allowing your son to cut his hair into an extreme version of the style as, if he does, he will be unable to attend mainstream lessons until such time as his hair has grown out.'

School staff have even spoken to a nearby barbers in Billericay, Essex, to explain anything shorter than a number two on the sides will not be acceptable for their pupils.

John Revell, director of the Billericay Barber Shop, confirmed he had been spoken to but said it was a customer's choice what haircut they would like.

He said: 'I'm not prepared to lose customers over it - I would do whatever they ask. 

'We've been here 18 years and that's because we do what customers want.

'We do warn the lads now, but if you don't do the cut, there are plenty of other barbers who would.'

John Revell, of Billericay Barber Shop, said he is not prepared to lose customers over it

However, Billericay councillor, Phil Turner, deputy leader of Basildon Council, has defended the school's decision saying it is 'not a draconian measure but a plea for pupils to look nice'. 

He said: 'I understand what the school is saying. 

'Some people are taking a bit of a liberty, not everyone, so the school is saying "can you be sensible about this?"

'There is a fine line between what is acceptable and what isn't.

Other stars who have sported the popular do include singer Justin Bieber and footballer David Beckham

'Parents may be outraged the school would do this. It's taking a bit of a risk putting a letter out and a bigger risk going to the hairdressers, but it's not unique in asking for some restraint in external appearance.

'I would ask parents to be patient and take on the message that's meant not as a draconian measure, but a plea for pupils to look nice.'

Other hairstyles banned under the school's strict uniform policy include extreme colouring, spiking, close-cropped and excessive use of gels or waxes.
