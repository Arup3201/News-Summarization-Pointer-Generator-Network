With its mixture of historic medieval towers, elegant Georgian townhouses and imposing Victorian structures, it is easy to see why Edinburgh is regarded as one of Britain's most beautiful cities.

But one  local conservationist is calling for it to be stripped of its Unesco World Heritage status due to what he describes as a series of 'architectural blunders'.

David Black, Chairman of the city's Southside Association is horrified by the way his beloved cityscape has changed in recent years and is compiling a damning report criticising planning decisions.

Heritage site: Edinburgh was awarded Unesco status in 1995, but one local conservationist is so appalled by recent buildings he is compiling a damning report to send to the group's New York headquarters 

Mr Black intends to send his report  to Unesco's New York HQ next month in a bid to have then strip the  city of the heritage status which was awarded in 1995.

He told the Edinburgh Evening News: 'At the time [1995], Edinburgh was seen as a prime example of an old town and new town co-existing well. 

'But since then we have seen one poor planning decision after another, from St Andrew Square to the Parliament building and Princes Street.

'This is not just some old fogey talking who doesn't like anything modern. I like the Festival Theatre, for example.'

Among the city's most criticised modern buildings are Appleton Tower, a 1960s eyesore next to the University and the new airport expansion recently named 'Scotland's Worst Building'.

Mr Black said he is concerned at the plans to develop the area around Waverley Station and to transform the 190-year-old Old Royal High School building into a luxury hotel. 

The city's Unesco status is seen as an important draw for tourists and the city council is understandably keen to keep it. 

Britain currently has 28 sites on the  World Heritage List, including Westminster Abbey, the City of Bath, the Giant's Causeway, Stonehenge and a section of Liverpool's waterfront.

If Mr Black is successful in convincing Unesco, it would not be the first time a city has been stripped of it's World Heritage Status.

Monstrous: Appleton tower is a typical example of a 1960s housing block and often cited as one of Edinburgh's ugliest buildings

Concerns have been raised over plans to transform the 190-year-old Royal High School into a luxury hotel

In 2009 the German City Dresden was taken off the list after a four lane bridge was built just over a mile from the city limits. 

A spokesman for Unesco said at the time that the city had failed to keep its 'outstanding universal value as inscribed'.

MailOnline has approached Unesco for comment regarding Edinburgh's status but they are yet to respond.
