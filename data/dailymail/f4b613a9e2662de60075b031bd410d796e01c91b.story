Apple has taken aim at many tech markets - from phones to music players and its upcoming smartwatch - and it now appears to be gunning for the world of virtual reality.

A job listing has revealed the tech giant is advertising for an engineer to create 'apps that integrate virtual reality systems.'

It is not known whether the firm is looking to develop hardware, as well as software, but an Apple headset would rival the likes of Oculus Rift and Samsung's Gear VR.

The job listing was first spotted by fan site 9to5Mac. 

It says: ‘We are looking for a software engineer to develop UI and applications to create next generation software experiences.

Following the release of Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the firm has achieved a record high for app downloads. 

According to Fiksu’s latest App Store Competitive Index, downloads in October were up 42 per cent cpmpared to September. 

This was up 39 per cent year-over year. 

More than 7.8 million downloads, across the top 200 free iOS apps, were recorded last month. 

‘This engineer will create high performance apps that integrate with virtual reality systems for prototyping and user testing.’

The candidate will work with the team in the firm’s Santa Clara Valley office.

A patent published in December suggests the firm does have ambitions for a head-mounted display.

The patent, which was first filed in May 2007, details a ‘goggle system for providing a personal media viewing experience to a user.’

Apple explained that the goggle system may resemble ski or motorcycle goggles, and to ‘enhance the user's comfort, the goggle system may include breathable components’, including breathable foam that rests against the user's face.

Apple was recently criticised for playing catch up with its rivals when it released its larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets.

If Apple is looking to expand into the virtual reality market, it would be following rivals Google, Samsung and Facebook-owned Oculus Rift - despite filing its patent before these firms released their headsets.

Last week, VR firm Jaunt released its first cinematic virtual reality release of Paul McCartney’s gig in San Francisco filmed during the summer.

The Jaunt camera system simultaneously records 3D stereoscopic video in all directions, which is coupled with 3D sound-field microphones.

The team then use so-called computational photography algorithms to process the recorded video, adjust the angles and colours, and make it appear more immersive.

The footage is available as a free app from Google Play and works with Google’s Cardboard, and the gig will be available for Samsung’s Gear VR and the Oculus Rift ‘soon’.
