Ros Altmann says women are being forced out of the workplace because employers are ignoring the impact of the menopause

Women are being forced out of the workplace because employers are ignoring the impact of the menopause, a campaigner for older workers has warned.

Ros Altmann, who advises the Government on how to keep over-50s in the workforce, said that while other life-changing events are recognised by businesses, the menopause is still taboo.

As a result, older women are being failed by employers.

Dr Altmann, who is an expert on pensions and finance, said some women struggling with symptoms of the menopause are perceived to be under-performing and are forced out of their jobs.

Others, tired of battling on, will choose to leave or go part-time. Dr Altmann warned that menopause is just ‘not on the work radar’.

‘Pregnancy is, childbirth is, bereavement is, many other life phases are, but [menopausal women] get no support in the workplace,’ she said.

The average age that women go through the menopause in the UK is 51. However, 1 per cent of women face it before they hit 40.

The symptoms, which range from hot flushes to sleepless nights, headaches and depression, can last for as long as 14 years.

Even for an average woman, it takes seven and a half years for the body to adjust.

Hormone replacement therapy can help but it is usually only prescribed for five years. Dr Altmann, who has written a report on how to keep older people working, said she would have to be brave to call for training on how to manage women going through the menopause because ‘nobody ever wants to talk about that’.

She told the Sunday Times: ‘A woman may come in one day… feeling awful and emotional and a lot of women find it hard to cope. You can’t sleep at night because of night sweats or you flush in a meeting.

‘Can you imagine telling a 40-year-old male manager you’ve got a problem with the menopause? It’s not going to happen.

‘Sometimes, women themselves think, “My God, I can’t cope any more” and leave.

‘Some drop to part-time work, even though they don’t need to.

‘We don’t know how it affects people because it’s not being managed.’

In December, a leading fertility expert called for women workers to be given paid ‘menstrual leave’.

Gedis Grudzinskas, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, said female workers who feel under the weather every month should get up to three days off and that this should be separate from sick leave.

The Harley Street professor said that his proposal was ‘about employers being sensible and aware’ about women in the workplace and trying to keep them there.

He added that Britain is behind the times as menstrual leave is already legal in Japan, Taiwan and Indonesia, while Canada is discussing the idea.
