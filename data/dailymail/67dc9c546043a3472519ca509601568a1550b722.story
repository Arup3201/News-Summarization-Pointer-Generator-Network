Gender pay gap: There was controversy when it emerged Lady Stowell is being paid less than her male predecessor as leader of the House of Lords

The new leader of the House of Lords last night rejected David Cameron’s offer to top up her salary using Conservative Party cash amid a growing row over her downgraded status in Cabinet.

Baroness Stowell was among several women appointed to senior roles in last week’s Government reshuffle.

Although the overhaul was supposed to promote female MPs, it emerged she was due to be paid significantly less than her male predecessor Lord Hill.

The discrepancy, which arose because of a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts, meant her salary will be £78,891 a year, compared with Lord Hill’s £101,038. This was seized on by Labour peers, who said it showed ‘contempt’ for her role.

Following the row, Conservative sources said it had been decided to supplement Lady Stowell’s salary using party funds, so she is paid the full Cabinet rate.

But last night, in a further embarrassment, the Tory peer rejected the extra cash, saying she believes her salary should come only from public funds in order to avoid any appearance of potential conflicts of interest.

In a letter to peers, Lady Stowell said: ‘I have decided not to accept this addition to my ministerial salary.

‘Even though additional pay from Conservative Party funds would not break the House of Lords code of conduct for members or the ministerial code, I am a firm believer that when it comes to potential conflicts of interest and especially where money is involved, it is essential that all interested parties feel the right thing is not only done but is also seen to be done.

‘I am all too aware that my responsibilities as Leader of the House of Lords extend beyond the Conservative benches to all parts of the Chamber and to the House as a whole. I feel it only right therefore that my salary comes from a single source and that source should be the public purse consistent with my role as a public servant.’

She also insisted that the Prime Minister had promised to restore the Leader of the Lords to full Cabinet membership ‘at the earliest opportunity’.

Lady Stowell’s status was originally downgraded so that outgoing Foreign Secretary William Hague can keep full cabinet status as he remains Mr Cameron’s de facto deputy as Tory leader.

There was embarrassment as Downing 
Street confirmed that this would mean Lady Stowell was to be paid less 
than her predecessor and, for the first time for hundreds of years, the 
leader of the Lords would not be a full member of the Cabinet.

UKIP has begun to erode Labour support in key marginal seats that will determine the outcome of next year’s election.

The anti-European party would triumph in at least two parliamentary constituencies if voting took place now, according to a poll.

Nigel Farage’s party is in first place in Thurrock in Essex and Thanet South in Kent, and second in Great Yarmouth, Suffolk, according to the results of a survey of 14,000 people in 14 constituencies. The research, carried out for former Conservative treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests that after doing serious damage to the Tories, Ukip is a threat to Labour.

In May, an Ashcroft poll said Labour was set to win 82 Tory seats – but that has been cut to 53. The findings will fuel speculation that Mr Farage will stand in Thanet South, where Tory MP Laura Sandys is leaving her seat.

There
 is now growing pressure on Mr Hague, who is quitting as an MP at the 
next election, to accept a downgrade in his status and a pay cut in 
order to make way for Lady Stowell’s position to be enhanced.

Peers from all parties are threatening
 to back a motion to be tabled by former Commons Speaker Baroness 
Boothroyd condemning the decision to undermine the Leader of the Lords’s
 status, which has been seen as an ill-thought-through insult to the 
second chamber.

In a letter to leaders of the Association of Conservative Peers, Mr Cameron said the Lords should be ‘properly represented in the Government at the highest level’ and its leader ‘as a general rule always be a full member of the Cabinet’.

He regarded Lady Stowell’s position as ‘a purely temporary one, which I want to rectify at the earliest opportunity’.

He promised: ‘I will certainly do so immediately after the general election if I am returned as Prime Minister, if no opportunity has arisen to do so over the coming nine months’.

The Prime Minister insisted Lady Stowell ‘will sit at the same place around the Cabinet table, and will have the same full right to speak and contribute to the Cabinet’s business’.
