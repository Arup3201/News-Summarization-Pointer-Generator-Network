A mother attending her first festival hanged herself in a public toilet cubicle after taking illegal drugs which 'affected her state of mind', an inquest heard today.

Beauty therapist Lisa Williamson, 31, was found slumped in a toilet at BoomTown Fair on the third day of the festival in Alresford, Hampshire.

Her back was to the door when a festival-goer discovered her. He alerted security, who then broke in and began CPR, the hearing was told.

She died later that day on August 9 this year at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester after paramedics also failed to revive her.

The mother-of-two had bought amphetamine - including ground-up ecstasy - with husband Darren Williamson when they arrived at the festival, the inquest was told.

She took around a small amount the night before she died - on August 8, the inquest heard.

Mrs Williamson - who did not make it to bed until 6am on the day of her death - woke up in a 'grouchy' mood, the inquest heard, and the tent was particularly hot when she was awoken at 11.30am.

After becoming agitated, Mrs Williamson, from Bromyard, Herefordshire, stormed off through a field of festival-goers' tents, the coroner was told.

Her husband became concerned when she did not return later and after 20 minutes went off in search of his partner of eight years.

A little over two hours later he discovered an ambulance crew attending a stricken festival-goer.

Mr Williamson said: 'I rushed across the fields but a security guard said "you're not allowed through".

'I told him I'm looking for my wife but he said "don't worry, it's a man".

'We carried on walking past the block of toilets when I looked back - and then I saw her pyjamas.'

Weeping, he added: 'That's when I realised it was her.

'We didn't know what had happened but she was on the floor and paramedics were surrounding her.

'They seemed to be trying for a long time to bring her around - watching it all I felt so helpless.'

A letter from her GP Dr Louise Mottram at the Nunwell Surgery in her hometown said Mrs Williamson had no significant history of depression or mental health problems.

However, she had an episode of 'lower mood' in 2010 shortly after the birth of her two children, which Mr Williamson said was a mild form of post-natal depression.

She had left her children with relatives to attend the festival, which is held on the Matterley Estate.

Toxicology tests revealed Mrs Williamson had high levels of amphetamine and MDMA in her blood.

There were also traces of cocaine, which could have been taken in the weeks leading up to her death.

Consultant Pathologist Hayley Burnley today said she 'ultimately died from hanging', but added: 'But the use of drugs previously would have no doubt affected her state of mind at the time.'

Grahame Short, Central Hampshire Senior Coroner, recorded an open verdict because he could not be sure she intended to kill herself.

He said: 'I am satisfied she took ecstasy and amphetamine and I believe she was under the influence of those drugs at the time of her death.

'She was found hanging in a locked toilet and having heard the evidence, I'm satisfied this was self-inflicted.

'She had been behaving strangely in those last few hours of her life.

'I think the drugs had affected her as well as the lack of sleep and the temperature of the tent would have affected her state of mind.'

Mrs Williamson's death, in the TrenchTown area of the site, was the third in four years at the BoomTown Fair.

Last year public schoolgirl Ellie Rowe died after taking the horse tranquilliser ketamine at the festival.

The 18-year-old, from Glastonbury, Somerset, was working as a volunteer steward at the festival when she was found collapsed in her tent by a friend.

In 2011, mother-of-two Deborah Jeffery, 45, died from a heart attack at the festival after taking ecstasy.

At the time of Mrs Williamson's death, a BoomTown spokesperson said: 'BoomTown Fair would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of the young woman who was found unconscious on site.

'Despite the efforts of all our staff involved she was later pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Winchester Hospital.

'Our thoughts are with all her loved ones at this tragic time, and the festival is doing all it can to assist those involved.'

BoomTown Fair is a music festival where acts and music are divided between nine different districts - each with their own theme or style.

It has been running for six years and features four days of live music and art events. 

Acts who played the festival include The Wailers, The Skatalites, Jimmy Cliff, Shaggy and Chas n Dave.

This year, Hampshire Constabulary seized around £70,000 of drugs and £15,000 in cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
