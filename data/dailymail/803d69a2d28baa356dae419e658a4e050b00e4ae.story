The driver of a float that apparently edged onto a railroad crossing during a military parade as a train approached - killing four veterans on board - has been identified as an Army veteran.

Dale Andrew Hayden, 50, was driving a flatbed truck carrying 26 wounded veterans and their families in the procession in Midland, Texas when he drove across the tracks, despite warning signals.

Four veterans - Gary Stouffer, 37, Lawrence Boivin, 47, Joshua Michael, 34 and William Lubbers, 43 - died after the train slammed into the float on November 15, while 16 other people were injured.

Hayden, who has a military career 
spanning more than three decades and has served in Afghanistan and Iraq,
 is 'kind of catatonic', his attorney Hal Brockett said.

He added that he is not ready to be interviewed. 'He's just very much in shock,' he explained.

Hayden now works as a truck driver for Smith Industries, an oilfield services 
company. Brockett said the company placed him on medical leave in the aftermath of the tragedy.

Doug Fletcher, a Dallas attorney 
representing Smith Industries, said Hayden is an Army reservist who has 
been driving for the company for two years and may have driven in the 
parade before.

Hayden is undergoing 'professional counseling,' Fletcher said. 'He is beyond distraught.'

Fletcher said the company is taking steps to protect the driver after he received 'some hate emails'.

Chaos: Investigators believe the flatbed truck had edged over the crossing despite warning signals

Shock: Pubic safety officials huddle after the trailer was struck, leaving four dead and 16 injured

Investigators
say the float began crossing the train tracks in Midland, Texas even 
though warning bells were sounding and the crossing lights were 
flashing. A float in front managed to clear the tracks before the train 
sped through, but the second, driven by Hayden, did not.

A Union Pacific train travelling at 62mph ran into the truck as the occupants tried to jump to safety.

'It was pandemonium at the point of impact. Some (of the veterans) tried to jump and protect each other, their girlfriends and their wives,' Sheriff Gary Painter told the Midland Reporter-Telegram.

Eyewitness Eservando Wisler added to ABC News: 'I just saw people going under the train. There was blood. There was blood all over.'

Officials said that Stouffer and Boivin were pronounced dead at the scene, while Lubbers and Michael later died at hospital.

Federal investigators on Tuesday plan to re-enact the events that led to the collision. Midland police also are investigating the crash but it's not clear what, if any, criminal charges will be filed.

According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the crossing warning system was activated 20 seconds before the accident, and the guardrail began to come down seven seconds later.

But some Midland residents have said there isn't enough time between when the signal begins and the trains arrive. They say guardrails aren't completely down by the time a train comes by.

The veterans had been invited to Midland, a transportation and commerce hub in the West Texas oilfields, for a three-day weekend of hunting and shopping in appreciation of their service.

A local charity, Show of Support, had
organized the trip, parade and other festivities. Show of Support 
officials had previously declined to identify the driver.

Hayden began his military career as an active-duty soldier from 1980 to 1988. He did two stints in the Oklahoma National Guard in the 1990s before signing up again for the Army Reserve in December 2003, according to Army records.

He served in Iraq until March 2005 and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 until the following September.

There were 10 previous collisions at the same Midland railroad crossing, according to Federal Railroad Administration records reviewed by The Associated Press.

Five cars and five trucks have been struck by trains or rail equipment at the Garfield railroad crossing in Midland since 1979. Six drivers were injured in the accidents but there were no fatalities.
