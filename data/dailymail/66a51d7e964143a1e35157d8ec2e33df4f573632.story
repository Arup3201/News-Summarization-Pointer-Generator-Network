Lupita Nyong'o is without a doubt Hollywood's most feted star of the year - Kenya's president even described her as 'the pride of Africa' after her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress in the movie 12 Years A Slave.

And it seems that beauty brands are keen to snap up a piece of the Lupita magic - the actress has just been unveiled as the new brand ambassadress of Lancome.

The French beauty giant hand-picked the 31-year-old and said in a statement today: 'Her instinctive and sophisticated talent and one of a kind beauty, both delicate and strength-exuding, has taken the world by storm.'

Speaking about the Mexican-born, Kenyan actress, the brand said: 'She is an outstanding example of a natural beauty; confident and simply true to herself, she embraces life with freshness, citing happiness as the most attractive form of radiance.'

Lupita, a graduate of the Yale School of Drama who starred in several productions in Kenya before landing her breakout role alongside Brad Pitt, said: 'I am truly honored to join the Maison Lancôme, a brand with such a prestigious history and that I have always loved.

'I am particularly proud to represent its unique vision for women and the idea that beauty should not be dictated, but should instead be an expression of a woman's freedom to be herself.'

Lupita is in good company: Julia Roberts, Kate Winslet, Penélope Cruz and the recently appointed young actress Lily Collins are all Lancome ladies.
