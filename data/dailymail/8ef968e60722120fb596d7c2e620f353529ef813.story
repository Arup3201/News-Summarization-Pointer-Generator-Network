Ryan O'Neal snatched an Andy Warhol portrait of his ex-lover Farrah Fawcett from her home shortly after she died, even though he knew it was not his, it was claimed this week.

But as a long-awaited trial opened in Los Angeles, a lawyer for the veteran actor claimed he was the rightful owner of the painting, with an estimated value of up to $12 million (£7million).

Lawyers for the University of Texas at Austin told the panel 
of six women and six men that Fawcett repeatedly described herself as 
the portrait's owner before her death in 2009, and her dying wishes 
included that all her artwork be given to the school.

Claims: Ryan O'Neal snatched an Andy Warhol portrait of his ex-lover Farrah Fawcett from her home shortly after she died, even though he knew it was not his, it was claimed this week

Dispute: Warhol created his two silkscreen portraits of the actress in 1980

The university says Fawcett had insisted the Warhol painting should be displayed in a museum next to a near-identical portrait of the late actress.

The university's lawyer, David Beck, told the jury that O'Neal removed the work from Fawcett's Wilshire Boulevard condominium shortly after she died of cancer on June 25, 2009, aged 62.

'We need your help to resolve a dispute as to who really owns this Warhol painting,' he said in his opening statement in the LA Superior Court.

Relationship: O'Neal was Miss Fawcett's on-off lover for 30 years and they had a son Redmond

Fawcett 'had possession and control of these two paintings on the day she died and for years before that,' the university's lawyer said, claiming O'Neal knew that when he drove away with the disputed canvas.

'He didn't tell anyone what he was going to do, and he didn't tell anyone what he had done,' Beck said.

Outrage: Controversy also shrouded O'Neal, when he donated Farrah's infamous red swimsuit, seen here,  to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C.

Beck showed jurors Fawcett's living trust and told the panel that the actress chose not to leave anything to O'Neal. There's evidence that Fawcett described both of the portraits as her own, Beck said.

'We are now told, since Farrah is now dead and can't speak for herself, and Andy Warhol is dead and can't speak for himself, Mr. O'Neal says that portrait was never Farrah's to begin with,' Beck said.

But O'Neal's lawyer Martin Singer  said that the 
university is relying on witnesses who had animosity toward the 
Oscar-nominated actor and evidence would show the disputed artwork was a
 gift to O'Neal from Warhol.

He said the university was trying to 
take away the one portrait the 72-year-old actor has of 'the love of his
 life, Farrah Fawcett.'

'One
 iconic portrait of Farrah Fawcett is not enough,' he told jury, 
referring to the Warhol near-duplicate the university already has.

While
 the university says the portrait is worth about $12 million, O'Neal's 
lawyer estimated its value at just under $1 million, adding: 'The 
University of Texas should have been satisfied with what they got.'

Fawcett
 died in Los Angeles after a long battle with cancer on the same day 
that pop icon Michael Jackson passed away from an overdose of the 
anesthetic propofol, given to help him sleep as he rehearsed for a 
comeback tour.

O’Neal has previously said he feels closer to Miss Fawcett when he is surrounded by her possessions.

He said: ‘You know, Farrah was a very strong presence in my life. So strong. She permeated my mind and my being. She still does. She had that kind of hold on me.

‘I live in the same house that we lived in together. The things that are nice in my house are the things that she got me.’

Allegations: The university's lawyer, David Beck, told the jury that O'Neal removed the work from Fawcett's Wilshire Boulevard condominium shortly after she died in 2009

Warhol created his two silkscreen portraits of the actress in 1980 and both could be seen hanging in her home in the 2009 NBC documentary about her battle with cancer, Farrah’s Story.

O'Neal has said he intends to give the artwork to his son, Redmond. Redmond O'Neal is the only son between the actor and Fawcett.

Redmond O'Neal, 28, who has accompanied his father to court throughout jury selection and days of pretrial motions, will not be able to sit in on the trial until after he testifies, Superior Court Judge William MacLaughlin ruled Monday.

Controversy also shrouded O'Neal, when he donated Farrah's infamous red swimsuit to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C..

But Farrah's best-friend Alana Stewart has since fiercely defended O'Neal's move.

'Farrah would have been delighted about the presentation, as now this famous red bathing suit belongs to the American people,' she said.
