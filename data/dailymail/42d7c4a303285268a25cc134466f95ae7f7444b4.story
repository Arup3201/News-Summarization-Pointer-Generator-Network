Bruce Jenner has reportedly told police there was no way he could have avoided a four-car crash that left one woman dead and seven injured as the driver of the Lexus in front of him slammed on her brakes without warning.

Former Olympian Jenner, 65, smashed his Cadillac Escalade into the back of the victim's vehicle on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday.

The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead.

Yesterday it was reported that rather than a chain reaction causing the victim's Lexus to hit a Toyota Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars.

But multiple sources have now told TMZ that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was unable to say if the Lexus had already crashed into the Prius before his car became involved, because it all happened to quickly.

The website also reports that law enforcement believes Jenner may have been driving too close to the car in front of him and that drivers are supposed to leave enough space in between the vehicle they are following to prevent such accidents.

Police are still investigating the cause of Saturday's crash and it is thought they have not drawn any conclusions yet as to why it may have happened and are probing all possibilities, including that Jenner may have pushed the Lexus into oncoming traffic.

Law enforcement sources have also told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving.

It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius.

TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right.

Jenner, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction.

Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. 

It is illegal to text while driving in California.

The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel.

Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.'

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles.

The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.
