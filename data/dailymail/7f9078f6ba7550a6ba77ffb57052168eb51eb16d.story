When Darrell Plews discovered his wife of four years was leaving him after a whirlwind holiday romance with an African gardener he was, quite naturally, devastated.

But his heartbreak turned to anger when he was told that 35-year-old Michelle had tied the knot in secret in Gambia.

Plews, 44, gathered up his wife’s collection of designer clothes and shoes, dumped them on the patio of their £200,000 detached home, and started a bonfire.

Happier times: Darrell and Michelle Plews on their wedding day, but Michelle later left her husband and married a man she met in Gambia while on holiday, sending him into a furious rage

Fifty handbags and more than 100 pairs of shoes – from the likes of Gucci, Jimmy Choo and Vivienne Westwood – went on the blazing pile. For six hours the company director fed item after item into the flames in the back garden and watched as they went up in smoke.

His revenge earned him a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and a £5,000 bill to cover the damage to his ex-wife’s possessions. But despite the threat of jail, the father-of-two remained unrepentant yesterday.

He said he had no idea his wife and  25-year-old gardener Lamin Dampha had fallen in love during a family holiday to Africa in December.

The couple, who married in 2008, and their two children had travelled to Gambia on New Year’s Eve last year. While staying in Banjul they met £20-a-week gardener Mr Dampha.

‘I never even expected anything was going on between them,’ added Plews. ‘I don’t really know when it started to be honest.

‘We got back on January 7 and about two weeks later I suggested she went back for another holiday, so she took our kids. When she came back, something wasn’t right.

‘I tried to confront her about it but we ended up having a huge row and I left.’

Weeks later, in March, Plews discovered his wife had returned to Gambia once more, so he drove round to the family’s £200,000 detached home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

While he was there his wife’s mother arrived. He claims she showed him the photographs and said they were of the wedding day.

Mr Plews said: ‘She told me that Michelle had married this guy out there in January. I was absolutely shell-shocked. I couldn’t believe it at first but then her mum gave me the wedding photos, showing Michelle in her wedding dress and with all of his family. I couldn’t believe she had actually married this guy. They’d known each other about a week. He’s only 25. What could they possibly have in common?’

Mr Plews was so angry he found the wedding dress she had worn to marry Mr Dampha and, along with all of her designer shoes, handbags and clothes, set fire to them.

‘She loved her designer gear, so I knew it would annoy her. I bought most of the stuff anyway so I thought, right, I paid for this, I’m going to burn it,’ he added. ‘There was stuff by Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Vivienne Westwood, about 50 handbags, 100 pairs of shoes – anything I could get my hands on.

‘I made a pile of them on the flagstones in the back of the garden, poured petrol all over it and burnt the lot.

Bonfire: Once Darrell heard his wife had married another man he stormed to their marital home in Wakefield, pictured, and torched designer clothes, shoes and handbags

‘One of the neighbours sent her an email in Gambia to tell her what was happening so the next thing I knew, the police were knocking on the door.

‘I told them I was just burning some of my old clothes.’

Plews, who ran a store fitting company with his wife until they split up, was later charged with arson and theft and admitted the offences at Leeds Crown Court.

Richard Canning, mitigating, said: ‘Mr Plews kept his wife, he thought, very happy over the years. It’s difficult for him not to see himself as the victim in this case. He has lost his wife, his house and his children.’

Plews, who has previous convictions for offences including grievous bodily harm, theft and burglary, must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He said he divorced two weeks ago.

Since then, his ex-wife has returned to Gambia to officially register her marriage and plans to bring her new husband back to the UK.

Mrs Plews said yesterday: ‘How am I meant to get married in one country when I’m already married in another? That’s bigamy. You tell me how that’s possible.’ She refused to comment further.
