After the boy's sudden death, an autopsy was ordered and led the coroner to discover an electrocution burn on the body.

Shawnee police said the tragic death highlights the dangers of working on computers without being fully trained.

Many people don’t realize that the power supply  - which is made up of capacitors - carry a charge for several days or weeks, even when they are unplugged and broken.

Computers experts have warned not to strip an old computer to build a new one because of the danger it poses to people who don’t know what they are doing.

Computer Dave Bradshaw said the computer parts are cheap and advised against taking the risk.

He told KCTV5: 'Why tear into it to replace it for $20? You're taking your life into your own hands.'
