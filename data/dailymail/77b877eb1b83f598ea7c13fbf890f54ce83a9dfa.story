The Duke of Wellington is famously quoted as saying that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.

And now an amazing 150-year-old photograph has emerged of boys at the private school playing cricket - one of the earliest images ever taken of the sport.

The earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere, has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. 

An 1860s photograph of young men playing cricket at Eton has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. It is thought to be the second oldest image of the sport ever taken 

The photograph was signed by Victor A. Prout in pencil. It will be sold at auction by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester

Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, was a British leader who is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton College when he was a student in the 1780s.

The Duke attended Eton, which was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI, before he joined the army in 1787 and later helped defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815.

According to history, he touched the ground at Eton and claimed: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.'

He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.'

His statements were construed by historians as references to the 'manly character induced by games and sport' among the English youth.

The previously unseen image was taken in the early 1860s and shows 11 young men dressed smartly in trousers and waistcoats. 

Resting on their bats, they pose for the photographer with the distinctive Eton College visible behind them. 

The photograph was taken by Victor A. Prout who signed it in pencil afterwards. Dating from around 1862, it was taken just five years after the first ever image depicting the sport. 

It is to be sold by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and is expected to fetch at least £500.  

Auctioneer and Senior Valuer Chris Albury said: 'This early, and previously unknown, cricket photograph in this album probably dates from circa 1862, some five years after the earliest photograph of a cricket match.'

The first ever photo of cricket was taken by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War.

He first captured the sport in during a match between the Royal Artillery and the Hunsdonbury Cricket Club at the Honourable Artillery Ground in Islington, London, 25 July 1857.

Around 100 years before the image of taken the Duke of Wellington is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton where he was a student. 

Touching the ground, history claims he said: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' 

Eton College was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI to school 70 poor boys. The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441.

The school has long been associated with cricket with its annual fixture against Harrow dating back to 1805. 

Cricket has long been part of Eton's sporting curriculum. Above, members of the first XI before a match against Household Brigade in 1925

English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt (pictured) perhaps summed up the spirit of the 19th Century best, with his famous work known as 'Vitaï Lampada'

In the 19th century, character building through sports was said to be vital in morally equipping young men to achieve greatness later in life.

Many held the view that 'manly characteristics' were developed by gaming and sports, and that those who flourished on the field would go on to carve successful careers as soldiers or engineers.

English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt perhaps summed up the spirit of the age best, with his famous work known as 'Vitaï Lampada'.

The poem, written in 1892, refers to how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the famous Close at Clifton College.

Vitaï Lampada, which means 'the torch of life', also makes reference to the Battle of Abu Klea in Sudan in January 1885.

The poem, in full: 

There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—

Ten to make and the match to win—

A bumping pitch and a blinding light,

An hour to play and the last man in.

And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,

Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,

But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote

'Play up! play up! and play the game!'

The sand of the desert is sodden red,—

Red with the wreck of a square that broke;—

The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel dead,

And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.

The river of death has brimmed his banks,

And England's far, and Honour a name,

But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:

'Play up! play up! and play the game!'

This is the word that year by year,

While in her place the school is set,

Every one of her sons must hear,

And none that hears it dare forget.

This they all with a joyful mind

Bear through life like a torch in flame,

And falling fling to the host behind—

'Play up! play up! and play the game!'
