A large pair of strange feet tickling your own is the last thing you'd expect on a flight.

But these particular toes caused some alarm for an Adelaide woman who awoke to find them peeking out from beneath her seat.

Camille was recently flying from Adelaide to Darwin when the large and unclean feet stretched out to touch hers.

These particular toes caused some alarm for an Adelaide woman who awoke to find them peeking out from beneath her seat on a recent flight

'I was sleeping and they scared the crap out of me,' she told the NT News.

'Having seen snakes on the plane (recently) definitely didn't help the situation.' 

But it's not the first time a passenger has faced a similar intrusion. 

There's a Passenger Shaming website run by former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen that is littered with photos disgruntled people have shot during their travels. 

Passenger Shaming was set up in March 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying.

The photos, which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants, are posted to Facebook and Instagram and the results are sure to shock. 

But it's not the first time a passenger has faced a similar intrusion, with a Passenger Shaming website set up to allow disgruntled people to share strange habits of their fellow flyers

The website, run by former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen, is littered with photos disgruntled people have shot during their travels, including this shot of a child's potty in the galley

Since its inception the site has drawn attention from passengers and flight attendants across the world and its Facebook page now has more than 250,000 likes.

'Initially it was mostly crew members who were sending photos through, but now it's probably 75 percent passengers and 25 percent crew. The passengers are over it,' Ms Kathleen told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm getting inundated with (photos) right now. I'm getting 50 a day via email and Facebook.' 

Ms Kathleen, who worked as a flight attendant for seven years, says she is accustomed to the less than desirable behaviour displayed by some passengers.

'I did this stuff but not to this extent. Some of this stuff is ridiculous. The dirty diapers are huge. Some people think it’s staged, but it happens literally every day where people stuff them in the back of the seat or throw it on the ground,' she said. 

Bare feet are also a common occurrence on tray tables, walls and stretched into other passengers' personal space.

This man obviously thought he was still in his own lounge room, rather than an airline lounge

It's not even clear what this passenger was thinking as she slept with what looked to be a see through jacket

Recent photos in the past month shows a suit jacket over the back of a man's seat, a potty in the aisle, people sleeping in inappropriate areas and dirty nappies stuffed in the seat pockets. 

Images to have been previously uploaded include people resting their feet near other passengers' heads, clipping their finger and toenails, eating smelly food and leaving a wake of destruction behind them.

'Probably one of my favourites is one with the feet coming through the middle of a seat,' Ms Kathleen said. 

The inspiration for Passenger Shaming came when the former flight attendant started receiving photos from people who read her blog, Rants of a Sassy Stew. 

'That focuses on me obviously ranting about poor passenger behaviour and telling stories I experience,' she said.

'Then I thought I'd branch off on social media using photos. Now I have the photos to back up what I've been talking about on my blog.

'They prove I'm not exaggerating - this is how ridiculous people are on air planes.'   

This woman may have run out of time for a pedicure, but the next best thing was a DIY job in her plane seat

Everyone knows plane seats aren't the most comfortable thing to sleep in, so this passenger decided the galley floor was the best place to catch up 

Recent photos in the past month on Passenger Shaming include this shot of a passenger's legs resting high in the air

Surely this isn't comfortable? One passenger was photographed folding their legs up on the tray table

This man treated the plane like his office when he draped his suit jacket over the back of his chair 

The Facebook page has drawn attention from passengers right around the world and currently has more than 250,000 likes.

Passenger Shaming's Instagram account has also taken off with more than 200,000 followers. 

Ms Kathleen says she filters every photo she is sent before it goes up online.

'I don’t post things based on appearance, like being overweight or clothing, I get heaps of those. But that's not what it’s about, it's about passenger behaviour,' she said.
