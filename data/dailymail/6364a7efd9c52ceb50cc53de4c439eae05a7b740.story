Brutal: Andrew Bullock, 19, of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, was jailed for up to 37 years for raping an 85-year-old nun behind a church 

An 85-year-old western Pennsylvania nun issued a statement forgiving the man who raped her  as the judge sentenced the 19-year-old to between 18½ and 37 years in prison.

The victim didn't appear in a Beaver County courtroom when Andrew Bullock, of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, was sentenced Wednesday. Rather, another sister read a statement on the victim's behalf.

The letter sent by the woman who is part of, Sisters of St. Jospeh, says: 'My profound and permanent prayer for you, Andrew, is that you wholeheartedly take advantage of the educational, uplifting, socially positive opportunities that may be available during your prison time.'

In a victim impact statement she wrote that she could forgive Bullock with the grace of God. 

The nun was 85 when Bullock approached her at a recycling bin behind St. Titus Church in Aliquippa on December 13, 2013. 

After offering to help her load some newspapers, he exposed himself, punched the nun in the jaw and knocked her face-down while raping and screaming at her.

During a preliminary hearing, the victim told a magistrate that she thought she was going to die during the attack.

In the first half of the letter she states that prior to the assault she didn't fully understand the meaning of the word 'terror' and now she finds it difficult to sleep.

The victim also described how when someone unexpectedly approaches her 'a single second of cold fear rips through me'.

Members of Bullock's family were in the courtroom when the sentence was handed down and they said they hoped the victim would find closure. 

Nadine Toliver, Bullock's stepsister told WTAE: 'We feel bad for her and her family, and that maybe now she can find some closure.'But, I do want to apologize for her about what happened.' 

Forgiveness: In the letter, the 85-year-old victim says that she forgives Bullock by 'God's merciful grace'. She also describes the lasting impact the attack has had on her 

Attack: Bullock asked the victim for help loading newspapers before punching her in the jaw and holding her down behind the St. Titus Church in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, last December

Another stepsister Marjorie Jackson added: 'I can't even begin to wonder why or how he done it,' That's not the brother that I knew.'

Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Popovich told the station: 'While they speak of forgiveness, there is still a place for punishment and that is what I believe we’ve seen here today in court.' 

Judge Harry Knafelc also deemed Bullock a sexually violent predator

This means when Bullock is released he will have to take part in monthly counseling sessions for the rest of his life and register his address on the Megan's Law website. 

Support: A statement from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden, Pennsylvania, says the 'sister' asks for 'continued prayers for her and for Andrew Bullock

Future: Bullock (pictured left at time of attack and right in court on Wednesday) was deemed a violent sexual predator and, following his release, will have to attend monthly counselling sessions for the rest of his life
