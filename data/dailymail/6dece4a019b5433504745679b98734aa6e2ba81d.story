Cracking down: Keir Starmer is introducing a raft of measures within the criminal justice system to ensure there is not another 'Jimmy Savile moment'

Hundreds of dropped child sex abuse cases are to be reviewed as part of radical plans to head off 'another Savile moment', the Director of Public 
Prosecutions said today.

Keir Starmer QC is introducing a raft of measures intended to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities.

He said prosecutors have 
been ‘too cautious’ in their approach and a new tough strategy is needed
to bring more sex offenders to justice.

He is also expected to admit that the number of victims in the Jimmy Savile case ‘may be considerably higher than previously thought.’

Mr Starmer said police and prosecutors are ‘still adopting the wrong approaches in cases of sexual assault.’

Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said a 'scoping panel' will be set up to take a 'second look' at historic cases before advising chief constables on whether they should be reopened.

Asked how many cases will be examined, he said: 'This is likely to be hundreds, rather than thousands.'

Mr Starmer warned 'the pendulum has swung too far against the child', meaning police are now inclined not to believe children reporting abuse.

Mr
Starmer said he will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been 
introduced over the last 10 years with new single policy for England and
Wales.

He said that in future prosecutors and police will be expected 
‘explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases’ instead of just
focusing on the account of the victim.

He said: 'We have got to clear the decks and craft the way we prosecute cases. Anyone who has ever prosecuted any of these cases will know they are extremely difficult.'

Mr
Starmer unveiled the measures with the Association of Chief Police 
Officers’ lead on violence and public protection, Chief Constable David 
Whatton.

Speaking earlier, he said: 'We cannot afford 
another Savile moment in five or 10 years' time. Whatever approach is 
now agreed it has to be fully informed, coherent, consistently applied 
across the country and able to withstand the test of time.'

The late DJ Jimmy Savile was one of 
Britain's most prolific sexual predators, but slipped under the radar 
and was allowed to abuse on a massive scale.

Police in Operation Yewtree - the 
investigation into Savile - currently estimates he abused around 450 victims.

Horrific: The Director of Public Prosecutions is 
also expected to admit that the number of victims abused by Jimmy Savile 'may be considerably higher than previously thought'

Mr Starmer said: 'Police and 
prosecutors have significantly improved the way we investigate and 
prosecute sexual offences in recent years, particularly those involving 
children.

'The results have been encouraging 
with more cases being brought to court, higher conviction rates and more
defendants pleading guilty.

'Yet, despite all this, events over the last 12 months raise fundamental questions about our approach to these cases.'

He added: 'We are clear that the 
yardsticks for testing the credibility and reliability of victims in 
sexual abuse cases do not serve the police or prosecutors well and risk 
leaving an identifiable group of vulnerable victims unprotected by the 
criminal law.'

In a speech this evening in London to 
an invited audience of representatives of charities, campaigners and 
Government officials, the DPP will set out the results of discussions 
undertaken with leading police officers, including Mr Whatton.

Teamwork: Mr Starmer unveiled the measures with the ACPO's lead on violence and public protection, Chief Constable David Whatton (pictured)

Mr Whatton said: 'By working shoulder 
to shoulder with the Crown Prosecution Service and the College of 
Policing, ACPO is keen to ensure that we continue to build on progress 
in the area of sex offence investigation.

'We have proposed a package of 
measures, including a rationalisation of guidance, training and 
consideration of a review panel mechanism to ensure we have truly 
learned from the lessons of the past.'

The CPS and ACPO have agreed:

Mr Starmer said: 'There is an urgent 
need for an informed national debate about the proper approach to the 
investigation and prosecution of sexual offences.

'That debate needs to extend well 
beyond the CPS and the police.

'Above all, a national consensus needs to 
be reached on the issues.'

To this end, ACPO and the CPS will 
host a series of 'round tables' with bodies and individuals with 
responsibility, interest or expertise in the field in order to explore 
and test the revised guidance on investigating and prosecuting sexual 
assault cases.
