The California Supreme Court says Anna Nicole Smith's manager can be retried on conspiracy charges related to the model's prescription drug use.

The ruling Monday returns the case to a criminal judge in Los Angeles, but it does not guarantee that Smith's manager Howard K. Stern will be retried.

The ruling states that Stern could face a retrial on two conspiracy charges if a judge grants a request by prosecutors for a new trial and does not find another legal basis to dismiss the case.

Confidante: Howard K. Stern (right) had been Anna Nicole Smith's lawyer, manager, lover and friend since they met in 2001 - following her death in 2007 he was accused of helping fuel her prescription drug problem 

Stern was previously acquitted of most of the 11 counts he faced related to the obtaining of prescription drugs for Smith, who died in Florida in 2007.

A jury convicted Stern of two counts of conspiracy in 2010, but a judge later dismissed the case. 

An appeals court ordered the convictions reinstated and ruled that Stern could not be retried.

Stern's attorney Steve Sadow was not immediately available for comment.

Unfinished business: The California Supreme Court ruled on Monday November 3,  2014, that Stern may be retried on two counts of conspiracy related to obtaining prescriptions for Smith
