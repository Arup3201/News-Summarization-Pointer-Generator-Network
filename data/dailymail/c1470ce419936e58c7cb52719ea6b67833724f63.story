A mother called police to a children's playground after getting into a heated row with another parent over whose child's turn it was to use a swing.

The unnamed mother claims she was approached by a father who wanted to use a swing her daughter was playing on at Livvi's Place, a park in Ryde, Sydney.

She alleges that when she replied that they would be another five minutes, the dad  stopped the swing which was still in motion, before trying to forcibly lift her child out of it so his own toddler could play on it.

The outraged mother then called police over the incident - saying she felt 'intimidated' by the man's actions. 

Another mother who witnessed the incident posted the details online which has now sparked a furious debate over who was in the right. 

The scene of the playground stoush : Livvi's Place in Ryde, Sydney.  A mother called the police after getting into a heated row with another parent over whose child's turn it was to use a swing.

Playground battle: A mother playing with her daughter at a busy playground in Ryde, Sydney, claims a father tried to remove her daughter from a swing so his own child could play on it 

Witness: Elaine Stack (pictured) talked to the mother after the incident and decided to post the story on her facebook page and gauge responses from other parents

Witness Elaine Stack revealed on Facebook how she was with a group of other mums at the park when the police arrived.

'The police spoke to the father for a few minutes and left', she said. 'The police just said to father, you never put a hand on another persons child.'

The 37-year-old said she then spoke to the mother involved and decided to put details of the incident online to see what other parents thought.

She wrote: 'A Mother was pushing her little girl on a swing when a Father approached and said he was also waiting for the swing'.

'The Mother replied that they would be another five minutes or so. The Father proceeded to stop the swing in motion and tried to lift the daughter out'.

'The Mother was very upset and called the police. Another parent in the park thought this was a little overboard. What would you do? Would you call the police?'

Debate: Elaine Stack posted details of the incident online which then sparked a furious debate between parents

Concerned mum: Elaine Stack (pictured) said she agreed with the mother calling the police but had admitted not to hearing the father's side of the story

Ms Stack said the mother told her she felt intimidated by the actions of the father and was left very upset by the whole incident. 

She said: 'She takes her little girl to the park most days and wanted to feel that it was a safe place to go in the future. She felt the man had really over stepped the mark.'

But the owner of Nell and Oll, an online boutique children's store, says while she didn't know either parents she decided to post the incident to a Facebook page in a bid to gauge what others parents would do in that situation.

Ms Stack's post received an overwhelming response and had more than 100 comments with parents split over who was in the right. 

'It was something I knew there'd be a response to, people were very passionate.' Ms Stack said.

'It was interesting to see it was 50/50. I'm surprised how it snowballed so quickly.' 

Some parents backed the mother's actions, with one writing: 'How dare he touch another persons child'. 

Talking point: Ms Stack wrote that putting your hands on anyone else's child is a 'huge no no' but she did not get hear the father's side of the story

Who was in the right?The row over the playground swing has left parents divided on whether the mother was correct to call the police or if she was overreacting 

But others thought it was unnecessary to call the police with one person commenting: 'Having to call the police over a swing is ridiculous.' 

Ms Stack, who has a newborn baby, described Livvi's Place as a busy playground that was suitable for all ages of children and was left surprised by the incident. 

She said: 'I hear everyone's point of view and understand the outrage.

'I think it is clear to everyone that putting your hands on anyone else's child is a huge no no'.

'I was not involved in this situation and therefore do not know all the details. I do know that the Mother was very upset as I spoke to her as she left the park'.

Ms Stack  admits she thought the mother had done the right thing for herself and her little girl, but added she didn't hear the father's point of view.

Police have confirmed that they spoke to both parents following the incident and no arrests were made.

'Police were called yesterday, police attended a dispute in the playground', said a police media spokesman.

She said 'police spoke to both parties and neither wanted to make a further complain. No offence was detected.'
