On Monday the likes of Ander Herrera, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao enjoyed kickabouts with kids in schools across Manchester for United's admirable foundation.

Across the city, Manuel Pellegrini and Samir Nasri were facing the world's media ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit of Barcelona.

Things have changed in these parts with the blue half seemingly in the ascendency after decades of red dominance.

RECENT HISTORY

City undoubtedly hold the upper hand. Two Premier League titles in three years have been greeted deliriously by the previously success-starved blue half of Manchester. 

This year they are locked in a two-horse race with Chelsea, with United lagging behind in the chasing pack as the home straight looms large. The noisy neighbours have cranked up the volume to 11 and it appears to be stuck there. Getting past Barcelona in the Champions League will see them hit the next level on their upwards trajectory.

United, on the other hand, are facing a fight to avoid a second season without Champions League football. Currently in fourth, Louis van Gaal's men have a season-defining run-in with a resurgent Liverpool breathing down their necks.

The Dutchman has a track record that cannot be questioned and should be judged after next season, but at the moment they are lagging behind their cross-town rivals.

OVERALL HISTORY

Not even a contest. United's haul of trophies and City's barren decades make for some lopsided scorelines.

Top-flight titles? That'll be 20 to four. European Cups? Three to none. FA Cups? 11 to five.

The Stone Roses sang 'the past was yours but the future's mine,' in She Bangs the Drums and City fans believe this so firmly they had the lyrics put on a banner.

TRANSFER MARKET

United's summer frenzy had many wondering if Dale Winton had gone on location to film a one-off Supermarket Sweep at Old Trafford. Ed Woodward, keen not to leave his new manager without stock, waltzed down the transfer aisle, lobbing the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria into his red trolley as the clock ticked towards deadline.

There will be no repeat this summer with targets already identified and work underway. This is an approach akin to that now used at City, who these days tend to do their business quickly and, where possible, under the radar.

Financial Fair Play sanctions, which the club still believe were unjustified, have stopped them from widening the gap even further.

SQUAD

Again, City have the upper hand. As Van Gaal continues to search for the right formula City's old guard is again clicking into gear. Pellegrini has two quality players vying for each position. The spine of his team, Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero would appear to be going nowhere.

An indication of how much things have changed came in the season's first derby, when City fans drfited away from the Etihad Stadium a little deflated after a 1-0 win that, only a few years ago, would have been deliriously received.

TURNOVER

Often used to measure club size, City turned over a record £347million last year which they believe will rise again this time around. Executives are confident that for the first time since their Abu Dhabi takeover, the club will post a profit.

Commercial income was £166m, by far a club record, and more partnerships have since been announced.

Across town, however, United remain ahead. Last year, they turned over a record £433.2m and made a profit of £23.9m. Their commercial intake was £189.3m.

This time around the club have forecast that, thanks mainly to the impact of no Champions League football, turnover will drop below £400m. It could mean that, for the first time in living memory, City's turnover is more than that of their rivals.

That said, United's record kit deal with adidas and rapidly expanding commercial machine should see a sharp swelling in the Old Trafford coffers in 2015-16.

Officials remain relaxed about the large chunk of Glazer debt that remains (£380.5m).

FANBASE

Domestically and internationally United continue to lead the way. They regularly attract crowds of 75,000 to Old Trafford - around 30,000 more than City get at the Etihad Stadium. That gap is expected to narrow when City complete the first phase of their stadium expansion which will see capacity rise above 55,000. A recent survey commissioned by City executives claimed that their global fanbase had expanded at the astonishing rate of 500 per cent in just three years.

The same figures claimed the club now had 37.97m followers across the world. That is dwarfed by the figure United famously use, which states that they have 659m supporters on the planet.

This area is hard to measure. Woodward recently pointed out in a call to investors, however, that four of the top five US TV soccer audiences were for United matches. City will no doubt take solace that their recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea attracted 1.34m viewers Stateside, a rise of 316 per cent from the 324,000 who watched the same fixture in 2010.

INFRASTRUCTURE

It might not seem like it, with more than £1.15bn spent in six years, but from the start City's Abu Dhabi ownership wanted to make the club a sustainable model. A big part of that process was getting the infrastructure right. 

When the new owners arrived they were stunned to find an ill-equipped training ground and a Premier League club with no HR department or chief finance officer. Under the guidance of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the transformation on the pitch has been mirrored by that off it. 

The £200m City Football Academy is one of the finest facilities in world football while the number of staff at the club dwarfs what it was just over half a decade ago. Add to that sister clubs in Melbourne and New York and City appear well-equipped for an assault on global domination.

At the last count, United had a Red Army of 837 full-time staff. Many of those are based in their Mayfair office. When it comes to capitalising on the Premier League's global appeal, United are second to none and got a head start on many of their rivals.

While Carrington is world class, Van Gaal ordered a number of renovations shortly after his arrival which should stand them in good stead. The club's academy continues to churn out footballers but, given the changing nature of the game, the success of the Class of '92 may never be repeated.

CONCLUSION

United remain the biggest club and should do so for the foreseeable future. That is not to say that the gap has not been substantially narrowed. The longer City remain the dominant force on the field the more danger United will find themselves in of one day being overtaken. Many more seasons without Champions League football could have a dramatic impact.

For generations, with City a laughing stock, United considered Liverpool their main rivals. Some will stubbornly say that will never change. It already has, both on the field and off it.
