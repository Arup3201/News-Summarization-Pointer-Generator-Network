A fish caught off the coast of Western Australia has set a new record in the state as its oldest fish, living to the age of 84.

The 60-centimetre long female Bight redfish - its scientific name Centroberyx gerrardi - was captured in November last year.

The maximum length of this species of fish is usually 46 centimetres.

But scientists were only able to identify its age until now as they needed to look at its bones.

'It's not possible to tell the age of a fish from looking at it. So its age wasn't discovered until its skeleton went under the microscope at the Department of Fisheries' Hillarys research centre just recently,' Fisheries Minister Ken Baston said.

The age of the fish was determined by the number of growth rings of the inner ear bones known as the otoliths.

It is similar to the process used to find out the age of trees by the cross-section of its trunks.

The find knocked off a previous record of 78 years held jointly by a western foxfish (Bodianus frenchii) and a bass groper (Polyprion americanus).

Born in 1929, the Bight redfish made its debut into the world at the same time as Popeye and the Academy Awards.

James Scullin took over from Stanley Bruce as Australia's ninth prime minister. Current Prime Minister Tony Abbott is the 28th. 

The fish's skeleton was collected as part of a State Natural Resource Management office funded research project to assess the overall health of south coast stocks.

It was caught off the south coast of Western Australia and handed into the state's Department of Fisheries where it was looked at by researchers who determined its age

Determining the fish's age was a joint effort between researchers from the Department of Fisheries and Murdoch University's Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research.

Mr Baston said it was encouraging the research was being supported by recreational fishers and commercial fish processors on the south coast who have been donating fish frames of the required species with skeleton and head left intact after filleting.

Bight redfish is one of the key species being checked. 

The project is also looking at pink snapper, blue morwong and donated frames of three near shore finfish species - Australian herring, King George whiting and tailor.
