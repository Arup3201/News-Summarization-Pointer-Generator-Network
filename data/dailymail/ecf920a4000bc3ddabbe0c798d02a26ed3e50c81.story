A toddler has made a miracle recovery after falling on a coloring pencil which pierced through her eye and traveled five inches through her brain to the back of her scull.

19-month-old Olivia Smith fell onto the pencil from her chair while drawing in the family's New Boston lounge two and a half weeks ago.

Her mother, Susie Smith, 30, picked her up after she fell and saw part of the orange pencil poking out.

'I picked her up like this and said, ‘You’re okay,’ and just picked her up. And the pencil was coming right out of her eye only a little bit,' Mrs Smith told WHDH.com.

"I thought the pencil had broken or something.'

'My three-year old said it's in her head', she told ABCNews.

Olivia was rushed to Boston's Children Hospital by emergency crews responding to her mother's frantic call.

Ouch! Emergency workers were delighted and shocked at Olivia Smith's full recovery after an orange coloring pencil, like the one pictured left, pierced through her brain, shown on another x-ray of the 19-month-old right

An x-ray at the hospital revealed the pencil's path. It entered through her right eye diagonally across the brain to her left ear.

She suffered three strokes during her ordeal but doctors were somehow able to remove the pencil without surgery.

Following their amazing procedure, Olivia began to return to being her energetic self. 

She spent eight days in hospital and a week in rehabilitation, aiding her return to full movement following the strokes which affected her right side.

She returned home on Wednesday and is now expected to make a full recovery without any damage to her sight, brain or movement. She is already up and running around as usual.

Grateful: Olivia Smith's parents Tyler and Susie expressed their gratitude to the local emergency workers, pictured with Susie and Olivia, who helped rush their daughter to hospital two and a half weeks ago

'For two days she didn't really have any progress. She was opening her eyes but she wasn't talking or responding or smiling or anything,' her father Tyler Smith told the New Hampshire Union Leader.

'She started to crack a bit of a smile, very small, only on that one side, then a little later I got her to laugh and she said, 'Daddy,' which was an amazing moment.'

Her mother, who is 20 weeks pregnant and cares for the couple's two other daughters as well, added: 'She is so strong. She's a fighter. If she wants to do something. she's going to do it. She's amazing.'

'The neurosurgeon said if you were to sit down and map out a way you would want a pencil to go through the brain, that's what you would have happen, because it missed everything,' she told the local newspaper.

Emergency workers dubbed it a 'miracle'.

'These things don't happen," said New Boston Fire Chief Dan MacDonald, who was first to respond to the call said in the report. 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.'
