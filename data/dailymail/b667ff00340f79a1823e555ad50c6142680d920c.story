Denials: Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans arrives at Preston Crown Court, where he faces nine charges, including rape

Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans told police he was ‘staggered’ at being accused of raping a man 33 years his junior, saying his alleged victim was ‘no wilting flower’.

He later told detectives he was the victim of a plot to destroy his career after learning that a total of seven men had come forward accusing him of sexually assaulting them, a court heard yesterday.

The gay ex-Tory MP, who now sits as an independent, said the 22-year-old alleged rape victim asked: ‘Should I follow you in?’ when he went to bed after a drink-fuelled dinner party at his constituency home, and then stripped off.

‘At no stage did he give me an indication that he was anything other than content to be with me in bed and having sex,’ he told officers.

However, the 56-year-old did admit another man told him ‘No, stop, stop’ as they ‘nestled together’ on a sofa on an  earlier occasion, saying that he had misread his signals.

Yesterday the jury in his trial at Preston Crown Court was given details of his answers following his arrest for rape on May 4 last year, five weeks after the alleged attack.

‘Did I have sexual contact with him, the answer is yes,’ the Ribble Valley MP told detectives. ‘Was it non-consensual, the answer is no.’

Evans told officers that guests at the party at his constituency home in Pendleton, Lancashire, all left except for the student, who was planning to stay in his spare room.

But he said they began kissing, and when Evans went to go to his bedroom the student asked, ‘Should I follow you in?’ to which the MP said ‘Yes’, and they each took their own clothes off.

‘At what stage he thought what was going to happen was not consensual, I’m a bit mystified,’ he told officers.

Evans told detectives that, far from being ‘incredibly shy’, the complainant was someone who ‘wanted to have sex with me’.

‘We are not talking about a wilting flower here,’ he added.

In a second police interview a few hours later, Evans was quizzed over claims from a 23-year-old bisexual political aide who earlier told the jury he awoke on the MP’s sofa in 2009 to find Evans being intimate.

Evans told officers the pair had been ‘flirtatious’ earlier in a drunken evening and he had ‘misread the signals’ by twice reaching towards him, but denied touching the man intimately.

Arrested later over further allegations, Evans highlighted links between a number of his accusers and said he feared he was a victim of efforts to ‘destroy his career’.

Evans denies one count of rape, six sexual assaults and two indecent assaults against seven men.

The case continues.
