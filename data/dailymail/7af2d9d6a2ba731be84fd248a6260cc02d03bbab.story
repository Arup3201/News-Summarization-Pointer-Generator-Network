For many people a day out in the sunshine is not complete without a visit to an ice cream van, but unfortunately sometimes a 99 can prove disappointing and messy.

However, in a bid to cure people of Flake 'angle-angst' - which, apparently, is rife - a scientist claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream.

His research found the recipe 
for a successful 99 means a flake should sit at precisely 45 degrees, have 35 
per cent 'chocolate crumbliness' and the ice cream should be chilled to minus 15°C.

A scientist (not pictured) claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream. The research commissioned by Cadbury found the perfect recipe for a successful 99 means a flake sitting at precisely 45 degrees, 35 per cent chocolate crumbliness and ice cream chilled to minus 15

The study is said to have come about after Cadbury, which makes the flakes for the ice creams, received phone calls from seriously concerned 99 lovers who were worried about the angle the flake was served at in their cone.

The company sought out an expert to come up with the ideal way in which the ice cream should be constructed, which will be shared with the Ice Cream Alliance - the UK trade association for ice cream manufacturers and retailers - which might mean customers will be more satisfied with their 99s in future.

68 per cent of people consider the flake is the most crucial part and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle, the study said

Simon Moore, a professor at London Metropolitan University questioned 1000 Britons over the iconic ice cream.

He found 68 per cent of enthusiasts consider the flake is the most crucial part - as they like to use it as a spoon - and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle. 

Around 55 per cent of people polled claim to suffer 'angle-angst', while 18 per cent are worried they will be poked in the eye if the flake is at any angle other than vertical.

Around 55 per cent of people 
deliberately eat that flake first while 28 per cent find the ice cream 
tastier with the chocolate in it.

More
 than half of people believe the perfect ratio for the amount of solid 
chocolate to crumbliness is between 35 and 50 per cent.

The optimum temperature was decided by Piccadilly Whip, one of London’s biggest ice cream fleets.

At minus 15 degrees Celsius, the ice cream doesn’t freeze the teeth but is cold enough so it doesn’t melt straight away.

Tony Bilsborough, spokesman for 
Cadbury Flake predictably said: 'The actual origin of a ‘99’ is lost in 
the mists of time but the most common explanation is when the Flake 99 
was launched, the UK ice cream industry was dominated by Italians. 

'At
 the time there was a legend that a former King of Italy had surrounded 
himself with an elite bodyguard of 99 soldiers so, to Italians, the 
number 99 signified excellence.'
