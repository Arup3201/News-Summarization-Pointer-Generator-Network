League One Sheffield United produced another major cup upset on a feisty night that ended with Southampton manager Ronald Koeman refusing to shake the hand of his victorious rival Nigel Clough.

Marc McNulty's scrappy second-half winner – following an error from England goalkeeper Fraser Forster – took the Blades into their second consecutive major cup semi-final following their run in last season's FA Cup.

It was accompanied by a constant roar from the Bramall Lane faithful and the animated presence on the touchline of Clough and his assistant, former Blades skipper Chris Morgan.

Morgan was sent to the stands after United's goal for making one comment too many and afterwards Koeman blanked Clough's offer to shake hands.

'I only shake hands with people who have respect for me as a coach, who have respect for the fourth official,' said the clearly cheesed off Dutchman.

'The behaviour of the bench of Sheffield United, I have never seen that (before). That was the reason I didn't shake hands.'

Nigel's father Brian wouldn't have been happy at any alleged haranguing of fourth official Paul Tierney or any other official but he would have been delighted by the effort and commitment shown by the underdogs.

Even though Southampton had lost their last four games and were without suspended top scorer Graziano Pelle, they do stand fifth in the Premier League and were hot favourites after Koeman named a strong team with regulars Nathaniel Clyne, Ryan Bertrand and Victor Wanyama included, and Morgan Schneiderlin making a welcome return from injury.

But United just didn't let them settle from the first whistle to the last, so much so that even Koeman didn't have any complaint about the final outcome. 'We hit the ball too long, we didn't play our normal football and to give them credit, they made it difficult for us,' he said.

After an opening 45 minutes that saw 19 fouls committed without a single shot on target being registered, the home side – who beat West Ham earlier in the competition – stepped up a gear.

Southampton’s first shot on target in the match didn’t arrive until the 70th minute. They had eight attempts off target before then. 

Forster made fantastic saves to keep out Jamie Murphy and Michael Doyle but then became a culprit as Sheffield took the lead after 63 minutes.

A free-kick by Bob Harris was fumbled by the Saints goalkeeper and from a couple of yards, McNulty beat a posse of players from both sides to get their first and squeeze the ball over the line.

The Scot, signed from Livingston in the summer, couldn't stop smiling and said: 'It was a striker's goal, a poach inside the box.'

Clough was also delighted. His side, fifth in League One, have now beaten four Premier League clubs in 2014. His half-time substitute Che Adams was playing non-league football for Ilkeston a few weeks ago.

'The only disappointment was we didn't win by more,' said Clough. 'That's the story, I don't think a sentence should be written about the managers,' he said rather irritatedly when the subject of the non-handshake came up.

The real surprise was that Southampton failed to pepper the United goal when they had 27 minutes to save the tie.

Instead, the home side seemed likelier to score and Southampton's misery was compounded at the start of four minutes' injury-time when Florin Gardos was shown the red card for fouling McNulty as he threatened to break away and make it 2-0.

A chastened Koeman admitted: 'It's cup football and it's not about the level. They showed the best cup experience. It's not the first time and it's not the last time a League One club will beat a Premier League. That's football.'

Clough pointed out afterwards his side were forced to field a right-winger Ryan Flynn at right-back against a team of internationals.

'It is an incredible night for the club,' he said.

'I thought we deserved the victory, we created more chances and the only disappointment was that we should have had another goal.

'Whoever we get in the semi-final will be a special occasion, but nights like tonight stay in the memory for a long time.'

As a player with Nottingham Forest when his dad Brian was the manager, Nigel won the League Cup twice in 1989 and 1990.

With Chelsea still in the competition, it'd be a brave man to predict he'll complete a hat-trick but it won't be for a lack of trying.
