Government safety rules are changing to let airline passengers use most electronic devices from gate-to-gate.

The change will let passengers read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music at any time during flight instead what is often just a brief cruising period between take-off and descent.

The Federal Aviation Administration says airlines can allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs and landings on planes that meet certain criteria for protecting aircraft systems from electronic interference.

It's a miracle! The FAA has finally lifted rules that ban the use of electronic devices during take-off and landing

Rules still apply: There are stipulations, of course, and the roll-out time will vary between airlines, but with only 'very limited exception'

Most new airliners are expected to meet the criteria 'with very limited exception' but changes won't happen immediately.

So why the change of heart? The FAA isn't saying complaints spurred the decision, per se, and instead uses the term 'input.'

Stow this! Passengers will soon be allowed to watch movies, read ebooks, and play games on their gadgets from gat-to-gate. Cell phone and internet use, however, are still banned

As per the FAA's October 31 release: 'The FAA based its decision on input from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry.'

Even fed up U.S. Senators had made their annoyance known.

'There is widespread support among 
the traveling public to be able to read a book, regardless of whether 
it's in a dead tree or digital form, more so than there is for your 
seatmate to talk on their cellphone,' a representative for Missouri
Democrat Claire McCaskill, who's criticized the ban on electronics 
below 10,000 feet, told the Wall Street Journal.

Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com. In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.

FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk. Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.

Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.

However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.

A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology. 'We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,' said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

According
to the release, the new rules will implemented at different times 
depending on the airline.

But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said. Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.

So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate. And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.

Heavier
devices like laptops will have to be stowed. Passengers will be told to
switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.

And don't expect to phone home in-flight: cellphone use will still be prohibited.
