She's eight months pregnant but Kate can still carry off a striking style statement. The Duchess of Cambridge cut a fashion-forward figure as she appeared at Southampton Docks this morning to christen the Royal Princess.

Forgoing maternity clothes yet again, Kate looked chic in a £169 mac from High Street store Hobbs. 

The water-resistant coat was the ideal choice for the blustery conditions at the waterside where Kate listened to a brass band play out before smashing a £1,250 Nebuchadnezzar - a 15 litre bottle of champagne the equivalent of 20 regular 75cl bottles - on the ship's hull.

She paired her coat with a sinemay hat with bow detail from royal favourite milliner Jane Taylor and black court shoes.

As has become her signature maternity style, Kate chose a dress shorter than the styles she wore prior to her pregnancy. While the generously cut coat skimmed her bump, her legs, carefully clad in those nude tights she (or Pippa, or Carole) is never without.

Order Of The Garter on Monday

With almost precisely one month to go 
before her reported due date of 14 July, Kate, still managing to wear 
non-maternity clothes, is an inspiration to women out there who feel 
frustrated by lack of choice in maternity shops.

This was to be the Duchess of Cambridge's last solo engagement before her baby is born.

Kate looked relaxed as she stepped from her chauffeur-driven vehicle to the quayside in Southampton.  

She made the journey from London by helicopter for the naming ceremony of Princess Cruises' 3,600-passenger vessel Royal Princess.

A musical extravaganza was staged ahead of the christening of the new vessel and blue carpet, not the customary red, was laid out for her arrival.

Good show! Kate with the ship's captain, Tom Draper, after cutting the ribbon

Sophisticated: Kate went for a sleek half up, half down hair style that helped keep her locks out of her face on the windy morning

Still working.. But this will be the last solo engagement for Kate before her due date in July

She took her place on a stage in blustery conditions that threatened rain.

Seated opposite in a large grandstand were guests associated with charities that have the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge or Prince Harry as their patrons.

Spectators were from East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Kate's charity, SkillForce which has William as its figurehead, and Harry's organisation WellChild.

Kate is the new liner's godmother, a symbolic position similar to a patron or sponsor that dates back to the mid-19th century when leading women were selected for the honour.

Princess Cruises has a history of illustrious godmothers for past ships including Diana, Princess of Wales, who named the first Princess Royal in 1984, actress Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, and Baroness Thatcher.

The Band of her Majesty's Royal Marines Portsmouth accompanied by the Pipers of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards gave the start of the ceremonies a military flavour.

They lined Kate's route to her seat after playing rousing tunes such as Pomp And Circumstance, sea shanties and a march called HMS Queen Elizabeth.

 

Kate's selling power: The duchess £169 Dalmatian mac was available online at Hobbs in all sizes except 8 and 18 at 11:30am this morning when Kate first appeared in the coat....

Loose fit: The Hobbs coat is not a maternity style but is cut generously to skim Kate's bump
