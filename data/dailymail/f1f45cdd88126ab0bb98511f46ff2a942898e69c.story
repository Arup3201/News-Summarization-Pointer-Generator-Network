Fears are rising for a Washington teen missing since last month after her mother discovered she had written, 'If you're reading this, I'm either missing or dead', in her journal.

Angelic Tracy 'Anji' Dean, 17, of Camas simply left her family home on the evening of June 23 leaving behind her wallet, bank cards and glasses and vanished, prompting a search which is now stretching across to Portland.

Her mother, Lynda Jorgenson believes her daughter may have become the victim of sex trafficking and revealed that the chilling diary entry meant for her or emergency services was not found until after she disappeared - leaving her convinced Anji knew her kidnapper.

Missing: Angelic 'Anji' Dean has been missing since June 23 when she walked out of her house in Washington and left behind a series of chilling journal entries and text messages

Home: Anji Dean was last seen at her home in Camus, Washington at around 10pm on the evening of June 23

Indeed, in the months before Anji vanished she had told her teachers and school councilors that she had gotten into something that she couldn't get out of.

And crucially, on the day she vanished, she texted her boyfriend to tell him that she definitely had become involved in something nefarious and that someone was threatening to kill him and her family.

The last time anyone saw the Washington teen was when she left her large family home at around 9pm, but police are interested in speaking to a man, described as a 25-34-year-old African American with a goatee, who dropped her off at 4.30pm that day.

He was driving a light blue older Volvo and Anji was last seen wearing exercise clothes.

Dean's mother discovered her daughter's journal entries which said that she was worried for her own life

Appeal: Lynda Jorgenson, Anji's mother, said the chilling message wasn't found in Anji's journal until after she disappeared

Now, more than two weeks later, Anji's parents are terrified that she is being pushed into the sex trade after seemingly disappearing without a trace.

'We have no idea where she is or who she’s with,' Lynda Jorgensen said to KGW.com.

'She can’t be doing this on her own, so we’re really, really afraid for her.

'It scares the bejesus out of me because she didn't just run off on her own.'

Chilling: This is the text message that Anji sent to her boyfriend warning him that an attempt may be made on his life

Described as wearing tight fighting exercise clothes before she vanished, Lynda said that police have also discovered a cellphone that she and her Anji's father did not know their daughter had.

'She only took what she was wearing, which was black running tights, a white razor back tank top and white Nike shoes,' said her mom to NBC.

The President of the National Women's Coalition against Violence and Exploitation is now working with the family and detectives on this troubling case.

'I don't believe she left thinking she was running away, I believe after speaking with law enforcement and the detective on the case that we may be dealing with a human trafficking situation here in Clark county,' said NWcave President Michelle Bart.
