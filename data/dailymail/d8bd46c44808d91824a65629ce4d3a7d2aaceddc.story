Militants sewed a bomb into the stomach of a Central Reserve Police Force officer, hoping it would detonate once touched.

In the latest bloody row between Naxalites and police, the improvised explosive device (IED) during an autopsy was discovered by doctors at a government hospital in Ranchi.

Doctors conducting the autopsy of the CRPF officer, who was killed in Jharkhand's Latehar district, found a 1.5 kg unexploded bomb stitched inside the abdomen of Constable Babulal Patel.

Bloody row: The Central Reserve Police Force have been battling with the Naxalites as the militants fight for land

The 29-year-old was among those killed in an ambush with Naxals three days earlier, the Times of India reported.

Doctors became suspicious when they discovered the body, which was killed along with eight other CRPF personnel, one personnel from the state's special anti-Naxal force 'Jharkhand Jaguars' and three civilians in the clash.

Mr Patel's body, which had to be inspected by bomb squad in an open field, contained an IED that exploded on being disturbed.

The latest gruesome act by Naxalites followed a grisly protest in Latehar.

On Monday the militants, who have been clashing with police over land disputes since 1967, draped the body of a critically injured and incapacitated constable over a landmine.

The next day the body was discovered in Karmatiya jungle by innocent villagers who died when they picked the body up and the bomb detonated.

About 600 Maoists are suspected to be hiding in the jungles moving between Bihar and Jharkhand.

The most recent grouping of Naxalites, known formally as the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI-M), was born in 2004 when two left-wing groups merged together.

It is unclear how many fighters, and how organised the groups in different states are. Figures suggest that out of India's 28 states, 16 â€“ mostly in the east and the centre â€“ have some group activity based there.

The bitter row between Naxalites and police stems from conflict over land.

The term Naxalites comes from Naxalbari, a small village in West Bengal.

It was here that a section of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) started a violent uprising in May 1967.

One group wanted to to redistribute land to the landless, using force if necessary. Soon after the declaration,  a sharecropper near Naxalbari village was attacked by a landlord's men over a land dispute. 

On May 24, when a police team arrived to arrest the peasant leaders, it was ambushed by a group of tribals and a police inspector was killed in a hail of arrows.

From here, tribals and peasants supported the movement to start claiming land and start attacking local landlords.

This conflict spiralled when terms set out in the India's Constitution's Schedules, which tried to limit what landlords could own, were not honoured.

Zedong supported the movement, believing that Indian peasants and lower class tribals overthrow the government and upper classes by force.
