Russian President Vladimir Putin was left red faced today when he lit the Olympic flame in Red Square only it went out forcing a security guard to fire it up again using a cigarette lighter.

The flame was lit a week ago in Greece and flown to Moscow for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

However, the glitch occurred when a torchbearer ran through a long passageway leading into the Kremlin which apparently created a wind tunnel, extinguishing the flame.

A man standing along the route, most likely part of the presidential security service, pulled out a lighter and re-lit the flame.

Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully.

The torchbearer, Shavarsh Karapetyan, 60, was a champion swimmer for the Soviet Union who once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir.

He used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 meters (30 feet) of water, and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers

The relay will stay in Moscow for the next three days and hundreds of athletes and public figures including Prince Albert II of Monaco are to take part.

The flame will then begin its journey across Russia, traveling from Kaliningrad to the easternmost point just across the Bering Strait from Alaska, before swinging back through the vast country to Sochi in time for the opening ceremony on February 7.

For most of the 65,000 kilometer (39,000-mile) trip, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, safely encased inside a lantern.

But 14,000 torch bearers also will take place in the relay at the more than 130 stops along the way.

One of the silver and red torches, unlit, will be carried into space in November for a brief visit to the International Space Station, and this same torch will be used to light the Olympic flame in Sochi. 

Putin, for whom the Olympic Games are a source of personal pride, said the relay will 'show the world Russia as she is and as we love her.'

The torch relay will pass through many cities that showcase the historical, cultural and ethnic richness of Russia, while other cities on the route are more closely associated with the evils of

Stalinism, the harsh treatment of dissent under Putin or the Islamic insurgency simmering in the Caucasus Mountains not far from Sochi's ski slopes. 

As the relay crosses the expanses of Siberia, it will put the spotlight on Russia's immense wealth of natural resources and the rusting of its industrial towns.
