You can't say Phuc Kieu doesn't live up to his name.

The Florida man with the unfortunate moniker has been charged with sexual assault, kidnapping, and robbery without a weapon after allegedly assaulting a man Sunday.

Kieu was reportedly sitting in his car in Orlando watching gay porn on a portable DVD player when he spotted his victim.

The New York Post reports an unnamed man had just withdrawn $220 from an ATM when the 58-year-old Kieu pulled him into his Honda Civic.

Kieu reportedly got on top of the man and tried to strip his clothing.

The victim was able to escape, then ran to a shopping center.

As he ran he screamed out:'Rapist!'

Keiu managed to tear away the man's backpack containing his cash before he made his escape.

He is being held on $150,000 bail.
