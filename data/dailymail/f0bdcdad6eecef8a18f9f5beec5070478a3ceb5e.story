The ownership circus at Leeds United took an extraordinary twist on Wednesday when it was revealed that the club’s former managing director David Haigh has been arrested in Dubai on suspicion of embezzlement, fraud and money-laundering.

Haigh was the frontman and deputy CEO of Dubai-based bankers GFH Capital when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012.

He became managing director and introduced controversial Italian Massimo Cellino to GFHC. Cellino subsequently bought 75 per cent of Leeds from GFHC and dispensed with Haigh, who had resigned from GFHC.

The Dubai bankers, with a Bahrain head office, retain 25 per cent of the club and it is they who called in the police.

GFHC
 released a statement on Wednesday confirming that a former employee has 
been arrested ‘on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering 
while he was employed at the bank.’

Haigh,
 36, has told friends that he is ‘shocked and horrified’ at his arrest, 
which happened on Sunday. By Wednesday he had been in custody for three 
nights.

A source close to Haigh said: ‘He is confident he has done 
nothing wrong or illegal... and that the Dubai authorities will see 
through what he insists are baseless allegations.’

Police
 in Leeds spoke to Haigh last month over allegations that funds had been
 inappropriately spent on installing spy cameras in the board room and 
toilets at Elland Road. Haigh admitted installing the cameras but said 
he had legitimately acquired the equipment after reports of drug-taking 
on the premises. Police continue to investigate.

The backdrop to the latest arrest is a bitter ongoing wrangle between Cellino and GFHC.

Sources
 have told Sportsmail that Cellino was surprised at the extent of the 
club’s debts and ongoing losses when he finally took over.
