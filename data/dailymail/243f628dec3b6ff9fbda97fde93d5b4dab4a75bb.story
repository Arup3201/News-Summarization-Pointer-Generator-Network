Only one in five Australian men would say they are at the happiest and healthiest point in their lives, according to new research.

The study done by the Movember Foundation also found men were at their mental best between the ages of 30 and 34, and their worst between the ages of 45 and 49.

The release of this new research coincides with Mental Health Week, which started on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

Two-time world surfing champion Tom Carroll suffered from low-level depression

Movember Foundation Asia Pacific director Jeremy Macvean said the results indicated more needed to be done to change the attitudes of men towards mental health.

The study surveyed more than 1,500 Australian men from the age of 18 and up. 

A person who has experienced the struggles of admitting that he suffered depression is two-time world surfing champion Tom Carroll who denied he had the mental illness for a number of years before he sought help.

The Australian - who won the World Championship Tour in 1983 and 1984 - said his 'low level' depression was only realised after he became addicted to amphetamines.

'Drugs lifted me up. It really helped me get up and engage with the world and that's what I treated myself with for many years until it stopped working,' Carroll told Daily Mail Australia.

'I only truly recognised it [my depression] probably around the age of 45 years old.'

Carroll urged men to talk about their mental health concerns.

He said they usually found it hard to talk about mental issues because talking about feelings went against the tradtional male stereotype

'I think men have get this strong message when they're young that they have to be in control and be fearless,' he said.

'How we talk is quite foreign – the idea of talking about how we're feeling, it doesn't make quite much sense to us yet.'

Carroll encouraged those who were feeling 'disconnected' from the world to talk about it and address mental health issues sooner rather than later.

'Those things you don't want to talk about, it will grow, that's what my experience has taught me,' he said.

'They don't go away, they just fester and grow and when you bring the light onto it, it starts to diminish. 

'It might be slow or it might quick, but it will diminish [if you talk about it].'

Most importantly, Carroll said the best way to recover from mental illness was not to go through it alone.

The release of the research coincides with Mental Health Week and comes before the launch of Movember on November 1

'Depression can trap us within ourselves and disconnect us from outside world and separates us completely...in some cases, it can be very hard to dig out of,' he said.

'Start dialogue with someone you feel comfortable with, the people you often care about are the ones to start that off with. 

'It's important to talk about how you are going with someone and work through it. Sometimes it is a slow process but depression can really change your body chemistry.'

Despite men's mental health becoming a more talked about issue, Movember Foundation Asia Pacific director Jeremy Macvean said the results of the study highlighted there was still a long way to go.

Men were more likely to turn to Google than talk to their peers to find out more about mental health issues, and would rather talk to their doctors over their partners to about their problems.

Meanwhile, 56 per cent of men surveyed said they would prefer to talk politics with their friends compared to the 28 per cent who would talk about their mental health concerns.

'Five times as many guys do nothing at all about a mental health concern versus a physical one,' Mr Mcvean said.

'We want every man across the country to take their health more seriously - mental as well as physical.'

The research found one in four men would wait several months before to seek advice when it came to mental health, whereas 86 per cent who would take steps to put right a physical issue in just a matter of weeks. 

Mr Mcvean also urged the public to take part in Movember to help raise awareness and funds for prostate and testicular cancers, and mental health problems as 75 per cent of men did not know the symptoms of the cancers and 50 per cent were not familiar with the signs of depression.
