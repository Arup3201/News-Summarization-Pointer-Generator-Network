A mother who lost twice the amount of blood in her body giving birth to her first child says she is terrified at the thought of going through labour again.

Samantha Slater, 29, says she has been left with a phobia of childbirth after haemorrhaging during the delivery of her son.

She lost 17 pints of blood during the horrific ordeal - double the amount of blood usually in the body.

Samantha Slater lost twice the amount of blood in her body after baby Jaeden's birth and says she is still traumatised at the thought of childbirth

She feared she would die before she had the opportunity to hold her son, Jaeden, but doctors were able to save her life using expanding glue.

Mrs Slater, from Accrington, Lancashire, went into labour in November last year and was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester.

But after four days of labour she was still only 7cm dilated and was given an emergency C-section under general anaesthetic because the birth was taking too long.

Just minutes after coming around she started haemorrhaging and was whisked straight back into theatre.

She said: ‘I still get flash backs from the event. It was horrific, I had no idea what was happening I just felt warmth between my legs and then I was rushed straight to theatre.

‘All I wanted to do was hold my little boy - I didn’t even know if he was okay.

Jaeden was delivered by C-section and after the operation Mrs Slater started to haemorrhage. She lost 17 pints of blood and had to be given multiple blood transfusions

At one point, Mrs Slater's husband, Jerome, was warned that she might not pull through

‘I felt as though I was dying. I remember just praying that I would survive so that I could see my son.

‘I don’t remember a thing but apparently I kept asking if I was dying. At first I thought I was weeing, I never imagined I was haemorrhaging.

‘I had only just woken up from the operation so I hadn’t even held Jaeden yet when I was whisked away to the emergency room.

‘I barely remember what happened because I was in such a state of shock. One minute I had just given birth and the next doctors were rushing around me.

‘My husband was looking down and told me there was blood everywhere. After that I blacked out, but he has told me I kept waking up and saying “don’t let me die”.’

Mrs Slater remained in the emergency room for five hours and underwent several blood transfusions while doctors tried to stop the bleeding.

Mrs Slater says she now has a phobia of childbirth and is terrified of every having another baby

Mrs Slater (pictured with her husband, Jerome) had to spend time in intensive care after the birth and it was six days before she could hold Jaeden for the first time

In all, the blood from 17 different donors, were given to her.

At one point doctors told her husband, Jerome, 27, a business account manager, that it was touch and go whether she would make it.

Thankfully, doctors found the tear in her uterus just in time and managed to stop the bleeding using special expanding glue.

After the operation, Mrs Slater was taken to intensive care before being transferred to a high dependency unit for four days.

It wasn’t until six days after the birth that she was able to hold baby Jaeden, now five months, for the first time.

She added: ‘I was taken to the baby unit in a wheelchair because my legs were swollen from the blood transfusions so I couldn’t walk.

Mrs Slater (pictured with Jaeden and her husband, Jerome) said: 'I'm so glad I pulled through, and having little Jaeden was worth it - but I'm never having any more children. I still wake up with nightmares and I'm terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens'

‘Holding him after everything was amazing. He was two days old and I couldn’t believe how tiny he was.

‘Looking at him for the first time made me forget the hell I had just been through.’

After the terrifying event, Mrs Slater stayed in hospital for two weeks so that she could be monitored before being sent home.

The lifesaving treatment left her body swollen for weeks, though she has since made a full recovery.

Mrs Slater added that she was so traumatised by the event she is unlikely to ever have children again.

She said: ‘I’m so glad I pulled through, and having little Jaeden was worth it - but I’m never having any more children.

‘I still wake up with nightmares and I’m terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens.

Mrs Slater (pictured with her sister, Kelly, when she was seven months pregnant) says that if it weren't for all of the blood donors who saved her life, Jaeden would now be without a mother

‘Jaeden is a perfectly healthy little boy now, and I am a healthy woman. We have a great little family unit.

‘I had no idea that it was possible to be given that much blood. I have 17 people who have saved my life.

‘If they hadn’t donated their blood when they did, there might not have been enough available and my child would be without a mother.’

Dr Alexander Heazell, Consultant Obstetrician at St. Mary’s Hospital, said: ‘Seventeen pints is a significant amount of blood to lose during or after giving birth, and is thankfully a highly unusual occurrence.

‘In Samantha’s case, we used a special glue-like substance that temporarily blocked the blood supply to the uterus to stop the bleeding.

‘I am really pleased that Samantha has recovered well.’
