The moment of truth: Ryan Swinburn could not collect his GCSE results until he paid his lunch bill

A teenager who almost died during a GCSE exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding £5.60 lunch bill.

Teachers told schoolboy Ryan Swinburn he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier.

The 16-year-old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure, having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome.

He was discharged from hospital in time to sit his GCSEs but almost died in May when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam. But he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt.

Ryan, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said: 'It was all a bit ludicrous really.

'I’ve had a tough time and because I wasn’t at school I wasn’t able to pay the bill.

'One of my teachers slyly told me I had got a C when I got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether I had done the same in any other subjects.

'But when my head of year told me I couldn’t have them until I had settled a mere £5.60 - I was shocked.

'I hadn’t taken any money with me because I hadn’t really been thinking about the outstanding bill for a pizza, baguette and a drink - I was more concerned about my health.

'I suffer from high blood pressure and I don’t think that did me any good.

'I had to come away from the school not knowing if I had got into college or not, it was devastating and I was really angry.'

Ryan was in his final year at Ashlawn 
School in Rugby, when he was struck down with cardiolipin syndrome, 
lupus disease and kidney failure.

He was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition.

Incredibly, the dedicated teenager battled to become well enough to sit his GCSEs in May but was rushed back to hospital after collapsing just minutes after starting the first exam.

The school agreed to award Ryan, who wants to study psychology and sociology at A-Level, his GCSEs based on his mock exam results and predicted grades.

But when he went to school on August 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill.

He walked home and returned with his fuming mother Deborah Harris, 44, who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation.

She said: 'Settling a £5 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital.

'He struggled to get to the school on that day but he was determined to collect his results with his friends.

'But he was humiliated in front of all his mates and this is the last thing he needed.

'I was also worried about his blood pressure because that can be high because of his illness.

'I thought they should at least show the lad a bit of compassion after what he has been through.

'I think it is disgusting how they treated him - it wasn’t even some random receptionist - it was his head of year who knew fully well what he had been through.

'I was told it was school policy.

'I explained how ill Ryan had been and felt she showed no compassion for my child.

'The whole situation was ludicrous - it was totally ridiculous.

'He really wants to go to college now, he really is a determined little thing and he’s had a rough ride.'

A teacher finally handed over the results after Deborah agreed she would settle the canteen bill.

Ryan achieved five Grade C GCSEs in Key Skills, English, Drama and Music, is now planning to study psychology and sociology at college.

The school was unavailable for comment today but a spokeswoman for Warwickshire County Council said it was a 'common policy' for schools to withhold exam results from pupils with outstanding bills or fines.
