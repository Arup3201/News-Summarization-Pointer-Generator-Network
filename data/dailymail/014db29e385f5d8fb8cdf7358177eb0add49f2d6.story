The number of calories in McDonald's burgers and fries will soon be listed on menus across the country, whether customers want to see them or not. 

The world's biggest hamburger chain is announcing today that it will post calorie information on restaurant and drive-thru menus nationwide starting on Monday. The move comes ahead of a regulation that will require major chains to post the information as early as next year.

'We want to voluntarily do this,' said Jan Fields, president of McDonald's USA. 'We believe it will help educate customers.'

In cities such as New York and Philadelphia where posting calorie information is already required, however, Fields notes that the information has not changed what customers choose to order.

Calorie average for McDonald's 20 listed burgers: 501

Sodium average for McDonald's 20 listed burgers: 44% of daily value*

*Per cent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

'When it's all said and done, the menu mix doesn't change,' she said. 'But I do think people feel better knowing this information.'

According to the numbers already published on their website, their 20 listed sandwiches, excluding their Snack Wraps, average out to 501 calories each.

The highest sandwich for calorie content is their Angus Bacon & Cheese clocking in 790 calories and 2,070mg of sodium - or 86% of one’s daily value, DV, based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

The second runner up is their Angus 
Mushroom & Swiss, at 770 calories and 1,170mg (49% DV) of sodium, 
and third, their Angus Delux at 750 calories and 1,700 (71% DV) of 
sodium.

All 20 sandwiches listed average out to 44 per cent of one’s suggested daily value.

The Oak Brook, Ill,-based company is also testing healthier options for next year, such as an Egg McMuffin made with egg whites and a whole grain muffin.

The sandwich has Canadian bacon and white cheddar cheese 
and clocks in at 260 calories. It will be called the Egg White Delight.

The chain is also testing versions of 
the McWrap, which is a bigger version of its Snack Wrap that is already 
sold in Europe. The wraps have sliced cucumbers and are less than 350 
calories.

The posting of
 calorie information isn't a magic bullet in fighting obesity but could 
have a big effect over time, says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition at
 the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates on 
nutrition and food safety issues.

'Obesity
 isn't the kind of thing where one day you wake up and you're fat. We 
gradually and slowly gain weight over time,' she said.

So even if only some people are swayed
 to make slightly better choices, Wootan thinks there's a big benefit to
 providing calorie information.

Another
 upside is that companies tend to work harder to provide healthier 
options when they're forced to display calorie information.

'It can be embarrassing, or shocking, so they end up changing the way the product is made,' Wootan said.

The moves also reflect the pressures 
McDonald's and other fast-food chains are facing amid growing concerns 
about obesity. McDonald's is also facing competition from chains such as
 Subway, which positions itself as a healthy alternative to traditional 
hamburger chains.

McDonald's
 notes that it has already made strides in improving the nutrition of 
its food, such as the automatic inclusion of apple slices in its Happy 
Meals.

And this summer, McDonald's rolled out
 a 'Favorites Under 400' campaign that highlighted the menu items that 
had fewer than 400 calories. The company noted that about 80 percent of 
its menu items fit the bill.

Of
 course, not everyone orders just one item. And the chain has been 
blamed by critics for fueling obesity rates with its big soft drinks and
 other items.

A meal 
consisting of a Big Mac and medium fries, for example, has 930 calories.
 Add a 16-ounce Coca-Cola, and the count rises to 1,080 calories.

The
 decision to post calorie information follows the Supreme Court's 
decision this summer to uphold President Barack Obama's health care 
overhaul, which requires restaurant chains with more than 20 locations 
to post calorie information. The timing of carrying out that requirement
 has yet to be worked out.

McDonald's, which has 14,000 locations in the U.S., doesn't plan to advertise the posting of the calorie information. Fields said it's something the chain is doing as a 'customer convenience.'
