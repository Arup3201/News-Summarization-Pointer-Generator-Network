The haunting never-seen-before images of bullet holes and a broken toilet lid in the bathroom of the home previously owned by Oscar Pistorius are a chilling reminder of where the Paralympian shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp 18 months ago.

The interior shots show the eerily empty rooms in the upmarket house in Pretoria that has laid vacant since that fatal night in the upstairs bathroom during the early hours of Valentine’s Day last year when the Paralympian shot at Miss Steenkamp through a locked toilet door saying he believed she was an intruder.

A broken window and an abandoned murky green swimming pool also vividly illustrates the desolate but once luxurious property that Pistorius and Steenkamp used to call home in the Silver Woods Estate.

The athlete has never returned to the house and has lived with his uncle ever since while he awaits for his fate to be handed down on his murder trial next month.

The Daily Mail reported just four weeks ago that the villa in a gated community finally sold for 4.5million South African rand at the beginning of this month after being on the market since March – about the equivalent of $170,000 less than the asking price.

It was confirmed that the 27-year-old, who is still on trial for murder, needed to sell the property to raise money for his legal bills, a total of at least $8,000 per day.

The buyer Louwtjie Louwrens, plans to retire to the property with his family.

'It is in a safe area and everyone I dealt with was very professional, ' he told the Times Live in South Africa.

'It stood empty for more than a year and there is some water damage, so we would first have to repair it.'

It is thought that the house remained sealed since it was handed back by police over a year ago.

Estate agent Ansie Louw, who was handling the sale said selling the property was an unusual process due to the situation.

'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos,’ she said.

'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't bother them.'

Ms Louw also explained that there has been a lot of interest in the home since it went up for sale in March.

The home inally sold for 4.5million South African rand at the beginning of this month after being on the market since March

Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year.

At the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in Cape Town.

All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court.

Since the shooting he has lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him about $510,000 a year.

The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to a statement released by his lawyers earlier this year.

The costs are said to include at least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company.

Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

He says he shot Miss Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his bathroom because he thought she was an intruder.
