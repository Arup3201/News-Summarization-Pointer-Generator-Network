Her boyfriend was later charging around on Centre Court.

But at home it was Novak Djokovic’s pregnant girlfriend who was scampering about – after their dog.

Jelena Ristic, 28, had to rush out of the house the couple share during Wimbledon after the pet, believed to be a labradoodle named Tesla, escaped as her boyfriend left to play.

Out! The dog, believed to be a labradoodle named Telsa, escaped the house Jelena Ristic shares with boyfriend Novak Djokovic while the Serbian tennis star plays at Wimbledon

In! Jelena, who has been with Djokovic for around eight years, took the dog back inside - just before her boyfriend defeated Grigor Dimitrov to reach the Wimbledon final

His girlfriend managed to capture the dog and take it back inside in time to see Djokovic defeat Grigor Dimitrov.

Her boyfriend beat the boyfriend of tennis star Maria Sharapova in four sets, winning 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6.

He will now face seven-time Wimbledon 
champion Roger Federer in Sunday's centre court men's final - the 13th 
Grand Slam final of Djokovic's career.

If he wins, the player - who has lost his last three finals - would once again be the number one tennis player in the world.

Miss Ristic is often see cheering her boyfriend at major tournaments around the world

The dog rescue took place as Djokovic won his semi-final clash to reach his 13th Grand Slam final, where he will compete for the Wimbledon title against Roger Federer

Djokovic has been dating Miss Ristic for
 around eight years, and she is often seen in the crowd cheering him on 
at major tournaments across the world.

The pair were allegedly going to tie the knot in June but it was reported that Djokovic changed his mind at the last minute.

It is now believed the pair will tie the knot after the Wimbledon tournament.

Speaking this week, Djokovic said of pregnant Miss Ristic: 'The date is coming closer, the stomach is growing.

The pair will reportedly get married once the Wimbledon tennis tournament has finished

'For us, it's a new chapter of our lives. We're full of joy.'

And while they might remain tight-lipped about their tennis secrets, Djokovic asked Federer for some parental advice a few weeks ago, according to Federer.

He said: 'He just asked me how life was on the road, how it is to be a dad.

'You want to get some information, something you can wrap your mind around. I think he's super excited. He's very happy. I'm very happy for them.'

Miss Ristic previously told the Daily Mail: ‘We are emotional partners. The emotional support we give to each other is very important.

‘It's the same for me as well. He is very supportive and encouraging of the work that I do.’
