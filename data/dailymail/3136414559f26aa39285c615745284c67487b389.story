Pope Francis has met British victims of clerical sex abuse to beg forgiveness for the ‘sacrilegious’ crimes committed by the ‘sons and daughters of the church, who betrayed their mission.’

The Pope told six victims of paedophile priests, including two Britons, that the church would ‘weep’ for its ‘grave sin’ and must make amends through reparations.

The meetings follows two damning UN reports on the Vatican this year which said the church had 'systematically' adopted policies that allowed priests to rape and molest tens of thousands of children over decades.

Despite his energetic and wide-ranging reforms, Francis has been accused of lacking in answers when it comes to tackling the child abuse scandal.

This was the first time he has met with abuse victims since becoming pope last year.

The three women and three men each had private half-hour meetings. As well as two Britons, there were two Irish victims and two Germans.

But in his strongest words on the subject so far, Francis promised that bishops who fail to report or cover up abuse will be held accountable.

At a mass for the victims at the Vatican, Francis denounced the abuse of minors as ‘worse than despicable.'

He said: 'It is like a sacrilegious cult, because these boys and girls had been entrusted to the priestly charism in order to be brought to God.'

He lamented that child sex abuse leaves 'life-long scars' and acknowledged that victims have been driven to addiction and even suicide by their experiences.

Francis listened to the stories of the three men and three women, two each from Ireland, the UK and Germany.

The 'intense' meetings lasted more than three hours - an 'exceptional' and ‘extraordinary’ length of time, Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said.

After the individual meetings the victims, who asked not to be identified, were visibly moved, he said.

‘They described their feelings as serene, touched, happy and grateful. It was a very profound spiritual encounter. The Holy Father listened and tried to understand their suffering in a deep sense.

‘They said they felt that they were listened to, which would helped them continue on their path.' 

Previously Francis has condemned abuse of children as like 'celebrating a Satanic mass'.
