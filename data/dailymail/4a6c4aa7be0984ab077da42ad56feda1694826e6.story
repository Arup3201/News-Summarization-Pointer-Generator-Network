An employee at a local TV station is suing amid claims that drug taking, sexual encounters and 'rampant' drinking were rife at the company.

Kevin Flanigan, a sales worker at 19 Action News, wants $35,000 in damages from 19 Action News in Cleveland, Ohio.

Station executives allegedly bought cocaine at work and had sex with clients in what has been described as a ‘Gomorrah-like’ office environment, according to Mr Flanigan's lawsuit filed last week.

Advertising staff at the station are said to have done whatever it took to ‘foster new business relationships’ - including giving clients oral sex.

 included a bikini cruise.

One sales manager is even said to have bragged of sleeping with her ‘designated d***’ in front of a horrified client who cancelled his account.

Flanigan is suing for sexual harassment and retaliation and wants $35,000 in damages. The lawsuit has sparked a scandal in Cleveland with Clevescene.com describing WOIO, a broadcaster which won plaudits for its coverage of the Ariel Castro case, as ‘Gomorrah-like work environments’.

The legal documents state that Mr Flanigan was hired by WOIO in 2010 and that executive Debra Pando preferred the company of women so began to discriminate against him.

He says there was pressure to ‘engage in inappropriate sexual practices including sexual contact with other employees and clients and rampant use of illegal drugs at corporate events, many times involving clients’.

Miss Pando and other employees ‘provided sexual favors’ to get new business or cement already existing relationships, Mr Flanigan claims.

The lawsuit alleges that in one instance at a party ‘after smoking marijuana with a client, Miss Pando performed oral sex on a client in order to convince the client to remain the sponsor of the event’.

Staff parties included an event on a boat owned by a major client in which female staff were ‘cavorting’ in bathing suits.

Miss Pando is said to have passed out drunk on a sofa in front of one client and his 20-year-old son, and became so inebriated at another event that she took off her top and flashed passers-by, Mr Flanigan alleges in his lawsuit.

The sales employee claims that his boss lost $300,000 worth of business due to her ‘unprofessional’ conduct.

On one occasion she turned up to meet a client wearing a red miniskirt and heavy makeup and bragged about having had sex with her ‘designated d***’, as alleged in Mr. Flanagan’s complaint. The client cancelled his account.

The lawsuit states that everything that went on was ‘widely known and condoned by management’ and that it amounted a ‘hostile environment’ in which Mr Flanigan feared he would be fired if he complained.

When he finally snapped and raised his concerns with Miss Pando last December she did indeed sack him, although this decision was reversed.

Since then Mr Flanigan has allegedly been ‘ostracized’ at work and lost advertising commissions.

William Applegate, vice president and general manager at WOIO, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the lawsuit was inaccurate.

He said that the ‘numerous offensive and erroneous allegations contained in this suit compels us to strongly deny them on behalf of the station and particularly our employees, viewers and clients’.

He said: ‘We certainly do intend to defend ourselves vigorously’.

Flanigan’s lawyer Andrew Kabat declined to comment.
