A daughter of alleged Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina today broke her silence, claiming that if her mother were running a high-profile prostitution ring, she would be aware of it.

Suzanna Pak claimed in an Anderson Cooper interview airing tomorrow that her mother was not the mastermind of a call girl service, but was in the business of providing 'discretion' for lonely - and wealthy - men.

In a preview released by the Cooper's daytime chat show on Wednesday, Ms Pak, Gristina's 24-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, says she cannot believe the allegations brought against her mother.

Ms Pak told Cooper: 'Obviously, these men were looking for discretion, and that’s why they paid so much money to find somebody to talk to, to take out to dinner. To make sure… whatever the case may be.'

She told the TV host that she doesn’t necessarily approve of Gristina's 'dating service,' but does not believe with what cops are accusing her of.

'I am 24 years old. I think if she had anything to hide, she would have said something to me by now. She shared with me her dating sites - her legitimate dating sites -here and there.'

Last week, Gristina's husband Kelvin Gorr launched a website to 
help pay off his wife's staggering $2million dollar bail, saying the family cannot afford it on their own.

New York: 304 East 78th Street, the alleged Upper East Side brothel where accused Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina reportedly ran a high-class escort service

Appearance: The mother-of-four attempted
to hide from cameras when she appeared in State Supreme Court on March 6
charged with promoting prostitution

The family created HelpAnna.org with the goal
of raising enough cash to bring Gristina home by Mother's Day.

The 44-year-old Gristina, who is accused of running the upscale brothel on Manhattan's Upper East Side, was arrested in February.

She is said to have raked in more than 
$10million in the last 15 years.

The website links to a PayPal account, where visitors can donate funds directly to Gristina's family.

Her loved ones emphasize that although the crimes against her may be dubious, she hasn't been found guilty of anything but inspiring memorable headlines.

Accused: Jaynie Mae Baker, Anna Gristina's alleged partner, had been on the run from police but turned herself in to face prostitution charges

'While she waits for her case to be heard, she should be home with us. It’s not fair that she doesn’t get to be with her family during this time - she hasn’t been convicted of anything,' the site reads.

The family goes on to describe 
Gristina's charity work, citing the fact that her family saved three 
rescue dogs and that Gristina co-owns a pot-belly pig animal rescue 
program called the Pig Placement Network.

The Pig Placement Network rescues pigs that are homeless or about to be slaughtered, the site says.

But
beyond the injustice of the high bail, the family argues that 
Gristina's treatment at Rikers Island is an 'insult to the American way
of life.'

'We need our Mom here. Without her, part of our family’s life is missing,' the family begs.

Gristina, a Scottish-born ex-real estate broker 
and mother of four, and co-defendant Jaynie Baker - Gristina's alleged 'fixer' - have pleaded not 
guilty to a single charge of promoting prostitution.
