A sorority at the beleaguered University of Oklahoma has come under fire over its involvement in the racist chant by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity over the weekend.

The Delta Delta Deltas have been identified as the sorority members on a chartered bus when frat brothers started singing 'there will never be a n**** in SAE.'

At least one female student can be seen in the video. She appears to raise her cell phone to record the incident. Her date, however, can be seen clapping to the song.

It is also believed that female voices can be heard cheering on the racist fraternity brothers.

On Monday the national Tri Delta organization issued a statement saying it was cooperating with the Oklahoma investigation.

However, the local Tri Delta chapter has denied reports its members are under investigation for involvement in the horrifying incident. 

'The women of the Theta Gamma chapter of Delta Delta Delta fully support the actions taken by the administration of the University of Oklahoma in response to the incident involving Sigma Alpha Epsilon.... However, the Theta Gamma chapter is not under investigation by the university, nor have any chapter members been identified within the videos released,' according to a statement given to the Oklahoma Daily student newspaper. 

University President David Boren said Monday he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning about the video Sunday afternoon. 

The Tri Delta national organization said in a statement: 'We are deeply disappointed by the conduct of the students involved in the incident at The University of Oklahoma.

'Tri Delta expects its members to uphold the highest responsibilities of college women.

'The behavior documented in the video is deplorable and is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and core values.' 

The Oklahoma football team decided to protest rather than practice Monday. At the team's indoor practice facility, coach Bob Stoops led the way as players, joined by athletic director Joe Castiglione, walked arm-in-arm, wearing black.

Meanwhile, a top high school recruit de-committed from the university after seeing the video.

President Boren attended a pre-dawn rally organized by students and lambasted those fraternity members as ‘disgraceful’ and called their behaviour ’reprehensible.’

He said the university was looking into a range of punishment, including expulsion.

‘This is not who we are,’ Boren said at a midday news conference. ‘I'd be glad if they left. I might even pay the bus fare for them.’

National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said late Sunday that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter. The national group said it was ‘embarrassed’ by the ‘unacceptable and racist’ behavior.

Boren said members have until midnight Tuesday to remove their belongings from the fraternity house. He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming,’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions.

He said the university's legal staff was exploring whether the students who initiated and encouraged the chant may have violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.

‘We are also going to look at any individual perpetrators, particularly those that we think took a lead in this kind of activity,’ Boren said.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the efforts by the university and the national fraternity to repudiate the racist comments were ‘an appropriate step.’

It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with what was being said about African-Americans.

OU Unheard, a black student group on campus, posted a link to the video after someone anonymously called it to the group's attention Sunday afternoon, communications director Alexis Hall said Monday.

‘We immediately needed to share that with the OU student body,’ said Hall, a junior. ‘For students to say they're going to lynch an entire group of people. ... It's disgusting.’

The video appears to have been taken on a charter bus, with at least one of the chanting young men wearing a tuxedo.

North Mesquite High School football star Jean Delance, a top offensive lineman prospect, told KTVT television and KRLD-AM in Dallas-Fort Worth that he would not attend Oklahoma. He said he spoke Sunday night with coach Bob Stoops, but wasn't told about the incident.

‘I'm very disappointed in the coaches not letting me know. “Hey jean, this is going on. Be aware. I don't want you to be shocked tomorrow when you wake up,"’ Delance told KRLD. ‘But that was just heart-breaking right there.’

A university police cruiser was parked Monday outside the fraternity house, a sprawling two-story, sand-colored brick building on a street lined with Greek houses just west of the center of campus. The Greek letters were removed from the side of the house Monday afternoon.

Boren said fraternity members had ‘violated all that we stand for.’

‘Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE chapter are hereby severed,’ he said in a statement.
