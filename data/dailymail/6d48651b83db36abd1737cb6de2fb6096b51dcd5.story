The wives of glam rock legend Alvin Stardust were joined in Swansea by hundreds of mourners, including a host of music legends, today to bid farewell to the star.

Julie Paton and his first wife, Iris Fenton, along with some 350 people - including his former bandmates and his ex-manager Lord Levy - turned out at the singer's honorary Welsh home for the service at St Thomas church, the same church where he married Julie.

After an emotional service, the singer's flower-laden coffin was showered with Champagne as his son thanked his rock star father for a 'lifetime' of 'Champagne moments'.

In stirring scenes, 50 members of the Harley Davidson Owners' Club also escorted the singer's coffin from the funeral to Swansea Crematorium.

The service was held at St Thomas church in his honorary Welsh home of Swansea - the same church where he married his beloved wife Julie Paton

His 44-year-old wife said it was her husband's dying wish that his funeral should be held at the church where they were married 

Some 350 mourners turned out to pay their respects, while many lined the streets to watch the cortege makes its way to the church

The riders, who grew up listening to his music, came from as far afield as Bristol and Pembrokeshire at the request of his daughter Sophie.

Stardust's bandmates also poured themselves a glass of whiskey around his coffin to toast the star, before a Champagne cork was popped to mark his habit of having a glass of bubbly at the end of a show. 

Stardust,  who grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, died of prostate cancer last month, aged 72. 

The singer's coffin was carried into St Thomas' Church to one of Stardust's favourite songs When You Wish Upon A Star from the Disney film Pinocchio.  

Male voice choir the Gwalia Singers - who sang at the christening of the couple's daughter Millie, whose godfather is Sir Cliff Richard - also performed his favourite hymn Calon Lân.

Lord Levy - who founded Magnet Records, which gave Stardust his stage name - then read a eulogy to the star, telling the congregation: 'I stand here as the creator of the persona of Alvin Stardust.

'But Alvin, you made yourself into such a great artist around the world.'

The performer's eldest son Shaun Fenton also paid tribute to his father who he said 'created champagne moments and lifetime memories again and again'.  

The singer - real name Bernard Jewry - started out in the music business in the 1960s but became a huge star on the back of the 1970s glam rock craze, scoring hits with tracks including My Coo Ca Choo and Jealous Mind. 

Stardust's career lasted five decades and he was still touring until shortly before his death.

His retro rock 'n' roll sound, distinctive quiff, sideburns and eccentric outfits - often complete with a pair of black leather gloves - made him one of the most distinctive acts to grace the charts in the '70s. 

Stardust met his wife in the 1990s, when the singer was starring in the musical Godspell. Speaking before his funeral, Julie, 44, said: 'Alvin and I were married at St Thomas Church. 

'It was Alvin's last wish that he be returned to the place where he felt his heart belonged, he considered himself an honorary Welshman and will wait there for his beloved wife to join him.'

The couple bought a home in St Thomas soon after their wedding and stayed there to be with Julie's family when they were not touring. 

Born in London, Stardust grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and started playing guitar as a schoolboy. He met one of his biggest influences, Buddy Holly, at a gig in Doncaster and played backstage with the singer and his band the Crickets. 

The star married Port Talbot-born Julie Paton at St Thomas Church in October 1992 and requested his funeral be at the same church

He signed his first record deal in 1961 as the frontman of Shane Fenton And The Fentones but the band struggled to get in the charts despite regular touring in Europe and the UK.

In 1973, he signed up with Magnet Records and took on the name that would make him famous - scoring hit after hit as Alvin Stardust.

His success continued into the 1980s, with Pretend, I Feel Like Buddy Holly and I Won't Run Away all making the top 10.

At the height of his fame in the mid-1970s, he appeared on TV as part of the Green Cross Code road safety campaign.

Turning to acting, he appeared in a string of musicals including playing the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the London Palladium.

He presented his own children's show, It's Stardust, on ITV and appeared in dramas including Hollyoaks and Doctors. 

After his death, several musicians and DJs came forward to pay their respects.  

Among those paying tribute was Radio 5 Live DJ presenter Nicky Campbell, who said: 'Pointing at the camera with his single leather glove. 'Lay down and groove on the mat'. He did the attitude consummately. Alvin Stardust RIP'.

And Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn said: 'So sorry to hear about Alvin Stardust. He was a lovely man and gave us some great songs. RIP.' 

Lord Levy had said the death of the star was 'a sad day'.

He said: 'He was one of the most professional artists that I had the privilege of working with.

'He was a real gentleman. Whenever he did TV or a radio appearance he would always thank the staff or the producer. He knew the score and knew what he was doing, he knew he had been given an opportunity and was prepared to graft to make the most of it.

'Whenever he did any promotional work anywhere in the world we always got the same reports that he was a gentleman and a pleasure to work with.'
