A dog abandoned outside a train station with nothing but a takeaway tray of water appeared to be so sad at being cast aside, tears filled his eyes.

The black Staffordshire Bull Terrier-type dog was abandoned outside Eastbourne Railway Station, tied to the railing and left with just a small pot of water by his owner who fled in a taxi.

A photo of the animal, looking forlorn, has been shared dozens of times on the internet with people calling for help for the 'crying' dog. 

A staffie-type dog was left abandoned at Eastbourne Railway Station with just a takeaway tray of water 

The dog was found whining and pining for his owner after patiently waiting by the railing for more than an hour on February 11 in the hope that he would return.

When no one turned up to collect the lonely dog he was reported abandoned.

He was collected by dog wardens who hope they will be able to find the owner. 

A spokesman for Eastbourne Borough Council said: 'We were called on Wednesday afternoon with a report of a dog tied up and left for more an hour at Eastbourne Station.

The dog cut a forlorn figure and appeared to be so saddened by his situation tears were coming from his eyes

'We collected the dog which is now safe and well in kennels.

'We are trying to trace the pet's owner who we urge to contact us.'

If they are unsuccessful it is hoped the forlorn animal may be able to be re-homed in a similar way to Kai, the Shar-Pei dog abandoned just after Christmas. 

Kai, a Shar-Pei, was left tied to railings with a suitcase shortly after Christmas and has now been re-homed 

Kai was left tied to the railings at Ayr station in Scotland, with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy. 

His story attracted worldwide interest and the Scottish SPCA received offers from as far away as Hong Kong, New York and the Philippines to re-home him. After sifting through hundreds of appeals, the SSPCA chose a new owner for Kai.
