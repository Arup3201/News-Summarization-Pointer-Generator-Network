Writer and parenting guru Lenore Skenzay is on a mission to wrestle the simple joys of childhood out of the clutches of overprotective parents.

Skenazy, a 55-year-old mother of two from Queens and the founder of the Free Range Kids movement, made headlines in 2008 when she allowed her then-9-year-old son to ride the New York City subway without supervision, earning her the title 'World’s Worst Mom.'

Seven years - and one book deal - later, Skenazy is tackling helicopter parenting head on as the host of Discovery Life's new show World's Worst Mom, which premiers January 22.

According to the show's description, the 13-part series is 'dedicated to diffusing parental paranoia by helping high-strung, fearful parents to relax and give their kids the freedom they deserve.'

In each episode, Skenazy performs interventions with families, pushes boundaries and debunks myths about perceived dangers lurking behind every corner.

Skenazy’s theory is that while parents have to be vigilant, they must not keep their children in metaphorical bubble-wrap. According to the 55-year-old mother of two, parents who strive to shield their children from the world are doing them a great disservice by robbing them of independence.

‘Some kids are losing their childhood because their parents are so overprotective,’ Skenazy tells The New York Post. ‘Fear is being shoved down their throats at every juncture.’

One of the anxious, phobia-riddled parents featured on the show is Cayle White, a mother of three from Manhattan's Upper West Side who describes her family as 'paralyzed' by her numerous fears.

To put her mind at ease that something might happen to her 11-year-old son, Amadeo, on his way home from school, the sixth-grader is required to call his mother and narrate his journey from the bus stop to their front door.

Kept in a bubble: Fearing the worst and following the old adage, 'better safe than sorry,' the parents featured on the show put unreasonable restrictions on their kids 

Terrified of deadly E. coli infections, White, an admitted germophobe, would purposefully overcook food and then nuke it in the microwave for good measure to kill off any lingering bacteria.

Descending on the White household like a modern-day Mary Poppins, Skenazy goes to work challenging Cayle White's preconceived notions about parenting.

In order to prove to the overanxious mom that eating medium-rare steak would not wipe out her entire family, Skenazy hosts a barbecue in the park where Mrs White is banned from coming near the grill.

Next, Amadeo White is sent out on his own to walk the family dog in Central Park, using a map to find his way after being asked to forfeit his cell phone to prevent his jittery mom from checking up on him.

When he returns home in one piece and with his head held high, Cayle White notes that her 11-year-old seems genuinely proud of his accomplishment.

In another episode, Lenore Skenazy visits the Almonte family in Rockland County, New York, to help mom Phyllis overcome her fear of letting her children out of her sight.

‘Sometimes I feel like I’m in a box and nobody can come into it and I’m not allowed out of it,’ 10-year-old Brianna Almonte tells Skenazy on the show.

Skenazy’s theory is that while parents have to be vigilant, they must not rob their kids of the joys of childhood 

Phyllis Almonte has banned her daughter from taking part in play dates, especially sleepovers, out of concern that Brianna would have to change in strangers' homes.

Whenever Brianna needs to use a public restroom, her mom accompanies her into the stall to prevent the 10-year-old from coming in contact with germs.

Zach Almonte, 12, is not allowed to ride his bike beyond the family’s driveway because his mother is afraid he could get hit by a car.

And even when the kids are playing in their backyard, they are required to stay in contact with their mother via walkie-talkies.

‘I constantly fear that they will get abducted or hurt,’ Almonte, 47, admits to Skenazy. ‘I know what I’m doing is not good, but I can’t help it.’

To cure Phyllis of her phobias, Skenazy organizes a pool party play date for Brianna and then sends Zach off on a bike ride in the park two miles away.

Speaking to the Post two years after her encounter with Skenazy, Phyllis Almonte said: ‘Instead of thinking of all the things that could go wrong, I’m thinking about all the things that could go right.’
