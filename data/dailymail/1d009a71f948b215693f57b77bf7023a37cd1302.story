The boyfriend of a diet guru famous for eating 51 bananas a day claims he could 'retire in 100 countries' due to the $10,000 he makes a month 'pimping her out' across YouTube.

An e-book written by Freelee the Banana Girl's partner, Harley Johnstone, has been tendered in South Australia's Supreme Court as the pair battle a lawsuit brought against them by a rival Australian fitness blogger, the Advertiser reports.

Leanne Ratcliffe - better known as Freelee - and Mr Johnstone are facing a lawsuit from Kayla Itsines, the brains behind the Bikini Body Guide, and her boyfriend who allege the pair defamed them in a series of online posts.

In Mr Johnstone's vegan-themed book, titled Carb The F*** Up: Follow Your Heart With No F**** Given, he claims he makes $10,000 a month from his various YouTube channels.

'Yep, easy money isn't it just for doing videos on health, sharks, bike stuff and pimping out my girlfriend... hey, sex sells and so does the fear of sharks,' he wrote.

'We troll the internet with the health message and use whatever means possible to get that message out there ... swearing, sharks or cleavage usually works pretty good.

'I'm 37, zero debt, enough money in the bank to retire in about 100 different countries for the rest of my life... thanks, YouTube!'

His book also goes on to say Mr Johnstone isn't there to make friends, he 'doesn't care' who he offends in his online posts and he welcomes trolls.

'The only reason I delete or block someone is so they get fired up and talk about us on someone else's video,' he wrote.

'That way, they advertise us — and for free.' 

Prior to a court hearing Monday, large crowd of Freelee's supporters reportedly appeared and chanted the 'fruitarian' duo's slogan, 'carb the f*** up'

Ms Ratcliffe told the Advertiser her boyfriend wasn't pimping her out - it was 'his cheeky way of saying he likes to show me looking fit, lean and healthy'.

Prior to a court hearing Monday, large crowd of Freelee's supporters reportedly appeared and chanted the 'fruitarian' duo's slogan, 'carb the f*** up'. 

In a fiery Facebook post to her 2.3 million followers last month, Ms Itsines alleged Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone made false claims on YouTube that her partner was on steroids, that she was starving herself or other people and that she was a fraud. 

'This is wrong and illegal,' she wrote. 

'So I have requested that the content be removed from the internet. 

'After my initial request was denied I had no choice but to continue to protect the safety and reputation of my followers, Tobi and myself from a personal point of view.' 

Kayle Itsines and her partner Tobi lodged an injunction to the South Australian Supreme Court in February

Ms Itsines lodged an injunction to the South Australian Supreme Court in February. 

Her legal representative, Andrew Harris QC, reportedly told Judge Brian Withers at Monday's hearing that Mr Johnstone and Ms Ratcliffe had not complied with the request. He said they had kept the videos on YouTube but set to 'private'. 

Judge Withers told the court the matter should head straight to trial. Mr Harris was quoted saying that there was still a prospect of mediation between the parties in the next seven days. The hearing was adjourned until next week. 

The presence of a large number of supporters for Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone came after they issued a video request for 'fruit bats' to attend court to support them. 

'Good will prevail!' Ms Ratcliffe said in the video. 'The fruit bats will prevail!'
