Chris Grayling said it was 'inconceivable' the next Tory manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap Labour's Human Rights Act

Tory ministers were last night urged by their own MPs to stop talking and ‘do something’ over the Human Rights Act.

In a move designed to calm the nerves of backbenchers, Chris Grayling promised yesterday to scrap the controversial legislation.

But this will not happen until after the next election in 2015 – and then only if the Conservatives win an outright majority.

There was also confusion in Westminster over whether the Tories are planning to make a manifesto commitment to leave the separate European Court of Human Rights.

Such a move would be hugely popular with Tory activists. But no final decision has been taken, despite briefings by Whitehall officials that the party was ready to advocate the nuclear option of pulling out.

To lift party morale after the Eastleigh by-election debacle, Mr Grayling said it was ‘inconceivable’ the next Tory manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap Labour’s HRA. The Tories made a similar pledge ahead of the 2010 election but have been thwarted by the Liberal Democrats, who refuse to countenance any changes.

Mr Grayling said: ‘We cannot go on with a situation where people who are a threat to our national security, or who come to Britain and commit serious crimes, are able to cite their human rights when they are clearly wholly unconcerned for the human rights of others.’

But he stopped short of committing Britain to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Human Rights Act enshrined into UK law.

Mr Grayling said only that he wanted 'a dramatically curtailed’ role' for the Strasbourg court, which has come under fire for demanding the vote for prisoners. The judges have also blocked the deportation of terror suspects, including Abu Qatada.

Some senior figures – including Home Secretary Theresa May – want the Tories to be ready to quit the ECHR. They believe it is doing huge damage to efforts to get rid of foreign criminals.

Last month Mrs May unveiled plans to change the law so a foreign criminal can no longer block deportation on the grounds they have a human right to ‘a family life’ in the UK. But, crucially, there is no agreement yet to include the pledge to quit the EHCR in the next Tory manifesto.

Insiders say such a dramatic step could split the party, with Attorney General Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke likely to resign.

Scrapping the HRA, but remaining in the ECHR, would mean foreign criminals could appeal to Strasbourg.

Britain would then have to decide whether to ignore the rulings – as other member states do – or back down.

Backbenchers welcomed the commitment to scrapping the HRA but do not want to wait until after the 2015 election.

Senior MP Mark Field said that if Mrs May and Mr Grayling were serious they should bring forward a Bill, defying Liberal Democrat objections.

‘We are in government. Either do something now, and call the Liberal Democrats’ bluff on this, or stay quiet,’ he said. ‘It’s that sort of cynicism, it’s just politicians saying words and not doing anything’.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Tories always promised ‘jam tomorrow’ and claimed their supporters would no longer believe promises from the party.
