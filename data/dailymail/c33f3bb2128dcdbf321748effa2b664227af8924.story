'Just be yourself' is what so many children and adults alike are told every day. But for some this is much more of a challenge than for others.

'If you don't be yourself, you're going to be miserable for your whole life,' is the advice that comes from 11-year-old Isabelle.

Isabelle was born as a boy called Campbell, but told her parents last year just weeks after she turned ten she felt as though she was stuck in the wrong body.

In a documentary set to air on ABC's Four Corners on Monday evening, she and her family have chosen to share their story to encourage others to speak out.

Isabelle, 11, was born as a boy called Campbell but told her parents last year she felt like she was trapped in the wrong body

Research shows that children dealing with their gender identity are the most vulnerable between the time they come out and before they get treatment.

Because of this Isabelle's parents Naomi, a social worker, and Andrew, who runs their bed and breakfast, knew they had to act fast for the sake of their eldest daughter.

'There was probably a couple of months where she’d start a conversation with me saying I’m just feeling weird, I don’t feel right. She said... I don’t like my body, and I said well... what do you you mean? 

'And she said.. I feel like I’m a girl, I’m in the wrong body,' Isabelle's mother Naomi told Four Corners.

'I just said to my mum that I didn't wanna be boy, I felt like a girl and that I’m sick of living in this body,' said Isabelle. 

Isabelle (right), with dad Andrew, mum Naomi and younger sister Hattie, 8, recently came out at school but says people treat her differently 

Isabelle is working with Dr Michelle Telfer, Paediatrician at RCH, who says the support of a child's family is critical to their wellbeing during such a difficult time

'It took three or four weeks to go through it but just see how upset she was, she would come home miserable (and say) "I don't want to live",' her father Andrew revealed, speaking of the many appointments and processes Isabelle had to go through.

'She... just whispered, I just can’t see what the future looks like for me. And that was awful... I think for me that was the point where the confusion kind of melted away a little bit and you just sort of think well god, we’ve only got one job here and this is to help her create a future that she can live with, that she can thrive in,' mum Naomi revealed. 

The other staggering statistics show that 30 percent of young children who don;t get adequate treatment attempt suicide while 50 percent self-harm. 

More and more transgender children are presenting at clinics around Australia but experts put this down to children coming out earlier rather than hiding.

Currently there are two stages of medical treatments for children who are transgender, the first of which is puberty blockers.

These are used so children are able to figure out what they would like to do in the future, giving them time to make a long term decision without any consequences.

The 11-year-old says people treat her differently when they find out she's transgender but she just wants to feel like herself

Her dad Andrew revealed how one day Isabelle came home and said 'I don't want to live' like this

Once they stop taking the blockers their body continues to develop as it would have, but if they choose to go ahead they are given cross changing hormones.

However in what is already a trying time for these young people, they also need to be assessed by at least five doctors before they can begin any treatment.

Plus until recently families in Australia would have to go through court to get permission and access to these treatments. 

Although puberty blockers can now be obtained without court consent, teenagers still have to get permission to commence the second part of treatment. However families are upset that these young people must still go to court to consent to the treatment.

Chief Justice Diana Bryant shares this view, and is keen to see a test case go to the full bench of the Family Court and then the High Court so that court need not be involved in the decision.

Currently teenagers have to go through court to access the second part of treatment, but families are fighting against this

'Well look I'd like to see the High Court have the opportunity to examine these kinds of cases, these gender identity cases and to decide whether or not the court has to be involved at all,' she told Four Corners.

Since coming out to her parents Isabelle has also come out at school, but said she has faced a lot of criticism and harsh words from her schoolmates.

'Sometimes people treat me differently when they find out I'm transgender ... People being cruel to me it kind of tells you what not to do,' she revealed in a preview of the program.

Isabelle's doctor, Dr Michelle Telfer, Paediatrician and Clinical Lead of Adolescent Medicine at RCH, said that the parent's role supporting their children during such a difficult time is essential to their wellbeing.

'I often hear stories of young people who are not supported by their family, or even outwardly rejected,' Dr Telfer said.
