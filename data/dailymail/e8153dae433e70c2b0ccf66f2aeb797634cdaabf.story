West Bromwich Albion are considering a move for former Chelsea defender Sam Hutchinson.

Hutchinson, 24, has endured an injury-plagued career after coming through the Chelsea academy and even being named England under-19 player of the year at one stage.

In his younger years, Jose Mourinho had identified him as a future star but at the age of 21, he was forced to retire with a degenerative knee injury that had caused him pain since the age of 12.

Chance: Versatile defender Sam Hutchinson could be given the chance to resurrect his career at West Brom

Fitness: Hutchinson (centre) spent 15 years at Stamford Bridge but was seriously hampered by injuries

However, he since fought back against 
the odds with a prescribed rehabilitation programme and earned himself a
 new deal with Chelsea under Andre Villas-Boas but has been unable to 
break into the first-team before being released at the end of last 
season.

He impressed on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last season after previous loan spells with Nottingham Forest and Vitesse Arnhem.

Hutchinson
 is a target for Ian Holloway at Millwall but new Albion boss Alan 
Irvine is understood to have made an approach this week and is confident
 of signing Hutchinson, who may now finally have his chance on the 
Premier League stage. Sheffield Wednesday also remain interested.
