Internet users searching Google for a small Yorkshire village were left surprised when the online results revealed a very rude image of a semi-naked man.

The former coal-mining village of Skellow, near Doncaster, had no previous claim to fame, until one Twitter-user posted the search engine findings showing a naked man as a screen grab which has now gone viral.

Posting the unfortunate image on the social network, David Firth wrote: 'Don’t think the people of Skellow, South Yorkshire would be happy with how Google pictures them.'

Shock: Internet users searching Google for the Yorkshire village of Skellow were greeted with this very rude image of a naked man next to the map of the area 

Origin: The search engine had confused the image in its results, using the picture which had been submitted to an online blog instead of a photograph of the village 

Mr Firth, 31, said he normally uses Twitter to promote his work as an animator but couldn’t help share the screen grab with his followers.

'I was watching a previous video I made with a friend, in which he mentioned Skellow in conversation,' said the cartoonist from Leeds, West Yorkshire. 

'For some reason I decided to Google it.

'I looked it up and there was the image. I’ve seen stuff like this before where the search engine confuses images with search results but this was something else.'

Amused Tweeters have since shared the picture more than 1,500 times.

One user replied: 'Maybe Google thinks it accurately portrays the citizens of Skellow'.

Writer Charlie Brooker, who Mr Firth used to work for, also shared the bizarre search engine results with his followers, writing: 'Reckon that @DAVID-FIRTH Skellow tweet needs wider distribution.'

It was later discovered that the image had come from an online blog, Housequake, and was sent in by a user called ‘Jo’ from Wigan, Greater Manchester.

The photograph, which had appeared next to a map of the village, has now been removed from the search results.

Historically part of the West riding of Yorkshire, rural Skellow - which takes its name from the River Skell - is located around six miles from Doncaster, alongside the A1 road.

During the English Civil War a cannon battery was set up in the village by Oliver Cromwell to protect the Great North Road, now the A1. The mounds that once held the cannon still remain in the village.

The village is also home to Skellow Hall, which was built as a country manor house in 1642, and is now used as a residential care home for older people.

Until the mid-1980s, the village was home to many employed in the coal mining industry, and the remains of the former Bullcroft Colliery's winding wheel can still be seen in neighbouring Carcroft.
