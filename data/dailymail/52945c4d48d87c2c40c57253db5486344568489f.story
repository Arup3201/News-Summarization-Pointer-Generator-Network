It’s the most wonderful time of the year – the time when the Kardashians release their annual Christmas card.

And of course, Kim had her heart set on being the centre of attention for the elaborate photo shoot.

The reality star showcased the figure that made her famous in a show-stopping Yves Saint Laurent dress while smouldering for the camera for the 2013 card, which was unveiled on Sunday.

Their most elaborate one yet: The Kardashians have released their annual family Christmas card, which was shot by David LaChapelle for 2013

The 33-year-old’s frock had a very sexy keyhole cut-out, that allowed her to display plenty of her ample cleavage.

The floor-length halter-neck gown hugged Kim’s curves in all the right places and had sequined sleeves and a split all the way up one side.

Kim wore her blonde hair big and bouncy for the photo, which was shot by David LaChapelle, and topped off her look with purple heels.

LaChapelle had asked her to spray her hair black, and when Kim declined he still wasn't happy after she had her locks styled, calling the look 'so normal' and claiming, 'I want a f***ing sex machine.

The big reveal: The family revealed this year's card on Keeping Up With The Kardashians: A Very Merry Christmas special

When Kim returned after having her tresses backcombed to the extreme, Bruce Jenner told her: 'Your hair is bigger than your ass.'

The
 card is the family’s most elaborate to date, and set in a 
post-apocalyptic, chaotic casino with mannequin parts all over the 
place, and a sea of tabloid magazines with various members of the clan 
on the cover strewn across the floor.

Kendall and Kylie were wearing headpieces and similar black dresses with side-splits, but while 16-year-old Kylie’s had long and billowing sleeves, 18-year-old Kendall’s was sleeveless and she paired it with opera gloves.

Khloe and Kourtney were clad in black cocktail dresses, and while Kourtney held Penelope in her arms, Mason lounged on a chair beside Khloe, whose dress ripped during the shoot.

Giving Kim a run for her money was 
her mother Kris Jenner, who hitched up her strapless dress and sat 
regally and aptly on a cashier booth, wearing a Cleopatra inspired 
headdress. Meanwhile Bruce was sporting long hair and a tuxedo while inside a case, forlornly pressed up against the glass.

The family are surrounded by blown up photos of Kim in her younger years, while TV screens behind Kris display further images of the famous family.

Noticeably absent from the holiday card is Rob Kardashian, with the sock entrepreneur declining to participate after revealing he wasn't feeling up to it.

It was previously revealed that the sisters’ significant others, Scott Disick, Lamar Odom, and Kanye West, as well as Kim’s baby daughter North, would not be taking part in the festivities.

Hat's nice: Kylie was clearly excited about her look for the card and on Sunday shared a photo on Instagram in which she can be seen showing off her silver headdress

The decision to feature solely the women
 in the family, aside from Bruce and Mason, was that of David 
LaChapelle’s, and the famed photographer was not keen on the idea of 
Kourtney’s children being involved either.

But the 34-year-old wasn’t having it and said firmly during the Keeping Up With The Kardashians: A Very Merry Christmas special: ‘I really think my kids should be part of it. I know he is an artist but it’s still our family Christmas card. They will be in it.’

Bruce also was resolved that he would be featuring, and told Kendall: ‘It’s not the girls’ Christmas card, it’s our family Christmas card. We’ve done it for 23 years and they want to change it? It’s your mom’s and my Christmas card.’

The card is certainly a far stretch from the clan’s 2012 Christmas card, which featured the entire family, complete with children, partners and pets, celebrating together while dressed in all-white. 

What a difference a year makes: The family's holiday card for 2012 was a lot more low-key, and showed all of the clan celebrating while dressed in white
