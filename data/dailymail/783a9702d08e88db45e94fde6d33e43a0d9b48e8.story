The transfer window may still have four days to run, but a record amount of £725million has already been spent by Premier League clubs.

A report by accountancy firm Deloitte discovered top-flight clubs have spent nearly three quarters of a billion pounds in the window since it reopened at the end of last season.

That figure smashes last year's record spend of £630million.

Ander Herrera (Athletic Bilbao - Man United, £28m) 

Adam Lallana (Southampton - Liverpool, £25m) 

The penchant for English clubs to buy from abroad has continued, with around £475million of the current total going on players from overseas.

Manchester United have been the biggest spenders in the market, parting with over £130million to sign Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and Angel di Maria, who joined for a British record fee of £59.7million on Tuesday.

Chelsea have also been busy in the market, reinforcing their squad with the capture of Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis.

And with plenty of time to go until Monday's 11pm deadline, further spending is expected.

Hitting the right note: Cesc Fabregas cost Chelsea in the region of £30million from Barcelona 

Drifter: Louis van Gaal was sanctioned a £28m move for Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera 

Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group, a branch of Deloitte, said: 'There are a number of factors contributing to this summer's spend, including the showcase for global talent a World Cup provides.

'However, one of the main drivers of Premier League spending continues to be the increased resources clubs now have as a result of improved broadcast deals.

'Last season the average Premier League club received around £25m more in central broadcast distributions than they did in 2012/13, which helped fuel a record transfer window last summer.

'We are again seeing Premier League clubs use these resources to contribute to what is a new record this summer.'
