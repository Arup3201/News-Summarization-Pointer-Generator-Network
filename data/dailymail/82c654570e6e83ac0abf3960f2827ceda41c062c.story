The parents of two girls killed on a 
level crossing accused Network Rail of a cover-up yesterday after 
winning a six-year battle for justice.

Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte 
Thompson, 13, were hit by a high-speed train as they went Christmas 
shopping together in 2005.

The friends stepped on to the tracks 
while trying to catch their train at Elsenham in Essex but failed to 
spot another service travelling in the opposite direction.

At the time, Network Rail insisted the
route was safe. But it failed to disclose the existence of a 2002 risk 
assessment recommending the gates should lock automatically when trains 
approached.

The documents came to light only last year – three years after an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

Plans to prosecute the company, which 
is responsible for the rail network, were announced subsequently and it 
admitted three health and safety charges yesterday.

It is facing an unlimited fine after 
magistrates said the £30,000 penalty they could impose was insufficient 
and passed sentencing to a crown court.

Olivia’s father Chris, 63, said 
afterwards: ‘Network Rail withheld documents from us and obviously that 
makes us angry. They withheld documents from official inquiries, they 
withheld documents from the coroner.

‘This is not going to end with the 
sentence. We still have a lot of questions we want answered. Who knew 
about this? How high up did the cover-up go?’

Charlotte’s father Reg, 54, added: ‘In
the aftermath of the accident, Network Rail claimed the girls had acted
recklessly and that somehow their youthful exuberance led directly to 
their deaths.

‘I never believed that they were the 
architects of their own terrible end. It has taken six years to reveal 
the truth of what happened. Charlie and Liv would be alive today had 
Elsenham station had proper safety measures in place.’

Tributes are still being placed at the crossing where the girls died

Elsenham Station: The girls were killed in December 2005 as pedestrian gates at a railway level crossing were unlocked. This was the scene a year later

Olivia and Charlotte were killed on December 3, 2005, as they crossed a footpath leading to Elsenham station platform. The crossing was fitted with warning lights and ‘yodel’ sounding alarms.

A London to Cambridge train passed over the crossing with the red lights and yodel sounding - a warning for foot passengers not to cross.

After the train passed, the lights remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, travelling from Birmingham to Stansted Airport in Essex, was going to pass through the station.

The girls opened the unlocked wicket gates and walked on to the crossing. They were both struck by the Stansted train and killed.

In November last year, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) announced that it would prosecute Network Rail over those deaths after reopening its investigation into the accident.

The move came after the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) joined the girls' families in demanding a public inquiry amid claims that two safety documents were not disclosed to the Essex Coroner at the 2007 inquest into the deaths.

Outside court, Reg Thompson, 
Charlotte's father, said: 'The horror of that day is always with us and 
the huge hole in our lives left by Charlie will never be filled.

'In
the aftermath of the accident, Network Rail claimed the girls had acted
recklessly and that somehow their youthful exuberance led directly to 
their deaths.

'I never 
believed that they were the architects of their own terrible end. It has
taken six years to reveal the truth of what happened.'

The court hearing comes just days after after 15-year-old Katie Littlewood  was hit by a train at Johnson's Footpath Crossing in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Saturday.

Her death, which is being treated as a ‘tragic accident’ by both Network Rail and British Transport Police (BTP), occurred just a few miles down the same stretch of track where Olivia and Charlotte were killed six years ago.

Network Rail said investigations were
carried out on the crossing immediately after the 11.45am incident and 
showed no faults with the safety measures in place.

Network
Rail said it would plead guilty to failing to carry out a sufficient 
risk assessment, failing to properly control protective measures at the 
level crossing and failing to prevent the girls from being exposed to 
the risks which led to their deaths.

A man has been fined £800 for allowing a little boy to open gates at a railway crossing.

A train driver saw the boy on the railway line and a 4x4 car driven by Lee Mason, 39, reversing from the track as the train travelled at 47mph towards the private crossing, magistrates at Dolgellau, Gwynedd, heard.

A telephone to check whether it was safe to cross the Llechryd private crossing near Talybont, Barmouth, had not been used when the child went to open the gates last August, as it should have been. Richard Edwards, prosecuting for the British Transport Police.

The court heard that train driver Gareth Owen sounded the horn and applied the emergency brakes, but knew that the train would not be able to stop before reaching the crossing.

'The train driver estimated that the boy, with his hands over his ears, was within three feet of the train as it passed him. The vehicle being driven by Mason had managed to reverse back,' Mr Edwards told the court.

The court heard that when the train driver spoke to Mason of Mansfield Woodhouse, Mansfield, the defendant said he had not used the telephone and the boy had opened the first gate and was walking over the railway to open the gate on the other side of the line.

He pleaded guilty to unlawfully allowing the boy to open level crossing gates without permission and therefore endangering the safety of railway passengers or persons using the railway crossing.

Iestyn Davies, defending, said his 'accepts full responsibility for not using the telephone to check to see if the railway line was clear'.

Court chairman Caerwyn Roberts said: 'This is far more serious and is the most serious case involving railway crossing that had been before this court in recent years,' he said.

'Our fine of £800 reflects your early guilty plea and remorse,' said the chairman. Costs of £100 were also imposed.

An order was made preventing the publication of the boy’s details.

Prosecutor Sarah LeFerve said the 
magistrates' court's power to impose a maximum fine of £30,000 for the 
offences was insufficient, given their gravity.

The Crown court can impose an unlimited fine for each count.

In May last year Network Rail was fined £3million  for safety failing at a set of points which caused the fatal Potters bar crash in May 2002.

Defence counsel Prashant Popat said the company had already apologised to the families and taken steps to improve safety.

In a statement released after the 
hearing, David Higgins, chief executive of Network Rail, said: 'Last 
year I apologised in person to the families of Olivia and Charlotte.

'Today,
Network Rail repeats that apology. In this tragic case, Network Rail 
accepts that it was responsible for failings, and therefore we have 
pleaded guilty.'

It added: 'Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by Olivia and Charlotte's families but I have promised them that we are committed to making our railway as safe as possible.

'In recent years we have reassessed all of our 6,500 level crossings and closed over 500. I accept that there is still a long way to go but we are making progress.'

Network Rail will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on March 15.

A spokesman for the ORR said: 'Network Rail pleaded guilty to two charges under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and guilty to one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

'Our thoughts are with the families of Olivia and Charlotte. ORR will do everything it can to ensure that the prosecution proceeds as quickly as possible.'

Mr Bazlinton's statement added: 'Above all, we shall be watching closely to make sure that the changes Network Rail has promised to improve level crossing safety are carried out.

'Visions and plans are all very well, but it is putting them in place that matters.

'I have confidence that David Higgins is the person to achieve change - his record of delivery at English Partnerships and the Olympic Delivery Authority bodes well for the future.

'Tina Ineson, Olivia's mother, accepted an invitation from David Higgins last June to become Level Crossing User Champion: she won't take "no" for an answer.'
