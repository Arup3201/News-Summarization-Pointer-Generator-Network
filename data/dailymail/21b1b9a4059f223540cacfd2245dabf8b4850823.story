After 120 bruising minutes and only a heartbreaking extra-time defeat against Belgium to show for their efforts, it would be easy for both the USA squad - and their legion of fans - to feel distraught after crashing out of the World Cup.

The pain of Tuesday night's last 16 tie in Salvador won't have disappeared just yet, but Jurgen Klinsmann and his players have plenty of reasons for optimism following arguably the bravest loss of the tournament so far.

As veterans of the international scene Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and DaMarcus Beasley battled away at the Arena Fonte Nova, America's bright young things were busy putting forward their country's case as serious contenders for Russia in four years' time.

Julian Green, only 19-years-old and making his first appearance in Brazil, scored with his opening touch to set up a dramatic finish against Marc Wilmots' much-fancied side.

And although Klinsmann's men couldn't beat Thibaut Courtois again to force a penalty shootout, they deserve to leave South America with both pride and hope for the future.

The impact of the young Bayern Munich forward, who controlled Michael Bradley's pinpoint pass with a brilliant first-time volley to reduce his side's two-goal deficit, gave supporters a glimpse of the country's emerging talent.

With talisman Dempsey now 31 and the international career of record goalscorer Landon Donovan seemingly over, Green will be expected to become a major part of Team USA's attacking force. The early signs suggest he's ready to do just that.

Born in Florida to an American father and a German mother, the versatile forward was picked up by the Bundesliga giants Bayern in 2010 and made his first team debut as a late substitute in a Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow last November.

He represented Germany at various youth levels before being talked into swapping allegiances by Klinsmann, who has focused on convincing a number of players with dual nationality to start wearing the famous stars and stripes.

Bright future: Green, who plays for German side Bayern Munich, runs off to celebrate his first World Cup goal

Speaking about Green after his side's narrow defeat, Klinsmann said: 'We knew that he was ready.

'He knew that he might get his chance today. It was just phenomenal the way he came in and scored that goal and gets us back.

'We just needed a little bit more. It was fun to watch that kid grow.'

And grow he will. Green netted 15 goals in 23 games for Bayern Munich's second team last season, exhibiting his natural ability in front of goal in his first campaign as a professional.

He has been linked with a move to Premier League side Tottenham in some quarters, although it is highly unlikely that Pep Guardiola would sanction a permanent transfer for one his club's most promising players.

Fortunately for Klinsmann, who wants to stay on as USA boss until at least the next World Cup, Green isn't the only youngster threatening to mark his mark on the international stage for years to come.

DeAndre Yedlin replaced injured right-back Fabian Johnson after 32 minutes in Salvador and, after the excellent Howard in the USA's goal, was easily the game's most impressive performer.

The 20-year-old, who reportedly earns just £60,000 a year playing for Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer, rampaged down Belgium's left-side, giving Red Devils defender Toby Alderweireld his most difficult game of the World Cup so far.

Up against the likes of Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne, Yedlin's commitment to getting forward, beating his man and delivering dangerous crosses was a breath of fresh air.

His energy levels barely dipped despite his constant forays into Belgium's half and he dealt impressively with the attacking threat posed by Wilmots' expansive side, something noticed by his team-mate Howard.

More to come: Klinsmann has reasons for optimism with talented young players continuing to emerge

'He’s fearless. He gets forward. He’s strong, he’s fast,' said the Everton stopper.

'(Eden) Hazard is no cake walk and I thought he handled him really, really well. Obviously, as the team got tired, we opened up, but when you talk about one-on-one, he won those battles.'

Klinsmann has proved his credentials as an organiser and man-motivator, but with Green and Yedlin, plus Bradley, Johnson, Omar Gonzalez, Jozy Altidore and Aron Johannsson all coming into their prime or still developing, the future for the national team looks even brighter.

Winning the 2018 World Cup may still be a few of steps too far for Klinsmann and Co, but you certainly wouldn't bet against this now football-mad nation continuing their development on the biggest stage.
