A British nuclear power reactor was shut down for five months over fears of a Fukushima-style meltdown.

One of two reactors at Dungeness power station on the Kent coast was closed by energy giant EDF last year after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event.

The flood defences were reviewed in an official government report in response to the Fukushima disaster and they were found to ‘not be as robust as previously thought’.

Worries: One of two reactors at Dungeness power station on the Kent coast was closed by energy giant EDF after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event

In 2011, an earthquake struck Japan, killing 20,000 people and resulting in a tsunami to crash over the Fukushima nuclear plant’s sea wall.

EDF told the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) in December 2012 that it ‘no longer has confidence’ in its sea defences being able to defend against rare weather events such as the Japanese tsunami.

One of the reactors at the power station, which generates enough power for about 750,000 homes, was shut down on May 22 in order to build a new barrier wall. It was reopened again in October.

The new permanent wall around the site is expected to be finished by the end of the month. The defences were upgraded from protecting against a one-in-1,000 year weather event to one that occurs every 10,000 years.

An EDF spokesman said last night: ‘EDF Energy chose to take the reactor offline to further improve flooding defence at Dungeness B. 

The Dungeness A nuclear station started generating power in 1965, before it was joined by Dungeness B two decades later.

Dungeness B is formed of two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985. They were set up more than a decade behind schedule and at four times the cost estimated to get them running.

Dungeness B remains operational after the 2006 closure of Dungeness A, which was the world's oldest operating nuclear power station at the time.

The site is protected from storm surges and coastal erosion by shingle extracted locally.

A Dungeness C was considered in 2009 on a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations - but the Government later ruled it out, citing environmental reasons.

'Prior to this the site was deemed safe to operate and protected from events which would occur one in every 1,000 years by the nuclear safety regulator, the ONR.

‘We conservatively took the decision to take both reactors offline in order to undertake additional protection to cover extremely rare events; ones which might happen only one in 10,000 years.

‘Part of this work included building a flood defence wall around the site which is due to be completed this month. 

'We are continuously updating and improving the plant to ensure it is operating safely. The recent weather has had no impact on operations at Dungeness B.’

Martin Pearson, station director at Dungeness B, said: ‘The recent adverse weather has had no impact on existing infrastructure and the power station has operated normally in the recent high tides and stormy weather.’

An ONR spokesman said: ‘We consider NGL to be making satisfactory progress in improving the Dungeness B flood defences, taking into account the challenges associated with the work and the need to ensure high confidence in the completed defences.’

Kyshtym (Soviet Union): September 1957

Thousands of people are exposed to radiation and thousands more evacuated from their houses after a chemical explosion near Chelyabinsk sees up to 80 tonnes of radioactive materials released into the air.

Windscale (Cumbria): October 1957

A limited release of radioactivity caused by a fire in the graphite-core reactor sees the sale of milk from local farms banned for a month. The reactor at Windscale (right) is buried in concrete after it cannot be salvaged.

Chernobyl (Soviet Union): April 1986

An experiment causes one of four reactors to explode, with the resulting fire burning for nine days. The explosion kills two people and 28 more die from acute radiation sickness directly after the blast. It is also thought that the disaster caused thousands of cancer deaths.

Fukushima Daiichi (Japan): March 2011

A magnitude-9.0 earthquake at sea causes a tsunami to damage four of six reactors at the nuclear power plant site. Fires are set off after cooling systems fail, but there is only a minimal risk to health.

And here are three nuclear near-misses:

Kirtland Air Force Base (New Mexico): May 1957

A cow was killed and residents of Albuquerque terrified when a B-36 aircraft transporting a nuclear bomb from Texas to New Mexico fell through the bomb bay doors from 1,700 feet and detonated, blasting a crater 12ft deep and 25ft across. Luckily the nuclear capsule had separated from the bomb and did not explode.

Savannah River (Georgia): February 1958

A B-47 carrying a nuclear bomb collided mid-air with an F-86 jet during a training flight. The device was jettisoned and fell into the river and has never been located.

Yuba City (California): March 1961

A crippled B-52 carrying a pair of nuclear bombs suffered a loss of pressure at 10,000ft. The commander stayed aboard to pilot the plane away from Yuba City before ejecting at 4,000ft. The plane crashed but nothing detonated and the bombs were recovered.
