A new photography trend sees newlyweds plunge into the water and pose in their wedding outfits.

Matt Adcock of Del Sol Photography, who is based in Mexico's Riviera Maya, has worked with hundreds of couples who choose to celebrate the first day of married life in this unique way.

They ask to be photographed fully-submerged at exotic spots along the coast, and often by the end of the shoot they appear undressed as they let their soaked clothing slip off. 

Bizarre trend: Newlyweds are choosing to pose underwater in their wedding outfits to celebrate entering married life - here a couple hold a pose in the waters of Mexico's Riviera Maya

Mr Adock, who runs his business with his wife Sol Tamargo, told the Huffington Post that they occasionally run into danger on location and he always has a large team of people on hand to help.

'We mostly work in the safe places where you can stand, but we have a rescue swimmer at every shoot,' he explained.

'A lot of times we’re having to throw our cameras down and save the bride because her crinoline’s wrapped around her legs.'

He said the craze for underwater wedding photography was born out of the Trash The Dress phenomenon, which sees brides effectively destroying a bridal gown by getting it wet or dirty.

Most couples request to be photographed while navigating underground caves and rivers in Riviera Maya, which is a popular scuba diving and snorkeling destination.

Although Mr Adock's images have an effortless feel, it takes hours of hard work to capture each one, as strong currents and cold water temperatures present a challenge.

Describing some of the difficulties he faces, Mr Adock said: 'None of our brides or grooms are models, and that’s the most challenging issue.

'None of them know how to hold their bodies or move their arms or face.

'We’re constantly directing these people: "OK, open your eyes” and “Don’t do that” and “OK, you’re covering your arm” and “Oops, wardrobe malfunction, pull up the dress."

'[That’s] coupled with water temperatures that are 62, 65 degrees - it’s cold.

'So it’s challenging to get what we want without, I don’t want to say killing them, but we are pushing them to their limits.

'And there is a current in these underground rivers, so these brides are fighting against the current.'

Carefree: One couple choose to end their photo shoot completely naked

Despite the tough conditions Mr Adcock says that most people seize the opportunity to express their sexuality. Some even request to conduct the whole photo session nude, while others get 'hot and steamy'.

'It’s a form of expression to be able to
show nudity and combine it with love and art. I’ve had clients order 
huge wall prints, and we’ve had clients that are happy to share it on 
Facebook,' he added.

While working with clients he said it is important to build rapport and have fun. Often, he likes to dole out shots of tequila once a day's work is over.

Del Sol Photography charges between $2,750 to 
$4,000 per photo shoot. Mr Adcock said some brides are hesitant to use their original wedding dresses and choose to wear a second-hand gown instead.
