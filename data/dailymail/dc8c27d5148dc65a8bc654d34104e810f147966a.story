Frank Lampard has refused to follow Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole into international retirement just yet, insisting that he will take a short time to ponder his England future.

Lampard, who announced on Thursday that he will join New York City in January, won his 103rd cap when captaining England in their final World Cup group game against Costa Rica last month.

The 36-year-old revealed that the reception from the fans after that game has made him think twice about quitting, even though it will be difficult to stay in Roy Hodgson’s plans for the Euro 2016 qualifiers if he does not have a club for the next six months.

Waiting: Frank Lampard is yet to make a decision on his international retirement

At his unveiling as a New York City player in Brooklyn, Lampard said: ‘I’m going to make the decision very soon. I wanted to get this cleared up first. I’ve enjoyed my time with England and I’m too proud an Englishman to make a decision like this lightly.

‘I have to be completely sure it’s the right call for me. I’m going to take a view on it now. It’s one of the things I want to do quickly - talk with my family.

‘I didn’t need to see them (Gerrard and Cole) retire to know that the end will come for me at some stage, of course it will. You get to a point when you just know.

‘We need young players to come through. I’m not silly. I know it can’t go on forever.  Every player knows when it’s best for them. For some it’s when they’re 29 - others want to play as long as they can.

Thinking time: Lampard admits he will think about his international future over the coming days

‘I have to think about what playing for England means to me. I know I have to decide soon because obviously the games start coming round soon enough.

‘Whatever decision I make I will want to speak to the England manager first and let him know before anyone else.

‘If the Costa Rica game turns out to be my last, I’ll go out a very proud man. It was a bad tournament for us but I’ll tell you what, I had a bit of a moment after the game. It made me very proud to experience the reception we got off the fans, considering the way we’d played.’
