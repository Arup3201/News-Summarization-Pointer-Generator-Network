A film is to be made about former West Bromwich Albion and Real Madrid winger Laurie Cunningham, entitled the Black Flash.

More than £1.6million has been raised to make a film about the former England international winger. 

Producers of the film issued a crowd-funding appeal to raise £1.4m and investors have helped them surpass that figure.

Cunningham became the first British player to join Real when he signed from Albion in 1979 and was a member of what became known as the Three Degrees alongside team-mates Brendon Batson and Cyrille Regis. Cunningham died in a car crash in Madrid in 1989 aged 33. 

Film-makers Roker 37 said the film was set to be a drama 'about a tragic hero who was adored but misunderstood.' 

In a statement to potential funders, the company said: 'This film will tell the story of a shy dreamer blessed with breathtaking ability, who became an icon, if not a champion, and died tragically before his time. On the surface, Laurie was exuberant, he loved to dance, wore loud fashionable clothes and played with a mesmerising freedom and grace. Inside, though, he was quiet and complex and it is this dichotomy that will define his story.' 

Actor James Corden is said to have been approached to play the role of Ron Atkinson.

Roker 37 produced and directed the documentary for ITV1 entitled Laurie Cunningham: First Amongst Equals.
