Professional counsellors are being drafted into a rural village to offer advice to residents after seven people, including five teenagers, killed themselves in less than two years.

The victims, who all either lived in or had close connections to East Leake in Nottinghamshire, committed suicide between February 2011 and October 2012.

Now, in a bid to halt the 'suicide contagion' sweeping through the community, the bereaved mother of the most recent victim is setting up a self-help group to try to prevent more deaths.

Called the Tomorrow Project, it will work with NHS counsellors on advising those most at risk in the large village.

The Tomorrow Project has been set up by Penny Johnson whose son Jamie, 19, died on a family holiday to Turkey last October.

Jamie had been struggling to get over the death of his friend Louis Way, 19, who hanged himself seven months earlier.

Mrs Johnson, 39, said: 'People are worried about 
the alarming rise of suicides in the village: we are 1,200 per cent 
above the national average for suicides in East Leake.

'I don't want Jamie's death to be in vain.  People are worried there could be more deaths and we have to do everything we can.

'The Tomorrow Project is aimed at trying to support young people through difficult times in their lives.'

Chloe Hayden, 17, was the first of seven suicides around East Leake, followed by her friend Daniel Raynor, 18

Mrs Johnson, who has two other sons, 
Ross, 16, and Johnny, ten, told how her eldest son had been affected by 
the death of his friend.

She said: 'Jamie was best friends with Louis and was with him the night he died.

'They'd been in the pub for a couple of drinks on a Sunday night and when they'd left the pub, Jamie said to Louis "See you tomorrow mate" and that was the last time he saw him.

'The next day Jamie was walking to the bus stop to go to work when Louis' brother rang him and told him he'd taken his own life.

'Jamie took it very badly and went into a deep depression for a while.  He was withdrawn and drank a lot and on one occasion said he wanted to take his own life.'

Mrs Johnson said she rang the NHS and a counsellor talked to Jamie on the phone, but she said that because her son was over 18 they were 'powerless' to do anything.

She said: 'Jamie told the NHS counsellor I was overreacting and he hadn't meant what he had said.'

Her son appeared to get his life back together and got a job as a kitchen porter in Corsica before working in Lineker's bar in Cyprus.

She said: 'When he came home he seemed happy and was loving life.'

'We went on holiday to Turkey and three days after we got there he went up to his hotel room and after three hours, his uncle went up and found him hanged.

'He didn't leave a note and we might never know if he did it because of Louis' death but what I strongly believe is that because of what happened to Louis, suicide became an option for Jamie.

'The Tomorrow Project is aimed at all people who want to talk about their concerns or for parents who want advice.

'If the Tomorrow Project had been around before Jamie died I might have been able to recognise some of the warning signs which I missed.'

Mrs Johnson, who runs the village's Nag's Head pub, has converted its back room into a drop-in centre for worried residents.

She launched the Tomorrow Project at the weekend, and it will be funded for the first six months with help from the self-harm charity Harmless, as well as monies raised by village fundraisers.

As part of the project, there will be therapy sessions - funded by the NHS - with counsellors in East Leake for anybody who might be affected by suicide or have concerns about difficulties in their own lives.

The spiral of suicides began in February 2011, when talented singer Chloe Hayden, 17, was found hanged in her bedroom in the Nottinghamshire village of Chilwell.

A week later her best friend, Daniel Raynor, 18, who went to school with Jamie Johnson and Daniel Raynor, was found dead.

At their inquests, Nottinghamshire Coroner Dr Nigel Chapman was so alarmed he called for the police to investigate the deaths to prevent a 'cluster' of copy-cat suicides.

All of those who died had either lived in or had strong connections to the village near the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border

But on January 9 last year Louis Way, who had gone to the same school as Daniel, was found dead at his home in East Leake.

The promising footballer, who 'lived for sport' had hanged himself.

Just a few months later in August 2012, another teenage girl in the village was found dead, and last October Louis' best friend Jamie Johnson killed himself on holiday.

According to Harmless, other people with close links to the village committed suicide recently, including a teacher on placement at the local school and another middle-aged man from the village who drank in the Nag's Head.

Caroline Roe, a director of Harmless which is leading the Tomorrow Project, said: 'We are trying to engage people and encourage people, of all ages, to talk about their concerns.

'What happens is that people can be affected by behaviours in people living in their communities and in this situation there is a risk of a suicide contagion.'

Natalie Way, 24, the sister of Louis Way, said: 'I think about Louis every day, nothing can take away the pain.

'I remember my dad telling me what happened and I just didn't believe it; I went numb.

'Young men sometimes bottle up a lot of things and often don't want to talk to anyone. We need to try and change this.'
