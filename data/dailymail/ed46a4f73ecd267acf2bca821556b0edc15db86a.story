Doctors have removed a tumour weighing almost a stone from the face of a Slovakian man.

In 2004, Stefan Zoleik developed a thankfully rare condition called Madelung disease, which caused fat tumours to grown on his face.

One of them grew from ear to ear under his chin causing people to stop and stare at him in the street.

‘Everybody was turning and looking at me,’ Mr Zoleik told Reuters the news agency. ‘It was very unpleasant. It also bothered me all the time when I moved my head.’

Finally, Igor Homola, a surgeon, spent five hours cutting away the growth and Mr Zoleik is more than happy with the resuts saying: ‘This is amazing, much better than it was before, which was horrible. ‘I don’t even feel any pain now.’
