Researchers have claimed that Shakespeare's portrayal of King Richard III as a psychopath was unfounded - but admit he was a control freak.

A team at the University of Leicester, which recently discovered the remains of the King under a car park, are now attempting to analyse the king's personality.

They found that, while there was no 
evidence for Shakespeare’s depiction of Richard III as a psychopath, he 
may have had 'intolerance to uncertainty syndrome' – which may have 
manifested in control freak tendencies.

They say their analysis aims to 
humanise Richard and 'to flesh out the bones and get to the character 
of the man who became one of the most controversial kings in English 
history.'

Professor Mark Lansdale, Head of the University’s School of Psychology, and forensic psychologist Dr Julian Boon carried out the study based on the consensus among historians.

Firstly, they examined one of the most persistent and critical depictions of Richard’s personality – the suggestion that he was a murdering psychopath.

'This reputation, portrayed most famously in Shakespeare’s play, does not seem to have any basis in the facts we have about his life,' they said.

They found he showed little signs of the traits psychologists would use to identify psychopaths today – including narcissism, deviousness, callousness, recklessness and lack of empathy in close relationships.

However, the academics speculate that Richard may have exhibited a common psychological syndrome know as an intolerance to uncertainty.

Professor Mark Lansdale said: 'This syndrome is associated with a need to seek security following an insecure childhood, as Richard had.

In varying degrees, it is associated with a number of positive aspects of personality including a strong sense of right and wrong, piety, loyalty to trusted colleagues, and a belief in legal processes - all exhibited by Richard. 

'On the negative side it is also associated with fatalism, a tendency to disproportionate responses when loyalty is betrayed and a general sense of 'control freakery' that can, in extreme cases, emerge as very authoritarian or possibly priggish.

'We believe this is an interesting perspective on Richard's character.'

In addition, the pair examined how his 
disability, evident in the curvature of the spine of the King’s remains 
may have had an impact on his character - and specifically on the way he
 interacted with people who he did not know well.

The
 remains of Richard III came within a matter of inches of being lost 
forever when a 19th century toilet was built above the skeleton, a lead 
archaeologist revealed today.

Richard
 Buckley, who led the project to exhume the deposed king, said his final
 resting place came close to being 'completely destroyed' when the 
outhouse was built on top of the site.

Luckily,
 the grave was only slightly disturbed by the building's primitive 
foundations, which missed the deceased monarch's body by a few inches 
when they were installed.

Because
 his remains were buried just 27in under the flag stones of Greyfriars 
monastery in Leicester, they were disturbed on a number of occasions as 
by builders developing the area.

The
 527-year-old skeleton - buried with its hands crossed in a shallow 
grave - was missing its feet, which experts believe were smashed off 
when the foundations were built.

The
 site was later turned into a council car park for social workers until a
 team searching for the king's body excavated the area last September.

A
 three-week dig by experts from the University of Leicester unearthed 
the skeleton which was confirmed 'beyond reasonable doubt' today to be 
that of the last Plantagenet king.

But
Mr Buckley said that the king's remains were 
almost flushed down the pan when the outhouse was constructed in the 
1800s.

He said: 'The remains were very vulnerable because they were only under relatively modern debris. A less experienced team could easily have damaged the skeleton whilst using a mechanical digger to open the trench.'

One woman's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of Richard III.

Screenwriter
 Philippa Langley, pictured right, said she felt a chill on a hot 
summer's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was 
buried.

The
 remarkable discovery of the remains, which, consistent with historical 
accounts of Richard, have both a curved spine back and wounded skull, 
was made last September.

Miss
 Langley was strolling across the car park used by Leicester social 
services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill 
in August 2009.

'It
 was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold.
 I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on 
his grave,' she told the Sunday Times.

'I am a rational human being but the feeling I got was the same feeling I have had before when a truth is given to me.'

Miss
 Langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City
 Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains
 were those of Richard.

Miss
 Langley, who is a member of the Richard III Society, is working on a 
documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4 titled Richard III: 
The King in the Car Park, which has been made alongside the university 
academics and will be screened tonight. She
 said the her play has been turned into a script for television and 
film, which is now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the
 UK'. 

In medieval times, deformation was often taken as a visible indication of a twisted soul.

As a result, it is possible that this would have made him cautious in all his interactions with others.

Professor Lansdale added: 'Overall, we recognise the difficulty of drawing conclusions about people who lived 500 years ago and about whom relatively little is reliably recorded; especially when psychology is a science that is so reliant upon observation.

'However, noting that this is the problem historians work with as a matter of routine, we argue that a psychological approach provides a distinct and novel perspective: one which offers a different way of thinking about the human being behind the bones.'
