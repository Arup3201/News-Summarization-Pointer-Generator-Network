Tartan and tweed may have been hot looks on the catwalk over Paris Fashion Week, but the A-listers were spearheading a new trend of their own in the French capital.

Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr and Cara Delevingne all unveiled the so-called 'extreme cleavage' - dresses or jackets that revealed an enormous expanse of decolletage.

New mother Kim Kardashian's take on the trend was the most extreme, with the 32-year-old showing off her Botticelli-like form in a series of risque 
outfits.

The latest trend? Kim Kardashian and her A-list friends have been sporting a new trend in Paris: to show off extreme cleavage

Last night, the reality TV star wore a daring black Givenchy gown at the star-studded Mademoiselle C party in the French capital.

Kim even took to Instagram to treat her fans to a glimpse of her bust-revealing outfit. 

Kanye West's girlfriend wasn't the only star at the party keen to show off their decollete either.

Model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne also wore a revealing black jumpsuit, complete with a daringly low cut neckline.

Elsewhere in Paris, Miranda Kerr proved she had the trend nailed with a sequence of outfits that would have even the most liberal of French women blush.

As one of the sexiest models in the 
world she would turn heads anyway - let alone when sporting the sort of dramatic necklines she stepped out in over the past week.

At the Stella McCartney show at Paris Fashion Week 
on Monday the 
30-year-old looked confident and stunning in a low-cut white dress which featured a
low-cut neckline, dropped-waist and a modest midi-length.

Across the pond in LA, Gwyneth showed her support for the racy look as she stepped out in a black tuxedo jacket while filming an advert in downtown LA.

The 41-year-old wore the blazer, which was open to the navel, as part of a shoot for Boss Jour Pour Femme perfume.

She wore her blonde hair swept over one shoulder and was topless underneath her blazer aside from a simple gem necklace.

Speaking
about the extreme cleavage trend, celebrity stylist Claire Wacey, said:
'The new trend to show off more cleavage is great provided you have a 
pert, toned bust, if however your boobs do not defy gravity and require 
bras of steel to keep them in place do not attempt this trend.

'If
attempting then ensure that you only show the curve of the bust, either
in the centre or at the top rather than creating a pushed together 'Bum 
Boob'.

Rocking the trend too: Gwyneth Paltrow wore a blazer, which was open to the navel, as part of a shoot for Boss Jour Pour Femme perfume

'Look for dresses that will separate and lift the bust so that the look remains classy.

'Invest in strong tit tape - Boots stock Eylure tit tape which is great to keep everything in place.'

Lisa Potter, Femail Fashion Finder deputy editor, added: 'The fashion craze that's been popping out all over the red
carpet? Cleavage.

'Whether you like it or not necklines are cut down to there
lately with everyone from serial offender Kim Kardashian to the usually demure
Gwyneth Paltrow parading their assets in plunging everything.

'There's a
fine line between sexy and downright tacky so if you want to carry off a
dangerous neckline - and stay in favour with the fash pack - then remember to
keep everything else low-keyand simple. That means long hemlines, adding a sleek
cover-up like a blazer and keeping hair and make-up minimal.'
