Danger: Police had warned people not to approach Graham Barry Gibson (pictured). A 47-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder

Police who this morning launched a manhunt after a woman's body was discovered at a house in Middlesbrough have arrested a 47-year-old man on suspicion of murder.

Officers had urged the public not to approach Graham Barry Gibson, thought to be the former partner of the dead woman, whose identity has yet to be confirmed.

A force spokesman for Cleveland Police said a man was arrested in Middlesbrough town centre this afternoon.

A body was found in the Bramble's Farm area of the city following a domestic row at 
1am.

The scene remained heavily guarded by police today and a white forensics tent had been set up in the front yard of the brick-built terrace house.

One woman in a nearby property, who 
declined to be named, said: 'All I saw were lots of blue lights and this
morning they said someone had been murdered - a lass, I think.

'It’s a good estate - you don’t expect this.'

Another resident, who lives a few doors away, said: 'I was woken at about 4am and the police came round to talk to us.

'It’s just rumours flying round at 
the moment. This is a quiet road of the estate. It’s mainly older people
who live here. Everyone just keeps themselves to themselves.'

The terraced street, which overlooks 
the Middlesbrough to Redcar trunk road and forms part of one of 
Middlesbrough’s biggest council estates, was otherwise quiet this 
morning.

Several neighbours kept an eye on the scene from their doorsteps and crowds of youths gathered on bikes.

Probe: The body of the woman was found at a home in Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough at 1am after a domestic incident

Crime scene: Speaking before this afternoon's arrest, a force spokesman said Gibson was the prime suspect in connection with the death

Cleveland Police had described Gibson as around 6ft 2in tall with short dark brown hair.

Speaking before this afternoon's arrest, a force spokesman said Gibson was the prime suspect in connection with the death.

He said: 'Police believe this has been a targeted, domestic-related incident.
