The story of the Ashes has been the same for England from first to last and it followed a dismally familiar pattern for them on the first day of the last Test when they wasted a clear opportunity to bowl Australia out cheaply.

England backed up their promise to usher in a new era, with the Ashes long gone, by picking three debutants in the same match for the first time in seven years but they could not avert the same old script unfolding at the SCG.

When Australia had crashed to 97 for five after Alastair Cook had finally won a toss the door was open for England to force a consolation win and avoid the horrible spectre of a 5-0 Ashes humiliation against a less than great side.

Immovable object: Steve Smith was in fine form, reaching his century in Sydney

But with Brad Haddin, perhaps a more 
worthy man of the series than even Mitchell Johnson, again proving a 
formidable obstacle to England and Steve Smith scoring his third century
in six Tests the Australian recovery was close to complete as they 
hurried to 326 all out, with Ben Stokes taking six wickets.

But there was a horrible start to their innings when Michael Carberry was out for a duck, caught at leg-slip by Nathan Lyon off Mitchell Johnson, and England went in eight for one.

Not
since Alastair Cook, Monty Panesar and, lest we forget, Ian Blackwell 
made their debuts in Nagpur in 2006 have England fielded three debutants
in the same match and the results of two the trio were mixed to say the
least.

Gotcha: Jimmy Anderson's massive appeal pays off as Shane Watson is dismissed early on

Finally: Brad Haddin and Smith stopped the Australian rot with a robust partnership for Australia

England left out 
Panesar and Tim Bresnan, both of whose Test days may now be numbered, 
and more surprisingly Joe Root with, as expected, Gary Ballance, Scott 
Borthwick and Boyd Rankin coming in and taking England’s tally of 
players used here to a record 18 for an overseas series.

It
would be wrong to expect instant results from such inexperienced 
players but Rankin in particular had the debut of his worst nightmares 
while Borthwick, who turned into more of a batsman than leg-spinner for 
Durham last season, showed that he is far from the finished article as a
bowler.

No England player 
can match Simon Kerrigan’s introduction at The Oval last summer for pure
misery but Rankin, making his bow at the highest level at 29, came 
close by having to twice leave the field mid-over with hamstring 
trouble.

England had not 
trusted any of their three giant fast bowlers to play since Chris 
Tremlett’s less than auspicious performance in Brisbane but they gave 
the Irishman his chance despite concerns about his fragility in a 
five-day contest.

It was an 
understandable selection but what was a concern was the sight of Rankin 
in conversation with the England physio, doctor and team director Andy 
Flower in the nets ahead of the day’s play.

If there were genuine 
worries about his fitness before the game then Rankin should not have 
played here. It emerged afterwards that he had cramp and had not torn his hamstring as first feared

It did not seem
to matter when England had an excellent first session, taking four 
wickets, and when they added a fifth almost straight after lunch, but the
emergence of Haddin seemed to scramble the brains of the bowlers and 
rob them of all their discipline and control.

First
they started to bowl too short at the fiery wicketkeeper and then engaged him
in yet another verbal battle on which he has thrived throughout a 
series in which he has scored at least one half century in every Test.

It
was terrible cricket from England as they allowed Haddin and Smith, who
has answered all doubts about his ability as a Test No 5, to add 128 for
the sixth wicket at four an over and probably change the course of this
Test.

The long walk: Stokes pumps his fist as Michael Clarke makes his way back to the pavilion

Early on: Alastair Cook and Clarke read through their teams before the first ball is bowled

Not too shabby: Here's how Smith reached 115 in the Hawk-Eye wagon wheel

Calamity: Boyd Rankin's Test debut was cut short after the bowler picked up an injury

Heartbreak: Rankin cuts a dejected figure as the England medical staff give him a once over

A side can rarely 
have dominated a five-Test series to such an extent with such an average
top six as Australia and their limitations were in evidence again as 
David Warner’s footwork was horribly exposed, Chris Rogers was a bit 
unlucky to play on, Michael Clarke looked uncomfortable against pace and
Shane Watson became England’s first lbw victim of the series.

When
George Bailey, who has struggled in his first Test series, became 
Stuart Broad’s second wicket England were on top, as they have been so 
often on this tour with the ball in their hand. But Haddin, and then 
Smith, changed all that.

Stokes
has been a ray of light amid the gloom of this series and he too showed
that he has much to learn with the ball when he bowled inconsistently 
at times and gave away four no balls with his habit of knocking the 
bails with his hand in his delivery stride.

But,
with Rankin indisposed and Jimmy Anderson being sucked into bowling too
short at Haddin, England needed their rookie all-rounder to stand up 
and be counted. Stokes, scorer of a mature century in Perth, did not 
disappoint.

Stokes, who had 
induced that fatal pull from Rogers and had taken the key wicket of 
Clarke, added Haddin after he had made his sixth half-century in seven 
innings in this series before finishing the Australian innings with 
three wickets in an over.

The Durham man was even on a hat-trick when he
dismissed Peter Siddle first ball but quickly added Smith after Lyon had kept him out.

His 
team-mate at Durham, Borthwick, had claimed his first Test wicket in his
fifth over, recovering from an opening spell in which he conceded 21 
runs in three overs, when Johnson hit him straight up in the 
air.

It had been a shock 
when England dropped Root but the fact is he had become as shot as the 
bulk of the other England players in this series while they clearly 
wanted to have one last look at Carberry before consigning him 
to the list of players they will draw a line under following this 
series.

That look did not 
last long as Johnson, his rise from joke figure the last time England 
were here to formidable performer now complete, toyed with the opener 
before having him caught by Lyon before the close. Only a second 
innings century is likely to save the 33-year-old from the Test axe now.

Ian Bell had been 
promoted to No 3 for this match but the demise of Carberry led to the 
emergence of Anderson in a continuation of England’s questionable policy
of using nightwatchmen in such circumstances.  

At
least Anderson and Cook survived to the close but with Johnson’s tail 
up and this Sydney pitch still green England face yet another tough 
battle if they are going to get towards parity here. The prospect of 5-0
remains all too real.
