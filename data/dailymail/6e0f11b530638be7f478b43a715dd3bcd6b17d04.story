The mother of a missing prostitute killed by taxi driver Christopher Halliwell has written a letter to the jailed murderer, begging him to confess to ending her daughter’s life.

In an emotional plea to the father-of-two, Karen Edwards called on him to end her torment and 'tell the truth' over what happened to Rebecca Godden, who was last seen alive by her family a decade ago.

The then-20-year-old had turned to drugs and prostitution, and her remains were only found last year when Halliwell led police to her body.

The Wiltshire taxi driver confessed to killing her after admitting murdering 22-year-old Swindon office worker Sian O’Callaghan, ending a five-day missing person investigation.

But he escaped justice over the murder of Miss Godden because of a police blunder.

While there was considerable evidence against Halliwell for Miss O’Callaghan’s murder - including DNA and CCTV images linking him with her death - his confession to killing Miss Godden was all police had in presenting a case against him.

A High Court judge ruled that the confessions during a three-hour period on the day of his arrest were inadmissible 
because Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher breached police 
guidelines governing the interviewing of suspects.

The senior detective, who was leading the hunt for Miss O’Callaghan, failed to caution Halliwell, 48, and denied him a solicitor.

The ruling by Mrs Justice Cox meant that Wiltshire Police had no other 
evidence against Halliwell to link him to Miss Godden’s murder and the 
charge was withdrawn.

He has refused to admit anything since.

In a letter to Halliwell in jail, published in the Daily Mirror today, Mrs Edwards writes: 'My every waking moment is filled with the horrific thought of her terrifying, frightening moments as she suffered her death at your hands.

'The nightmare never ends. Please could you find it in your heart as a father to tell us the truth about my beautiful girl.

'I am begging you, please, admit Becky’s murder.'

Mrs Edwards broke down at Bristol Crown Court on Friday when Halliwell was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for murdering Miss O’Callaghan as she made her way home to her boyfriend, Kevin Reape, following a night out in Swindon with friends on Friday March 18 2011.

She sent a text message to Mr Reape in the early hours, just before setting off home, but never made it back.

Her body was found dumped down a steep bank in south Oxfordshire, while Miss Godden’s remains were recovered from a field in the Cotswolds.

Speaking outside the court, members of Miss O’Callaghan’s family praised the work of the police, including Mr Fulcher, for finding Miss O’Callaghan’s body 'so soon' and sparing them further anxious days waiting for news.

Mr Fulcher is currently suspended from the police because of allegations of 'inappropriate contact with the media'.

Today, Mrs Edwards called on David Cameron to help save the career of the man who assisted in finding her daughter’s body.

In a plea to the Prime Minister, also published in the Daily Mirror, she said: 'There should be more policemen like Steve Fulcher. The world would be a better place and the streets safer.'
