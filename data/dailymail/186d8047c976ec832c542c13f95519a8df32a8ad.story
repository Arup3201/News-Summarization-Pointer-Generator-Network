The new Greek government has picked its first fight with the European Union, delaying agreement on further EU sanctions against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.

The move raised European and Nato fears that Moscow might seek to exploit the extremist coalition under Alexis Tsipras as a Trojan horse within the key western alliances.

An emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers was convened in Brussels to respond to the upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine, notably last week's shelling of the town of Mariupol by pro-Russian secessionists which left 30 civilians dead and 100 wounded.

Last night the ministers agreed to prolong the blacklisting of pro-Russian separatist leaders from March until September, to add new names to the blacklist by next week, and asked the European commission to look into broadening the economic and financial sanctions against Russia imposed last July.

Although it was originally feared that the Greeks would veto the sanctions, their ambassador merely prolonged the blacklisting by refusing to agree to the key passage on sanctions, until his minister arrived in Brussels.

'One delegation has a general reserve on the text,' the ambassadors stated in the final draft of the document.

Although several other countries are lukewarm about renewing or extending sanctions against Moscow or the Russian separatists, diplomats said there were no other dissenters on the statement, which squarely held Russia to blame for facilitating the Mariupol attack.

The meeting 'notes evidence of continued and growing support given to the separatists by Russia, which underlines Russia's responsibility,' the statement said.

While falling short of proposing new sanctions on Russia, the statement told the European commission to prepare new 'appropriate action'. 

Diplomats said that meant broader financial and economic penalties against Moscow than those imposed last July and which need to be renewed by this July. Britain is pushing for stronger sanctions against Moscow.

Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister, said Greece wanted to 'prevent a rift' between Russia and the EU, although both sides have been in acute conflict for the past 10 months over Moscow's assault on Ukraine.

Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy coordinator chairing the meeting, said the decision to augment the sanctions was unanimous. She said Kotzias was 'taking his own position which was changing in the days'.
