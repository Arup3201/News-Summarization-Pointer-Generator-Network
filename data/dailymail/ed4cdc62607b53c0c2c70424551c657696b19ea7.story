Covers lay like palls over the rest of  Wimbledon’s courts. People huddled their strawberries under umbrellas and their dresses under ponchos.

But below the roof of Centre Court came a performance from Novak Djokovic as brilliant as a true summer’s day.

The scene was perfect. The lights shone down as they might on a boxing ring. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lent his own air of authenticity to the analogy, for he is the Muhammad Ali of tennis, at least in terms of appearance.

But he could barely lay a glove, or 
racket string, on the Serb, who efficiently and relentlessly put down 
his marker as the champion in waiting.

So one-sided was the contest 
that from early on Tsonga’s every winning point was cheered loudly. Not 
only because he is a firm favourite of the crowd for his all-action, 
all-heart style, but because he was in grave danger of humiliation, and 
the worst sentiment a sportsman can experience — pity — was being 
lavished upon him.

Those fears were hardly misplaced. The match was over in a trice. The rules allowed play to have gone on until 11pm, but that never looked likely from the moment the first set was concluded in just 25 lopsided minutes, Djokovic having taken a stranglehold on proceedings by breaking Tsonga to go 5-2 ahead.

At that point the people in the Royal Box were still reconvening in their seats, having taken a comfort break following Andy Murray’s similarly brisk victory on the same rectangle of covered grass.

The second set followed a similar pattern. Djokovic broke his opponent in the seventh game and went on to close it out with near-immaculate precision. Tsonga’s resistance in saving three set points was merely a stay of execution.

Of course, Tsonga is a battler. His engine is nearly inexhaustible — he played 509 minutes en route to this fourth-round match. And his greatest scalp ever, victory over Roger Federer here in 2011, came from two sets down. Was a repeat even remotely possible?

There was a moment in the third when it looked as if it might, just might, be. The crowd’s cheers were at Tsonga’s back in the eighth game. He led 4-3 and had two break points. But Djokovic was calm calculation personified.

He held his nerve and his service game before letting out a loud raw of emotion in delight. Tsonga, though, fought back. He won the next game to love to go 5-4 ahead. Emotion was pumping right through him.

He was holding nothing back. Every ball was hit with all the power his big, Ali-frame could muster. He went on to lead 6-5. The rallies were short bordering on non-existent.

With the clock ticking towards 9pm, the set went into a tiebreak, such an arm wrestle of serving  mastery. Finally on match point, Djokovic returned a backhand winner so close to the line it was called out.

He celebrated in a star-shaped stance of impregnability, his head nodding in satisfaction. Realising the point had been given against him, he challenged it and was vindicated. Game, set and destruction.

All this precision was remarkable considering in what state we last saw Djokovic. He hit his left shoulder on the baseline grass in the previous round, fearing his involvement in the tournament might come to the least satisfactory of early conclusions.

But he showed not the least flicker of pain until he clutched it in the tiebreak, but, as last Friday, it did nothing to stop his progression.

Perhaps we should have expected such a one-sided encounter.  Djokovic was on a 10-match winning streak against the Frenchman, who had not taken a set from him in two years.

In another statement of  consistency, Djokovic was gunning for his 21st straight Grand Slam quarter-final and his sixth consecutively at Wimbledon.

But Tsonga played his part. The standard of his game was hardly poor, and at times outstandingly strong. But Djokovic was like a machine, every point devised with computer-like precision and the emotional detachment of a factory machine. It is a form of genius.
