A New Jersey teacher has been arrested after she allegedly engaged in a sexual relationship with one of her students. 

Nicole McDonough, 32, of Mount Olive, New Jersey, was arrested on a charge or second-degree charge of official misconduct and placed on immediate paid leave this week after being accused of having a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old in May and June of this year.

The student attended West Morris Mendham High School, where McDonough, a married mother of two, works as an English teacher.

Details of the alleged incidents, as well as the sex of the student, have not been released at this time.

According to NJ.com, McDonough 'teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses at the high school' and 'holds a bachelor's degree in English Literature from the College of St. Elizabeth.'

Describing herself on the school's website she writes; 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter. I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.'

She closes by saying; 'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!'

Though the student in question is not a minor, authorities have yet to release their name.
