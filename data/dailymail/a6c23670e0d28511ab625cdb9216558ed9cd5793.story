Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has promised to stop annoying customers and bring an end to its ‘macho’ culture.

Speaking at the budget airline’s annual meeting with shareholders in Dublin the combative chief executive responded to concerns that issues with customer service were dragging down sales.

He said the airline must improve how it treats passengers and handles complaints.

Humbled: Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, left, was forced to apologise for his company's actions after staff charged grieving Muhammad Taufiq Sattar £160 to change his ticket home after his family died in a fire

Yesterday it emerged Mr O'Leary was forced
into a humiliating apology after a grieving father desperate to fly 
back to the UK after his family died in a suspected arson attack was 
charged to transfer his return ticket.

Surgeon Muhammad Taufiq Sattar had to 
pay nearly £160 to change his regular evening Ryanair flight from Dublin
to the UK to an earlier one moments after he was told it was likely his
family were dead.

‘I don’t want to make a big deal about it but it did shock me. I really did not expect them to charge me,' said Dr Sattar. ‘I thought, given the circumstances, they might just let me transfer flights, as I had already paid for a return fare.’

Mr O'Leary, facing questions about why he appeared to go out of his way to be rude and dismissive of criticism, told shareholders: ‘We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily p*** people off.’

Speaking about common gripes, such as charges for hand luggage that exceeds size limits by a fraction, he said: ‘A lot of those customer service elements don’t cost a lot of money’.

Mr O’Leary said it would review its inflexible enforcement rules on luggage and hefty charges for customers who forget to print out their own boarding passes.

He revealed plans to improve the airline’s website and create a communications unit that responds more quickly to customer complaints using Twitter and texts.

‘I am very happy to take the blame or responsibility if we have a macho or abrupt culture,’ he said.

‘Some of that may well be my own character deformities.’ 

The customer is always wrong... Earlier this week Ryanair was voted as having the worst customer service out of Britain's hundred biggest brands in a league table compiled by consumer champion Which?

The signal of a change in culture comes after a string of bad headlines for the budget airline.

Earlier
this week Ryanair was voted as having the worst customer service out of
Britain's hundred biggest brands in a league table compiled by consumer
champion Which?

That's an 
assessment that can be corroborated by Dr Sattar, who was forced to 
stump up the price of a new flight to get back to the UK after his wife 
and children were burned to death in their home in Leicester the Friday 
before last.

Arriving in Dublin Airport at around 
5.30am, moments after Leicester Police had confirmed by phone that no 
member of his family had managed to escape, Dr Sattar approached the 
Ryanair check-in desk to see if he could change his ticket.

Distraught, and with tears streaming down his face, he explained why he had to change his flight, but he was told he would have to buy a new ticket.

The stunned neurosurgeon produced his credit card and was promptly charged €187.46 - approximately £158 - for a one-way ticket to Birmingham.

Mr O’Leary confirmed a letter of condolence had been sent to Dr Al Sattar, along with a an apology for the way the budget airline had handled the situation.

'I think you have to make exceptions in cases like that and we made an exception last night when we became aware of it,' Mr O’Leary said.

'We want to respond sensitively to these cases.'

Mr O’Leary added Dr Al Sattar had been refunded the extra charge and said that the booking change was handled according to the airline’s policy, which staff are told to implement without exception or variation.

Earlier this Ryanair warned annual profits may miss or be at the lower end of its range of €570million to €600million.

It also revealed there had been a drop in ticket prices and booking levels for September, October and November.
