A small group of Manchester United fans had the perfect end to their weekend by meeting Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Marcos Rojo.

The trio all starred in Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 win against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday afternoon, with Falcao and Rojo both making their debuts after sealing summer moves to Old Trafford.

Rojo, who joined Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon after a successful World Cup campaign with Argentina, was pictured with three football fans shortly after his impressive first Premier League appearance.

Strikers Falcao and Van Persie also met a lucky fan during a night out on the back of Louis van Gaal's first competitive win since taking up the reins at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal's former assistant manager Patrick Kluivert, who was at Old Trafford to provide analysis on the game for Sky, was also included in a fan's picture with Van Persie and Falcao.

Rojo and Falcao's fellow Old Trafford debutant Angel di Maria stole the show by scoring Manchester United's opener and playing a part in his side's three other goals, however Van Gaal will be pleased with the performance of all of his summer acquisitions.
