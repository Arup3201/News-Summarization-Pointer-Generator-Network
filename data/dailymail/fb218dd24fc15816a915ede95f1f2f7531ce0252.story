A 26-year-old man has become the second Australian wingsuit diver to die in Europe in a month after smashing in to a moutainside during a jump in the Swiss Alps.

Friends said Alex Duncan, from Manly on Sydney's northern beaches, died doing what he loved most after jumping off a cliff on Tuesday.

A member of the World Wingsuit League Facebook page confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Duncan died after a flight failed when he went off track during his jump, hitting the rocks of a mountain 300 metres below the peak.

The group has posted a tribute to the Sydney man on Thursday morning: 'We are sorry to learn about the tragic death of wingsuit pilot Alex Duncan. Just recently, Alex had entered the international wingsuit scene by publishing videos featuring his hard-core proximity flying. Today he is gone ... our condolences to family and friends of Alex.'

The Australian Base Association president Gary Cunningham told Daily Mail Australia that Duncan's death was 'terrible news' and he didn't know 'what went wrong' surrounding his accident

Duncan was reportedly killed in the rugged region of Valais after jumping from near the summit of the 2243 metre Croix de Fer peak in Switzerland with another diver.

The Australian Base Association, which represents wingsuit divers, says the sport is in some ways safer than base jumping, which involves jumping from heights with a parachute.

President Gary Cunningham told Daily Mail Australia that Duncan's death was 'terrible news' and he didn't know 'what went wrong' surrounding his accident.

'In his 5 years of BASE jumping I believe he had completed over 550 BASE jumps. In the last couple of years he had really started to excel with his jumping,' Mr Cunningham said.

'In theory, wingsuiting can make jumping safer, because it allows you to fly well away from the cliff.

'But what they're using wingsuits for now is to follow the contour of the terrain down a mountain, they're getting very close and leaving finer margins for error ... some people miscalculate.'

Duncan described himself on Facebook as a 'professional Skydiver and BASE jumper with a passion for adventure and flying' and also has personal interest in diving, skateboarding, snowboarding'.

The wingsuit pilot went off track immediately after his jump, hitting a rock face 300 metres below the peak

Duncan is from Manly on Sydney's northern beaches and in his most recent video post on August 30 he revealed his passion for the sport.Â  'One of the coolest jumps I've done this season. Flying high over the clouds with Tancrede the Flying Frenchy'.

Tributes are flowing in on social media, with people paying their respects:

'Now your sky is unlimited. RIP Alex'

'Was nice to know you mate. Fly Free brother'

'May he fly forever now and free with all the others that have passed away before him'

'Fly Free Alex! Can't believe that...'

The Swiss Alps are a magnet for wingsuit divers, who wear special jumpsuits that add surface area to the body, enabling them to glide like a bird, before opening a parachute like a regular skydiver.

About 20 people are killed each year taking part in the extreme sport.

On August 18, two base jumpers, including an Australian died in separate accidents in the French Alps.

British wingsuit diver and stuntman Mark Sutton - best known for parachuting into the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony dressed as James Bond - died in August 2013 when he crashed into a Swiss mountain ridge after jumping from a helicopter.

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the family of the deceased man.

Duncan was believed to be using the wingsuit as part of an international competition for base jumpers
