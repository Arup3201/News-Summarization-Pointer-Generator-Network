Danny Welbeck may not have left Old Trafford with much goodwill on Monday night but the Arsenal striker was given a warm reception as he arrived for the FA Cup clash with Manchester United. 

Welbeck scored the winning goal as Arsene Wenger's side knocked their hosts out of the FA Cup and advanced to the semi-final.

The FA, though, have since released footage of scenes that weren't quite so well publicised on the night.

Welbeck was greeted with plenty of handshakes from United staff and coaches, and even received a kiss on arrival.

Sportsmail's Martin Keown shared a joke with former team-mate and current assistant at Arsenal Steve Bould while Wenger chatted to Peter Schmeichel and his son Kasper. 

At half-time Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez were engaged in discussions about tactics while United's players looked glum.

Their mood didn't brighten after the final whistle, either, as the Arsenal players congratulated each other on the way back to the dressing room.
