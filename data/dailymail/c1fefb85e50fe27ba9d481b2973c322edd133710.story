You definitely wouldn’t want to drink it all in one go... the world’s strongest beer has been named as a British one which is nearly 70 per cent proof.

Lab tests have confirmed the super strength of Brewmeister’s Snake Venom, which is made in Keith, Scotland, and has an alcohol content of 68 per cent.

The beer even carries a warning sign. It is produced using two different yeast strains – ale and champagne – and freeze-concentrated to secure its alcohol content.

Lewis Shand of Brewmeister said: ‘Snake Venom is not like other beers in that we would not recommend drinking a whole bottle in one go. It should be savoured in small measures in a similar way to a fine whisky or brandy. 

We are delighted that Trading Standards has confirmed that Snake Venom is the world’s strongest beer.

‘The idea with Snake Venom was to produce something which still tastes like beer, not masked by a harsh alcohol flavour.’

The beer is sold through the company’s website... for £50 a bottle.

Unique: The company say it is not like other beers, as it is not recommended to drink a whole bottle in one go
