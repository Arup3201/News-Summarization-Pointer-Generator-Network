Andrew Lloyd-Webber said he requested the forms to join assisted suicide
 clinic Dignitas after 14 painful back and leg 
operations

Lord Lloyd-Webber took steps to join assisted suicide clinic Dignitas, he revealed last night.

The West End composer was so convinced he wanted to die last summer that he requested forms for the the Swiss clinic.

He said a bout of deep depression, triggered by the pain from a series of operations, caused him to consider suicide.

But the 66-year-old, who previously suffered with prostate cancer, said he now felt it would have been a ‘stupid and ridiculous’ thing to do.

The peer is likely to oppose the bill to legalise ‘assisted dying’ tabled by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor, which will be debated today.

Lord Lloyd-Webber, who said he struggled with the pain after 14 back and leg operations, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I went through a moment of deep depression – that awful moment when you think that you must find a way out.

‘I actually got the forms for Dignitas. With hindsight, it was stupid and ridiculous, but I couldn’t think what to do.’

He said as his symptoms alleviated he decided to throw the forms away and expects to oppose the bill but remains torn on the issue.

He continued: ‘What concerns me, and I suspect many others, is what floodgates would [this measure] open?

The 66-year-old said his mother had expressed a wish to end her life five years before she died, aged 72, but was not ready to die - something he fears would become common if the law is approved

‘Does it create a culture where older people are a burden ... I am totally unsure.’

Nearly 130 peers have signed up to speak in a 10-hour debate, which will begin the biggest ever challenge to Britain’s euthanasia laws.

Under the bill, doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to patients in England and Wales with less than six moths to live.

Two doctors would have to confirm that the patient had the capacity to make an informed decision to die. One of the two doctors would then provide the drugs with which the patient would end their life.

Lord Lloyd-Webber also told the paper that he believed his mother Jean Lloyd Webber, a distinguished piano teacher, would have chosen to end her life had the law been in place while she was alive.

He said that she expressed a wish to end her life, five years before she died peacefully in December 1993, aged 72.

But Lord Lloyd-Webber believes his mother - who cycled and walked until her death - was not ready to die.

He said he fears that 'in the future, someone like her could be assisted to die', before they are ready. 

Dominic Grieve, former Attorney General, said the assisted dying bill is flawed and said it could lead to 'a form of legalised execution'

He told the paper: 'She kept saying she couldn't continue any more because she was a burden on us.

'We
 told her she was anything but... In the state she was in, I fear that a
 couple of doctors would have concluded that, if she wished to kill 
herself, they would agree.'

The composer's brief consideration to join Dignitas came after he underwent a procedure to ease a pain he developed in his leg, around two years ago.

That, and a back operation, led to the composer having 14 operations, which propelled him into a state of depression. 

He said he would approach the debate 
with an open mind and listen to the arguments, but would also think 
about his mother and 'reflect on personal experience'.

'With hindsight, it was stupid and ridiculous, but I couldn’t think what to do'

Lord Lloyd-Webber

Dominic Grieve, who was the Government’s chief law officer until the cabinet reshuffle this week, said the proposals could open the door to a form of ‘legalised execution’.

The former Attorney General, said: ‘I think that the assisted dying bill is flawed and seeking to do something that could lead to a form of legalised execution, however well intended.

‘It is not something that a civilised society should do.’

Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, also said he believed the proposals would 'devalue' the lives of people living with disabilities.

This week, a group of 27 leading doctors urged the House of Lords to support the bill, saying terminally ill people suffering ‘unendurably’ should be allowed to end their lives.

It came as leaders from Britain's major faiths - the Church of England, the Catholic Church and the Jewish faith - put their names to a joint letter which pleaded with Parliament not to legalise assisted dying.

The letter, signed by 23 leaders, including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said it would be a 'grave error' which could change society forever.
