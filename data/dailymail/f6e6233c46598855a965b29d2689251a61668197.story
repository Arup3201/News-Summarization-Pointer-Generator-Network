A millionaire footballer was arrested yesterday along with his cousin and a friend amid claims they were involved in a champagne-fuelled gang rape.

Loic Remy, a 26-year-old French international striker who earns £80,000 a week playing for Queens Park Rangers, was held by Scotland Yard's sex crime squad with the other men.

Yesterday it emerged that the alleged victim was a 34-year-old woman who claimed the trio raped her on May 6, Bank Holiday Monday, in a £2million flat in Fulham, West London.

After the alleged assault, it is 
understood the woman travelled to Kent where she reported the attack to 
police the following day. They in turn passed on the details to the 
Metropolitan force on May 8.

It is claimed the woman visited 
Remy's rented home at Marina Point, Imperial Wharf. The plush £2million 
three-bedroom flat is owned by Pippa Lister – nicknamed Miss Network – 
who is president of the Synergy Matchmaking business.

Remy, who has denied the claims, is believed to be paying £6,000 a month to stay in the fourth-floor flat after moving to London from France in January.

The alleged victim was said to have been offered champagne once she was inside the flat.

A friend of the alleged victim – who 
works in a 'skilled profession' – said yesterday she was left extremely 
upset by her ordeal.

She said: 'The two of them had been 
in touch for some time. They met a couple of months ago. He has been 
keeping in touch with her by phone and text since then.

'She confided in a friend who 
encouraged her to make a complaint to police. They interviewed her 
earlier this week and arrested him this morning. They have taken 
evidence from his flat.'

Two uniformed officers with the Met Police answered the door of his fourth-floor apartment yesterday.

One said: 'This is a crime scene. We are waiting for the forensics team to get here. Mr Remy is not here.'

Neighbours spoke of their shock at 
the arrest, with one saying: 'I sometimes see him at the gym or going to
training. He seems like a cool guy from what I can tell.'

A spokesman for the Met Police said: 
'Officers are investigating an allegation of rape which happened on May 6
in the West London area.

The victim alleges she was raped by 
three men. Three men, aged 26, 23 and 22, were arrested at an address in
Fulham on suspicion of rape – they remain in custody at a West London 
police station.'

Remy joined QPR in January for a 
club-record fee of £8million from Marseille. He has scored six goals but
could not stop the team from being relegated from the Premier League. 
He has 18 caps for France.

Remy is also facing a legal battle in
France over a paternity suit brought by a former girlfriend. The 
striker is said to have fathered a boy called Adrian – who is now 18 
months old – with 26-year-old  Toulouse student Valentine Mini.

Lawyers in Marseille have issued a summons calling for Remy to admit that he is the father.
'This is not a sordid financial affair,' said Laurie Delclos, Miss Mini's lawyer.

French striker: Remy joined the west London club in January for £8million from Marseille but was unable to help them avoid relegation from the Premier League, and is expected to leave this summer

'It is not a question of money, and it never will be – just a quest by a young mother who insists that her son has a father.'

Remy insists another player is 
Adrian's father. Earlier this year his spokesman said: 'Loic does not 
deny having had a relationship with the young woman. He simply says that
he was not alone.'

Remy is the product of a broken home 
and was born in Lyon, where he was brought up on a tough council estate.
As a child his hero was Arsenal star Thierry Henry and he was 
encouraged to become a footballer by a neighbour after his father left 
the family home.

Remy is expected to leave QPR in the 
summer with top-flight clubs such as Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and 
Liverpool reported to be interested in signing him.

A QPR spokesman said last night: 'The
club is aware of the allegations regarding Loic Remy, but due to police
investigations is unable to comment.'  

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
