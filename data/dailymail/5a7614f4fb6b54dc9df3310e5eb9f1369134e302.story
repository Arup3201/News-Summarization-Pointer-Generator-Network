It’s a question Jose Mourinho is asked after every match: ‘Can your side match Arsenal’s invincibles?’

He doesn’t want to. That would mean drawing a further 10 Premier League matches and getting knocked out of the Champions League quarter-finals.

Arsenal’s 2003-04 side is legendary. Undoubtedly Arsene Wenger’s greatest achievement, one of the most fondly-remembered teams in history won the title in emphatic fashion without losing a game.

Chelsea have made a stellar start this season, sitting top of the league and are unbeaten in all competitions

Blues boss Jose Mourinho has guided Chelsea to an an average of 2.64 points per game this term

It had only ever been achieved before once – by Preston North End in 1888-89.

Quite rightly, Wenger’s team were hailed from all corners, christened ‘the Invincibles’ and became the benchmark against which all great sides in the future were judged.

Now, 11 years on, Wenger and Arsenal are one of a host of big sides with a season on the verge of crumbling, huge questions being asked of the manager, the players and the club’s hierarchy.

The only question being asked of runaway league leaders Chelsea, it seems, is whether they can match Thierry Henry and Co’s incredible feat.

But will it matter to Mourinho? While he’s always been a fan of getting one over Wenger – either on the pitch or in the press room – matching that Arsenal side’s points total would mean a huge downturn in form at this point.

The unspoken fact on the Gunners’ incredible season is they drew 12 games, winning 26. Only one title winner has won fewer games since then – Manchester United with 23 in 2011.

Arsenal could have lost seven and won just four of those 12 matches and finished on a higher points total. Their eventual tally of 90 would not have been enough to win the title in the next two seasons.

Chelsea currently have 29 points from 11 games – an average of 2.64 points per game. Keeping this up for an entire season would see them finish on 100.

(4-4-2) Thibaut Courtois; Branislav Ivanovic, Sol Campbell, John Terry, Ashley Cole; Robert Pires, Cesc Fabregas, Patrick Vieira, Eden Hazard; Diego Costa, Thierry Henry.

Mourinho’s side have drawn two matches so far – at the homes of both Manchester clubs.

With 27 games to play, having already been to Old Trafford, the Etihad, Anfield and Goodison Park, sharing points a further 10 times would hardly put a smile on Mourinho’s face.

The business Chelsea did in the summer set them up for this blistering start. Mourinho identified key weaknesses in last season’s side and sealed moves for Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa early.

Those two in particular, along with the league’s best defence and others such as Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic have formed the core of a side among the best and seemingly most consistent in Europe.

Mourinho is also used to fighting on different fronts. While the mental strength involved in going a domestic campaign hasn’t been matched, Arsenal had already lost two Champions League matches – to Inter and Dynamo Kiev – by this point. Chelsea remain unbeaten in all competitions.

The feat of being unbeaten consumed Wenger and his side – they drew five of their last 10 games against the likes of Portsmouth, Birmingham and a Spurs side that finished in 14th.

That run-in was mostly without the distraction of Champions League football.

Having been drawn in the quarter-finals against a newly-rich Chelsea side under Claudio Ranieri, Arsenal faltered and were beaten at home in the second leg thanks to a Wayne Bridge goal.

The Blues’ side, lopsided as it may have been and under an inferior manager, showed greater steel to clinch the tie over two legs.

The competition that year was there for the taking. The semi-finalists were the inconsistent Chelsea, Monaco, Deportivo La Coruna and a Porto side managed by a certain Jose Mourinho.

While it seemed Mourinho was destined for that particular honour and Ranieri’s tinkering put paid to Chelsea’s hopes, Arsenal’s team was far more talented than any of those semi-finalists.

Mourinho has been in the Champions League semi-final for the last five years. A quarter-final exit with the talent he has at his disposal this time around would represent failure.

Arsenal’s legendary team reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions is to be commended, although they fell in the League Cup against Middlesbrough.

When Mourinho insists his side won’t go unbeaten in the league, he could well be right.

He will be demanding to be challenging in all competitions until the send of the season, and difficult matches in quick succession against teams fighting for their lives breeds occasional slip-ups.

He will be livid, though, to draw another 10 Premier League matches and exit the Champions League at the quarter-finals.

That Arsenal side deserve their gold Premier League trophy, and their place in the pantheon of great teams. But it will be no black mark over this Chelsea team if they don’t go unbeaten.

They could very easily have an even better season.
