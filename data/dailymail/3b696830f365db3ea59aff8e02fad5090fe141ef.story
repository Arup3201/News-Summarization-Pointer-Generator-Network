A 16-year-old schoolgirl who is accused of her mother's murder was allegedly helped by her female lover.

The daughter of Mary Ann Murphy, 48, is accused of taking part in the stabbing of her mother on July 16.

Now Rebecca Renee Keller, 20, from Houston, Texas has also been charged with murder and court records claim she had a sexual encounter with the daughter around the time of the slaying.

Keller has also been charged with the sexual assault of a child. 

A friend of the daughter, Zein Imran Ahmed, 21, has also been charged with the murder at Mrs Murphy's home in the 8300 block of Poplar Ridge Lane, according to my fox houston.

While her mother was being murdered, her daughter ran into a neighbor's home and told them that someone was attacking her mother.

'She said her mom was screaming loud, and I did think I heard a scream but I didn't know for sure,' Marcus Cox, the neighbor, said that morning. 'I just thought it was some kids down the street.'

When police first went to the home of Murphy, her daughter said that two men had forced their way into the home when they were in bed and murdered her mother before fleeing the scene.

It was just days before detectives realized it was a fabricated story and arrested the 48-year-old's daughter and Ahmed, after the knife used in the brutal stabbing was found at his home just blocks away.

Prosecutors said Ahmed admitted slipping into Murphy's bedroom with her daughter's permission. He allegedly got on top of the woman and began stabbing her when she woke up.

'I’ve got testimony and video,' Don Hecker, Ahmed’s attorney told HCSO. 'I’ve got a lot of stuff and he’s just not guilty.

'It is either the desire of the girl to cover her tracks or to keep someone that she knows from being blamed,' he said.

The investigation continued after Ahmed and the teen were taken into custody and led to Monday's arrest of Keller.

Murphy's daughter was then placed in the custody of the Harris County Juvenile Probation Office.A motive for the murder is not yet clear.
