Louis van Gaal gave a prickly reaction to questions about his relationship with Dutch compatriot Ronald Koeman ahead of Manchester United's trip to Southampton on Monday.

The two men have barely spoken since Van Gaal left his job as Ajax's director of football 10 years ago claiming that he had been undermined by Koeman who was coach at the time.

Van Gaal was reluctant to talk about Koeman on Friday and was grudging in his praise of what the new Southampton boss has achieved at St Mary's this season, guiding his team to third place – one above United – after losing a number of key players in the summer.

'I don't have to describe my relationship with the trainer of the opponent,' said Van Gaal. 'We play against Southampton and we have to speak about them and not the trainer-coach.

'I've read that (how many players Southampton lost) but do you know how many players we lost? I've never read that in the media. We have lost more players.

'Ronald Koeman is a very good coach and I know that he can do that but it's also surprising me that a club like Southampton is in that position but that is always a matter of coach, players and staff. When you do that, it's very good.

'Southampton are able to come in the first four but that's also because I believe in the management of Ronald Koeman and his brother. When the cohesion is good he can manage.' 

Asked about United having to pay more for players than Southampton, Van Gaal added: 'I don't think money is the question. When Manchester United are coming, clubs ask for more money and then we have to pay because we're Manchester United.

'Do you think Southampton paid so much for the players? No I don't think so because they are Southampton and not Manchester United.

'There is always a relationship between Real Madrid and Manchester United and teams like Aston Villa and Southampton.'

Van Gaal signed Luke Shaw from Saints last summer and were also linked with a move for Adam Lallana, who eventually joined Liverpool in a £25million deal.

'They have a very good squad,' said the Dutchman. 'I know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us.'
