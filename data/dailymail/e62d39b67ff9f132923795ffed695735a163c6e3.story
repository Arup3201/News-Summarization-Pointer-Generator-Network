An Indian schoolbook is teaching Year 8 students that Japan dropped a nuclear bomb on the U.S. and that Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated nine months after his death.

The Social Science textbook used in Gujarat state is said to have more than 150 factual, grammar and spelling mistakes.

Other mistakes include placing Pakistan’s capital in the Hindu Kush Mountains and confusing carbon dioxide with CO3.

Bad teacher: The mistakes in the Social Science textbook used in Gujarat state include placing Pakistan's capital in the Hindu Kush Mountains and confusing carbon dioxide with CO3

The Social Science English medium textbook for Standard 8 published by the Gujarat Council of Educational Research and Training (GCERT) has come under severe criticism, and it is not exactly uncalled for.

The 124-page book has 59 factual errors and more than 100 spelling mistakes, according to the Times of India.

Among a long list of errors, the schoolchildren of Gujarat, a state which borders Pakistan, are taught that the Muslim country which won independence in 1947 was called ‘Islamic Islamabad’.

It also states that the capital of Pakistan, or ‘Islamic Islamabad’, is located in the Khyber pass in the Hindu Kush mountain range on the border to Afghanistan.

False claims: The textbook for Year 8 claims that Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in October 1948, instead of the true date of his death, 30th January that year

Just wrong: According to the textbook 'Japan dropped a nuclear bomb on the U.S. during World War II'

The book, which allegedly is being used by more than 50,000 children, also claims that ‘the proportion of poisonous gas CO3 has increased due to cutting of trees,’ NDTV.com reports.

Other statements include ‘Japan dropped a nuclear bomb on the U.S. during World War II,’ and ‘Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on October 30, 1948.’

Gandhi was in fact murdered by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948.

‘I have been told that there are many errors. We are trying to bring out an errors list and publish it on the internet,’ executive president of Gujarat state board of school textbooks, Nitin Pethani told Times of India.

‘We cannot recall the books at this stage. But we give an assurance that we will correct the mistakes.’
