One in ten pensioners is staying in bed longer to keep warm because of rising fuel bills, a poll reveals.

As the thermometer plummets this winter, one in eight also said they planned to stop using some parts of their home to save money.

And 64 per cent said they were having to wear extra layers of clothing as a result of rising energy costs.

Worry: One in ten over-50s admitted that they stay in bed longer to keep warm

One in five was even planning to cut back on other spending so they could afford to heat their homes.

More than 12,000 people over the age of 50, including almost 8,000 retirees, answered the online survey commissioned by Saga. It comes as  the so-called Big Six firms that dominate the energy supply market announced above-inflation price rises.

More than two-fifths told the survey they would struggle with energy bills this winter, with an overwhelming majority - 84 per cent - expressing concern about the rising cost of fuel.

Paul Green of Saga said: ‘For some, the fear could mean they won’t turn their heating on, and in so doing, risk their own health and welfare.’

He called for cuts to green levies, more pressure on energy companies for fairer pricing and the development of new fuel sources linked to lowering bills. Jane Vass, of the charity Age UK, said high energy prices combined with poorly insulated homes were major factors behind excess winter deaths.

Pledge: Ed Miliband has promised to freeze energy bills if he wins the next general election

‘Those living in the coldest homes are three times more likely to die a preventable death than those living in warmer ones,’ she added.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the 2015 general election, although Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg dismissed the plan as a ‘con’.

Labour public health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘This survey shows the desperate lengths older people are going to in order to keep warm in David Cameron’s Britain.’

However, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the Government had a range of schemes to help cut bills and make homes more energy efficient.

A spokesman said the Warm Home Discount will help two million British households this year – with more than one million vulnerable pensioners on low incomes receiving £135 off their bill.

A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents the Big Six suppliers, added: ‘No one should have to resort to staying in bed longer or only using parts of their home to keep warm, your energy company wants to help, you just need to get in touch.’
