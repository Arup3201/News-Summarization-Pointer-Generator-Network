Sony may have come under fire for editing certain scenes from The Interview, but it seems a few of the more controversial images might just have slipped through the net.

The millions of viewers who have already download the movie will have been treated to scenes showing James Franco cavorting with topless dancers and two girls kissing - scenes which are unlikely to impress North Korea's infamously uptight leader. 

Kim Jong-Un  has made no secret of its fury over the movie, and the FBI has continued to insist that North Korea is behind a cyber-attack on Sony, in which thousands of damaging documents were leaked.

An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse suggested that the hack may have been an inside job carried out by disgruntled ex-Sony employees - but the FBI has dismissed the theory, claiming there is not enough evidence to stand it up.

According to Politico, an official claimed the evidence put forward by Norse was 'narrow' and not an accurate analysis of the information. 

Last week, it was revealed that Sony removed a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un and television presenter Dave Skylark.

But it seems that the racy scenes depicting lesbian kisses and half-naked North Korean women dancing did indeed make the cut.

The movie, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' the feared dictator, has been a continuous source of tension between the U.S. and North Korea.

Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate'. It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. 

Then a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace  launched a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents.

But the attention brought to the movie over the hack and its initial cancellation by Sony, drove traffic to independent movie theaters and online when the company changed their mind and decided to release it on Christmas Eve. On opening day, the movie grossed $1million. 

Among the documents leaked in the hack was a version of the film's script including scenes which did not appear in the film released online and in movie theaters.

Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'.

A South Korean activist will launch balloons carrying DVDs of Sony's 'The Interview' towards North Korea to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator Kim Jong-un.

Activist Park Sang-hak said he will start dropping 100,000 DVDs and USBs with the movie by balloon in North Korea as early as late January. Mr Park, a North Korean defector, said he is partnering with the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation, which is financing the making of the DVDs and USB memory sticks of the movie with Korean subtitles.

Mr Park said foundation officials plan to visit South Korea around Jan. 20 to hand over the DVDs and USBs, and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow.

'North Korea's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolization of leader Kim breaks down,' Mr Park said.

Details edited from the film include North Korean military insignia, which was originally visible on soldiers' uniforms in the film, and a conversation between Rogen and Franco about Kim Jong-un's sexual abilities. 

Over the weekend, the North Korean regime spewed racial slurs at President Obama as they blamed him for the movie's release. President Obama encouraged Sony to release the film in defense of free speech.

'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' a spokesman for North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement.

President Obama has promised retaliation for the hack against Sony, but it's still unclear what punishment will entail. 

Last week, it was revealed that Sony removed of a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un and television presenter Dave Skylark, played by James Franco. A toned down version (pictured) was used instead
