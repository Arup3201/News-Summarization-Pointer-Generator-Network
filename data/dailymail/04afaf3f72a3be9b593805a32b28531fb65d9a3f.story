It's the dilemma as old as time itself: How a girl is meant to quickly (as well as effortlessly and economically) freshen up her work look after a long day in the office, readying herself for a night on the town.

Well, fret no more.

Debenhams may, after all these years, finally have the answer: the 2-in-1 boot.

Ready to wear: The 2-in-one ankle boot and knee-high, now available at Debenhams

The unique leather boot - the brainchild of London-based designer Betty 
Jackson - begins life as the casual Chelsea ankle-high.

I am rarely a fan of multipurpose clothes and accessories - they to be too many things and fail at them all. Before I saw this 2-in-1 boot I expected to feel the same way - and assumed I would be write it off as a gimmick. But in reality, both styles are worth wearing on their own merit. The leather - which I expected to be shiny and welly-like - was soft and had a really good leather smell. They'll wear well. The shape is good, and the suede detailing and buckles at the back are a nice touch that gives them a luxe touch. They'll be a great city break companion, and ideal for a winter-walk-to-pub-lunch day. A surprise hit - and only £120 too.

In a matter of seconds - and with a little help from a long leather cuff which fastens beneath the foot - it can become a completely 
different, smarter evening knee-high with buckle detail.

Available in black and brown, the innovative product costs £120 and was developed after customer research 
showed that women wanted a quick and simple solution to shaking up their work look.

Natelle Baddeley, Head of Accessories Design at Debenhams: 'This boot 
is the ultimate choice in footwear for fashion-savvy recessionistas.

'Women are being more and more careful with their cash than before, but 
still want to invest in great quality and design.

'We
wanted to offer our customers that little bit extra, so thought what 
better than two on-trend, stylish boots for the price of one!'

It's always painful parting with a lot of money for beautiful designer shoes.

So thank heavens for Zoe Lee, the shoemaker who's taking the sting out of her £575 price tags by giving you two pairs of flats for the price of one.

The generous girl has created a 
stunning pair of pale beige 'Jackson' ankle boots, crafted out of the finest Italian leather, with a removable cuff, allowing you 
to get double the wear out of them.

And, Zoe being a woman who trained under Manolo Blanhik, hers are shoes you are going to want to wear a lot.

Zoe Lee's Italian leather 'Jackson' boots with removable cuff, available to buy for £575 from Soboye in Shoreditch, east London.

Lee's Jackson beauties are available to buy in east London from Soboye, priced at £575.
