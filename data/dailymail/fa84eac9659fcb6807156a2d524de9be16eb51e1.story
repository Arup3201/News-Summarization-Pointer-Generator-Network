Arsenal target Virgil van Dijk should be aiming to secure a move to a top six Premier League side if he leaves Celtic this summer, according to John Hartson.

Van Dijk has been linked with a number of clubs in England's top flight this season with Sunderland and Everton both being priced out of a deal to sign the 23-year-old in the January transfer window.

Last month Southampton also watched the Dutch centre back during Celtic's 3-3 draw with Inter Milan in the Europa League.

Arsenal also enquired about the defender prior to signing Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal.

And Hartson, who played for both the Gunners and Celtic, believes Van Dijk is as good as current Arsenal first-team centre back Laurent Koscielny.

'I like big Virgil. I think he's the full package. He's quick, he can leap and defensively he is sound,' the former Wales international said.

'Celtic did fantastically to keep hold of him in the summer. It was a fantastic bit of business by [manager] Ronny Deila, who no doubt has had a word in his ear and told him: "If you give me another year to 18 months, then you can have your move."

'He will keep improving with Celtic and in time, he will become a top-class centre-half that a lot of clubs will be interested in.

'Is he top notch? Is he as good as the Laurent Koscielny's of this world?

'I think he is. I think he is a top-six Premier League player. I really do.'
