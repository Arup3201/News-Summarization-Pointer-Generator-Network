An unlicensed driver accused of killing a four-year-old girl while fleeing from police could get a lighter sentence if he pleads guilty to the top manslaughter charge - prompting a fiery reaction from the accused's mother. 

The Manhattan state Supreme Court judge offered the three-to-nine year prison deal to 18-year-old Franklin Reyes Jr. on Wednesday.

The offer prompted an explosive reaction from Reyes' mother, Lilia Reyes, who was in the courtroom as she reportedly screamed at the judge: 'It’s not fair! There is not justice in this country! He was only 17!'

Lilia Reyes screamed at a judge on Wednesday who sentenced her son Franklin to up to nine years in prison. The teenage boy killed a four-year-old girl in 2013 while fleeing from police

The hysterical mother was dragged from the courtroom by police officers as the parents of victim, Ariel Russo, looked on. 

She has now been barred from future hearings by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro who has had previous verbal attacks from Mrs Reyes.

Sofia Russo spoke outside court to the New York Post, alongside her husband Alan. She said: 'That really upset me that she would say there’s no justice, that it’s not fair.

'Who knows better than us that it’s not fair? Our child is dead and hers is alive.'

Reyes has 45 days to accept the deal.

The judge said he could no longer treat Reyes as a youthful offender because he had been arrested twice on felony charges since four-year-old Ariel Russo was killed in June 2013.

Authorities said Reyes was fleeing officers who were trying to stop him from driving erratically while on a joyride with his parents' SUV.

The 17-year-old fled, jumped a curb and hit a building, pinning Ariel and seriously injuring her grandmother.

In August, Reyes was charged with another crime behind the wheel - injuring a police officer while fleeing from a traffic stop.

After he made an illegal turn, the teen was pulled over by a cop but sped off, dragging the officer for about a block, injuring his wrist and elbow.

Police said Reyes was arrested after he ditched the car in a parking garage and hid in the office.

He was held without bail after his arraignment on assault and other charges. 

Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment in July. 

His attorney has said that Reyes denies taking anything and was helping his father, the building superintendent, with a plumbing leak. Reyes' father was charged with similar crimes.
