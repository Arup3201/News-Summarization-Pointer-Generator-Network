When playing for England, cricket star Marcus Trescothick knew exactly how to stop opposition bowlers getting through his gate.

But when it came to a wandering hedgehog, Somerset's opening batsman was left completely stumped.

Trescothick, 38, found himself having to call out rescue workers to cut through the entrance to his garden after a prickly intruder got stuck there.

In a spin: Marcus Trescothick  and his family had a surprise visitor in their garden last week when a hedgehog got stuck in his garden gates

The opening batsman, who retired from internationals in 2008, tried in vain to free the wedged creature before experts from a local wildlife charity used an axle grinder to slice through his gates.

The female hedgehog was given a clean bill of health before being released back into the cricketer’s garden in Taunton, Somerset.

Trescothick praised the efforts of staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in nearby Highbridge, which is holding a hedgehog open weekend this Saturday and Sunday.

He said: 'It was a bit different holding a prickly ball rather than a cricket ball.

Bowled over: Trescothick watches as animal experts from Secret World in Somerset free a hedgehog which got stuck in the gates of his house

'My wife and family were delighted with the fast response from Secret World and hope their forthcoming weekend is a huge success.'

The drama began last week when Trescothick and his wife woke up to find the hedgehog wedged in the lower rungs of their front gates.

After failing to prise the animal free he called in Secret World and gave them permission to cut through the gates.

Secret World founder Pauline Kidner said: 'Hedgehogs are renowned for getting themselves into prickly situations like this.

'We are delighted that on this occasion the hedgehog was able to be returned back into Mr Trescothick’s garden.

'He was a part of the rescue mission too. He held her back whilst we were cutting through the bars.

'He was then able to let the hedgehog go at night as we are pretty sure she had babies in the garden somewhere.

'He says he hasn’t seen her since. That is definitely the first time we have had to cut through someone’s gates to free a hedgehog - they do love squeezing into tiny gaps though.

'We were very lucky that Marcus was so understanding in letting us cut the gates, we welded them back together for him.'
