Team Sky's problems continued on Thursday as Spaniard Xabier Zandio joined Chris Froome in exiting the Tour de France.

Defending champion Froome abandoned on Wednesday's fifth stage after the pain caused by three crashes in two days.

The 194-kilometre sixth stage from Arras to Reims took place on wet roads and Zandio was caught up in a crash after 79km and received lengthy medical attention before withdrawing.

It means Richie Porte, who inherited the leadership of Team Sky from Froome, now has just six team-mates to call upon with the race less than a week old.

Egor Silin (Katusha) also quit after the large crash, which also caught up Arnaud Demare (FDJ).
