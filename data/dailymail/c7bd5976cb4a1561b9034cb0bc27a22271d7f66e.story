Judge Nigel Gilmour says messages posted on Facebook are fuelling more violent crimes

Messages left on Facebook are the cause of an increasing number of violent crimes because people post comments they would not make in person, says a judge.

Judge Nigel Gilmour, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, raised his concerns about the social network site after hearing the case of 17-year-old Daniel Cannon who bit off part of his friend's ear.

Cannon admitted using 'his teeth as a weapon' to carry out the assault after an argument on Facebook escalated into violence.

The judge said Facebook messages left by Cannon’s brother -  which he described as  'absolutely disgraceful and centred on threats of violence' - had provoked the attack.

In passing sentence he added: 'It is remarkable when people are communicating on Facebook that they say things they would not say face to face.'

'We are increasingly getting in court instances beginning on Facebook, it is becoming more and more.

Daniel Cannon, was spared a 
custodial sentence after pleading guilty to sinking his teeth into the 
left ear of a friend during an early morning fight in a corridor at St 
Helens College’s technology campus, on Merseyside.

Liverpool Crown Court heard Cannon 
got embroiled in a fight after 'disgraceful, pathetic and violent' 
exchanges between his brother and the victim.

The judge added: 'I had an opportunity to look at the Facebook (comments)  and it can be said that the defendant’s brother is responsible for Daniel Cannon being in the dock.

'It would have been appropriate if your brother could be in court today 'It was disgraceful, pathetic, juvenile behaviour - messages some of which were deeply offensive and of a violent nature.

'If your mother has not had the opportunity (to read them) then I hope she is given it, so she can understand why it is I say a great deal of responsibility for you being in the dock lies at the feet of your brother.'

Sentencing, Judge Nigel Gilmour, who allowed Cannon to be named despite him being under 18, said the motor mechanic student had 'a rush of blood to the head' while he and the victim were grappling in a brawl.

Ben Morris, defending, added: 'People seem to see what is going on on Facebook on the internet as a kind of different form of reality than what is going on in a personal exchange.'

Liverpool Crown Court heard violence broke out shortly after 8am on Wednesday, March 7 following a fall out over comments posted on Facebook the previous evening, mainly between the teenaged victim and Cannon’s brother, Paul.

Cannon who admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent, says he bit the 17-year-old victim’s left ear to break free from a bear hug he was locked in.

Sentencing, Judge Nigel Gilmour said: 'Having got involved in a fight with someone you described as a friend, you were getting the worse of the fight and then bit off part of the ear of the victim.

'You did not intend to cause really serious injury (but) I have no doubt you intended to cause acute pain with a view to bringing the fight to an end.'

Judge Gilmour told Cannon, who was 16 at the time of the assault, that if he had been an adult he would have been sent to prison.

However, given his age and his early guilty plea, the judge sentenced him to an 18-month supervision order and 150 hours unpaid work. He will also have to complete a victim empathy and violent offender programme.

Judge Gilmour's comments follow similar statements by Judge Bopa-Rai at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court last month.

He said: 'Facebook is causing more hassle than anything else these days,' after sentencing a man who punched a woman in the face following an exchange of messages on the site.

An upcoming Government defamation bill will aim to tackle online abuse and harassment which has become known as 'trolling'.

However the impact of provisions in the bill which require sites to reveal anonymous culprits on Facebook are expected to be minimal as the company already requires its member to post under their real names.
