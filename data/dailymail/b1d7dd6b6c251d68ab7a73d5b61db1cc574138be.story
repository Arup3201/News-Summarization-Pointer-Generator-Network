QPR have signed Brazilian midfielder Sandro from Tottenham Hotspur for £10million after the midfielder spent five years at White Hart Lane.  

After some tough negotiations lasting several hours, QPR manager Harry Redknapp has been able to land his top target for the day.

International: The 25-year-old has 17 caps for Brazil, making his debut in 2009 

Sandro said on FacebookL 'I'd like to thank Tottenham Hotspur for everything they've done for me. Spurs has been my home since I moved to England and I loved every minute of my time there. 

'To the fans; I'll always have a special relationship with you and can't begin to express how much your support has meant to me, particularly in tough times when I was injured.

'I can't wait to get started at QPR now and look forward to wearing the famous hoops for the first time.'

The fee will rise to a possible £10m but that could still represent a bargain for Rangers for a 25-year-old Brazilian international who was signed by Redknapp at White Hart Lane.

Spurs owner Daniel Levy wanted more, QPR wanted to pay less, but they've managed to work out a deal.

Sandro was absent from the Tottenham squad that lost 3-0 against Liverpool at White Hart Lane, but Levy originally wanted double the original £8m fee that Redknapp paid in 2010.

QPR owner Tony Fernandes is prepared to back his manager but wants Shaun Wright-Phillips and other dead wood to be shifted from Loftus Road.
