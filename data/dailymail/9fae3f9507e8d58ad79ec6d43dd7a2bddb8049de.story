The internet is influencing our big days more than ever as 13.72 per cent of couples who get married are most likely to meet through a dating website.

And Britons' exposure to celebrity culture online also has its part to play when it comes to planning a wedding.

The most popular colour scheme was revealed to be pink - mimicking a trend set by Hollywood A-Listers including Reece Witherspoon, Gwen Stefani, Jullianne Moore and Anne Hathaway, who all chose pink bridal gowns for their recent weddings.  

More than one in five brides (22.6 per cent) this year chose a wedding dress style featuring a touch of lace similar to the lace gown worn by the Dutchess of Cambridge in 2011 - by far the most popular style.

Two thirds (64.73 per cent) of weddings go over budget as brides- and grooms-to-be strive to outdo one another, witnessing lavish weddings of the rich and famous in the lead up to their big day. The average wedding costs an eye-watering £20,000 and the average number of guests is 78.

And religious ceremonies have continued to fall in popularity, with just only one in four ceremonies now considered to have religious sentiment.

A new and growing tradition was revealed to be the selection of a theme, with 38 per cent of couples opting to personalise their nuptuals this way. 

These ranged from the unsurprising 'vintage' theme, to 'steampunk' or even 'Game of Thrones'.

However, British brides have not completely discarded traditions, with 85 per cent of brides wearing something old, new, borrowed and blue, and a further 87 per cent were given away by their fathers. 

· 25.22 per cent meet through friends

· 24.34 per cent meet through work

· 14.60 per cent meet socialising (e.g. at a bar)

· 13.72 per cent meet online

· 11.06 per cent meet at university

· 9.73 per cent meet at school

· 1.33 per cent meet at the gym 

Regardless of personal tastes and preferences, it is clear that marriage is as important as ever to the British public. 

The institution of marriage in Britain has weathered the recession and even wars.

Country House Wedding Venues, a leading wedding authority in Britain which commissioned the research, believe it's a lucrative industry which is sure to flourish in the UK for a long time to come. 

In what is believed to be the most prolific bridal survey ever conducted, more than 10,000 brides  revealed the intricate details of their big day.

With the UK wedding industry valued at £10bn, the information helps map future trends.

A Country House Wedding Venues spokesperson says: 'We're thrilled to have conducted what is likely to be the largest survey of brides in the UK and feel privileged to have so many brides in our database who are willing to share such intimate insights with us.

'We plan to continually expand the survey each month to get even more comprehensive results, and are now excited to watch the industry with keen interest and see just how accurate our trend predictions turn out to be over the coming years.'
