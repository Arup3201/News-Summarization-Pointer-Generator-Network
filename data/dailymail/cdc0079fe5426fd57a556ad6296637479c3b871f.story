A 13-year-old schoolboy was plied with four tumblers of vodka before a middle-aged woman tried to smother him to death with a pillow, a judge has heard. 

The child managed to fight off his attacker but as he dialled 999 for the police, she gulped down highly toxic anti-freeze in an apparent suicide attempt.

Today the 43-year-old 'very intelligent' businesswoman Jane Rogers was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after she admitted a charge of attempted murder.

She was told that she will not be released from hospital until the Government decides she no longer poses a threat to the public.

A judge heard Rogers had tried to suffocate the 13-year-old boy while he slept.

She then downed toxic anti-freeze in an attempt to kill herself after the youngster leapt out of bed and called the police.

The troubled businesswoman sobbed and dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock as the court heard she suffered from psychotic depression.

Smartly-dressed Rogers, who was thin with her blonde hair in a short bob, was arrested following the incident on May 24 this year.

Prosecutor Mike Roques said the spindly, bespectacled defendant had given the teenage boy four tumblers of vodka and fruit juice before he went to sleep at 1am.

He added: 'He described waking up at 5.45am because he felt a force on his face and couldn’t breathe.

'(She) was pushing a pillow down on his face. He was lying on his back and (she) was on her knees on the bed.

'Any killing of a child or attempt to kill a child is obviously an offence of great gravity. I don’t believe you disagree with that for one moment'

'He attempted to get up and she grabbed him and tried to push him back on to the bed. He was able to get away and run downstairs.

'He describes her as not saying anything after she came downstairs. She just looked down at the floor.'

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, called the police.

When police arrived at the house in Reading, Rogers told them she had consumed toxic anti-freeze and had 'tried to take him with me.'

She told officers: 'I decided this a week ago. I planned it. I tried to take him with me, I tried to smother him.

'I wanted to take him with me. I was going to kill him then myself so nobody else would be involved.'

Judge Stephen John, sitting at Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, heard that spinster Rogers had suffered with depression stemming from an assault she had suffered some years earlier.

The date was not specified in court.

He was also told she had also battled alcohol problems and had two 'drink-related' convictions in 2001, and had received a caution for making threats to kill in 2004.

Her defence barrister, Nigel Daly, said: 'She is a very intelligent woman. She had a career in business which was quite successful but she has had personal difficulties.

'She herself was subjected to a serious assault and developed an addiction to alcohol. She was also taking other drugs.

'She developed, over a period of time, what is described in the reports as psychotic depression.'

Mr Daly said her condition worsened earlier this year when she left one job on the promise of another more high-profile position, which never materialised.

 'If this defendant was not unwell, she would be facing a long period of imprisonment. But she is sick'

Judge Stephen John

The court heard from consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Rami El-Shirbiny (corr), who said Rogers’ illness was very serious and posed a significant risk to others.

After considering the psychiatric reports, Judge John sectioned Rogers under the Mental Health Act and said she would not be released until the Secretary of State was satisfied she was no longer a risk.

'If this defendant was not unwell, she would be facing a long period of imprisonment. But she is sick,' the judge said.

Addressing Rogers directly, Judge John said: 'Any killing of a child or attempt to kill a child is obviously an offence of great gravity. I don’t believe you disagree with that for one moment.

'In many such cases, a long period of imprisonment would inevitably follow. But this case is not one of them because I consider that what you require is not punishment but help.'

The judge ordered that Rogers be treated at the Littlemore Mental Health Centre in Oxfordshire.

'Any decision to release you from hospital will not be taken by the doctors responsible for your care but by the Secretary of State on recommendation from a Mental Health Tribunal,' he added.

Rogers nodded and was in tears as she was led down from the dock.
