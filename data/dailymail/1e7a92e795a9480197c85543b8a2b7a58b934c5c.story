As the star of BBC’s gritty costume drama The Village, she has had to overcome more than her fair share of troubles.

But now Maxine Peake has revealed she has had to overcome some equally difficult ordeals in her personal life.

The actress, 40, has spoken for the first time about her years of trying to start a family, her two miscarriages and how she turned to IVF to try to find a solution before deciding not to have children.

And she hit out at those who assume all women ought to become mothers, saying it ‘shocks’ her that childless women are subjected to more scrutiny than men.

She said: ‘I haven’t talked about those things before because they’re very personal and I didn’t want to be a spokeswoman for women who don’t have children.

‘But when I did interviews, it was the first thing they asked about, like it was a conscious decision on my part to not have kids, and it wasn’t.’

Miss Peake told Red magazine she and her long-term boyfriend Pawlo Wintoniuk, 43, a television art director, have been unsuccessful trying to start a family for a number of years.

She said: ‘Paw and I have been down every avenue and it hasn’t happened but there are other things to do.’

In The Village, Miss Peake plays Grace Middleton, the wife of an impoverished farmer who loses her son in World War One. In BBC drama Silk she played a barrister who suffers a miscarriage when a client punches her in the stomach.

Miss Peake criticised interviewers who constantly questioned her why she doesn’t have children.

She said: ‘I get angry about the way women are forced and bullied into what the male ideal is. Men don’t get quizzed about their personal lives in the same way. No one says to a man, you’re 38 and you haven’t got children – why?

‘You spend your life as a woman building your career, then, once you’re there, there’s a tiny window and all this pressure.’

Miss Peake revealed her own mother had advised her against becoming pregnant. She said: ‘My own mum told me not to have children. She loved us, but she realised that because of us there were things she hadn’t done.

‘I think women can feel ashamed, like they’ve failed or like they’re not a woman somehow if they don’t have kids, and that’s wrong. It shocks me that in this day and age motherhood still often defines a woman.’
