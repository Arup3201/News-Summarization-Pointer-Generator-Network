Anyone who's been on a ski holiday will admit to have thinking it. 'Wouldn't this place be brilliant if we had it all to ourselves?'

One way to avoid crowds on the slopes, is to hire out the whole resort exclusively - something one Utah ski village offers for $10,000.

Eagle Point, in Utah, can host 200 people at its resort and while its slopes are open to the public from Thursday to Sunday, from Monday to Wednesday, skiers will have the lifts and the runs to themselves.

Eagle Point in Utah can be hired out completely for almost $10,000 (£6,500) and can cater for 200 people

And while it sounds like the sort of thing that would only be exclusively accessed by the rich, royal or uber-famous, it's not.

In theory, the whole place including accommodation and slopes with five lifts to access 600 acres of skiable powder, can be all yours for $50 (£32.50).

Owner Shane Gadbaw, a former banker, rents out the whole resort privately for $10,000 (£6,486), which if split between 200 people works out at just $50 (£32.50) each. 

And because it's called the 'As You Wish Package', and the resort is run privately and not by some big, faceless corporation, it's all tailored to your group's needs. 

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Gadbaw says that three key virtues of an authentic ski and snowboard experience, affordable first class food service and a terrain for all levels make the resort what it is.

The US resort offers stunning views out over Utah, while this luxury continues to the facilities and food on offer

Executive chef Jimmie McDowell ensures his food and his staff are of the highest standard for all the guests

'Eagle Point resembles a ski resort of the classic era before high speed detachable lifts, luxury shopping villages and amusement park-like crowds and lines. Guests have the space to enjoy the snow and the mountains without fighting crowds. 

As a private, family-run operation, the culture of Eagle Point and its staff is set from the top. Our goal is simple: we want you to have an amazing time at our resort. You will find the friendliest and most helpful staff in the resort industry. 

'From the personal escort to your condo at check-in, to the special attention to your kids in our ski school program, you will be treated like a special guest at our resort.' 

Most of the lodging is ski-in/ski-out and located within a short walk through the fresh powder from the main lodge. 

What better thing can there be after a testing day on the slopes than relaxing in the bar with friends and an alcoholic beverage?

The resort caters for all levels of skier, and has the facilities to provide for all the family

'Eagle Point is offering the opportunity to reserve the entire resort on an exclusive basis,' says the resort website.

'Imagine you and your friends, family, social or corporate group, enjoying exclusive access to 600 skiable acres, five lifts, the terrain park - and of course no lift lines!

'Stay in comfortable accommodations, with superb dining options and plenty of apres ski fun for everyone - all tailored to your group's priorities and interests.

'This is your chance to be king of the mountain.'

The resort can be booked privately from Monday through until Wednesday, and could cost you just £35

Clearly the package is most attractive to corporate groups and its convenient position 241 miles or a less than four-hour drive from Las Vegas doesn't hurt at all. By comparison, the much more famous Vail in Colorado is a three hours and 15 minute flight away. 

The Canyonside Lodges which includes The Outpost Grill restaurant dishing up American cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a bar, two fireplaces, and five televisions.

The Lodge is also the hub at night-time with live music and dancing guaranteed on Saturdays with a host of acts coming over from Vegas.

The accommodation is a step back in time to what we'd consider a classic ski resort, with a village feel and an array of suites, condos, cottages and holiday homes, along with lodgings in Beaver City, a Mormon-settled town of about 2,500 people.

The heavy snowfall has mean Eagle Point has maintained a steady influx of customers to its slopes

The region boasts 40 feet of snow annually, and famously fun powder at that. 

Although this year hasn't been a good one for Eagle Point, it's turned around in the past week. 

After a brief closure in February it was planned that from February 21 the slopes would only be open on weekends due to a lack of snow fall and warm weather.

However Mother Nature delivered and from yesterday regular service as resumed, albeit with a very generous free skiing for all on Sundays, as long as you sign up to the mailing list.

The resort will cater for skiers as well as snowboarders and can provide all the equipment to make your stay memorable

Mr Gadbaw added: 'While not as large as the mega resorts of Colorado and Northern Utah, Eagle Point has 600 acres of terrain that will suit all levels. 

'Our steep terrain is the most thrilling in the region and rivals the same at any of the mega resorts. The groomers will keep the casual skiers and snowboarders smiling and shushing throughout their stay. 

'Also, the resort is situated like two resorts - divided by skill level - with all of the steep terrain and one side and the groomers on another. This allows a clustering of like-skilled skiers and snowboarders together.'
