A 15-year-old whose mother was killed in the 2004 terrorist bombing in Jakarta, will have her Australian passport renewed after prime minister Tony Abbott personally ordered it himself.

Mr Abbott read of Manuela Musu's struggle to obtain the passport, which her mother had been collecting from the Australian embassy in Jakarta when it was bombed, in the Daily Telegraph on Monday when he took action, News Corp Australia reports.

A spokesperson for the prime minister told the publication: 'The Prime Minister instructed his staff to work with DFAT to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.

Manuela Musu's, whose mother Eva was killed in the Bali bombing of the Australian embassy bombing in 2004, has been struggling to receive her passport for the last month, despite her biological father being a citizen

Prime Minister Tony Abbott fast-tracked her passport after reading of the 15-year-old's story in the Daily Telegraph on Monday. It will be issued in the coming days according to Mr Abbott's spokesperson 

'Ms Musu's application is currently being processed and the passport will be issued in the coming days.' 

Manuela was five-years-old when the bombing occurred and was herself severely injured in the blast. She was one of 200 people injured and her mother, Eva, was one of the 11 people killed in the tragedy. 

The teenager, who currently lives in Italy with her step-father, told the Daily Telegraph earlier this week that she had spent the last month struggling to renew her passport.

The publication reported that Foreign Affairs had required the teenager to prove that her mother had died before they issued her with a new passport.

The death certificate was never provided to the family, according to her step-father, while the Indonesian government informed them they had misplaced it.

The reason why the certificate was required remains unknown, as Manuela's biological father, Dave Norman, is an Australian citizen. 

The 15-year-old said she wants to travel to Australia once her schooling finished, saying she hoped to find a job in the hospitality industry.
