Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace is poised to receive an annual bonus package worth £160,000 from the cash-strapped Ibrox club.

Currently caught in the crossfire between potential rival saviours, Dave King and Mike Ashley, the former Manchester City executive is entitled to a discretionary performance-related bonus of up to 100 per cent of his £315,000 annual salary.

Rangers sources have confirmed to Sportsmail, however, that Wallace has had a scaled down cash payment of £100,000 ratified by the board’s remuneration committee.

In recognition of the club’s perilous financial position, he has asked for a further £60,000 to be paid in market value shares in a move yet to be waved through by shareholders – one of whom, Ashley, is seeking to remove Wallace and financial director Phillip Nash from the board at an EGM.

The Union of Fans are angered by Ashley’s moves to flex his muscles and last night accused the SFA of facilitating an abuse of their rules on dual ownership of football clubs.

Ashley, the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, has increased the heat in the Ibrox boardroom by demanding the removal of Wallace and Nash.

Now in control of 8.9 per cent of Rangers’ shares, Ashley’s move is being viewed as a direct hit on two men sympathetic to seeing the club refinanced by sources other than the deep pockets of the sportswear tycoon.

Sportsmail revealed yesterday that former directors Dave King and Paul Murray, together with shareholder George Letham, are heading an investment group willing to sink an initial £16million into the club – in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue.

It has been claimed however that, if successful, Ashley’s motion will scupper this potential source of investment.

And last night, the UoF, the supporters’ umbrella group, claimed Ashley’s actions this week made a mockery of SFA rules banning any individual from owning more than 10 per cent in two clubs.

‘The move by Mike Ashley to grab power in the Rangers boardroom is extremely concerning,’ a statement read.

‘The SFA’s special dispensation, which allowed Mr Ashley to purchase up to 10 per cent of the club, was clearly designed to mirror UEFA rules on dual ownership.

‘These rules do not allow anyone to exert a “decisive influence” over the decision-making of two clubs. There can be no more obvious attempt to exert “decisive influence” over another club than to try remove its executive directors.

‘Charles Green and the previous board, as placemen for shareholders currently represented by Sandy Easdale, have already allowed Mr Ashley to plunder the club for onerous merchandise contracts and virtually free stadium-naming rights. He also has full control of the club stores.

‘We firmly believe that it is Mr Ashley’s intention to now attempt to grab ownership of the club’s trademark rights including our name and badge. We believe he is deliberately attempting to hamper the efforts of others to invest in the club so that he can provide a loan on terms which will allow him to demand these trademark rights.

Ashley currently owns 8.9 per cent of the Scottish club, but is interested in increasing that stake

‘The SFA has a duty to Rangers to rigorously enforce both its own and UEFA rules on dual ownership. We believe Mr Ashley’s EGM call is a breach of those rules and we have written to the SFA calling on them to take appropriate action.’

Rangers striker Kris Boyd, meanwhile, will be available for the visit of Raith Rovers next Saturday after a charge of violent conduct levelled against him in the wake of last month’s defeat to Hibs was found not proven.

Boyd had been offered a two-game suspension after being charged with an altercation with ‘headbutting or attempting to headbutt an opposing player’ but he opted to fight the charge. And a Disciplinary Tribunal was unable to prove his guilt in the incident involving Jordon Foster.

However, Ibrox defender Bilel Mohsni will serve a two-game suspension after accepting a violent conduct charge for swinging an arm at centre-back Liam Fontaine in the same match.

Rangers are second in the Scottish Championship, six points behind Hearts and two ahead of Raith Rovers
