Injured passengers had to be airlifted to safety off a ferry after it became stranded in ferocious seas on its way from Portsmouth to Bilbao, witnesses said today.

The MV Cap Finistere had tried to enter the port of Brest in Brittany, Northern France, but the waters were too rough.

Instead, the captain was forced to ride out the storm as waves battered the vessel before finally being able to dock, nearly 36 hours after leaving the UK.

The drama came as nearly 1,000 passengers were left stranded in the English Channel for 16 hours on board another ferry because it was considered too dangerous to enter Dover harbour.

Speaking of her experience on the MV Cap Finistere, Catriona Koris, who was 
going to visit her parents-in-law in Portugal, told the BBC last night: 
‘They couldn’t get a port to take the ferry in.

'At one point my chair slid from one side of the boat to the other. We have had injured people airlifted to safety. We have had helicopters coming down.

‘The gentleman next to us was airlifted on a spinal board and neck brace.’

The ferry left Portsmouth at 10.30pm on Sunday night, docked 
briefly at Plymouth as scheduled and was supposed to reach northern 
Spain this morning.

However, because of severe weather it was forced to take shelter in the Bay of Biscay before docking in Brittany at 8am today.

After reaching Brest, the passengers were then reportedly told to make their own way 600 miles through France to Bilbao in northern Spain.

'Ferry is now a floating dormitory!' This picture was posted by Paul Woodbury who was stuck in the English Channel on P&O's Spirit of Britain for 16 hours because Dover harbour was closed due to the torrential storms

This
 morning, Miss Koris tweeted: 'Thx 4 for abandoning us xmas eve, nth France, no
 refund, no ferries to UK, no-where to stay, 24hr drive from 
destination.'

She later said: '@BrittanyFerries Just found out you sent us out when violent storm force 11 was forecast!'

Brittany Ferries said it would be offering £200 compensation to each passenger.

Meanwhile, around 900 passengers were left stranded on P&O's Spirit of Britain in the English Channel for 16 hours after the port of Dover was closed overnight.

Detailing the drama on Twitter, passenger Paul Woodbury said: 'Just made a very scary attempt to enter Dover harbour - aborted when the bridge recorded 70knot winds. Out to sea again...'

He later tweeted a picture of passengers sleeping on the floor, adding: 'Spirit of Britain is now a floating dormitory! Very bumpy; worst of weather expected soon.

'Many young children aboard. Feel for them & their parents - all so well behaved considering. Crew are exhausted yet superb'

He later told how the ferry was battered by 'massive waves'.

The ferry was finally able to dock at around 7am.

Mr Woodbury said: 'Incredible approach manoeuvring of ship into Dover in such atrocious conditions. Superb, skilled bridge team. In total awe #SpiritofBritain.'

The Port of Dover reopened at about 6.30am, but passengers were advised to check with their ferry operator before travelling.
