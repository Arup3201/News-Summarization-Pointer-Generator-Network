Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has been Tory MP for the Ribble Valley for more than 20 years.

Born and raised in Swansea, he stayed in the Welsh city for his university years and gained a BA Hons in politics.

Following his arrest last night for alleged sexual offences against two men in their 20s, colleagues have come out in support of the Deputy Speaker.

Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Evans, said: 'I was just deeply disturbed and shocked.

'I've known him ever since I've been in Parliament and I came in in 2005. I consider him to be a very good friend. I know him to be caring, compassionate and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person.

'He is a good enough friend to have come up last Friday to a fundraiser my partner Sally and I were holding for Macmillan nurses and so I do know him well.

'I just hope and pray that this thing is cleared up sooner rather than later.'

Having joined the Conservative Party as a 17-year-old, Mr Evans became a councillor on West Glamorgan County Council from 1985 to 1991, and was elected deputy Conservative group leader in 1990.

He contested Swansea in the 1987 general election, Pontypridd in the 1989 by-election and then the Ribble Valley in the 1991 by-election, before being elected MP for the Lancashire constituency the following year.

Mr Evans' kept his links to his home city however and owned family convenience store Evans the News in Townhill, set up by his grandfather in the 1930s, until he sold it last year.

He was parliamentary private secretary to several cabinet members in the 1990s, including then employment secretary David (now Lord) Hunt, agriculture minister Tony Baldry and to William Hague when he was secretary of state for Wales.

In June 1997, he was appointed opposition front bench spokesman for Welsh affairs and he went on to lead the Conservative Party's general election campaign in Wales three years later.

Iain Duncan-Smith gave Mr Evans the 
position of shadow secretary of state for Wales in 2001, which he held 
for two years, and he was appointed to the Welsh Affairs Select 
Committee in 2003. He was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from 
2004 to 2005.

A popular figure at Westminster, in June 2010 Mr Evans was elected as one of the three Commons deputy speakers.

Later that year, he revealed he was gay, saying that he was 'tired of living a lie'.

He
came out on the eve of the launch of a new help group for politicians 
and Westminster staff, ParliOut, in which he was involved.

At the time, Mr Evans claimed a Labour MP had threatened to 'out' him and that he had decided to be open about his sexuality to help others in a similar position.

He had discussed the issue with Gareth Thomas, the former Welsh rugby international who had been married before coming out as gay, and said he realised it 'should be no big deal' for him to do the same.

Mr Evans said he had been 'confused' about how to protect pupils when he backed the Tories' notorious Section 28 legislation in the 1980s however and later regretted that support.

Welsh political commentator Gareth Hughes
described Mr Evans as a highly respected individual among his party 
colleagues, who loved returning to Swansea but was 'not a great lover of
devolution'

As well as keeping his grandfather's shop, Mr Evans was said to be 'fond of coming home' to Wales. The former Swansea councillor highlighted his concerns over Clostridium difficile following the death of his mother Betty at Singleton Hospital. And last week he attended a Welsh Conservative party conference at the Liberty Stadium.

Welsh political commentator Gareth Hughes described Mr Evans as a highly respected individual among his party colleagues, who loved returning to Swansea but was 'not a great lover of devolution'.

Mr Evans has a personal interest in American politics and worked on three US presidential campaigns in the 1980s. He returned to the US in 2000, acting as British Conservative Party parliamentary observer.

In the Debrett's People of Today profile on Mr Evans, he lists he recreations as 'tennis, swimming, all spectator sports'.

Born in Swansea in 1957, Mr Evans was educated at Dynevor School, a grammar which converted to a comprehensive during his time there.

After studying for a politics degree at Swansea University, Mr Evans started his working life helping out at his family’s newsagents shops, before embarking on his political career as a local councillor.

He was defeated in three Commons Elections in the space of one Parliamentary term – Swansea West at the 1987 General Election, at the Pontypridd by-election in 1989 and the Ribble Valley by-election in 1991 – before finally taking his current seat at the 1992 Election.

‘After decades of denying it to myself, 
and then just denying it to others, I didn’t want to continue living a 
fraction of my life.’

He was quickly talent-spotted by William Hague who made him his Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1996, when Mr Hague was Welsh Secretary.

Mr Evans was briefly a party frontbencher when he served as Shadow Welsh Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith between 2001 and 2003, returning to the backbenches after Michael Howard took over the Tory leadership.

Since becoming Deputy Speaker, after the 2010 Election, he has impressed colleagues with his handling of Commons debates: his good-humoured approach is preferred by many MPs to John Bercow’s more abrasive style.

Some said Mr Evans was in prime position to succeed Mr Bercow when he stands down.

Last month, Mr Evans made clear his respect for Margaret Thatcher by mounting a strong defence of the cost of the funeral arrangements for the former Prime Minister.

He rebuked the Bishop of Grantham for suggesting the event could be a focus for ugly protests, insisting Britain excelled at ‘pomp and ceremony’.

He also heaped praise on Lady Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda for her calm and collected reading at the funeral in St Paul’s.

Mr Evans said: ‘If she had been speaking at just a family funeral people can break down and cry, but her composure was perfect.’

Mr Evans told movingly in 2009 how his mother Betty died from a superbug infection after a routine operation in an NHS hospital, writing: ‘The last, harrowing moments of my mother’s life will live for ever in the collective memory of my family.

'An 86-year-old lady of infinite grace and dignity, she had the most agonising of deaths.’

He blamed the tragedy on a ‘mixture of neglect, incompetence and indifference shown by the NHS’ before adding: ‘If she had been cared for properly, if the ward had been cleaner or greater urgency had been shown in handling her case, then this tragedy might never have happened.’

Mr Evans – who enjoys regular foreign trips as part of his duties – made a characteristic appearance in the gossip columns two years ago when involved in a good-humoured, late-night exchange with police after pulling up to the Commons gates in a tourist rickshaw.

He made a futile attempt to persuade them to waive security rules so he could ride on to the  Parliamentary estate to collect the driver’s fare.

He was last spotted at the Commons on Thursday evening, cheerfully waving to colleagues as he loaded up his Saab convertible before driving to his constituency.
