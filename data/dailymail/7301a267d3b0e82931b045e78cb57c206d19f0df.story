Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow 

Sir Alex Ferguson insists he had nothing to do with the process that saw David Moyes sacked by Manchester United in April and admits to feeling ‘confused’ when he found out.

Ferguson chose Moyes as his successor at Old Trafford less than a year earlier and in the updated version of his autobiography he says he was in the dark over the decision to sack his fellow Scot.

'I was in Aberdeen as the events unfolded,' he recalls.

'On the Monday, I was flying back to Manchester and sitting next to me was a lad with a newspaper that ran: "David Moyes to be sacked".'

Ferguson then says he was confused on his flight back to Manchester and was not sure how to respond to a text from Moyes he had received.

'I was unsure what was happening at that exact moment,' he writes in relation to the text.

Ferguson adds: 'I spoke to [chief executive] Ed Woodward when I got back and established a final decision had been made.' 

On Moyes, Ferguson also insists that the former Everton manager has 'plenty going for him' as he continues his search for a new job.

He said in his republished autobiography, released on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday: 'On his record it will show that he was selected to be manager of Manchester United, which is a rare occurrence.'

Moyes finished seventh with Manchester United last season, and when the Scot left United had the worst home record since 1978 and the lowest points total in their Premier League history.

He still had a better win percentage than Sir Matt Busby, but lost 11 games as United boss, conceding 40 goals in his 34 games.

He was sacked on April 22, two days after a 2-0 defeat to Everton in the Premier League.

Ferguson played a major role in choosing Moyes as his successor after 26 years in charge at United, but insists he played absolutely no part in his sacking from Manchester United in April of this year
