Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has warned that the growing parachute payments for clubs relegated from the Barclays Premier League are in danger of decreasing the competitiveness of the Championship.

Norwich, Fulham and Cardiff will receive around £60million over the next four years after dropping out of the top-flight last season. 

That figure has increased from the previous £48m parachute payments. But Barber (right), whose Brighton side are fighting to gain promotion from the Championship having reached the play-offs in the past two seasons, is concerned that it could prevent the competition being a level playing field.

Firing shot: Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has warned about the impact of parachute payments

‘Despite the highest average crowd in the League over the past two season, some of the best long-term sponsorship deals and sold-out hospitality, that doesn’t add up to one season’s parachute payments,’ said Barber.

‘For me the disparity is too large and it will have an impact — if we’re not careful — on the competitiveness of the division.

‘People could argue that those with parachutes are not always promoted so it can’t be having an effect. That’s true, but payments haven’t been this large before and the disparity not this great.

‘We have to be careful fans don’t lose heart and feel they’ve got a mountain to climb before a ball is kicked. Everyone should worry.’
