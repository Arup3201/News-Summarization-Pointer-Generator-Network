Plans for easy-to-understand savings accounts were unveiled by ministers yesterday.

They want the 'plain vanilla' products to protect customers from being ripped off, especially by misleading introductory interest rates.

The products will be backed by an official kitemark to reassure people that a savings account or insurance deal 'does what it says on the tin'.

Ministers want more easy-to-understand savings accounts to be offered by banks

The move is a victory for Money Mail's Get Britain Saving campaign, which has called on banks and building societies to end confusion and offer savers simpler, easy-access accounts.

They will now introduce new and straightforward products including an easy-access savings account, a 30-day notice savings account, a regular savings account and fixed-term life insurance.

The savings accounts will not offer bonus or introductory interest rates and all new and old savers will be paid the same rate, regardless of the length of time they hold the product.

There has been increasing concern about customers being lured in with tantalising initial rates on saving products, not understanding that returns fall to almost nothing later on.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show £1trillion is invested in UK deposit accounts. Yet, according to the consumer group Save Our Savers, 40 per cent of this cash is in poorly paying products – some with interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent.

The onus is on the saver to shop around and switch, allowing banks to make huge profits from those who fail to do so. Savers with some of banks are told about rates only once every 12 months and are not told when they fall, or when a bonus lapses.

In many cases, the details are hard to find on the internet.

The Government's plans will be outlined today following a review by Carol Sergeant, the former chief risk officer at Lloyds Banking Group.

Sajid Javid, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'People need to be able to manage their everyday finances with confidence and ease.

'The products outlined in this report represent a milestone towards achieving this, and I am impressed with the way that such a diverse group of organisations has worked together to develop them.

'The challenge now is to ensure that the work that has gone into the Sergeant Review is transformed into tangible changes for consumers.'  

Miss Sergeant said: 'We have known for a long time that being able to manage your finances effectively leads to increased well-being and a better quality of life, at every given level of income.

'I hope the simple financial products initiative will make it easier for people to understand and compare the key financial products they need and make good choices with confidence. It is now really important to make the recommendations a reality.'

British Bankers' Association chief executive Anthony Browne said: 'The development of a suite of simple financial products should help customers to save for a rainy day and to protect themselves against the unexpected.'
