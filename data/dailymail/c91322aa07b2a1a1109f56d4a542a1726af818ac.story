He was part of the intimate family portrait that introduced Prince George to the world.

But the Queen is said to have left Lupo the cocker spaniel off the guest list for the Royal family’s celebrations at Sandringham this year.

‘The Queen made it clear that Lupo was not on the guest list,’ according to a source.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s beloved pet is said to have been left at the Middletons’ home in Berkshire on Christmas Day.

The Queen’s decision may have been a move to keep the peace, as new dogs have caused problems on visits to Sandringham in the past.

Last summer, one of the Queen’s corgis nearly lost an ear when it was involved in an attack with Princess Beatrice’s Norfolk terrier Max.

And in 2003 one of the Queen’s corgis had to be put down after it was attacked by Princess Anne’s bull terrier Florence at Sandringham.

The Duchess received the dog as an early Christmas present from her parents in 2011 after he was bred from their family dog, Ella.

She is ‘especially fond of the puppy and was sad that he could not accompany them,’ the source told The Sunday Telegraph.

'The Queen made it clear that Lupo was not on the guest list'

The working spaniel, who lived with the couple while Prince William served as an RAF pilot in Anglesey, has become a regular fixture in Royal life.

In his first full interview since becoming a father, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘For me, Catherine, and now little George, are my priorities. And Lupo.’

‘He’s coping all right, actually. As a lot of people know who have got dogs and are bringing newborn back, they take a little bit of time to adapt, but, no he’s been all right so far.’
