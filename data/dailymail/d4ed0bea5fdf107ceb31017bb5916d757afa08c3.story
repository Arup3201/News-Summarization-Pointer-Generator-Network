This is the historic moment the last soldier out of Camp Bastion arrived home safely on British soil, marking the end of a 13-year war.

Just days before, more than 600 British soldiers, airmen and American marines withdrew via military aircraft to Kandahar air base in a mass exodus dubbed 'B-Day'.

A ceremony was also held at the military base last week to mark the end of combat operations. 

Following the deaths of 453 British personnel and an overall cost  £20 billion, the base will be handed over to Afghan troops.

Britain is preparing to withdraw entirely from the country by the end of this year.

At the time of the withdrawal, Wing Commander Radnall, of the RAF’s 7 Force Protection Wing, said: 'The adrenalin is still flowing. That is the highlight of 24 years with the RAF Regiment without any doubt.

'It has been an extraordinary morning. It started very early and it was full-on from the word go.

'The end of each six-month tour we look forward to going home and there is a sense of finality for each individual as you finish that tour but for this one in particular, it is a real sense of occasion about it.'

Brigadier Rob Thomson, the most senior British commander in Helmand, said: ‘There is pride for what has been achieved, there is a privilege of being part of something that is pretty historic and there is a confidence that the Afghans are ready to do this.

‘We are confident this is work in progress and yes there are some challenges ahead but the direction ahead is sound and we believe we have a real difference in this land. This is not a evacuation. This is a deliberately measured transfer to the Afghans.’ 

Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006

Major General Sayed Malook, who is taking over the base, said: ‘They have given peace and security for the Afghan people.’

Apache attack helicopters continued to circle the area to deter insurgents and artillery guns were fired from different positions to confuse the enemy. 

Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006. 

The vast majority of the tens of thousands of British fighters who served in 'Task Force Helmand' since then, have passed through the camp.
