An Indiana paramedic has been reunited with his son who, along with his siblings, was abducted by his mother 18 years ago.

Nathan Slinkard was kidnapped by his mom, Trena Slinkard, in October 1995, after Steven Slinkard, the children's father, was given full custody in their divorce.

She fled with the then-5-year-old, his brother, Andrew, 7, and his 3-year-old sister, Sydney, to Mexico and had not been heard from since.

But last week, Nathan, now aged 23, walked into the 
United States Consulate in Guadalajara, Mexico, and asked to return home
 to his father, who hadn't seen his son for nearly two decades.

Authorities say Trena failed to return the children to their father in Greenfield, 
about 20 miles east of Indianapolis, despite a court order giving Steven full custody of all three kids.

It wasn't immediately clear when the 
children were taken out of the U.S., or under what 
circumstances Nathan and the others separated.

Investigators
 had tried to track the family for years, said Hancock County Sheriff's Department Lt. Ted Munden, the last local investigator in the case.

He said officers 
regularly pursued tips about possible sightings, but they always proved 
false.

However, out of 
the blue, Nathan chose to come forward last week, requesting to return 
to the U.S. To prove his identity, the 23-year-old showed his Social
 Security card, birth certificate and his scars that matched his medical
 records.

Steven said it took just seconds for him to recognize his son, despite the years that have passed.

The veteran 
EMS worker and deputy coroner had received a photo of Nathan a few days before he arrived at 
Indianapolis International Airport from Mexico. But he said he was caught off guard at first by 
Nathan's full head of dark hair, because he was blonde as a child.

New chapter: Nathan walked into the United States Consulate in Guadalajara, Mexico, showed his Social Security card and asked to return home to his father

'It took about 5 seconds. I was like, ah, yeah, I remember that little face,' he told the Daily Reporter.

Munden was present during the first meeting between the father, son and his aunt.

He said Slinkard was nervous, and even asked him on the way to the airport if he should shake Nathan's hand, or give him a hug.

'Nathan
 immediately recognized us at the airport. He walked up and initiated a 
hug to his father,' Munden said. 'It was neat. It was really neat.'

Steven said he found comfort in the fact his youngest son was carrying
 a photo of them together before the 1995 disappearance.

'I thought that they were probably kept away from my pictures, but it doesn't sound like it,' Steven said.

He said he is being patient through their reunion.

'We've got quite a few years to go through,' Steven Slinkard said. 'I'm just glad he's home.'

Munden told CNN Nathan is currently staying with his father and has very big plans for the future.

'He's staying with Dad right now,' Munden said. 'He's a good kid, lots of ambitions.'

Wanted: There is still a state warrant for Trena Slinkard's arrest in the custody case

Nathan, who is fluent in English and Spanish, wants to attend college in the U.S. and become a cardiologist, a physical
therapist or a nurse.

Authorities say Nathan has assured them that his brother and sister are alive and healthy and 
know they are free to return to the U.S.

'They're just not ready to do that yet,' Munden said, refusing to disclose where his siblings, and their mother, are currently residing.

Should his daughter and other son decide to return, Steven is waiting with open arms.

'That would be great to see everybody, and I hope to someday,' he said. 'I love them, and I miss them, and I hope that they know I never gave up.'

Authorities still have a state warrant for Trena Slinkard's arrest in the custody case but Munden said they 'would be more than happy to drop that warrant if they wanted to come back.'

But he said he investigators would insist she have 'one sit down with Steve and the three children.'
