Iranian high school students will be taught how to hunt for U.S. drones, a local newspaper reports.

The youngsters will receive lessons by the country's powerful Revolutionary Guards paramilitary units to promote civil defense in Iran.

The plans were unveiled on the 60th anniversary of the coup in Iran which deposed prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh after he restricted the flow of oil to the West.

Hunting for drones: The Iranian military are planning on teaching high school students to hunt for American drones

The new program will be taught as part of a ‘defensive readiness’ lesson in high schools, General Ali Fazli, acting commander of the Guard's Basij militia, told newspaper Etemad Daily.

Students of both junior and senior high schools currently take courses focusing on ‘civil defense.’

However, this is not the first time the Basij militia has made controversial statements.

In April General Mohammad Reza Naqdi claimed that this will be the year of the fall of the 'American Empire'.

The militia leader said that the U.S. should not think it could solve its 'problem with the nation of Iran' with 'some diplomatic dialogue'.

Iran first captured a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone in 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace and claim to have  seized more U.S. drones since, including a Boeing-designed ScanEagle.

The Basij militia was set up as an 
Iranian volunteer force of Islamic government loyalists and is often 
called out onto the streets at times of crisis.

The force was originally formed in 1979 as a resistance force during the Iran-Iraq war.

General Naqdi has been sanctioned by 
the U.S. as a violator of human rights for having participated in the 
suppression of the Iranian people, having previously threatened to kill 
American generals.
