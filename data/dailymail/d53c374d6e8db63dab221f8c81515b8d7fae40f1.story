A climber has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after his friend plunged to his death at a coastal beauty spot.

The men were abseiling down cliffs to look for the semi-precious gemstone Jet when the tragedy happened.

The 51-year-old victim was airlifted to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Both men were abseiling down a 375ft cliff face at Kettleness Point, near Runswick Bay, North Yorkshire

Police revealed the friend climbing with him, aged in his 20s, was arrested and released on bail pending further inquiries.

Both men were abseiling down a 375ft cliff face at Kettleness Point, near Runswick Bay, North Yorkshire, when the incident happened at around 11.20am on Friday.

A Whitby coastguard team attended the scene and looked after the second climber, who was said to be suffering from shock.

A coastguard spokesman said: ‘He just said his friend was going down the cliff and they had tied this rope round a rock. But it moved and down he went.’ 

The victim was airlifted by an RAF Sea King Helicopter to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, but nothing could be done to save him.

The dead man, who is from the Cleveland area, has not been identified.

North Yorkshire Police have now launched a full inquiry.

Temporary Detective Superintendent Steve Smith, said: ‘This is a tragic incident involving two climbers who appear to have got into difficulty, resulting in the death of one of them. 

'A full investigation is underway to establish exactly what happened.’ 

Police have appealed to any walkers in the area who saw the two men to come forward. At least two walkers were nearby at the time, it is believed.

It is not known how far the dead man fell or exactly why the accident happened.

Police are looking at what part the equipment the men were using played and also why one man fell and the other survived.

The rope they were using had not been cut, said police.

It is thought that the men were looking for Whitby Jet – a gemstone used to create jewellery for centuries.

Jet's colour is responsible for the term ‘jet black’ and is in reality the fossilised wood remains of the monkey puzzle tree.

The seams were laid down about 180 million years ago.

The gemstone is only found along a seven-and-a-half mile stretch of North Yorkshire coast near Whitby.

The black fossil was so popular during Victorian times that around 1,400 people worked in the local industry as finders, carvers and polishers.

The rugged coastline remains a magnet for Jet hunters today.
