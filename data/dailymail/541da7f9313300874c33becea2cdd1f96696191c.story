Police have been accused of wasting £5million prosecuting senior firemen over the deaths of four colleagues in a warehouse blaze – while failing to catch the arsonists who set the building alight.

A jury yesterday threw out the case against Timothy Woodward and Adrian Ashley, who were accused of manslaughter through gross negligence in their handling of the fire in 2007. In the worst loss of life for the fire service in 35 years, part-time firemen Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid died trying to put out the fire.

But while police never found the criminals who started the fire in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, £4.7million has been spent over five years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been accounted for.

Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of   
manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze

A third defendant, Paul Simmons, was acquitted on the direction of the judge earlier in the trial at Stafford Crown Court.

After the verdicts, critics said 
firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could
be arrested. Andy Dark, of the Fire Brigades Union, said: ‘Firefighters
are furious at the police and prosecutors.

We believe that the Crown’s case, 
which was essentially that firefighters should stand aside and watch 
buildings burn, must be challenged by the Secretary of State, if not the
Prime Minister himself.’

The police officer in charge of the 
inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, insisted the 
investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had 
learned lessons from the tragedy.

Station Manager Timothy Woodward, 51, and Watch Manager Adrian Ashley, 45, who acted as incident commanders, were charged with gross negligence 
manslaughter in February last year following a criminal inquiry which 
cost taxpayers £4.6 million.

But after hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr Ashley  had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of November 2 2007.

Speaking outside the court, 
Warwickshire’s Chief Fire Officer condemned the decision to press 
criminal charges against three members of his brigade in the first 
place.

Anger: Warwickshire Chief Fire Officer Graeme Smith said the charges should never have been brought

Graeme Smith claimed the defendants had 
been treated like 'common criminals' and is now calling for the Home 
Office and Ministry of Justice to investigate how and why the 
prosecution was allowed to proceed.

Mr Smith, who was present in court 
during much of the six-week trial, said: 'It is crystal clear that these
cases should never have been brought to court in the first place.

'But today neither I nor any of my colleagues in the Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service feel any sense of relief.

'Rather we feel a sense of sorrow and remembrance for the four brave firefighters who died at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007.'

Both Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers Association have serious concerns about the case.

Mr Smith and both bodies will be 
writing to the Home Secretary and to the Justice Secretary to seek a 
formal investigation into the prosecution.

Mr
Smith was also critical of 'undue aggression' shown towards the 
firefighters charged with manslaughter during their time in police 
custody.

During two days in the custody of 
Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their 
belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station 
overnight between interviews.

Mr
Smith said: 'I am seriously concerned - and the public should be 
seriously concerned - that today, up and down the country, fire officers
will be asking themselves... why on earth would I ever want to be an 
incident commander and face an unjustified legal attack in the way these
three men have?'

There were
two independent reports into the blaze, one commissioned by the police 
and another commissioned by the Warwickshire Fire Service, which was 
seized by the police before Warwickshire Fire Service had a chance to 
consider it.

Verdict: After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of November 2 2007

Mr Smith said the investigation had been handled poorly and had put firefighters’ safety behind the needs of the police.

He said: 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn very early on.

'The
police treated decent fire officers like common criminals. The court 
heard they were locked up in the cells overnight and even had their 
shoelaces taken away from them.

'It has taken almost five years and 
five million pounds of public money to construct a flimsy case against 
these three men and when it was presented in court it simply fell 
apart.'

Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007

The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS

He added: 'Both of these reports 
contained safety critical information of vital importance to the safety 
of firefighters up and down the country.

'Neither of them was released to the fire service until May 2011 - an incredible three-and-a-half years after the fire.

'I am outraged that the secrecy surrounding these reports meant that firefighters remained at risk for so long.'

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) hit out at police and prosecutors after the two remaining firefighters were cleared.

The union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS.

FBU assistant general secretary Andy Dark said: 'This was the first time firefighters at an incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues.

'This prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern.

'We are relieved at the not-guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors.

'The criminals who started the fire are still free, but those who tried to put the fire out were arrested, charged and brought to trial.'

Difficult decisions: Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence

The officer in charge of the £4.6 million inquiry into the Atherstone-on-Stour tragedy conceded that 'difficult and unpopular' decisions were taken during the investigation.

But Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence believes the scale of the joint inquiry by Warwickshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive was justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial.

Describing the inquiry as one of the most complicated undertaken by Warwickshire Police, Mr Lawrence said: 'I think that the investigation has answered a number of important questions, in particular for the families that have lost loved ones.

'I very much hope that the fire service generally will take on board some of the lessons learned from this tragedy and reflect upon them.'

Critics of the decision to charge Paul Simmons, Adrian Ashley and Timothy Woodward with gross negligence manslaughter claim too much weight was given to the evidence of one expert witness on firefighting techniques.

But Mr Lawrence said the inquiry had been proportionate, appropriate and had sought to establish the reasons for the 'unnecessary' deaths.

Mr Lawrence said: 'There have been many challenges to overcome, difficult decisions to make and unpopular actions to take throughout the four and a half years.

'Whatever the result of the trial, the investigation has been successful and has had a number of positive outcome for the families of the four men who died and firefighters in Warwickshire and across the country.

'I promised that we would do everything that we could to determine how the four men - Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, Ian Reid and John Averis - died and to find some answers for their families and loved ones. I believe we have done that.'

During the inquiry, Mr Lawrence added, some safety critical issues had been discovered which were of great importance for firefighters across Britain.

'As a result of those findings, I believe that there have been some changes to training for the use of breathing apparatus and fire behaviour.

'Investigating the deaths in the way, and to the extent, that we did was the right thing to do and has been justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial.'

The probable cause of the blaze was found to be a naked flame - after all other possibilities were excluded - and Warwickshire Police arrested several people on suspicion of arson.

But although migrants workers at the vegetable packing plant were interviewed through interpreters in around a dozen languages, there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with arson.

Asked about criticisms of his force’s treatment of the defendants who stood trial, Mr Lawrence said he had led a highly professional inquiry in an independent manner.

'Where there is a loss of life, nobody is above investigation,' he said. “We must never ever lose sight of the fact that four people lost their lives.'
