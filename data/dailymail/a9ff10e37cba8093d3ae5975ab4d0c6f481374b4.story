Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren took to Instagram on Monday night as he took a selfie of himself getting a tattoo on his left arm. 

The 25-year-old - a £20million signing from Southampton last summer - already has a vast array of tattoos on his body.

Lovren's ink include positions on his ribs, upper body and arms - with one of particular note reading: 'We will never let you go' on his forearm.'

Lovren has struggled for form since making a big-money move to Southampton last summer

It is unknown what his latest tattoo is - but what is clear is that the tattooist is someone Lovren has used in the past - lauding him on the social networking site.

Accompanied with the photo Lovren posted the message: 'With one of the best tattoo artist @megrimtattoo let's do it.' 

Dr Ante Starcevica travelled from Lovren's homeland in Croatia to complete the tattoo for the defender in Merseyside.

Starcevica has a tattoo studio of his own in Karlovac - a central city within Croatia.
