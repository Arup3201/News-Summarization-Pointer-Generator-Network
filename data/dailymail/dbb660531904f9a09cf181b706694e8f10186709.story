David Cameron is expected to put a female minister in every Government department to counter claims that he has a ‘woman problem’.

A senior Tory source said the Prime Minister would use his forthcoming reshuffle to promote women and address the ‘gender imbalance’ in his top team.

He added: ‘You will see a lot more women coming through. The Government will look and feel quite different.’ The news came as Labour accused the Conservatives of  sexism, saying that only one of the 14 Tory MPs given major honours since the election was a woman.

Prime Minister David Cameron is considering appointing one female minister to each government department

While in Opposition, Mr Cameron said 30 per cent of his ministerial team would be women within one parliament. But progress has been slow, with just 25 female ministers out of 120 – or 21 per cent.

The total includes only three full members of Mr Cameron’s 22-strong Cabinet.

Aides doubt the target can be met in the reshuffle, which is expected in weeks. But they believe he will make significant progress and end the embarrassment of having seven departments with no women ministers.

Sources expect at least one woman to be moved up to the Cabinet. Employment Minister Esther McVey is heavily tipped for promotion, as are Women’s Minister Nicky  Morgan and Childcare Minister Liz Truss.

Mr Cameron will also have to bring a number of women into the Government for the first time. Potential names include Portsmouth MP and Royal Navy reservist Penny Mordaunt, who hit the headlines this year after appearing on the reality TV show Splash!.

Another contender is rising star Priti Patel, a former adviser to Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was appointed to the Prime Minister’s policy board last year to help draw up plans for the next Tory manifesto.
