Instead of wearing an old ripped shirt and a bit of fake blood this Hallowe'en, Rob Cockerham decided to wear a classier breed of costume.

So the Sacramento, California, resident painstakingly recreated Downton Abbey itself for this year's fright-fest and documented the whole process on his website.

Starting with foam board, Cockerham covered it in printed photos of Highclere Castle, the 5,000-acre, Jacobethan-style country house estate, situated in Hampshire - the setting for all five series of the popular ITV period drama.

What would Lady Grantham make of it? He covered foam board in printed photos of Highclere Castle, the 5,000-acre, Jacobethan-style country house estate, situated in Hampshire

Once he had an entire wall printed and cut, he used spray glue to stick the printouts in place. The centre tower was big enough for Mr Cockerham's head, but not his arms.

So, he cut out arch-shaped holes on the sides and, after the printouts were glued to the boards, all the sixteen sides of four corner towers parts - complete with quarter-inch foam brackets - started to come together.

Rob says: 'Each of the exterior walls was almost four feet across, so I had to figure out a way to get this costume into a vehicle and through doorways. The answer was to assemble the costume with hinges at each corner. This would allow the costume to fold into a long diamond shape.'

He added: 'I considered a few different hinge designs, but settled on a length of corrugated plastic, slit down one side. This material is ideal for hot gluing, and it is super-strong.

'I looked around after the hinges were in place and realized I was finished! Somehow I convinced my kids to resist vaulting the castle walls.

'I straightened the top spikes, added a couple of PVC pipe cross-braces and I was done! The Downton Abbey costume was ready to wear!.'
