Shamed: The son of disgraced presenter Stuart Hall has said that his father should not be stripped of his OBE

The loyal son of shamed television presenter Stuart Hall has said that his father should not be stripped of his OBE despite admitting a series of indecent assaults against girls as young as nine.

Daniel Hall, 50, said that his disgraced father's charity work should 'not be whitewashed' because of his court admission.

Lawyer Daniel, his sister Francesca, 52, and their mother Hazel, 72, are standing by the broadcaster who confessed that he indecently assaulted 13 children over an 18 year period.

He told the Daily Express: 'It does not change my relationship with my dad - he's been a superb father and grandfather.

'My father's massive work for charity for 50 years, for which he was awarded an OBE, and a lifetime of good work should not be whitewashed in one brushstroke.

'That would not be fair.'

Former It's a Knockout presenter Hall and his family were leading fundraisers in the North-West.

MPs signed a motion in the House of Commons in 1999 congratulating Hall on four decades in broadcasting.

He was awarded the OBE just last year for his services to television and charity.

Hall was described as an 'opportunist predator' by the Crown Prosecution Service after it was revealed on Thursday that the 83-year-old pleaded guilty to carrying out the attacks between 1968 and 1986 when he appeared before a judge at Preston Crown Court.

He had fiercely denied all the allegations and read out a strident condemnation to reporters in which he labelled the claims as 'pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious' after he was charged last year.

The former sports commentator said he had endured 'a living nightmare' and but for his 'very loving family' may have considered taking his own life.

But when he appeared before a judge on April 16, he calmly and repeatedly answered 'guilty' when the charges were put to him.

Hall will be sentenced on June 17.

Since his guilty admission was revealed, it has been claimed that BBC managers turned a blind eye to Stuart Hall’s regular practice of luring young girls into his dressing room.

The BBC said it would not be setting up a separate inquiry into the Hall case and neither would it be setting up a hotline for allegations about the presenter.

But the broadcaster confirmed it would be forwarding ‘some information about Stuart Hall’ onto the Dame Janet Smith review.

It said it had ‘to date’ not uncovered any written record of complaints of a sexual nature made against Hall.

Several of Hall's victims have since spoken out about their ordeal.

Both Kim Wright and Susan Harrison waived their right to anonymity to speak to the Daily Mail.

Susan Harrison, who told the Mail yesterday how she was 16 when the presenter picked her out at her school speech day, and persuaded her to visit him at the BBC on the pretext of recording a song.

He later got her drunk in a pub and molested her in his car.

Kim Wright was the first of Hall's victims to make an official complaint.

She was working as a clerk when he grabbed her breast.
