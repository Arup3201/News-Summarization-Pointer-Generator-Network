A young mother who gave birth at the age of 14 has proved having a baby is no barrier to education - after passing eight GCSEs two years later.

Elle Randall, now 16, vowed to finish her studies after having baby Ava two years ago - and soon found herself juggling nappy changing with school work.

But the determined teenager gained eight GCSEs at grades A-C, including maths, in which she scored 98 per cent after gaining an early entry.

Elle fell pregnant when she was in Year 9, but continued going to Trinity Catholic College, Middlesbrough until a month before she gave birth and returned to classes two months later.

'Of course it was a massive shock when I found out I was pregnant,' said Elle, from Thornaby, North Yorkshire.

'I always did well in class, but I was a rebellious pupil and I was always getting in to trouble; I never took school seriously.'

The single mother said she was 'looked down on' while she was pregnant - and is now delighted she has been able to prove people wrong.

She said: 'I got my head down because I knew I could do it.

'And a big part of it was not only to make Ava proud, but to prove people wrong.

'I was constantly looked down on and so by working hard and getting my grades I've been able to prove a lot of people wrong.'

Her mother Kath, a community worker with Middlesbrough Council, said she was 'numb' when her child told her she was having a baby but said the youngster was a 'complete natural.'

'The transformation from a rebellious school pupil to a responsible mother is lovely to see,' said the 46-year-old, also mother to Jake, 23, and Kurtis, 19.

'She's done a fantastic job and she is a credit to Ava.

'It is every parent's dream for their children to do well and I am so proud of her for accomplishing so much.'

Elle plans to go to college in September to get her A-levels and hopes for a place at Leeds University to complete a joint degree in English and RE.

She added: 'I want to become a teacher eventually.

'It's going to be tough but if I have come this far I think why not?'

'I'm in a good routine now and if it wasn't for me having Ava I know I wouldn't have done so well. I don't even think I would have stayed in school much longer.

'It just shows that everything happens for a reason and young mums shouldn't be afraid to reach for their dreams.'
