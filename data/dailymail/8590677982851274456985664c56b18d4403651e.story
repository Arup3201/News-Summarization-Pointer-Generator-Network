More than 1,200 cases of scarlet fever have been reported since the start of 2015, with ‘steep increases’ across the country, say health officials.

Some 1,265 new cases have been recorded in England in the first six weeks of the year, with over 300 cases reported last week, according to data from Public Health England (PHE).

Officials say the number is above typical levels for the high season of scarlet fever between March and April.

Last year in England, over 14,000 cases of scarlet fever were recorded, the highest total since the late 1960s.

Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash which feels like sandpaper to touch.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE’s head of streptococcal infection surveillance said: 'As we enter into high season for scarlet fever, we ask GPs and other frontline medical staff to be mindful of the current high levels of scarlet fever activity when assessing patients.

‘Prompt notification of cases to local health protection teams is critical to enable local monitoring and rapid response to outbreaks.

‘Schools and nurseries should similarly be mindful of the current elevated levels of scarlet fever and promptly inform local health protection teams at an early stage if they become aware of cases, especially if more than one child is affected.’

The first symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat and fever which may be accompanied by a headache, nausea and vomiting.

Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic fine, sandpapery rash develops, often appearing first on the chest or stomach. 

Cases are more common in children although adults of all ages can also develop scarlet fever. 

Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should consult their GP, said Dr Lamagni.

Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications.

As scarlet fever is highly contagious, children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection.
