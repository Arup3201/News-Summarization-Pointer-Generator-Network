Wayne Rooney has warned England’s young players that they face the biggest test of their international careers at Celtic Park. 

The England captain admits the stadium will be bouncing after Gordon Strachan’s side beat the Republic of Ireland there in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday. 

Rooney is determined to make sure England secure a sixth successive victory to end the year on a high against a fast improving Scotland.

The forward, who will win his 101st England cap this evening, said: ‘I have spoken to the younger players because it can take you by surprise. It will be a big test. 

‘I am excited to play in it. It will be a good game, Scotland are doing well and getting some good results. 

‘I have played here before in the Champions League and the atmosphere is really loud andintense. It’s a stadium with a particular atmosphere you want to experience as a player.

‘We have to play the game within the rules. I don’t think it will be like the games 20 years ago. ‘There will be an edge to it, but that’s what you expect from this kind of fixture. Everyone knows this stadium, the fans here have a great reputation of making it an intimidating place to come. I want to make sure they (the younger players) are ready. I wanted to pass on my experience.’

Gary Cahill, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Rooney could be the only survivors from the side that won England’s previous game against Scotland, a 3-2 victory at Wembley last August. Rooney added: ‘Our next game is in March so we don’t want to come off a bad result. We went to end the year on a high.’

Scotland boss Gordon Strachan is fully aware of the significance of the fixture to his players and when asked about the strength of his team said: ‘Nobody wants to be rested, that’s for sure. If we were playing some team 70-odd in the rankings, we would not be as excited.’

Hodgson expects a ‘strong’ Scotland to test his side. He said: ‘I’m not looking for excuses if we don’t win. If we don’t, it’s because we haven’t played well enough or they have been better.’

‘Our approach to the game is exciting, it is a big game and we will be given a tough test.’

An empty Celtic Park may not look too intimidating, but England will find themselves in a hostile environment on Tuesday
