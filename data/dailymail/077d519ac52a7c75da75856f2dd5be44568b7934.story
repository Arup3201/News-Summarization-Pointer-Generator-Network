Ravel Morrison has all but confirmed his transfer to Serie A side Lazio after posting a picture of his new shirt online.

The 21-year-old midfielder travelled to Italy on Wednesday to have a medical and complete his move from West Ham, where he has fallen out of favour. 

And Morrison appears to have sealed a deal to play for the sixth club of his career after releasing a picture  of a Lazio shirt with his name on the back and the caption: 'Ravel 4'.

Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United

Appearances: 81

Goals: 14

Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) 

Morrison, who began his career at Manchester United's academy, will join the Italians on a free transfer at the end of the season.

His contract with the Hammers expires at the end of June and the controversial midfielder is thought to have signed a three-year deal in Rome.

This season he joined Cardiff on a three-month loan but returned early in December. 

Other Premier League clubs also enquired about the England Under 21 international but Morrison favoured a move abroad.
