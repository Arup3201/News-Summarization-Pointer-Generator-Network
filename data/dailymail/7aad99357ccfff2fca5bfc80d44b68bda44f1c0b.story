Real Madrid's 22-game winning streak was ended by an inspired Valencia in one of the most thrilling games of the season so far, despite Cristiano Ronaldo putting his side into the lead from the spot.

Antonio Barragan got Los Che back on level terms before another defender, Nicolas Otamendi headed his side in front to stun Carlo Ancelotti's side.

It handed Barcelona the chance to get back in the La Liga driving seat, but they spurned it against David Moyes' Real Sociedad and it means Madrid are top of the table by a point, with an extra game still to make up.

Valencia played with amazing intensity, continuing their revival this season under Nuno Espirito Santo and showed they are good value to get back into the Champions League.

This was the scene of one of Gareth Bale's greatest triumphs, the ground where he scored that brilliant solo goal against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, but along with Karim Benzema he was substituted as Madrid desperately searched for an equaliser.

January is usually a gruelling month in Spain because that tournament begins for La Liga sides, and this year is no different. Real face local rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night in the cup, but Ancelotti picked his strongest available side.

The last time these teams met, it took a quite brilliant Ronaldo strike to earn Real Madrid a point, the Portugal star's acrobatic backheel one of the goals of the season. Luka Modric was missing that day and injury again prevented the Croatian from playing—he is expected back in February—while Marcelo and Sergio Ramos, both injury doubts, started.

There is a good feeling around Valencia this season, especially now Peter Lim is in control of the club's affairs. New €25million signing Enzo Perez was incorporated into the midfield straight away, replacing the suspended Javi Fuego.

Seven thousand Valencia fans were there to greet the team bus when it arrived, and created a huge tifo reading 'Yes we can', while Lim himself visited the dressing room.

The supporters weren't particularly keen on their team giving Real Madrid a guard of honour at the start of the game, to recognise their Club World Cup success, and made their feelings known.

The only time Valencia have fallen at home this season was against Barcelona and even that was a barely deserved, last-minute win thanks to Sergio Busquets ramming home after a scramble in the box.

Going to the Mestalla is no easy task, and Valencia made sure of it from the off, with a string of challenges that toed a fine line between hard-but-fair and brutal. Nuno's side accumulated an astonishing five bookings in the first half, including one for new boy Perez.

Valencia's strong starts have been notable this season, particularly when they raced into a 3-0 lead over Champions Atletico Madrid, whom they trail by a point after this game.

But despite coming out all guns blazing, it was Madrid that took the lead. Alvaro Negredo handled the ball in the box after a Toni Kroos free kick had not been dealt with, and Ronaldo sent penalty expert Diego Alves the wrong way from the spot.

Historically Los Che have a strong record against Real Madrid, having beaten them 42 times, more than any other side in Spanish football history. Recent years have proved more disappointing though, with the club unable to attain victory in any of the previous 10 clashes with Los Blancos.

Against Barcelona, Valencia had not been able to maintain their intensity, but here they did, coming out in the second half swinging, and they got their reward.

Barragan, the right-back who is out of contract in the summer, was having a marvellous game and on one of his runs forward earned some space for a shot, just outside the box. His strike deflected off Pepe and past the helpless Casillas, setting the stadium alight. 

And then, the unthinkable. Daniel Parejo swung the ball in from a corner kick and Nicolas Otamendi rose highest, thanks to a superhuman, hanging leap, and planted the ball far beyond Casillas to send the Valencia supporters wild.

The rampaging Barragan had another chance shortly after Valencia took the lead but fired inches wide of Casillas' far post after some stunning build-up play and Andre Gomes' through-ball.

Madrid hooked Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, with Sami Khedira, Jese and Javier Hernandez thrown on in their places.

They came extremely close through Isco but goalkeeper Diego Alves made an outstanding save from his header, before goalscorer Otamendi acrobatically smashed the ball off the line to prevent Ronaldo following up. He had another chance towards the end but span a header wide of the near post when he should have hit the target.

The front cover of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport had read 'Liga caliente', signifying that the title race was hotting up. It was more in hope than expectation, but Valencia at a riotous Mestalla, came through.
