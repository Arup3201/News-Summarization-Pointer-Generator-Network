It is five-star living with vast spiral staircases, bridges and stunning sloping roofs.

But this village of 18 homes provides luxury without the guilt, as the properties are all crafted from sustainably-sourced bamboo.

Set alongside the rushing Ayung River, the Green Village rises out of the lush jungle in Sibang, Bali.

It is the brainchild of designer Elora Hardy, who wanted to prove that sustainable materials can be used to create architecturally stunning buildings that do not need to compromise on modern conveniences.

The unique village is built using locally sourced bamboo that is then treated to make it last longer.

Banana paper - used to line the inside of the walls - and sheets of aluminium are the only other materials used.

The village has attracted buyers and investors from across the world who have forked out between £300,000 and £1.2million for a home.

It is centred around a stunning communal centre with wooden floors, bar and stools made from bamboo.

Tropical rainstorms are kept at bay by roll-down bamboo shutters.

The properties cost between £300,000 and £1.2million and have been snapped up by buyers across the world

The bamboo is treated so it lasts longer and Hardy said the homes could last a lifetime

There is also electricity inside the village so owners can still enjoy home comforts.

It is the sister site to the Green School campus, which was founded by Ms Hardy's father, John, in 2006.

The Canadian former jewellery maker arrived on the paradise island in 1975.

Like the village, the school is built using sustainable natural material and is powered by more than 100 solar panels.

Ms Hardy, the creative director of the Ibuku team, said on the village's website: 'Green Village has redefined the potential of sustainable materials.

'It is a place where people connect with nature. We build light on the land.

Ms Hardy said the villas - which feature open walls - allow people to reconnect with nature

Electricity and modern kitchen and bathroom fittings are standard, allowing people to enjoy home comforts

Bamboo has also been used to create study bridges connecting the village and crossing the Ayung River

'With very few resources or attention, a bamboo shoot can become a structural column within three years and that house can stand strong for a lifetime.

'The care we put into designing the homes and the skill of the local craftsmen is a statement about the potential for human innovation and ingenuity for the future.'

Operational Director Patrick How told CNN he hopes the project has changed the way people see bamboo as a building material.

He said: 'Many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings, but we're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used.'
