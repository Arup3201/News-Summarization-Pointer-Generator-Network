A former soap star who admitted driving the getaway car in a gangland shooting has been jailed for perverting the course of justice.

Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry 
Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside, was found not guilty at Liverpool 
Crown Court over his role in the killing of nightclub doorman Bahman 
Faraji, 44.

However, he was convicted of two counts of perverting the course of justice by lying to police in the early stages of the murder investigation and disposing of a pair of gloves he wore on the night.

Regan, who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place, was jailed on January 25 for a total of four years and 10 months.

The facts can now be revealed after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant, Jason Gabbana, who was today convicted of the murder.

Bahman Faraji, known by the nicknames Batman and Ben, was gunned down in a 'ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution'.

Prosecutors said it was the result of an argument between criminals.

Those involved in the shooting went to extraordinary lengths to lure Mr Faraji, 44, to his death on February 24 last year.

He had gone to the Belgrave public house that night following a series of phone calls he received from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

Victim: Nightclub doorman Bahman Faraji was shot in the face

'This was a dirty phone obtained for the purpose of luring Mr Faraji to his death and used in a disciplined way that was designed to leave no clue as to the identity of its user,' prosecutor Brian Cummings QC had told the jury.

Regan's unwitting involvement began when he delivered a £30 bag of cocaine to drug user Edward Heffey.

The former soap star told the trial he would supply Heffey, a convicted armed robber, with drugs 'about three or four times a day'.

That night, '(Heffey) asked for a lift to go and get money so he could pay for the drugs', Regan said.

The pair then drove to Belgrave Road, around the corner from the pub, and Heffey left the vehicle as Regan snorted a line of cocaine.

Mr Faraji arrived at the Belgrave in the company of two other men shortly after 6.30pm on the night of his murder.

They spent about 10 minutes in the pub before they went outside and stood on the pavement.

A short while later the gunman approached and said to Mr Faraji, 'Are you Ben?'.

Mr Faraji nodded and the killer raised his shotgun and fired it directly into the victim's face from a distance of three or four feet.

Mr Faraji fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke and died instantly as Heffey ran back to the waiting car.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Bickley of Merseyside Police's major incident team said it was a 'shocking' crime.

He added: 'Any murder is an appalling event but to me this was striking - it was 6.50pm in a quiet residential area outside a pub during half-time in a Liverpool match.

'What became apparent during the investigation and from the evidence in the trial is that Mr Faraji had received a telephone call in the evening requesting him to go to the pub for a meeting.

'That call was from a dirty phone which was used to deliberately lure him to the pub to be shot.'

Mr Bickley added: 'The defendants have never volunteered any information to suggest what the motive was.

'It would seem likely to me that Mr Faraji thought he was going to meet somebody he knew.

'It's entirely possible that was for some sort of illicit meeting but we really don't know at this stage.'

Following the shooting, detectives launched a murder investigation and began by hunting for the getaway car, a red Ford Escort estate, which had been spotted by witnesses and on CCTV.

The next day, police stop-checked the vehicle in Liverpool city centre and at the wheel was Regan alongside girlfriend Christine Line.

Regan initially told police he had not been anywhere near the area where the murder took place.

But Line's witness statement contained significant differences and detectives became suspicious.

The couple were arrested that night and Regan's efforts to distance himself from the shooting quickly unravelled.

Mr Bickley said: 'The last thing the police need at the start of an investigation is somebody trying to wrong foot them.

'That's clearly what Regan's statements were intended to do.

'Fortunately, we were not wrong footed for too long but it is completely unacceptable to mislead the police at any time and certainly at the start of a murder investigation when time is so critical for us.'

The jury was told that on the way to the police station, Regan said: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly.'

He also told detectives: 'I want to help you but I'll be shot.'

After giving evidence against his co-accused, the court ordered security be stepped up around Regan and that security guards sit between him and the rest of the defendants.

He was also designated a 'vulnerable prisoner' and placed in the isolation wing of his jail.

Mr Bickley said the murder had left a 'devastating' mark on Mr Faraji's family.

'There is a six-year-old son who is going to grow up without knowing his dad and that is appalling,' the detective added.

'It is going to take an awful long time for them to come to terms with what's happened.'

Paul Whittaker, the chief crown prosecutor for Merseyside, said: 'This was a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution of a 44-year-old man in a quiet residential street in a suburban part of Liverpool.

'The whole circumstances of the offence are quite shocking.

'The police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) will not spare any effort to investigate, prepare and pursue these cases and together we are absolutely committed to driving all organised crime and gun crime out of Merseyside.'
