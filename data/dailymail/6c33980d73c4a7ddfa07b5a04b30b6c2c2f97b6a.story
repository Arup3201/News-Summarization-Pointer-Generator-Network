The micro pig which ballooned to a massive 20 stone has now been ordered to go on a diet by vets.

Owner Catherine Dawes, 52, from Lanarkshire, Scotland, has been told that Dudley needs to lose almost half his weight.

The pet, who was supposed to stop growing at two stone, now measures 5ft 8in from snout to tail - and tips the scales at more than 20 stone.

Huge: The porker, who was supposed to stop growing at two stone, now measures 5ft 8in from snout to tail and is a staggering 20 stone

Dudley, aged almost three, who eats sow weaner nuts mixed with fruit and veg, has been limited to just two meals a day.

While he used to be fed up to 30 bananas a week - his favourite treat - but is now limited to just one a day.

And Miss Dawes has been warned it’s time for her pet pig to slim down. She bought Dudley as a treat for her 50th birthday, but he increased to 10 times the size of an average micro pig.

Expensive: Miss Dawes paid £550 for the pig from a breeder in Nottingham

Unexpected: The pig was only supposed to be the size of a small dog

She said: 'The vet said he needs to lose nine-and-a-half stone.

The youth worker has put Dudley on a strict exercise plan. Instead of lazing by the fire in the afternoon, he’s encouraged to walk a few laps round the garden.

'It’s so hard not to spoil him because he’s our boy,' she said.

Dudley, who was bought for £550 from a breeder in Nottingham, was never supposed to grow any bigger than a small dog.

But he just kept getting bigger - and became a fully grown pot-bellied pig.

The pampered pet is put to bed every night in an old coal shed in the garden, with a bed of straw and a heat lamp to keep him warm.

Miss Dawes said: 'Dudley can be a bit grumpy at times, but he’s a big softie. He’s fully house trained, can give you a trotter when you ask and closes doors behind him,'

'Of course, everyone who meets Dudley is smitten. He’s a big friendly giant', she added.

He’s only been on his diet for a few weeks, but Miss Dawes says Dudley is already looking trimmer.

She said: 'He’s a big boy so it will take a long time for him to lose the weight, but he’s doing well so far.'
