Under the water: Hock Ma, 84, was discovered in a rooftop hot tub by a patron of a New York spa

A woman climbing into a hot tub at a high-class spa found a man's body underneath her feet.

Hock Ma, 84, was submerged in warm water at the rooftop pool of the Spa Castle center in Queens, New York - and went undiscovered until the unnamed patron felt him underneath her.

It is unclear how Ma, who was later declared dead, ended up slipping beneath the water unnoticed on Sunday evening.

The woman ran out of the pool, screaming for help after making the macabre discovery, according to NBC4 New York.

Staff gave emergency aid to the man while medics were called - but Ma was later declared dead in hospital.

A friend of the woman who found Ma's body said: '[She was] actually walking into the water and felt something by her feet - It was the gentleman. He went under and no one noticed him.'

New York City regulations demand frequent monitoring of spa pools by officials. It is not clear why nobody had noticed Ma.

However, small print on the website of one Spa Castle location emphasizes that guests have to use 'caution' around the pools and that it will not be responsible for any injuries caused by people swimming, running or diving around the water.

Ma's son, James, demanded an investigation into the death. He said: 'It does warrant a closer look so this doesn't happen to someone else and it's a shame it happened to my father,'.

The New York City Health Department is understood to be looking into the incident.

A spokesman for the spa told DailyMail.com: 'Safety is a priority at all of our facilities.

'On Sunday evening a guest visiting Spa Castle with his family was pulled unconscious from one of the Bade pools - a shallow spa pool.

'CPR was initiated by a certified manager and the patron was taken by ambulance to a local hospital.'

'Safety precautions are clearly posted in our facilities and the staff in the area is CPR certified. Our thoughts are with the family at this time.'
