Following ‘bendgate’ and recent complaints about Apple’s iOS software, the firm is facing yet another issue with its iPhone 6 Plus.

Users have reported a fault with the 5.5-inch model’s camera that means photos won’t focus, even when the phone is held perfectly still.

The same users have managed to get replacement devices, or have the camera fixed, but the cause of the fault is still unknown.

Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) was introduced on the iPhone 6 Plus.

It works with the phone’s A8 chip, gyroscope and M8 motion coprocessor to measure motion data and provide precise lens movement.

It was designed specifically to compensate for shaking hands when the camera is taking pictures in lower light.

It also fuses long- and short-exposure images together to helps reduce subject motion.

Apple claims this ‘unique integration of hardware and software delivers beautiful low-light photos.’  

The fault was reported on the Apple support forums by user oneZer01, who wrote: ‘iPhone 6 Plus rear camera is not focusing, won't remain stable and is blurry, no matter how still I [am].

‘Automatic or manual focus not working either, [but the] front facing camera works fine.’

The user blamed the fault on Apple’s Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) feature, introduced to the iPhone 6 Plus released in September.

As reported in TechTree, the problem may occur because of vibrations in the OIS system that causes it to fail.

Automatic or manual focus not working either, [but the] front facing camera works fine’

Another Apple forum user called Scott Story, who also reported a similar fault, said his local Genius Bar replaced his handset, while oneZer01 had the camera replaced - a fix that cost $59 (£37), but was covered by a warranty.

A further video was posted on YouTube by Bnorty that shows the screen flickering when they attempt to take a photo, or film a video.

Within days of the iPhone 6 Plus being released in September, owners began complaining that the handset bent out of shape when placed in a back pocket for too long.

Apple said at the time that, with normal use, a bend in the phone is rare, and the numbers of affected users was extremely low.
