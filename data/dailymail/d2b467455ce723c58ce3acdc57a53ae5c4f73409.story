Country legend Johnny Cash and his enduring musical legacy are being celebrated in the city of Folsom following the grand opening of the first section of the $3.8 million Johnny Cash Trail and Overpass at the weekend.

The release of Cash's 1968 album At Folsom Prison firmly established the singer as an international country music star and his song Folsom Prison Blues catapulted the California city to enduring notoriety.

City officials unveiled the first section of the 2.5-mile trail on Saturday. The centerpiece is a pedestrian and bike bridge especially designed to look like the east gate guard towers at Folsom State Prison.

Johnny cash's legendary performance at Folsom State Prison in 1968 provided the live album which helped established the singer as an international country music star

'People around the world know Folsom because of that very famous song,' Folsom Mayor Kerri Howell told The Sacramento Bee.

The trail will traverse prison property and link to other area trails.

Next the city is planning a $3 million fundraising drive to pay for a two-acre park next to the bridge.

It will feature art installations along the trail including a 40-foot steel statue of Cash, a large replica of a guitar pick that will include a trail map and a Ring Of Fire display made up of swirling red guitar picks.

Federal and state funds paid for the trail and bridge, but officials say donations will be a more appropriate source of money for the art celebrating the singer nicknamed the Man in Black because of his trademark black stage outfit.

‘There's some kind of beautiful connection between this and the prison, you know?’ Cash's daughter Rosanne said. ‘Just, to involve nature and healing and exercise.’

Rosanne Cash, the musician's daughter, attended Saturday's ceremony and cut a ribbon to officially open the overpass.

‘There's some kind of beautiful connection between this and the prison, you know?’ she told ABC. ‘Just, to involve nature and healing and exercise.’

Even before his 1968 album, Cash had sung about the area in his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues.

It is a Cash classic and features one of his most famous lines: ‘But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.’

‘I sat with my pen in my hand, trying to think up the worst reason a person could have for killing another person, and that's what came to mind,’ he said years later.

The song was inspired by the movie Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison.  

Cash had first sung about the area in his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues which features the famous line: 'But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die'

I Walk The Line: The city is planning a $3 million fundraising drive to pay for a two-acre park next to the bridge and to build a 40-foot steel statue of Cash. A miniature model was on display on Saturday 

Cash had intent was to play his first prison concert at San Quentin, but the warden was out when his manager called, so he ended up at Folsom first.

The song was the first on the At Folsom Prison album, although the cheering from the audience following the 'But I shot a man in Reno' line was added in post-production. 

The atmosphere at the prison was tense during the concert because the inmates were ordered to stay in their seats throughout the concert, the result of a guard being kidnapped two weeks earlier.

In August, Cash's childhood home in Dyess, Arkansas was opened to the public.

Rosanne Cash said that the Arkansas State University-led scheme was launched to help boost the local economy in Dyess, which has struggled in recent years.

'We have lost many other such places of historic significance because of a lack of funds, [no interest] or ignorance,' she said. 

'I am so happy ASU stepped in when they did. There were only around 35 cottages left and my dad's, though dilapidated, was one of those.'

Other works of art commissioned for the proposed park include a large replica of a guitar pick that will include a trail map and a Ring Of Fire display made up of swirling red guitar picks
