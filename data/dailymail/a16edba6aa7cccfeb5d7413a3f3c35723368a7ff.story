RAF fighter jets have been involved in near misses in the skies once every two weeks since the Ministry of Defence approved - but never fitted - a safety measure 15 years ago.

Defence chiefs pledged to implement a collision avoidance system for Tornado GR4s in the 1998 Strategic Defence and Security Review.

The warning system could have prevented the mid-air smash between two RAF jets that killed three airmen last year.

But ministers controversially delayed introducing the £55million device in a bid to save cash. It will finally be fitted in the fighter-bombers in late-2014.

New figures uncovered by SNP MP Angus Robertson have revealed that since the MoD first promised the safety measure there have been two collisions and 361 near misses involving the Tornados.

Critics said the extraordinary total - around 22 a year between 1998 and 2013 - exposed the seriousness of the situation and suggested defence chiefs were 'not putting safety first'.

Mr Robertson, who represents Moray, said: 'It is very shocking that there have been so many incidents since the MoD promised to install a collision warning system on the aircraft which according to them would "improve safety for man and machine".

'It shows that the conditions that led to incidents like the tragic collision in 2012 are not isolated and rare.

‘We don't know whether such a system would definitely have stopped that collision and saved lives, but this is certainly being considered in connection with a potential fatal accident inquiry.

'I believe that the families of the victims deserve the fullest answers and the whole truth. The MoD has a lot of questions to answer about why they do not appear to put the safety of service personnel first.'

Retired RAF engineer and airworthiness campaigner Jimmy Jones said: 'This is a scandal. It is criminal that nothing has been done.

'The scale of these figures show there is a problem - why has it gone unchecked for so long?'

Defence Minister Mark Francois revealed the number of 'airprox incidents' - near misses - in a Parliamentary answer.

An 'airprox' incident is defined as a situation where two aircraft come so close together it has compromised safety.

Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey, 36, and Flight Lieutenants Hywel Poole, 28, and Adam Sanders, 27, died when two £40million Tornado GR4 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north-east Scotland. Sq Ldr Paul Evans survived but was badly injured.

The fighter-bombers, each carrying a pilot and a navigator, spun out of control and plunged into the Moray Firth on July 2012.

The crew were all from 15 (Reserve) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth. They were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog.

The MoD confirmed last week it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident.

The state-of-the-art £53.5million device was not finally approved for the Tornados until October 2012 - three months after the tragedy.

Military sources said cost-saving in the cash-strapped MoD meant the RAF was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit.

Defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018.

An RAF board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) will be held. The board's findings have not been published.

An MoD spokesman said: 'There are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in Moray are extremely rare.

'A specifically designed Tornado Collision Warning System, which will be another tool for pilots to use, is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year.'
