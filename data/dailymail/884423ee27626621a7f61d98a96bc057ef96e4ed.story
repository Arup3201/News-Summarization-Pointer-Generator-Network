NHS funding will be protected and increased if the Conservatives win the election – meaning other new areas of public spending will be hit by savage cuts.

David Cameron will use his final party conference speech before the General Election to pledge a ‘ringfence’ of the NHS’s vast budget until 2020.

The promise places him squarely on Labour territory after Ed Miliband used his conference speech last week to put the issue at the centre of his 2015 campaign.

The Prime Minister will also challenge Ukip’s suggestion that Britain has gone to the dogs. He will insist the Conservatives are building ‘a Britain that everyone is proud to call home’.

Pleading for another five years to finish the job, Mr Cameron will promise a country ‘where hard work is really rewarded, not a free-for-all, but a chance for all . . . the chance of a job, a home, a good start in life, whoever you are, wherever you are from’.

Confronting Labour’s claim that it can ‘save’ the health service, the Prime Minister will insist: ‘The next Conservative government will protect the NHS budget and continue to invest more.’

Controversy: Cameron's announcement of an extension of the NHS budget ring-fence - and the commitment to increase spending in real terms over the next five years - is likely to prove controversial

But the extension of the NHS budget ring-fence – and the commitment to increase spending in real terms over the next five years – is likely to prove controversial.

Chancellor George Osborne warned this week that the nation’s debt levels remain ‘dangerously high’, and £25 billion in spending cuts will be necessary to balance the books.

Soumaya Keynes, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that based on figures at the last Budget, between 2014/15 and 2018/19, cuts of 3.1 per cent in all areas – totalling 11.9 per cent – will be required to eliminate the deficit. Continuing to protect the budgets of the NHS, schools and overseas aid, however, will mean harsher cuts in all other areas – including home affairs, justice and local government – of 6.1 per cent, or 22.1 per cent in total.

Ministers who have taken a third out of their budgets are likely to resist fiercely any attempts to make their departments shoulder all the pain in the next round of cuts.

Mr Cameron will say today that the party had been right to shield the health service from the pain of austerity. ‘We know this truth – something Labour will never understand and we will never forget: you can only have a strong NHS if you have a strong economy.’

On his plan for the next five years, he will seek to demonstrate broader goals than deficit reduction. ‘I love this country – and my goal is this: to make Britain a country that everyone is proud to call home.

Proud: Mr Cameron, seen taking a selfie with delegates at the conference, will say his goal is to make Britain 'a country that everyone is proud to call home' 

‘That doesn’t just mean having the fastest-growing economy, or climbing some international league table. I didn’t come into politics to make the lines on the graphs go in the right direction.

‘I want to help you live a better life. And it comes back to those things I believe. A Britain that everyone is proud to call home is a Britain where hard work is really rewarded.

‘The past four years have been about laying the foundations for that Britain. The next five will be about finishing the job.

‘If our economic plan for the past four years has been about our country – and saving it from economic ruin – our plan for the next five years will be about you.’

Looking forward: Mr Cameron, pictured with wife Samantha, will say that 'the past four years have been about laying the foundations for that Britain. The next five will be about finishing the job'
