Welcome to the 'ocean of gambling'.

Right now, thousands of people around the world are gawking at video clips of other people winning big on poker machines - and potentially adding even more money to their coffers in the process.

Hundreds of thousands of videos of pokies hitting jackpots, features and massive payouts have been uploaded to YouTube, with view counts in the millions.

'I think it's culturally devastating and utterly deceitful, most people lose,' World Vision Australia CEO and chair of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce reverend Tim Costello told MailOnline.

Dangerous pastime: Psychologists have warned the YouTube videos could trigger gambling binges in addicts

'It's a free world, people can upload what they want, but someone needs to tell them they are entrapping and ruining somebody who sees it and says "that could be me"...your joy at winning can only be at the cost and sorrow of somebody who loses.'

Many of the clips - which can be viewed by children of any age in most instances - feature extremely extravagant  high-rollers who boast about betting hundreds of dollars per spin.

'This is really what's got the public upset, parents are saying who asked them about their kids being handed over to gambling. It's everywhere. Kids have got smartphones at school where they can watch these videos,' reverend Costello said.

One Australian YouTube user, who goes under the alias of 'Pokey Ranger', uploaded a video of him winning more than $10,000 on a $180 spin in an Australian casino. 

The video has been viewed 100,000 times and Pokey Ranger and his friend can be heard swearing at the machine and willing it to 'give them a hand'.

Under the video Pokey Ranger brags about belonging to the 'ocean of gambling', ridicules other small-time gamblers for being 'tadpoles' and describes walking into the high-roller areas in Australian casinos as becoming 'enlightened'.

In another video Pokey Ranger complains openly on his way to winning $6300 on a $62.50 spin.

'So far it's s***,' he says after winning $3000.

In the comments section he later wrote: 'I was not over the moon with it and I am in Australia and you can win much more then $10,000 on a poker machine in in the high roller areas where the max bet is actually $450 a hit.'

One of the most popular machines to feature in the YouTube gambling community is 'Big Red' - an Australiana-themed pokie in which a kangaroo falling in the right place trigers five free spins. Manufacturers Aristocrat describe the machine as 'hugely successful'.

More than 4,000 videos of the game have been uploaded to YouTube, the most popular of which has been viewed 180,000 times.

'Ocean of gambling': The YouTube clips are keenly discussed in online gambling forums

Uploaded by Aussie 'D Reid' the clip was filmed at Sydney's Royal George Hotel and shows Mr Reid collecting a tidy $6,000 on a $10 spin.

Sydney clinical psychologist Bill Campos told MailOnline the videos have the potential to cause serious addiction problems, with access to online casinos only a click away.

'The problem is you're just seeing the sizzle, the five minute clip of somebody being elated,' he said.

'It perpetuates that feeling of "where is the next roll of the dice? where is the next pull of the pokie?"

'With YouTube there's no real way of stopping kids watching anything...a kid of 12 or 13 could see this and say "someone's winning, great"...it could have implications down the track.'

Mr Campos said online casinos were especially dangerous because they didn't provide the 'social queues' for gamblers to stop betting.

Fed up: World Vision Australia CEO and chair of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce has described the trend as 'devastating'

'There is nobody there to say enough is enough, you're just in a room by yourself.

'In a casino or pub there are people packing up, drinks are finishing...there is none of that at home.'

YouTube users with popular channels are able to 'monetise' their videos - meaning the website pays them a small percentage of the revenue earned from placing ads at the start of, and during, clips.

It is unclear according to YouTube's online policies if the clips are eligible for monetisation and the website did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.

The guidelines tell users: 'Videos showing software user interface may be monetized only if you have a contract with the publisher or you have paid a licensing fee.'

MailOnline noted a number of the popular poker machine videos carried advertisements on them.

Aussie YouTube user Colin, whose channel Col447 has been viewed more than 1 million times, would not comment on whether he receives an income from the hundreds of poker machine videos on his YouTube account.

‘Watching pokie wins on YouTube is cheap entertainment,’ he said.

‘Plus only the big wins are uploaded for the viewers. It's good to see someone win big for a change.’

A Facebook page called Pokie Wins – which has been liked nearly 18,000 times – is home to a number of the more popular YouTube clips.
