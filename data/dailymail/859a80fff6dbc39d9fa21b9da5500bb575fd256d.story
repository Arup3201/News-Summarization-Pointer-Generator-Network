The body of an autistic man has been found buried in the woods after he was allegedly tortured and murdered by his stepbrother.

Matthew Graville, 27, who has Asperger's Syndrome, had not been seen since June 30. Police discovered his body on Monday buried off a remote highway following a tip-off.

His stepbrother Jeffrey Vogelsberg, 28, was charged today with first-degree murder and hiding a corpse in Mazomanie, Wisconsin.

Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney 
said on Tuesday that Matthew was tortured and abused by his stepbrother 
who killed him and put his body in a freezer at the beginning of July.

Vogelsberg is then believed to have buried the young man's body in the isolated woods off a highway close to Lone Rock a few days later.

Mr Graville's stepmother, 49-year-old
Laura Robar, was also arrested after she allegedly took money from Matthew's bank account following his death. She faces charges of felony theft, identity theft and hiding a corpse.

Vogelsberg's landlord 28-year-old Robert McCumber faces a charge of hiding a corpse.

An emotional Sheriff Mahoney told the Wisconsin State Journal: 'Matthew lived a living hell, one in which he could only find peace in death.'

The sheriff
said Mr Graville lived with his stepbrother in Mazomanie before 
Vogelsberg moved to Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington with his 
wife, who serves in the Army.

The
young man was reported missing by his birth mother in September 
after she had not had contact with her son since March.
