American pop stars Miley Cyrus and Justin Timberlake could be forced to cancel Finnish concerts due to U.S. sanctions against the venue's owners.

Both singers are due to play dates at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki, one of Finland's biggest entertainment venues.

But the arena's Russian owners are all close associates of President Vladimir Putin and are included on a list of visa bans and asset freezes, imposed by the United States last month.

Now it is unclear whether the concerts can go ahead.

The Hartwall Arena is owned by Gennady Timchenko, co-founder of Russia oil trader Guvnor, and brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg.

All three were the subject of sanctions, which were issued against close allies of President Putin following the country's annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.

Mr Timchenko and the Rotenbergs bought a stake in Helsinki ice-hockey team Jokerit along with the arena, which is the team's home rink, last year.

Justin Timberlake has a sold-out concert scheduled for the Hartwall Arena next month, though it could be under threat

Justin Timberlake already has a sold-out concert scheduled at the arena for May 12, while Miley Cyrus will be taking her world tour to the venue in June.

Helsinki concert promoter Live Nation Finland said its lawyers were discussing with U.S. authorities whether the sanctions against the venue's owners would bar planned shows by American artists.

Nina Castren, chief executive of Live Nation Finland said: 'We are examining the possibility whether this could have an impact on American artists' shows.'

'If it does, then we will need to come up with a different solution.

'But I believe that the problem will be solved and the concerts will be held.'

Timchenko's and the Rotenbergs' company in Finland, Arena Events Oy, could not be immediately reached for comment.

The sanctions imposed by the United States mean that Americans cannot conduct any transactions with those on the list.

The U.S. Treasury Department has said that Gennday Timchenko's activities in the energy sector are directly linked to Mr Putin, who has investments in Gunvor and could have access to Gunvor funds.

The Rotenberg brothers are both believed to be close childhood friends of President Putin and have held big state contracts.

Arkady Rotenberg's companies won billions in road contracts in Sochi, the host of the 2014 Winter Games.
