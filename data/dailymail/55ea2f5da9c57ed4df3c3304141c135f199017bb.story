Floyd Mayweather has opened up about his decision to post a picture of his ex's sonogram and publicly claim that she aborted their unborn twins, saying that at first he was trying to defend her.

Mayweather said that his ex, Shantel Jackson, had told him that she had a miscarriage because of stress that he caused, and for some unknown reason he felt the need to make it clear that she did have a miscarriage.

According to TMZ, he told radio station V-103 that after he said he was going to post the photo, representatives from a reality show she had been working on for Showtime contacted him and revealed the truth.

Outrageous: Floyd Mayweather posted this photo of a sonogram- the details of which have been blurred by MailOnline but states that it shows multiple fetuses- and he claimed that it was that of his ex Shantel Jackson

'Somebody from Showtime contacted me and said "Floyd, I'm glad you didn't put that picture out there because she didn't have a miscarriage. She had an abortion,"' the undefeated boxer said in an interview Friday.

'But I feel bad because she was telling me the whole time that basically stress from me made her have a miscarriage but all in all, she went and got an abortion.'

From there, he went on to make further claims about her alleged motivations and the supposed plastic surgery that he paid for while they were together for four years prior to their split in April.

'It hurt my feelings all because she's selfish because all she's worried about is looks, talking about "I don't want to mess my body up." Everything you got on your body, I paid for so it's okay. Even if you had the baby- even if you had the babies, if you wanted me to put you back together like I did in the beginning, I could've done it again,' he said.

Retaliation: Jackson promptly posted this photo of her and Nelly, effectively confirming that they are in the beginning of a relationship which had been rumored in the days leading up to Mayweather's posting of the sonogram

Bitter punch: Mayweather responded to the Nelly pictured by posting this undated shot of Jackson- before taking it down

Pointed response: Jackson posted this clear message on Thursday afternoon

'I'm all like "everything you got on you is fake," you know you got a fake butt, you've got fake titties, you got work done on your face.

‘That's how you know my love was genuine because I accepted you from the heart: no breasts, no butt, no face work. I accepted you because it was real love. Pure love.'

In conclusion, he declared that it was never his intention to bring this up publicly, even though he was the one that planned to confirm the 'miscarriage' in the first place.

'My whole outlook from the beginning was that I think your private life should be private,' he told the radio show.

The scandal began Thursday when Mayweather posted his ex-fiancée’s alleged sonogram and claimed that he broke up with her because she got an abortion.

The World Champion boxer posted the photo of the sonogram to his Facebook and Instagram accounts Wednesday before receiving thousands of negative comments and taking it down.

'The real reason me and Shantel Christine Jackson @missjackson broke up was because she got a abortion (sic), and I'm totally against killing babies. She killed our twin babies. #ShantelJackson#FloydMayweather#TheMoneyTeam#TMT' he wrote as the caption.

Mayweather and Shantel Jackson dated for four years and got engaged in 2013 when he proposed with a $10million ring.

In
 April, the undefeated boxer who has signed a deal that will net him 
$200million, he announced that they were calling off their engagement.
