Stand-up comedian and former psychiatric nurse Jo Brand has attacked Simon Cowell's reality TV shows The X Factor and Britain's got talent as she believes they exploit people with mental health problems. 

The 57-year-old star said TV executives have a responsibility to consider the impact scathing criticism on such talent shows could have on the people taking part. 

She said that a poor singer might honestly believe they can sing because of a delusion. 

TV comic Jo Brand, pictured, said she feels angry because reality TV shows such as The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent could be exploiting people with mental health issues 'for other people to laugh at'

She told BBC Radio 4: 'I have a huge ambivalence to shows like The X Factor and particularly Britain’s Got Talent because I think they wheel on people who have mental health problems for other people to laugh at.

'I feel very angry about that.

'It is easy for all of us to take the p*** out of someone who thinks they can sing when they can’t and I think that’s very cruel.

'The field of mental illness is complex because as well as issues like schizophrenia or depression there are lots of other different shades of problems.

'Someone may have a personality disorder or schizo affective disorder.

'There’s also delusion but sometimes that can be a symptom of schizophrenia.'

According to The Mirror Ms Brand said families should tell the loved ones if they are not able to sing to help them avoid ridicule.

She added: 'It’s more and more a feature of society – to hold people up to ridicule for one reason or another.

However, producers behind The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent said they have a psychologist on site during the entire audition process. 

A spokesperson said: 'The welfare of our contestants is our number one priority. We take our duty of care very seriously and contestants are asked to disclose any concerns they have in advance so that we can offer appropriate support.'

A spokesperson for The X Factor said the welfare of contestants was 'their number one priority' claiming that the show has an on-site psychologist employed throughout the audition process
