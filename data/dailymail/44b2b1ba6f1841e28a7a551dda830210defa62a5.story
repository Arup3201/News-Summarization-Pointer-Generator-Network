Furious Nick Clegg today revealed how he rebuked his staff for the WWI wreath blunder which meant he failed to write a personal dedication to the war dead.

He was among senior politicians ridiculed on Monday for laying a wreath at a ceremony in Glasgow with a label just scrawled with 'From the Deputy Prime Minister' in black felt pen.

David Cameron and Prince Charles both penned personal notes to attach to their wreaths, and today Mr Clegg his staff are ‘very well aware’ of his anger for failing to arrange for him to do the same.

Nick Clegg faced criticism this week for the impersonal felt pen message scrawled on his WWI wreath left at the Cenotaph in Glasgow on Monday

Mr Clegg laid the wreath alongside Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was also ridiculed for his message stating: 'From the leader of the opposition'

Organisers of the ceremony arranged for wreaths to be laid at the Cenotaph in Glasgow to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War.

In contrast David Cameron's message read: 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister.

The Prince of Wales also wrote his own note, which said: 'In everlasting memory, Charles'.

But the many other politicians laid their wreaths with the standard labels provided by organisers.

Ed Miliband was accused of being 'pathetic' and 'distasteful' after his a scruffy message read only: 'From the Leader of the Opposition'.

Political aides had suggested it was the fault of the organisers for not making the offer to signatories to write their own message in advance.

But Mr Clegg appeared to suggest he considered his own staff were at fault for not recognising the importance of the event, and asked for a label to write in advance. 

Today Mr Clegg was challenged on his radio phone-in about why none of his staff thought to ask to write a note in advance

Prime Minister David Cameron left a message which read 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister

Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘Clearly everybody understands that I would much prefer to have been given the opportunity which I wasn’t given.

‘Many other people were not either. The organisers understand that loud and clear.’

Asked what he had said to his staff who could have asked to write a message, he added: ‘I have made it absolutely clear that I would have liked to have had the opportunity which I wasn’t given, to write a personal message.’

He said his staff are ‘very well aware’ of his anger at the blunder.

‘It was just a feeling of regret that I had not been given that opportunity,’ he added.

The incident happened at hundreds of people gathered at George Square for the wreath-laying ceremony. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Home Secretary Theresa May and Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities, were among those who attended the hour-long service in the heart of the city.

But anger at the impersonal labels on the wreaths briefly overshadowed a day of poignant commemorations.

The labels of Mr Miliband and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond were criticised for being impersonal and insensitive

Mr Clegg had been challenged by a caller to LBC, Alistair in Grimsby, who told the Deputy PM: ‘What happened there because now a man of your stature in your position should be ready for an event like that? You should have your own hand written note.

‘You knew that you was going to that wreath laying ceremony as did Ed Miliband. What happened and why didn’t your secretary get you prepared?’

‘You go to these ceremonies numerous times of the year. Why had you not personally right, on your way to the event whether you’d be on the train, on a helicopter or whatever in the back of the chauffer driven car, why did you not personally hand write a note ready to slip in there?’

Mr Clegg protested that such events were organised in a ‘very sort of strict way’ and those taking part ‘basically do what you’re told’.

He noted that Labour leader Ed Miliband, Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson and the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones all had wraths with the same scrawled label.

‘Of course if I’d been give the wreath before the note, before, I would have been more than honoured to write a note.’

Asked what his message would have read, Mr Clegg added: ‘I honestly think there’s not much point you know to sort of lurching around trying to point the finger of blame.

‘I would have wanted to express my everlasting gratitude and that of our generation for the extraordinary sacrifices that lost their lives in World War One, their sacrifice has allowed us to enjoy our freedom. ‘
