An ointment that painlessly melts away fat has been hailed as ‘an eye-lift in a bottle’ by experts. The treatment – known only by its experimental name of XAF5 – has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes.

Its makers say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body, particularly on stomach fat.

The praise follows yesterday’s annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, where US bio-tech company Topokine Therapeutics presented details of a trial of 90 patients, aged between 40 and 70, who applied the cream once a day to their under-eye area for ten weeks.

The trial was double-blind and placebo-controlled, meaning that neither the participants nor the researchers knew which patients belonged to the control group or the test group.

Bags were graded on a four-point scale, and in ratings given by independent doctors, just under half of those using XAF5 were found to have improved by one full grade in both eyes, with some seeing a two-grade improvement.

Dr Michael Singer, Topokine’s chief scientific officer, said: ‘A one-grade improvement may sound small, but it is a meaningful change. Participants said they felt they looked more youthful, more attractive and more well rested after treatment.’

Eye bags, or steatoblepharon, are fat pads under the eye socket that bulge forwards. Although numerous factors, including lack of sleep and allergies, can lead to fluid accumulation in these tissues, they are typically a permanent part of the facial structure.

Their appearance worsens with age as the ligaments holding the pads in place soften.

When applied, XAF5 is absorbed through the skin and into fat tissue. It binds to receptors on the surface of fat cells, causing them to expel their oil contents, reducing their size. It also prevents new fat cells from forming.

The ointment’s active ingredient – a compound known as a prostaglandin – was initially developed as a treatment for glaucoma, or high pressure in the eyeball, given as eye drops.

However, while testing the drug, doctors noticed that fat around they eyes began to disappear within weeks – called prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy, or PAP.

However, as well as losing their eye bags, some patients also developed deeper or ‘sunken’ eyes. Previously, PAP has been seen as an unwanted side effect of a different prostaglandin used in another prescription-only cosmetic cream Latisse, which causes the eyelashes to grow. In rare cases, the drug also causes irreversible brown pigment to appear in the eye.

But Dr Singer said that XAF5 was a different type of prostaglandin, and trials had seen ‘no effects on the eye, including iris hyperpigmentation’.

US professor of ophthalmology, Dr Stanley Berke, who has written papers on PAP, said this type of fat loss could make people with loose, puffy, baggy lids and loose skin look better. ‘For some patients who might be candidates for plastic surgery, this could be thought of as a “blepharoplasty [eye lift] in a bottle”,’ he added.

However, London-based dermatologist Dr Stefanie Williams said: ‘Surgery is currently the only option to treat eye bags due to fat accumulation.’

Yet while this is effective and permanent, surgeons may inadvertently remove too much fat, which can leave people looking hollow-eyed and permanently surprised. In contrast, when XAF5 is discontinued, the results reverse.

XAF5, which would be a prescription-only cream to be applied at home once a day, is now undergoing further testing.
