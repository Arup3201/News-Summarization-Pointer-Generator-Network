When Louis van Gaal took over at Manchester United earlier this summer, the future looked bleak for Ashley Young.

There appeared to be no place for the 29-year-old in Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 formation and, after a poor campaign under David Moyes last season, Young looked almost certain to be offloaded. 

Five games later, however, and Young  looks to have saved his United career by reinventing himself as a wing-back in the mold of Dirk Kuyt, who caught the eye at the World Cup with some industrious displays for Holland.

But is Young really cut out to play that role week in and week out in the Premier League?

Four goals - two of them against Real Madrid - and a series of penetrating crosses and dribbles during United's pre-season tour of America provided a reminder of Young's attacking qualities.

But his defensive limitations were exposed against Liverpool on Monday morning. A lapse in concentration allowed Raheem Sterling to run in behind him leading to Phil Jones hacking down the Liverpool midfielder and conceding a penalty - which Steven Gerrard duly dispatched.

An isolated lapse may be, but Young has never been known for his defensive qualities. When Sir Alex Ferguson or David Moyes needed an auxiliary right back in the absence of Rafael, they always turned to Antonio Valencia. 

The Ecuadorian has more physical presence and big-game defensive experience than Young who, after all, has only impressed in his new role in meaningless pre-season friendlies.

In the Premier League last season Young managed a little over a tackle a game (1.14) compared to Valencia's 2.32. In 20 games, Young managed to block just one shot and make 10 interceptions. Valencia by comparison blocked six shots and made 39 interceptions - although he did play nine more games. 

Valencia also made more headed clearances and won a higher percentage of tackles than Young, who also fails in comparison to Rafael and Luke Shaw - who will also be challenging for the wing-back spots.   

In defence of Young, however, Rafael for all his attacking qualities still has a tendency to jump into tackles. Valencia has not been as potent going forward as Young, while Shaw will have to prove he is able to step up to playing for a big club like United.  

It is clear that none of Van Gaal's options are perfect but he has seen something in Young that Ferguson and Moyes didn't.

The Dutchman has been keen to get his players thinking on and off the pitch and it was interesting that Young was chosen to speak alongside the Dutchman at a press conference last week - something which rarely happened under Ferguson and Moyes.

Young spoke well and it may be that Van Gaal is hoping he can reinvent and tutor the winger in a similar way to how he used Kuyt at the World Cup. 

Kuyt, a former striker turned winger, impressed for Holland as a left wing back and the pair share certain similarities. Young too is a good athlete and hard worker able to get up and down the pitch well.

Young also prefers to play on the left rather than the right - 'as a right-footed player, you can cut inside, have a shot and link up with the midfielders and forwards' - and with doubts over Shaw's fitness, he may well start United's opening League game against Swansea on August 16.

Defensively Young will have to improve if he is to keep his place in the team but he is very much the in-form man. And if Young keeps scoring and proving a threat going forward it will be hard for the Dutchman to ignore him. 

However this experiment turns out, Young at the moment deserves praise for reigniting his United career and the Old Trafford faithful will be hoping to see a new and improved man wearing the No 19 shirt this season.
