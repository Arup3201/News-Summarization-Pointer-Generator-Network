Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has boldly stated he can win the Ballon d'Or award during his career.

The France international is confident his club success at the Bernabeu can force his way into contention for the prestigious award.

However Benzema's Los Blancos team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has picked up the last two accolades for the world's best footballer whereas Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi prevailed between 2009-12.

Despite the duo's dominance, Benzema is adamant he can compete for the title if he continues to perform for Real Madrid and at international level. 

'If I keep winning titles then I can win this award in future,' he told Le Parisien.

'We have Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, the two best players. We know I won't reach 80 or 100 goals in a season. They can do that.

'After that, there are a lot of players who are worth it. They can put me in the top 5, but I don't know.'

Benzema fired a warning to his team-mates ahead of a titanic clash with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals. 

'PSG are a great team, that's all,' he said. 'It will be more difficult than usual for Barca because Paris Saint-Germain are known to have increased their standing in the Champions League. PSG have every chance of going through.'

The Frenchman, in action against Brazil on Thursday, has scored 20 goals for Real Madrid this season
