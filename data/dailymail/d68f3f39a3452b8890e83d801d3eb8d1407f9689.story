A few chickens clucking in the back garden provide fresh eggs every morning, more money in your pocket and a little taste of the Good Life.

But the 500,000 households across Britain now keeping their own flocks could also pose a major health threat to the poultry industry.

Veterinary experts say many of us keeping chickens at home have little understanding of how to control disease in the birds, along with insufficient knowledge of health regulations.

Major health threat: Many of the 500,000 households across Britain keeping their own flocks have little understanding of how to control disease in the birds

They warn this could hasten the spread of disease from backyard flocks to commercial poultry farms.

A survey by the Royal Veterinary College found most back garden flock owners provided their birds with good living conditions.

But 75 per cent did not comply with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs regulations which outlaw birds being fed on kitchen waste.

Farmers have been banned from feeding such waste to chickens since 2001, because some agents of disease can survive in household food products.

75 per cent of back garden flock owners do not comply with regulations

Feeding such food to chickens can spread disease.

The survey, published this month in the journal of British Poultry Science, also found lapses in biosecurity, with very few owners keeping human visitors, wild birds and rodents away from their flocks. Few properly vaccinated their birds.

They found that nearly half of flock owners would not seek veterinary help if their birds became ill, despite RVC guidelines saying chickens should be cared for like any pet.

Around 40 per cent said they would dispose of dead birds by burying them in their gardens, when they should be incinerated to prevent disease spreading through groundwater and wild species.

Another serious concern was the low awareness of diseases such as Marek’s disease, infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis, all common in backyard flocks in Britain.

Keeping chickens is also a major risk factor for diarrhoea in children since the birds’ droppings can contain the disease agent campylobacter jejuni. More than a third of the chicken keepers surveyed had children, which highlights the risk posed to families.

Study co-author Iveta Karabozhilova 
called for greater regulation of back garden chickens and more 
communication between householders and health officials.

‘Making information available and easily accessible is of high priority from a disease control perspective,’ she said.

‘Even though evidence from our study shows that flock owners provide enriched living conditions to the chickens, they ought to realise that their pets are a farmed species and are subjected to regulations.’

Poultry vet Barry Thorp, from the St David’s Poultry Team practice in Scotland, said: ‘A lack of education and awareness by those who buy them certainly make the birds more vulnerable to disease and therefore pose a bigger threat of spreading it.’
