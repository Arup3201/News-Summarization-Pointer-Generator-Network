Sunbathers and nuns sat side-by-side today on Rio de Janeiro's iconic Copacabana beach, as more than a million people gather for an evening vigil Mass that will be said by Pope Francis.

The Argentinian Pontiff- who is due to return to Rome tomorrow- arrived at the beach tonight to celebrate World Youth Day in his Popemobile. He made his way through the crowds, waving to his followers before reaching the grand altar where he will say Mass.

Pilgrims and locals set up tents and sleeping bags by the sea, to witness the service.

After receiving a shirt from one of 
Rio’s beloved football teams from the legendary Zico and visiting one of
the city’s most violent slums, Pope Francis today immersed himself 
further in Brazilian culture as he modelled a local tribesman’s feather 
headdress.

Halo: Pope Francis appeared to be holier than usual when his head was surrounded by a light that formed a crescent-shaped halo as he preached to bishops, priests and seminarians at the Cathedral of St. Sebastian

The Pontiff, 76,
was met by Brazilian Indians at the capital’s grand municipal theatre, 
where he spoke with the country’s political and economic elite.

When
groups lined up to kiss the Pontiff’s ring, a man from the Pataxo tribe
offered Pope Francis an alternative to his traditional ceremonial 
headdress.

The Pope wore the flamboyant headdress, which is designed in a fan-shape as he spoke with the tribe.

Now
on his sixth day of his first overseas trip, the leader of one of the 
world’s biggest churches continued to preach about the need for a better
dialogue after weeks of violent protests in Brazil.

During
his speech at the Municipal theatre- where he was met with a standing 
ovation- he said better dialogue was needed between religions.

He said: ‘Between selfish indifference and violent protest there is always another possible option: that of dialogue.

'A
country grows when constructive dialogue occurs between its many rich 
cultural components: popular culture, university culture, youth culture,
artistic and technological culture, economic culture, family culture 
and media culture.'

Commentators have said the Pope's visit to Brazil has been a unifying success.

When
he arrived at the theatre to deliver his remarks, he was welcomed with a
standing ovation and shouts of 'Long live the pope!'

International event: Flags from the UK and Brazil illustrate the world-wide appeal of Pope Francis

Earlier in the day, he delivered a Mass with 1,000 bishops in Rio's beehive-like modern cathedral.

Pope
Francis echoed the message he has delivered to pilgrims at World Youth 
Day all week- a radical call to renew the dusty church, which has seen 
its numbers dwindle in Europe thanks to general apathy.

'We cannot keep ourselves shut up in parishes, in our communities when so many people are waiting for the Gospel!

'It's not enough simply to open the door in welcome, but we must go out through that door to seek and meet the people.'

The
slum pope'- who is respected for his work with the poor, received a 
rapturous welcome in the Varginha shantytown on Thursday, part of a slum
area of northern Rio so violent it's known as the Gaza Strip.

The
76-year-old seemed entirely at home, wading into cheering crowds, 
kissing people young and old and telling them the Catholic Church is on 
their side.

The Varginha visit was one of the highlights of Francis' weeklong trip to Brazil, his first as pope.

Strong message: The Pope told the thousands of youngsters to get out into the streets and spread their faith, saying a church that doesn't go out and preach simply becomes a civic or humanitarian group

Man of the people: The slum pope'- who is respected for his work with the poor, received a rapturous welcome in the Varginha shantytown on Thursday, part of a slum area of northern Rio so violent it's known as the Gaza Strip

Trying on a new look: The Argentinian Pope modelled a local tribesman's feather headdress earlier today

Preaching: Pope Francis waves to people from his popemobile as he visits the Varginha slum. The 76-year-old has been greeted by standing ovations and shouts of 'Long live the Pope' during his visit

The
surprise, though, came during his encounter with Argentine pilgrims, 
scheduled at the last minute in yet another sign of how this spontaneous
pope is shaking up the Vatican's staid and often stuffy protocol.

He
told the thousands of youngsters, with an estimated 30,000 Argentines 
registered, to get out into the streets and spread their faith, saying a
church that doesn't go out and preach simply becomes a civic or 
humanitarian group.

'I want
to tell you something. What is it that I expect as a consequence of 
World Youth Day? I want a mess. We knew that in Rio there would be great
disorder, but I want trouble in the dioceses!' he said, speaking off 
the cuff in his native Spanish.

'I
want to see the church get closer to the people. I want to get rid of 
clericalism, the mundane, this closing ourselves off within ourselves, 
in our parishes, schools or structures. Because these need to get out!'
