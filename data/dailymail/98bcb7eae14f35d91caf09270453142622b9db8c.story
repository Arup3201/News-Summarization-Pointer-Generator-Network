Nedum Onuoha suffered a painful return to action on Wednesday night when he was forced off with a cut near his eye after clashing heads with QPR team-mate Steven Caulker.

Onuoha was left with a sizable gash on his left cheek and had to be substituted during their 2-1 defeat by Arsenal at Loftus Road.

Shaun Wright-Phillips revealed a photograph of Onuoha's cut on KICCA and wrote: 'Wish big chief all the best and it goes back to normal.'

Onuoha had last played for QPR almost a month ago when they lost 1-0 against Southampton on February 7, and was making his return from a hamstring injury during a bloody and bruising derby.

QPR were left in the Barclays Premier League relegation zone after the 2-1 loss as goals from Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez kept Arsenal in third.

Charlie Austin set up a nervous finish with his strike in the 82nd minute but it proved to be just a consolation for Chris Ramsey's side.
