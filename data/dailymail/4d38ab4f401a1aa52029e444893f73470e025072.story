A puppy with three legs can't find a home because she keeps getting passed over for able-bodied dogs.

Five-month-old Ruby was born with a deformed right front paw which had to be amputated after she was turned into the RSPCA.

Puppies are normally snapped up within days, but because of Ruby's disability no one wants to adopt her.

Ruby, who now has three legs and is pictured above with her carer, Leanne Manchester at the Derby RSPCA Centre, can't find a home because she keeps getting passed over for able-bodied dogs

When Ruby was handed over to the RSPCA her front right paw was deformed and it had to be amputated

Leanne Manchester, from the Derby RSPCA Centre where Ruby is currently being looked after, said the puppy is an 'adorable dog - so friendly and full of life'.

Ruby, a rottweiler and Staffordshire bull terrier cross, has been at the centre for a month.  

Ms Manchester said: 'Her disability means she is still lonely. If she wasn't missing a leg, she would have been rehomed by now.'

Ruby's owners took her to the centre because they were struggling to deal with her. A vet later concluded a birth defect had caused her front leg to be folded up and that amputation was the only solution.    

Because Ruby was already used to getting by with three usable paws she was able to run around straight after surgery. 

Ms Manchester said if Ruby wasn't missing a leg she would have been been adopted by a new owner by now 

Ms Manchester said while Ruby, pictured above before her operation, would be more suited to gentle exercise, rather than long hikes, her disability wouldn't make her more difficult to look after

And since then Ms Manchester and her team have been taking Ruby to hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions to help her build up strength in her legs.  

Ruby's stump is currently too small for a prosthesis, but Ms Manchester hopes that who ever adopts the puppy might help get the dog back onto four legs.

Ms Machester, 25, added: 'She is the happiest puppy you will ever meet in your life.

'Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done for her.' 

The RSPCA hopes people can look past Rugby's disability because she is '100 per cent worth it'

Ms Manchester said while Ruby would be more suited to gentle exercise, rather than long hikes, her disability wouldn't make her more difficult to look after than an able-bodied dog.   

She said: 'I think people are concerned that because she only has three legs she will be much more difficult to look after and they are worried about taking on the extra responsibility.

'We wouldn't want people to take home a puppy without thinking it through carefully but Ruby is such a great dog and I hope people can see past her disability to see that.

'She is 100 per cent worth it.

'She will need some more support from her vet than the average dog, but she is fantastic with children and other dogs.'
