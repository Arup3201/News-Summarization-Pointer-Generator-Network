It is often said that music can be good for your soul.

Now one inventor has used that philosophy to create his very own coffin, complete with a built-in stereo.

The CataCombo Sound System, which costs around £18,500, is aimed at music-lovers who don't want to rest in peace.

Going underground: Customers can programme their own playlists into the £20,000 coffin before they die

Customers can compile their own personal playlists before they die and the music will be streamed into their coffin.

And even when they have gone relatives can update the songs for their dearly departed via Spotify and a 'Catatomb app' using a touch screen built into the gravestone.

The music is piped into the casket via two-way front speakers, 4in mid-bass drivers, 'divine' tweeters and 'a hell-of-an-8-inch subwoofer.'

They are all powered by a custom 2.1 amp and fine-tuned to the coffin's unique interior acoustic space which is fitted with an external cooling system so they don't overheat.

And the beat goes on: Relatives can even update the songs for their loved ones via Spotify and a 'Catatomb app'

The whole system is also completely soundproofed so it doesn't wake the dead lying nearby.

Inventor Fredrik Hjelmquist of Stockholm, Sweden, said: 'Just because you are dead, you should not be deprived of the life-enhancing power of music.

'Some people believe that a beautiful melody can reach beyond our senses. Now you can expect nothing less than godlike comfort and heavenly sound from the catacoffin.

'This is designed to allow customers to 
embrace their passion for music, in this life and the next. Hi-fi is my 
biggest passion in life, and I will take it to the grave.

'People in Sweden are so stuck up about death - I wanted to give them something to laugh about. I was very afraid of death and I wanted to lighten it up a bit.'

He said so far he had only invented his own personal musical coffin - but was ready to take orders for more.

Father-of-two Fredrik, 48, said: 'This is genuine - I've already got my own ready, although I'm hoping I don't have to use it for a few years yet.

'My wife doesn't like to see it but I haven't yet put my final year on my gravestone.'

Fredrik said the coffin would be powered by an electrical supply to the tombstone.

The coffin is linked wirelessly to the 
CataTomb tombstone which comes with a seven-inch touch screen LCD panel,
a 2.5 GHz Intel core processor and even a 4G Wireless internet 
connection.

His coffin features two tweeters, two mid-range speakers and a woofer with an amp in the gravestone linked by cable to the casket.

He added: 'I've already had interest from a funeral parlour who think it will prove to be a hit.'

Fredrik runs specialist hi-fi store Pause, one of the biggest in Stockholm.
