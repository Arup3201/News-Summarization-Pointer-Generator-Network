His rescuers described him as terrified, emaciated, severely neglected and clinging to life.

But Alex - a heartbreakingly-malnourished dog who was found wandering the streets of New Orleans, surviving off nothing but rocks and twigs - never stopped being a kind, lovely animal.

'He was still so nice and sweet and forgiving despite, obviously, the neglect he has suffered for some time,' said Deanna Theis, the assistant director of the Southern Animal Foundation, a no-kill rescue organization.

Theis saw a picture of Alex appear on a website for a local animal control center, and realized he would be euthanized unless someone like her went to save him.

Shocking: Anyone with information on what might have happened to Alex is being urged to come forward

Skin and bone: Despite his neglect, rescuers say Alex never stopped being a lovely, sweet dog

Terrified: Alex was delirious and severely ill when he was first taken in

'How he is still alive at this point is pretty much a miracle,' Deanna Theis told Fox 8.

'He was extremely close to death.'

It is not known who abandoned him.

An x-ray of the Weimaraner showed there was nothing but twigs and rocks in his stomach.

Specialists at the Southern Animal Foundation desperately tried to restore his health.

However they suspect they overfed Alex because his stomach bloated out significantly.

Awful: An x-ray shows how there is nothing in Alex's stomach but rocks and some chewed twigs

Savior: Deanna Theis, the assistant director of the Southern Animal Foundation, is woman who rescued Alex

Skeletal: Alex could barely walk because of his shockingly thin frame

Troubling: Alex had to operation after being taken in because his stomach severely bloated after eating

Safe: This photo was taken not long after Alex was taken into care 

Ouch: The dog had to undergo an emergency operation after his stomach bloated and flipped over

The situation got so serious he required surgery, because his stomach had flipped in his torso.

However the operation was successful.

Alex now weighs 43 pounds but is getting stronger.

He has been put on a prescription diet that will hopefully ensure he continues to gain weight.

The Southern Animal Foundation plan to nurse Alex back to health.

They will then set about finding him a proper home.
