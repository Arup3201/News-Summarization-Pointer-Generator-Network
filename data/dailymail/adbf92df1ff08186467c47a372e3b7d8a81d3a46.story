Detectives investigating the murder of a dance radio DJ who was found stabbed to death in his mother's flat have arrested a teenager at Heathrow Airport, Scotland Yard said.

Luke Jackson, known as MC Bluetooth, was found dead in the home of his 65-year-old mother, Elizabeth Jackson, in Pimlico Road, south-west London, shortly after 6pm on Friday.

An 18-year-old man was arrested at Heathrow Airport yesterday afternoon on suspicion of murder and taken into custody at a north London police station where he continues to be questioned.

Investigation: Forensic officers at the south-west London flat where Mr Jackson was found dead on Friday

Tributes: Flowers and candles were left outside the flat, which belongs to Mr Jackson's 65-year-old mother

Missed: Friends and colleagues said that they were 'saddened' to lose a 'genuinely loveable person'

Mrs Jackson was arrested as part of the murder inquiry, but has been released on bail until the New Year after being questioned by detectives. 

Mr Jackson, from south east London, co-hosted a weekly drum-and-base show for online dance music station Vision Radio.

A statement on the radio's website said: 'Vision Radio UK was deeply saddened to learn of the untimely passing of our much loved MC Bluetooth, Luke Jackson.

'He was a genuinely loveable person in the true sense of the word and will be sorely missed not just by us, but by so many.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.'

Mr Jackson enrolled in 2008 at the newly-established London Urban Arts Academy (LUAA) where he was later named 'star student' and toured secondary schools teaching rap to young pupils.

LUAA founder Kerry O'Brien said: 'He was the most joyful soul with the biggest heart, amazing lyrics and had so much ahead of him.' 

Friend Nathan Patterson, 28, who spoke to Mr Jackson hours before his death, said: 'Everyone who knew him will say the same thing. He was charming and had a heart of gold. He wouldn’t hurt a fly.' 

Scotland Yard said officers were called to the flat following reports that a man had been stabbed.

London's Air Ambulance attended but Mr Jackson was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area near Lumley Flats in Pimlico between 5.30pm and 6pm on Friday, 19 December to contact us.

'There would have been many people in the area and they may hold vital information into what happened.'

Scotland Yard said formal identification has yet to take place but that officers are 'satisfied' that the deceased is Luke Jackson. A post-mortem examination was due to take place today.

Any witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8358 0200 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
