A seaside town fired at by volleys of shells in a  bombardment, which left 18 dead on the home front during the First World War, is commemorating those who lost their lives.

Tomorrow  marks exactly 100 years since the residents of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, were unexpectedly attacked by three German warships, damaging schools, homes, churches, hospitals and the lighthouse.

The shelling, which started shortly after 8am on December 16, 1914, left 18 people dead and 200 others injured and it took years for the coastal town to rebuild itself.

Many of the buildings that were targeted, including a shop, have since been rebuilt and still remain standing on the very same spot.

To mark a century since the devastation hit, a maroon will be fired from Scarborough Castle after the name of each of the victims is read out at a special dawn ceremony tomorrow. 

The castle will be lit up during the ceremony and a flotilla of boats will be stationed outside the harbour.

At another service, which will be held at Manor Road Cemetery, wreaths will be laid on a new cairn bearing the names of all those who died.

The 1914 raid was the first successful one on British shores for 250 years, since a Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames and the Medway and destroyed much of Charles II’s navy in Gravesend and Chatham.

Although a number of lives were lost, including that of 14-month-old John Shields Ryalls, it is believed that the toll could have been much higher as the winter weather and the early hour meant less people were around.

The raid became important in the war as a mode of propaganda after Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and a leading public figure, denounced them as the ‘baby-killers of Scarborough’ for their unprovoked attack on a defenceless population.

It was then used in a recruitment drive and to stir up bad feelings against the Germans. Posters were printed, which read 'Remember Scarborough! Enlist now.'

Shop fronts were damaged and windows smashed, including those on Scarborough's South Street (above) during the attack in December 1914

Four of the fatalities that day came from the same family and the Government used photographs of their house on its posters. Another, issued within weeks of the shelling, bore the headline: 'Avenge Scarborough - up and at 'em now.'

The text added: 'The wholesale murder of innocent women and children demands vengeance. Men of England, the innocent victims of German brutality call upon you to avenge them.

'Show German barbarians that Britain's shores cannot be bombarded with impunity. Duty calls you now. Go today to the nearest recruiting depot and offer your services for King and home and country.'

Posters were published in 1914 encouraging men to enlist after the  bombardment, in what became an important piece of propaganda for Britain
