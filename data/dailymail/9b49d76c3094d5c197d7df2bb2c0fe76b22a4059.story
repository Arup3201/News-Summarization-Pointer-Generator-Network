For more than 100 years, butchers in the market town of Sudbury have proudly displayed their meats in their shop windows.

But now one has been forced to stop hanging game such as pheasants, partridges and rabbits in his shopfront after a vicious campaign, blamed on ‘townies’ who have recently moved in.

Staff at JBS Family Butchers, which has sawdust on the floor and takes great pride in its link to local suppliers and the countryside way of life, spent hours every week perfecting their window displays featuring meat and game.

JBS Family Butchers in Suffolk buckled to pressure and removed its traditional window display, after shoppers mounted a campaign saying they were offended by the sight of bits of dead animals

Those behind the hate campaign mounted against JBS Family Butchers of Sudbury said they were trying to protect their children from the ugliness of 'mutilated carcasses'

Unplucked birds and the occasional pig or deer head were hung up in its shopfront in a small precinct in the Suffolk town.

But
 it has reluctantly had to remove the display after it became the target
 of a campaign including anonymous hate mail and people hurling abuse in
 the shop.

Others wrote to the local papers and posted remarks on Facebook calling for a boycott of the shop and its neighbours.

Assistant manager Richard Nicholson, 25, said staff had been stunned.

Traditional: The display at another butcher's in the Suffolk town of Sudbury in 1955

‘We really put a lot of effort into the window display to make it look special and attract customers,’ he said.

'It is tough trading against the big supermarkets so we are up against it already without this happening'

Richard Nicholson, JBS Family Butchers assistant manager

‘There
 have been pheasants, partridge, rabbits and even half a pig. We live in
 a market town in the countryside, so I am surprised people feel this 
way.

‘It is tough trading against the big supermarkets so we are up against it already without this happening.’

After
 the call to boycott neighbouring shops, the butcher’s replaced its 
display with a small sign saying simply: ‘Due to complaints, there is no
 window display.’

Mr Nicholson said: ‘We have had 
anonymous hate mail and people have come into the shop and said stuff. 
We feel we’ve been persecuted for being proud of our trade and 
tradition.’

In a letter to a
 local paper Ben Mowles, 34, said the ‘needless display of multiple 
mutilated carcasses’ had stopped him taking his 12-year-old daughter to 
the nearby sweet shop.

'Their display looks more like a scene from a horror movie. They even had a line of squirrels across a bar. Who eats squirrel?'

Keith Lewis, petrol station worker

‘We 
avoid the entire precinct as we’d rather not look at bloody severed 
pigs’ heads when buying sweets,’ he wrote. ‘I am asking for JBS to be 
more considerate with what they display in their window.’

Daniel
 Cudmore, 25, wrote: ‘As someone who breeds rabbits, I find the display 
of animals hanging in the window disgusting. It has continental giant 
rabbits, pigs’ heads and ducks. It must be upsetting for children who 
have animals.’

Keith Lewis, 35, a petrol station worker 
who moved to Sudbury three years ago, told the Daily Mail: ‘Their 
display looks more like a scene from a horror movie. They even had a 
line of squirrels across a bar. Who eats squirrel?

But owner John Sawyer and his right-hand man Richard Nicholson (pictured) have been so encouraged by the outpouring of support that they are determined to create a proper display in the shop window on Saturday

‘Everyone knows animals are killed to get meat but you don’t need it shoved in your face like this.’

'So-called rural Suffolk will have large numbers of townies with weekend retreats... who may be importing their values into the community'

Roger Kelsey, National Federation of Meat and Food Traders chief executive

Mother-of-three
 Kirsty Trevatt, 34, said: ‘Why can they not be like other butchers and 
put the meat that is skinned and prepared in the window? I grew up 
around here and I think the display is completely uncalled for.’

There
 has been a butcher’s on the site for more than 30 years. Pictures of 
the area show butchers standing proudly next to displays of meat as 
early as the end of the 19th century.

Roger Kelsey, chief executive of the 
National Federation of Meat and Food Traders, blamed the complaints on 
‘townies’ moving to the area.

He
 said: ‘So-called rural Suffolk will have large numbers of townies with 
weekend retreats... who may be importing their values into the 
community.’

People wrote to the local papers and posted remarks on Facebook calling for a boycott of the shop

Among those supporting the butcher was Monique Driscoll, 63, who said: ‘How is he supposed to sell anything if he cannot advertise his wares in the window?

'He is a butcher in the heart of a farming community so people should know what to expect. The displays are always colourful and impressive.’

On Facebook, Paul Felton wrote: ‘If you want to live in (the) country, put up with country habits.’

Jessica Bridges added: ‘What do people expect, it’s a butchers. At least they know where their meat is coming from.’

And James Bird wrote: ‘We are losing our grip on reality if we can’t abide being reminded where our sausages originate from (and I’m a vegan).’
