They are the faces of Britain’s lost children, with 140,000 youngsters going missing across the country each year.

And today, the Missing People charity has launched a campaign to help find them - encouraging the public to retweet a different missing child’s appeal it posts on Twitter every 30 minutes for 24 hours.

Celebrities including presenter Phillip Schofield, former rugby player Matt Dawson and model Jodie Marsh are all supporting The Big Tweet campaign, which marks International Missing Children’s Day.

Among the missing children highlighted by MailOnline today are Lucy Browne, 15, of Guildford, Surrey, who vanished on May 6, and Craig Cole, 16, of Thornton Heath, south London, on March 14.

Evelina Mazaliauskaite, 16, of Barking, east London, has not been seen since May 14, while David Kerrigan, 13, of Margate, Kent, has been missing since February 24.

Also missing is Paige Chivers, 15, of Blackpool, Lancashire, who has not been seen for seven years since August 2007. She is 5ft 5in, of slim build, and a distinctive 'Playboy Bunny' tattoo on her neck.

Police believe Paige was killed and her body disposed of, but nobody has ever been arrested - and detectives are carrying out forensic tests on almost 2,000 items seized during their investigation.

And probably the most famous missing child on the website is Madeleine McCann, originally from Rothley, Leicestershire, who vanished aged three from Praia da Luz in Portugal on May 3, 2007.

Missing People staff said the aim of the appeal today was to reach followers that may have information leading to a child being reunited with their family.

'I was so impressed by how the world of Twitter responded last year – an incredible 58,000 retweets in one day. The result? Two missing children were found. Invaluable'

Stephen Fry, Missing People patron

Last year the online event generated 58,000 retweets of appeals throughout the day, and two of the children featured were found.

The charity’s patron Stephen Fry said: ‘It is a very simple concept and there is simply no excuse not to get involved.

'Every half hour for 24 hours throughout International Missing Children’s Day, the charity will be posting Twitter appeals with the aim of finding missing children.

'By retweeting these appeals, we can all help extend the platform that might bring those children home.

‘Circulating the details of these children through the social media site is such a simple, yet incredibly effective way to give the appeals as much coverage as possible.

The Big Tweet will also encourage people public to sign up to a new Child Rescue Alert system, which will issue alerts via email and text messages when a child has disappeared and their life is at risk.

Jo Youle, Missing People chief executive, said: ‘Every year, we’re blown away by the support of the general public and the number of high profile celebrities re-tweeting our appeals, sharing messages that can help us find missing children.

‘Any one of those tweets can help us save a child’s life, so we’re urging the public to get stuck in, follow @MissingPeople, use #TheBigTweet and help us save lives on International Missing Children’s Day.’

Some 250,000 people go missing each year according to Home Office figures. And 100,000 children under 16 years old run away overnight from home or care each year in the UK.

In 2010/11, 91 per cent of missing incidents reported to the police were closed within 48 hours, with 99 per cent of all missing cases solved within one year.

Among adults, those aged 24 to 30 were the most likely to be reported missing, followed by adults aged 18 to 23. But people in the 15 to 17 age group went missing most often.
