from her daughter's phone stating she was in Fort Myers, but 
Wilkey admitted that he sent the text.

Hunt's car was discovered at about 8:30 a.m. yesterday at Life Church at Auburndale and her car keys were found in Wilkey's bedroom - his home was near the church.

Hunt who lived at home with her parents, was a 2010 graduate of Plant City High School, and worked at a bookstore.

David Wheelus, a friend of the deceased woman said she got the 'Pray for Death' tattoo for its 'shock factor' and that she was going to have another tattoo on her arm reading 'Love For Life.'
