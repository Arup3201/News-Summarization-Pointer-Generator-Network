Dogs with OCD often over-groom, suck blankets jump repeatedly (pictured) and chase their own tails obsessively

Dogs have many medical conditions in common with humans and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of them.

Canines with the condition often over-groom, suck blankets and chase their own tails obsessively.

And while humans with OCD may not share the same repetitive behaviours as dogs, scientists believe that genes causing diseases or medical conditions in dogs may also be responsible for same conditions in humans.

Helene Bäckman, the owner of a German shepherd called Texas, noticed that as a pup the dog started to jump up and bite the air repeatedly.

‘It’s like he sees something. He jumps and when he's biting, he bites hard. You can hear his teeth against each other,’ she told the BBC.

'He can do this for hours and he gets more and more stressed when he´s doing it. He never rests between jumps,' she added.

Texas’ repetitive behaviour, which includes ‘fly-catching,’ where dogs snap at thin air as if they are catching flies, was diagnosed as OCD.

Scientists think that dogs having medical conditions in common with humans meaning that they are one of the most important models for human hereditary diseases and by studying them, researchers could come up with new ways to treat human sufferers.

Professor Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, of Uppsala University in Sweden and the Broad Institute in Massachusetts, explained that it is easier to identify genes in dogs than in people, because humans have been breeding canines with specific characteristics for centuries.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour.

Unpleasant thoughts or urges can enter a person's mind and cause them anxiety, NHS Choices said.

A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to prevent an obsession coming true - for example, someone who is obsessively scared they will catch a disease might feel the need to wash their hands repeatedly.

OCD symptoms can range from mild to severe. For example, some people with OCD may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive-compulsive thinking and behaviour and for others, the condition can completely take over their life.

A number of factors are thought to trigger OCD. Evidence suggests that in some cases the condition may run in families and is linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development.

This means that disease–carrying genes are widespread in certain breeds and that they are similar genetically.

‘In
 dogs we can find [disease-causing] genes with only a few hundred sick 
and healthy dogs, whereas in people thousands of patients and controls 
are needed,’ she said.

In 2005 her team identified the genetic sequence for a female boxer dog and together with other researchers, they have found that the sequence is quite similar to humans so that genes responsible for diseases in dogs, might also cause the same conditions in humans.

In a recent study in the journal Genome Biology, the scientists identified four genes that are associated with OCD in dogs and they are trying to work out if the same genes are involved in the human condition too.

Professor Lindblad-Toh said: ‘Since the disease symptoms and medications used in dogs and people are similar, we expect that the same genes or other genes with similar functions will be responsible for the disease also in humans.’

Dogs are also susceptible to other human conditions, including epilepsy, narcolepsy, cancer, retinal degeneration and haemophilia.

The identification of the genes responsible for narcolepsy in canines has enabled scientists to find an unknown pathway in the brain and another study has led to the development of a new gene
 therapy for haemophilia.

Genetics researchers from the University of Helsinki examined OCD among 400 dogs in 2013.

Breeds such as bull terriers and German shepherds (like Texas) were particularly prone to chasing their tails, which led the researchers to believe genetics plays a role.

But then they noticed other connections. Dogs which were fed nutritional supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails, which suggested diet also figures in OCD.

Dogs that were separated particularly early from their mother or had poor care from their mother also exhibited OCD-style signs of behaviour. However the researchers found that a lack of exercise did not make any difference with tail-chasing.

supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails (illustrated),

Researcher Katriina Tiira said: ‘Tail-chasing in dogs can be used as an animal model for studying the genetic background of OCD in humans.’

Compulsive tail chasing occurs in several dog breeds, but worldwide it is most common in breeds such as Bull Terriers and German Shepherds.

The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of tail chasing in dogs, to identify possible environmental risk factors and to find out whether a previously discovered gene region associated with compulsive behaviour is also linked to tail chasing.

Blood samples were taken from the dogs participating in the study, and their owners filled out a questionnaire about their dogs' stereotypical behaviour.

One of the most interesting findings of this study was the connection with behaviour and vitamins and minerals. Dogs that received nutritional supplements, especially vitamins and minerals, with their food, chased their tails less.

‘Our study does not prove an actual causal relationship between vitamins and lessened tail chasing, but interestingly similar preliminary results have been observed in human OCD’ said Dr Tiira.

Scientists are looking at how certain vitamins and minerals in a human diet could help OCD sufferers.
