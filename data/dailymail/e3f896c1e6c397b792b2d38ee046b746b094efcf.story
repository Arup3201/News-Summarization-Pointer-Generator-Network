Russian authorities are claiming that a 3-year-old boy was killed by his adopted American mother who allegedly abused him and gave him psychiatric drugs, it was revealed today.

Russia's Investigative Committee said today that it had opened an 
investigation into the Jan. 21 death of 3-year-old Maxim Kuzmin in what could be the latest in an ongoing battle between Russia and America over adoptions.

The 
committee says it has information the boy was abused and subjected to 'inhuman treatment.'

Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused

'Inhuman treatment': Russian authorities are also saying Maxim was given psychiatric medication and are demanding to play a part in the investigation

Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death

'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, 
according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him 
psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some 
psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights
Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph.

He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs.

'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added.

Parents: The boy's adopted parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made

Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed 
the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a 3-year-old
named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West 
Texas was investigating.

Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and 
neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true.

Sgt. Gary Duesler, spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said
no arrests have been made and authorities are waiting for autopsy 
results.

An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland 
Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of 
Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia.

The boy lived with a 
family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death 
on Jan. 21, according to the obituary.

When reached by telephone, Mr Shatto told the Telegraph: 'We’re not aware of what any Russian envoy has said. We’re not making any comment.'

Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating

On the funeral home's website, Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts.

'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you.'

The death comes weeks after Russia announced it was banning all American
adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian 
human-rights violators.

The ban also reflects lingering resentment over 
the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two 
decades, of which at least 19 have died.

Russian Foreign Ministry official Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement that the boy's death was 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a Russian child adopted by American parents.'

Duesler said he could not immediately confirm or deny Russian allegations of abuse.

Dolgov also accused the U.S. Department of State of not helping Russian consular officials investigate the death.

Timing: Max's death comes weeks after Russian authorities announced it was banning all adoptions by Americans

A State Department official said the government is aware of the case and 'takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries.'

'We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas,' said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter.

Crimmins said the Russian consulate had contacted Child Protective Services.
