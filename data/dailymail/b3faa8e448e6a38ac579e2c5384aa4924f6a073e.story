With their drastically different price points and clientele, Primark and Prada should be poles apart when it comes to looking after their customers.

But it has been revealed that the two stores have one unexpected thing in common: their level of customer service.

An independent guide to London shops has awarded both retailers a rating of just two out of five for their customer service.

Not so posh: Luxury department store Prada, who show their collections on the world's most famous catwalks, have been rated the same at Primark for customer service

With the designer Bond Street store attracting the likes of Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow, with an average handbag costing around £700, customers should expect an excellent level of service.

But in fact, the research by fashion journalist Tracy Rose and her husband Russell for the third edition of their shopping guide, Fashion Fabulous London, reveals a surprisingly low score for the iconic Italian brand.

Bargain basement: Primark, which copies Prada's designs and sells them for a fraction of the price, received the same rating as the designer store

The 100-year-old brand,
 whose designs often inspire cheap product ranges by bargain retailers such as Primark, received a much worse customer service review 
than it's cheaper counterpart.

Tracy Rose, who visited the store, said: 'Once there, it seemed that the sales assistant had problems with person recognition, or maybe that she had come off a trance training course.'

Writing about her visit to the 80,000 square foot Oxford Street Primark store, she commented that the service at the till was 'actually very friendly', which led to the service rating being doubled.

The Roses carried out reviews of 200 different shops in the capital and decided that good service speaks for itself and therefore they judge it accordingly.

Tracy Rose is a milliner and a fashion journalist on BBC, lTV, Channel 4 , Five, Sky News, GMTV, London Tonight and was a diarist for London Fashion Week.

Her husband, Russell Rose, is co-editor of the Fashion Fabulous books and blog, London's top independent shopping guide.

According to Amazon.co.uk their latest book, the third edition of Fashion Fabulous London, 'is the essential guide, offering up-to-date information on how to buy fashion in London. From Bond Street to Brick Lane, this book showcases the Top 200 hottest places to buy fashion in London plus over 60 must visit stores for both sexes.'
