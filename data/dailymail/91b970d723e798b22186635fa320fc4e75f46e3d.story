High-tech 'fight cameras' which can automatically alert police when violence is about to break out on busy streets are being developed by British scientists.

The crime-fighting CCTV system will use sophisticated software to predict when a fight will happen - by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert as fists are about to fly.

Police say the the groundbreaking surveillance technology could help them detect crime 'before it happens' - much like the pre-crime unit featured in the Steven Spielberg sci-fi film Minority Report.

It does this by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert. The project is only in development at the moment but could help reduce the number of violent crimes

The million-pound project to develop the smart cameras is believed to be a world first in using CCTV to analyse people's behaviour in public.

In December it was announced police in Germany are considering adopting a similar software that predicts crimes and is named ‘Precobs’ - in a nod to the sci-fi film.

Developed by the Institute for pattern-based Prediction Technique in Oberhausen, the software programme predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur, based on different sets of data.

It is being tested by police in the southern state of Bavaria.

The German Precobs system relies on data of the location, time and other details of past crimes, such as home break-ins.

When a new incident is reported, the software analyses the data to look for a pattern that will point to a future target. 

Developed by scientists at the Violence & Society Research Group at Cardiff University, the imaging technology alerts CCTV operators and police officers when fights are detected on city centre cameras.

'Developing smart camera technology that can pinpoint violence is a really cost effective way of helping police to do their jobs,' said Professor Simon Moore.

'Officers can't monitor hundreds of city centre CCTV cameras all the time.

'By using imaging technology, officers will be alerted to violence hotspots in real-time, helping to further reduce violence.

'It's a great way of using technology to make the streets safer for all of us.'

It comes amid a surge in violent crime in England and Wales, with the number of incidents soaring by 16 per cent to nearly 700,000 incidents in figures released last month.

According to Home Office estimates, the average violence incident costs more than £33,000 ($50,700), including NHS and criminal justice costs and lost working hours.

Adrian Lee, Chief Constable of Northamptonshire and Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on alcohol and licensing, said the CCTV system would 'hopefully identify ways to automatically predict potential disorder in the night time economy so we can deploy officers to it before it happens.'

He added: 'As austerity continues in policing it is important that we work together with academia to develop an evidence base of knowledge to ensure officers and resources are deployed as effectively as possible.'

The project team is working to develop a fool-proof system which can operate at night - when most street fights take place - and recognise the complex behaviour of people in a crowd.

'Detecting violence from CCTV camera footage presents some interesting technical challenges due to the time of day, the need to operate in all weather conditions, camera positions and recognising people's often complex activities in such footage,' said Professor David Marshall, from the university's Computer Science School.

The project is a partnership between Cardiff University, Airbus Group and the Welsh Government. Airbus is developing the technological infrastructure, whilst the Welsh Government is providing funding.
