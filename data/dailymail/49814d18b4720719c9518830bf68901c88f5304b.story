Mario Balotelli appears to be somewhat of a fans' favourite among the Anfield faithful after joining the Merseyside outfit in the summer - with t-shirts being sold outside the ground with the striker's faced superimposed onto an image of Super Mario.

The t-shirt includes the slogan 'Mario Fantastcio! Mario Magnifico! Ole! Ole!'

Balotelli, or Super Mario as he also known as, geared up for the Merseyside derby by cheering about his new side after inhaling helium.

The 24-year-old will be hoping he can finish his first Merseyside derby on the winning side as Everton travel to the red half of Liverpool for Saturday's early kick off.

The Italian international is yet to hit the back of the net in the league since sealing a move back to the Premier League.

Balotelli has netted just one goal since his £16million move from AC Milan.
