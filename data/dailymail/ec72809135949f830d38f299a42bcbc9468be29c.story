It's not hard to pick the chick out in this huge colony of king penguins.

The solitary young bird stands out from the crowd as it wanders among the large group - made up of around 200,000 penguins - at the Salisbury Plain in South Georgia, USA.

While the fluffy chick is distinguishable for the rest because of its warm coat of feathers, the other penguins surrounding him are older and have the typical, black and white 'tuxedo' tone.

Spot the difference: A young chick wanders through the huge bird colony in South Georgia

Striking: The young bird struts along the older King Penguins, who look like they are dressed in 'tuxedos'

Cute: Photographer Sergey Kokinskly said he thought the chick might have been looking for his parents when he ended up in the middle of older penguins

Photographer Sergei Kokinskiy travelled from his home in Tula, Russia, to capture the special moment a young chick walked into the huge colony. 

The 49-year-old said: 'There are certain rules when visiting this part of the island.

'For example, it is forbidden to approach penguins closer than five metres, otherwise you will frighten the birds.

'One shaggy, brown bird in the photograph is a king penguin chick.

'He waits on the banks for his parents who go to the sea to get food. Returning, the parents seek out their young among the thousands of the same brown lumps.

'Perhaps the penguin was hungry and went looking for his parents and has obviously ended up in the middle of the other older penguins.

'I love the contrast between the single brown chick and the beautiful adult birds, who look like they are dressed in their 'tuxedos'.'

Baby penguins, known as woollies, keep their brown downy feathers for a year, while they develop a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm through the winter. 

King penguin chicks are cared for by their parents for around 40 days before they join a 'creche' for warmth and protection from predators. Their parents return occasionally during the winter to feed them.

Males incubate the eggs much like Emperor penguins, but King penguins do this during the warmer summer season. The female goes to the open sea to feed and return in about 21 days so the male only goes a month without food. 

Change: The King Penguin chick on the right has patchy brown feathers. Young penguins tend to have their feathers for a year
