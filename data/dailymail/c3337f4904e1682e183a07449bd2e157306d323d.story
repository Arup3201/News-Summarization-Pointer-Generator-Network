Police have released surveillance footage showing the chilling moment an armed robbery suspect opened fire on two plain clothes NYPD officers on Monday night, shooting both.

The video clearly shows the face of the unidentified man inside a store. In another frame, he goes to leave but quickly pulls out a gun and fires from inside the building as he runs towards the door.

One 30-year-old officer was shot in the left arm and the lower back. He has undergone surgery and remains in critical condition, according to the NYPD. The second officer, 38, was shot in the chest and left arm, and is listed in stable condition. Both are expected to survive.

After the shooting, the gunman and another suspect in the armed robbery fled. On Tuesday morning, they still remained at large.

'This is another indicator of the dangers our officers face in the line of duty,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said after the incident. 'Thank God, these officers will recover.' 

The police officers were near the end of their shift when they got a call for an armed robbery at a grocery store just after 10pm on Monday.

As part of a five person anti-crime team, the two plain clothes officers started searching for suspects and came across two possible suspects on Tiebout Avenue in Fordham, the NYPD said.

'These officers did something that was extraordinarily brave, and they did it as part of their commitment,' de Blasio said. 'They came off their shift. Upon hearing this call, they went back out in search of these criminals.'

One of the suspects entered a Chinese restaurant while the other stayed outside on the street. As the officers approached the man on the street, the other stormed out of the restaurant, firing on the cops, according to police.

The officers returned fire. Police believe one of the suspects was wounded.

The two suspects then fled on foot before stealing a white Camaro a block away, police said. The vehicle was later found abandoned and a black revolver was also recovered.

The officers were not targeted by the gunman, unlike two police officers who were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn two weeks ago, Deputy Chief Kim Royster said. 

The plain-clothed police officers may not have been wearing their protective vests at the time because they were finishing up their shift, CNN reported.

Their names have not yet been released.

'As always, the city of New York and the NYPD will be with them through this challenge and as these officers recover,' de Blasio said. 

Now police are looking into whether the two men were also wanted for the armed robbery that unfolded 10 minutes before the shooting.  

'We are currently reviewing video footage from both locations and will provide additional information as it becomes available,' police said in a statement.

They are also looking into whether reports of a man going to a Manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back are connected to the incident. 

Both suspects are described as Hispanic males aged between 25 and 30. One has a short beard. 

A $10,000 reward is being offered for information that will lead to their arrest and conviction.

The shooting came just hours after de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton celebrated a 4.6 per cent drop in New York City crime rates.

But Bratton conceded that the sharp rise in shootings - up 13 per cent - is 'an area of concern'.

On Sunday, thousands of officers converged to mourn the death of Officer Wenjian Liu, who was executed alongside his partner Officer Rafael Ramos in Brooklyn on December 20, 2014. Last week a ceremony was held for Ramos.

The men were killed by a gunman who said he wanted to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police officers over the summer.

After shooting the officers, the gunman took his own life.
