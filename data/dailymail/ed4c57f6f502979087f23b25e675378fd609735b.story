Senator Cory Bernadi has sparked outrage after suggesting at a domestic violence inquiry that it was sometimes okay to put women in headlocks.

The Liberal senator made the controversial claims at a Senate inquiry into domestic violence in Queensland on Thursday when he was talking about protection orders, the Courier Mail reports.

He told representatives of Queensland's oldest women's refuge, Women's House Shelta, they were not 'experts' and that there were times it was appropriate for someone to headlock their partner.

It was sparked when a support worker from Shelta, Barbara Crossing, told the hearing a man had been able to successfully take out a protection order against his partner because there was evidence she had bitten him under the arm. 

She claimed the bite could only have occurred if she had been placed in a headlock.

Mr Bernadi responded by saying Ms Crossing was second guessing police who considered headlocks to be an 'appropriate means of deterring an aggressor'.

His comments angered Greens senator Larissa Waters who argued a headlock was domestic violence.

Mr Bernadi since denied endorsing headlocks on women after backlash online over the comments.

'I never suggested violence in any form was acceptable; I merely pointed out the fact, when asked whether it is ever right to restrain someone, that law enforcement officers use appropriate restraint techniques to deter aggressors in the course of their duties,' he said in a statement.

He said 'it was inappropriate for witnesses at the inquiry to second-guess the decisions of police in granting a protection order after they had completed an appropriate investigation based on evidence'.

The Senate inquiry had earlier heard that a Queensland domestic violence hotline was overwhelmed by 300 calls a day and only had the resources to answer 120 of them.

As the calls are increasing, so too is the type of violence, according to DV Connect CEO Di Mangan.

'Most of them are serious to the point now where you think if someone doesn't have fractures or serious injuries we're actually starting to see them as not so serious,' Ms Mangan said.
