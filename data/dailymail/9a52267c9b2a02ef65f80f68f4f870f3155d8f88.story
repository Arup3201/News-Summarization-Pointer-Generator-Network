Hugh Jackman and his schoolmates are genuinely shocked, saddened and longing for justice as revelations emerge about rampant child sex abuse at their former school.

That's according to Triple M radio presenter Gus Worland, who attended the prestigious Knox Preparatory and Senior Schools on Sydney's north shore with his lifelong friend from 1978 to 1986.

The Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse has this week heard shocking evidence about the alleged paedophilia of teachers at the school between the 1970 and 2012.

Among the disturbing stories aired at the commission this week include how a paedophile teacher was commemorated on a memorial with the inscription, 'he touched us all', and how a former teacher was suspected of hiding under a boy's bed and then touching him inappropriately. 

Jackman emails his mates around the world each day about the revelations, said Worland, one third of the Grill Team breakfast show.

The commission heard the following in Sydney this week: 

'His reaction is my reaction and mates' reaction - sadness and disappointment and a want for justice for our class mates,' Worland told Daily Mail Australia. 

The radio presenter said he didn't think any of his mates had been affected by the scandal. He said the group of mates had been '100%' 'genuinely shocked' as they heard rumours while the years went by.

'I am very sad and upset for the victims and the cover up!

'None of my mates were affected I think because we perceived to be strong. They seemed to prey on the weaker guys'. 

Worland and Jackman are very interested in the testimony of Dr Ian Paterson, who was the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, most of the period under investigation.

The commission has heard from counsel of the commission David Llyod that Dr Paterson was aware of sexual abuse allegations but that there was no evidence NSW police were contacted about the incident.

'We are all dotted around the world just trying to work it all out and of course waiting for the Dr Paterson evidence,' Worland said.

'We all respected Dr P so much and were scared of him too. Jacko (Hugh) was his school captain and I was a (Senior) Prefect so we dealt with him a lot'.

A Royal Commission spokeswoman said Dr Paterson was expected to appear at hearings next week.

The commission heard evidence from a former boarding house master on Thursday, Dr Timothy Hawkes, who said he reported the 'balaclava man' incident to Dr Paterson but not to police.

According to the ABC, Dr Hawkes, now the headmaster of The King's School in Parramatta, in Sydney's west, told the commission: 'I didn't believe it was my place to do that.

'I had every confidence that the matter would be dealt with by a very experienced headmaster.

'There was absolutely no question in my mind that I fully expected the police to be notified because it was a serious offence. 

'And I was desperate to make sure that this person was caught because I did not want that happening again to any of my boys.'

Worland commented on the matter on Triple M this morning. 'He was my geography teacher,' he said.

'If he knows a balaclava'd man has been hiding under the beds of kids in his boarding house, he then takes it to his boss, I totally understand (that),' he said. 

'Where's the moral obligation to then check up the next day and check, by the way boss, you have taken it to the authorities right?' 

The commission continues. Daily Mail Australia has approached Hugh Jackman's representative for comment on the proceedings.

The child abuse royal commission has issued a warrant for the arrest of a former teacher at Sydney's Knox Grammar school who failed to turn up for a hearing.

Christopher Fotis was due to give evidence on Tuesday but did not show up.

On Thursday David Lloyd, counsel advising the commission, said police were searching for Fotis and if he was found he would be brought to the commission.

Fotis was never charged with offences at Knox but was jailed in Melbourne for sexual abuse offences at a school there after his time at Knox, in Wahroonga on Sydney's north shore.

The inquiry into the NSW private boys' school is focusing on an incident in 1988 at one of the boarding houses, MacNeil House, when a person wearing a Knox tracksuit and balaclava hid under a child's bed and sexually assaulted him.

Mr Lloyd said although the person's face was concealed by the balaclava a number of the boys in the dormitory believed the offender was Fotis.

The boys were later told police arrested the intruder - "an Asian man" - but the commission has found no evidence that police were ever informed of an intruder or a sexual assault.

Fotis left MacNeil shortly after the incident and resigned from Knox a year later when he was found by police masturbating in his car outside a school in Melbourne.
