A 200-year-old, European-inspired mansion with eight bedrooms, six bathrooms and 10 car spaces in Sydney's inner west is set to break suburban records if it sells for $9 million.

But Wellings property - which has a gate house imported from Hamburg in Germany - failed to meet the reserve price set by its owners of 24 years when the Burwood estate went under the hammer on Saturday afternoon.

The most expensive property sold in the area was set in 2010 by a six-bedroom home in Appian Way, which sold for $4,105,000, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

The mansion and its gate house, which is on the Register of the National Estate, is located at 4 Woodside Avenue in Burwood - in Sydney's inner west

Wellings' The Gate House was built before 1854 in Hamburg and was then moved to Burwood in two pieces by an Adeline Agnew

Its current owners are Frank and Marcellina Civardi who run Australian joinery manufacturers Civardi Furniture.

With the help of renowned heritage architect Lester Tropman, Mr Civardi transformed the two houses - with some parts dating back to 1813 - into the Gothic-style vision seen today.

The main house boasts an expansive kitchen decked out with granite benchtops, a commercial gas stove and finished off with European appliances.

Every room in the house has a touch of the past to channel the estate's historic connections and has nine-feet high ceilings to add to its grandeur.

The exterior matches the impressive interior, with extensive gardens sprawling across a 3,679 square-metre block of land.

The main house at Wellings is designed in a Gothic-style and is 200 years old. This is the first time it has been on the market for 24 years

Wellings' owners reserve price was $9 million and was passed in by bidders on the Saturday afternoon auction at Burwood

The Gate House - a smaller building on the property - was built before 1854 in Hamburg and is listed on the Department of Environment's Register of the National Estate.

It was selected by the then-French consul, Leonardo Etienne Bordier, at the 1854 Paris Exhibition and was then imported with three or four other buildings to be set up at Hunter's Hill - on Sydney's North Shore.

Up until 1967, it was the gate house of the French Consul General's residence, Passy, in Ferry Street.

It was then bought by Adeline Grant (nee Agnew) who was the wife of the former owner of Wellings - Dr Lindsay Grant.

The Gate House was transported in two parts to Burwood and re-built to be a main feature in the front of Wellings.

The house was restored by architect Lester Tropman - who specialises in heritage buildings and its owner Frank Civardi to reflect its rich history

Other features in the house include a billiards room, music room, pool, spacious outdoor dining area and sweeping veranda to look over its extensive grounds

Much of its original structures are still intact as it stands on a large lawn, encompassed by a paved driveway.

The building is made out of pitch pine, which comes from a resinous variety renowned for its ability to resilience to age and weathering.

It still features a lot of its original joinery and hardware, including its clipped tin verandah valance and barge boards.

But unfortunately none of these features attracted bids close enough to the $9 million reserve price set by the Civardis for the 4 Woodside Avenue property.

It is surrounded by an encompassing driveway and has its own large lawn, making it almost a standalone house by itself

The highest bid on the property on Saturday was $6 million and its real estate agent said it was negotiating with a bidder to come to an agreement

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Wellings is one of Burwood's oldest, surviving estates and only attracted a $6 million bid at its auction.

But Ray White Burwood's Janeta Biviano remains upbeat that she will be able to seal a deal soon.

She said she in talks with the bidder who lives in the next suburb over in Strathfield.

'There is plenty of interest in the property, as you can see with 15 people registering to bid,' she told Fairfax Media.

'It's just that people decided to keep their hands in their pockets on the day.'

Burwood's suburb record for most expensive property sold is $4,105,000 - set in 2010 for a six-bedroom house in Appian Way

Its six bathrooms have kept with the Gothic style of the house with wooden trimmings and vintage light fixtures

Large windows in the bedrooms give occupants the opportunity to experience the full impact of the property's expansive greenery

Each of the rooms have high ceilings and are carpeted, with lofty dimensions and include ensuite bathrooms

The property is is close to major shopping centres, elite schools, a variety of restaurants as well as train and bus stations all within walking distance
