It could be the ultimate disguise - make-up artists have transformed a black family into white people.

The result is remarkable and would even survive a very close inspection.

The experiment was carried out on a husband and wife, and the wife’s daughter, for a French TV show called Dans la peau d'un Noir (‘In a Black Person’s Skin).

Skin deep: Mrs Kitty Sina is unrecognisable after the make-up artists have worked on her

Romuald Berald, 41, Kitty Sina, 48, and Audrey Verges, 19, all had to wait extremely patiently while a team of experts set about changing their looks.

The team spent six months developing pigments and wigs, and a further ten weeks preparing the materials and testing them once the family had been chosen.

It then took several hours to apply everything.

Ultimate disguise: Audrey Verges looks completely different

At the end the family is left in shock, with their new white looks seeming entirely natural.

A white family underwent the reverse process and the show then documented how their everyday experiences differed with each skin colour.

The documentary was made by KM Le Van Kim for Canal Plus.
