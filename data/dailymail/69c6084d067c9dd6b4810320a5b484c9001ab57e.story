If you thought Amsterdam was a bike-friendly city, then think again. Each morning, the region’s train stations become swamped with a tide of wheels and frames.

And each evening, confused cyclists attempt to pick their way through the mass of metal in an attempt to find their ride in the crowded racks.

Now, a Dutch duo has invented a gadget that they claim will make finding bikes easier during the daily commute.

A Dutch-due has come up with a gadget that they claim will make finding bikes easier during the daily commute. Their device comes in the shape of a GPS bicycle bell which connects to a rider's smartphone to direct them to their bike

The bike bell gadget by Frolic uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect to a user's smartphone.

When a cyclist parks their bike and walks away, they break the bluetooth connection to their bike and the app will automatically drop a pin on the map on their phone.

This gives the general location of bike using GPS. And with BLE, users can then use their phone to even more precisely locate their bike’s position.

In the insanity of these bike parking lots, this may still not be enough. So Frolic have added the ability to remotely ring the bike bell directly from an app on the user's smartphone.

Their device comes in the shape of a GPS bicycle bell which connects to a rider’s smartphone to direct them to their bike.

It even rings out loud as the rider’s smartphone gets close – letting the owner known exactly where they parked their ride.

Andrew Spitz and Ruben van der Vleuten, who are behind the Amsterdam-based design consultancy Frolic, were able to make a fully-functional prototype of their idea in just one day.

They started with a regular bike bell then removed all the components in the interior. They then added back in custom electronics and 3D-printed parts.

The system connects to an iPhone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Walking away after from the bike drops a pin on to the smartphone's map, allowing GPS to guide the rider back.

‘In the insanity of these bike parking lots, this may still not be enough as you often stand right by your bike and have difficulties spotting it,’ the duo write on their website.

‘This is why we added the ability to remotely ring your bell directly from the app. This makes it easy to find your bike using your ears instead of your cluttered sense of sight.’

From the outside, the device looks like an ordinary bike bell making it less likely to be stolen by thieves.

‘It was a challenge to get all the elements working in such a short time - the iPhone App as well as the hardware,’ Mr Spitz told MailOnline.

‘On top of that was the size. It was not easy to cramp all this technology inside the casing of a bell, but we managed to do so and it all functioned very well.’

The device is currently only a prototype and there are no plans to commercialise it.

The chaos caused by overflowing bike racks around Dutch train stations is set to get worse, according to a recent report by Netherlands' railway infrastructure company, ProRail.

Around half a million people in the Netherlands currently cycle to their local train station each day, amounting to about 40 per cent of all train passengers.

'It was a challenge to get all the elements working in such a short time - the iPhone App as well as the hardware,' Mr Spitz told MailOnline. Pictured is the exterior of the bell being fitted on the device
