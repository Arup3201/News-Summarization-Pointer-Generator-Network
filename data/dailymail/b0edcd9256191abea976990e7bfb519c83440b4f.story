A father-of-three has collapsed and tragically died in front of his family during a Boxing Day rugby match.

Vincent Francis, 48, had substituted himself off the pitch at the Caerau Ely RFC match in Cardiff when he felt unwell but he collapsed on the side line with a suspected heart attack soon after.

His daughter Sophie, 20, and other family members who were also watching the game, rushed to his side and despite treatment from paramedics, Mr Francis could not be saved.

The father, who lived in Ely, Cardiff had come out of rugby retirement to play the friendly match. 

Club chairman and lifelong friend Mike Meredith said: ‘I spoke to him in the changing rooms before the game.

‘He was fine and looking forward to playing and looking forward to getting on the pitch.

‘He made a quip saying it was no excuse me not playing because I had my baby grandson with me.

‘I didn't see him collapse because my grandson was getting fractious so I'd walked away with him. He had just come off the pitch substituted and felt a bit ill and collapsed on the side line. It was a suspected heart attack.'

‘He was a personal friend. It is a sad loss to the club and we will all miss him.’

Known by his team mates as ‘Vince the Prince,’ Mr Francis had played for Caerau Ely RFC in Cardiff for 30 years, joining as a teenager, and playing and coaching as a senior.

He played regular first team rugby until last year and had pulled his boots back on to take part in the club's annual Boxing Day match between the senior and junior teams.

Mr Meredith said: ‘He was always there at the club, everybody knew him.

‘He was just an ordinary bloke who loved his rugby and his family. He was a nice bloke. He was a Wales and Cardiff supporter.’

Mr Francis, who was widowed several years ago, worked for Rentokil. 

He leaves daughter Sophie, and sons James, 24, a Welsh Guardsman, and Ross, 18.

James has played for the Caerau Ely RFC first XV alongside his beloved father.

Close friend John Lovell, who was playing alongside Mr Francis during the game, said he was a great supporter of the local club.

He said: ‘A lot of people called him “Vince the Prince”. He was a good-looking chap and he also had the gift of the gab.

‘He was definitely a cheeky chappy, but he was also a great player who was a member of the club for 30 years.

‘He has been one of the longest serving players and he was still playing up until last year. His family are doing okay but it will take some time to get over such a tragedy.’

Mr Francis became captain of Caerau Ely RFC Youth in 1983 and starred as outside half for the first team.

He was the club captain between 1992 and 1995 and remained involved in the club as assistant coach and backs coach.

A minute's silence was held at Caerau's home match on Saturday.
