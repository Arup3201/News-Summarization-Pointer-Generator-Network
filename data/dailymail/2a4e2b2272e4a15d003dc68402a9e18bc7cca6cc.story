Newcastle United won their third pre-season match in a row as an Ayoze Perez strike gave them a 1-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.

The young Spanish striker, who was signed in the summer from Tenerife, coolly slotted home after 66 minutes to give Newcastle victory in a closely-fought encounter.

The Magpies will travel to Germany this weekend for a pre-season tournament hosted by Schalke and this was the perfect preparation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch both sets of fans pay tribute to John Alder and Liam Sweeney

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY: Kirkland, Palmer (Young 83), Mattock (Floro 81), Hutchinson (McCabe 61), Loovens, Kelhar (Antonio 46), Maguire (Contout 61), Madine, Nuhiu (Croasdale 75), Coke (Betra 75), Maghoma (Zayatte 46).

Goal: Perez (66). 

Geordie Gary Madine was playing for Wednesday, and he blazed the game's first real chance over the bar after 17 minutes.

Madine was the home side's most dangerous player, forcing a brilliant reaction save from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot on the half-hour mark as Wednesday started the brighter of the two sides.

The Geordie striker chipped on to the roof of the net before Sam Hutchinson smashed a long-range shot against the bar as Wednesday continued to pepper Newcastle's goal, but to no avail. 

Emmanuel Riviere, Alan Pardew's summer signing from Monaco, almost broke the deadlock after 24 minutes when his stinging shot grazed past the post. 

After the break the away side started the sharpest, with young Geordie striker Adam Armstrong firing a shot just wide of Chris Kirkland's goal.

And it was a new signing, Spanish youngster Ayoze Perez, who opened the scoring after 66 minutes.

Paceman Gabriel Obertan threaded through the young striker, who calmly slotted past Kirkland to give Newcastle the lead. 

Wednesday should have equalised with 12 minutes remaining but substitute Franck Betra smashed wide from six yards.

But Newcastle held on to grab another victory.

There was chants of 'Hatem Ben Arfa' from Magpies supporters as they became frustrated with Obertan's elevation into the line-up while their mercurial French playmaker once again did not even make the squad.

The Newcastle players wore black armbands to commemorate the eve of the five-year anniversary of Sir Bobby Robson's passing on July 31, 2009.

Both sets of supporters also sang 'There's only one Bobby Robson' throughout the game.

Newcastle fans unveiled banners in honour of the two fans who died during the MH17 Malaysia Airlines disaster.

One banner in memory of Liam Sweeney and John Alder read: 'Death ends a life - not a relationship.'

In a poignant moment, the scoreboard at Hillsborough also posted the message: 'RIP Liam Sweeney and John Alder - you'll never be forgotten.'
