A care home worker was jailed and two of his colleagues received non-custodial sentences after they admitted ill-treating a 79-year-old dementia sufferer.

Bristol Crown Court was shown video showing a distressed Gladys Wright being pushed, shoved and pulled on a number of occasions, while subjecting her to a tirade of verbal abuse.

Daniel Baynes, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a 'nasty aggressive bitch' and telling each other to 'f*** her', throughout the recordings.

Mrs Wright is clearly distressed as a member of staff pins the frail 79-year-old pensioner to her bed

Bristol Crown Court was shown video showing a distressed Gladys Wright being pushed, shoved and pulled on a number of occasions

On one 
occasion Baynes, 24, attempts to force Mrs Wright’s eyes open, while on 
another pushes the clearly distressed pensioner onto the bed, while 
attempting to change her, before applying his weight on her legs to hold
 her down.

Salnikow,
 25, while changing Mrs Wright for bed, is shown to hold the nape of her
 neck before forcing her backwards into her chair by grabbing her chin.

Incredibly the appalling treatment only came to light after Mrs Wright’s son, James, placed a hidden camera in the room.

Mrs Wright's son set up a video in her mother's room and caught staff abusing the 79-year-old

He
 set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was 
receiving in the specialist Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North 
Somerset, was unlike the horror stories he had read about.

He was so disturbed by what he saw he immediately took the footage to police.

The
 men, who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence 
came to light, pleaded guilty to the abuse, which took place in October 
and December 2012.

Baynes,
 of Bath, was handed four months behind bars after admitting three 
counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity, and 
another of theft after he was caught stealing Mrs Wright’s food.

Salnikow,
 of Southmead, Bristol, who practised yoga while in the dock, was given 
two months in prison, suspended for two years after admitting three 
counts of ill-treatment.

Gladys Wright, pictured at her home in Bristol around 1990, was subjected to ill-treatment  in the weeks after  she moved into the Granary care home in north Somerset to due to her worsening dementia

Daniel Baynes, was today  jailed for four months by Bristol Crown Court after admitting three ill-treating Mrs Wright and stealing her food, left. Baynes, right, earlier told Police that  he was 'absolutely disgusted' by himself

Gidaszewski, of Nailsea, north Somerset, was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work for admitting one count of the same.

Sentencing
 them at Bristol Crown Court, Judge Michael Longman said: 'You were 
employed as carers. This was in breach of a most basic duty of care and 
humanity which you had all undertaken to perform.

'Nothing 
about her behaviour or the environment in which you worked excuses your 
behaviour against a very vulnerable patient in your care.'

Despite the sentences however Mr Wright believes nothing will change until 24 hour CCTV is placed in all homes.

Speaking afterwards he said: 'I wish I recorded nothing but good behaviour. That would have been the best outcome.

'I had no reason to believe there would be problems, because she wouldn’t have gone there in the first place.

'I
 believe we’ll be seeing many more instances of the abuse of vulnerable 
individuals and know this will not improve until we see the 
implementation of CCTV in these homes.'

The court 
heard Mrs Wright was first admitted to the home in September 2012 after 
her family were no longer able to provide her with the care she needed 
for her severe advanced dementia.

The Granary Care Home, a specialist dementia centre, is owned and run by Shaw Healthcare, and has room for up to 60 sufferers.

Kerry
 Barker, prosecuting, said: 'After about three weeks Mrs Wright’s son 
placed a covert camera in her room at the care home in order to assure 
himself that his mother was receiving appropriate care.

'The covert footage shows that on particular occasions they ill-treated Mrs Wright.

James Wright installed the secret camera in his mother's room at the Granary care home in Wraxall, North Somerset. When he discovered the abuse he handed 57 DVDs to police who launched a criminal investigation

Janusz Salnikow, left received a two-month prison sentence suspended for two years while Tomaz Gidaszewski right was sentenced to 180 hours unpaid work after they admitted ill-treating the pensioner

Watching the footage was a difficult and upsetting experience for Mr Wright.

'Watching his mother being ill-treated by people who were supposed to be caring for her remains a distressing memory.'

Mr Wright was so appalled by what he saw he immediately confronted the home, who told him it was against Mrs Wright’s 'dignity' to put the cameras in her room.

He then handed the 57 DVDs to police, in January 2013, which lead to the arrest of the three men.

Mr Barker added: 'The police investigation revealed that care workers in the home had been recruited without any previous experience. Janusz Slanikow had been recruited by the company in his native Poland.

'Wages were low and there were often staff shortages.'

A Care Quality Commission inspection, carried out during the criminal investigation, also found there were concerns about the quality of care and support given at the Granary home.

Gladys Wright, pictured with her partner Ken Jones left was admitted to the Granary in September 2012 after her dementia worsened

In interview Baynes said his behaviour 'was not acceptable and embarrassing to watch', before adding he was 'absolutely disgusted' with himself.

Martin Bloor, defending him said: 'He is under no illusions how serious these matters are and he wishes to express his apologies to the victim and her family.'

Salnikow told officers on occasions there would be only three carers and a nurse to 30 residents and said he was 'not proud' of what he had been shown.

Virginia Cornwall said he had acted out of 'frustration'.

Stephen Mooney, for Gidaszewski, said his client was 'mortified by what he had done'.

Jeremy Nixey, chief executive officer of Shaw Healthcare, said: 'We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any unkind or disrespectful behaviour to anyone in our care and that is why, when we were first advised by a relative of incidents of poor care towards their family member, we immediately referred the matter to the Police and North Somerset Council.

'All three individuals involved in this case have not worked at The Granary since we were made aware of the incidents.

'We understand that this must have been a difficult time for the family, which we are extremely sorry for.

'We hope that today will bring some closure for them and we are pleased that these individuals have been brought to justice today.

'As the judge pointed out, the actions of these three individuals were not typical of care at The Granary.

'Since these incidents came to our attention, a new area and home manager have been appointed to oversee the implementation of an action plan looking at every aspect of the service provided at The Granary.'
