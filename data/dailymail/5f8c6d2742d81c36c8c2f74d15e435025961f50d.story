These tiny turtles seem to be trying their best to bring back the shell suit in these miniature tank tops.

The Australian green sea turtles had their bespoke suits individually designed by a university scientist to assist with his research.

The baby turtles' Lycra 'sun safe' green vests were made from offcuts from children's swimsuits after Dr David Booth asked his wife to mock up a couple of prototypes to dress his turtles in.

Now that's a shell suit! These adorable handmade teeny turtle tops are giving a new life to style under the sea

Dr Booth, 55, said: 'The stunning fluorescent green makes the images so striking but how they came about is quite random.

'My wife was making 'sun safe' swimsuits for our eight-year-old twins at the time - and this material was scrap remnants in the cupboard when I went looking for some Lycra.

'I wanted Lycra because of is elastic stretching properties.

'If the swimsuits had been made from a dull brown Lycra, the turtle vests would have been a dull brown as well - but these are far more appealing.'

The study needed a number of snug fit vests to wrap around the turtles and ensure that accurate readings were measured - as well as illustrate the cute costumes created

Biologist Dr Booth has been studying 
the effects of nest temperature and global warming on reptiles - he 
believes that a rise in temperatures may be leading to the deaths of 
many newborn turtles.

Together
with his team at the University of Queensland, David began research in 
2006 to investigate how rising temperatures may influence how strong 
hatchlings are when they are born.

They found that warmer nest temperatures not only effect a turtle's swimming ability but also its sex when born.

Dr Booth, 54, said: 'We were somewhat surprised to find that nest temperature had a larger effect on swimming performance than water temperature.

'We swam our sea turtle hatchlings in individual tanks, and measured the forward thrust they produced with each swim stroke.

'Each hatchling was fitted with a swimming vest and the vest to help measure a hatchling's swimming performance.

'If the climate continues to warm as is predicted, and if we want to preserve sea turtle populations at their current level at their current locations, then some sort of active management will need to be implemented.'

The study needed a number of snug fit vests to wrap around the turtles and ensure that accurate readings were measured - as well as illustrate the cute costumes created.
