A supercar fan has created a road-legal Formula 1 lookalike and now happily drives it around town.

Miso Kuzmanovic spent about 1,000 hours and £20,000 building the car which looks like it belongs on a Formula 1 racetrack rather than on town roads.

While the two-seat streamlined vehicle is the same colour as Michael Schumacher’s Ferrari, it doesn't quite reach the same top speed of 240mph but can still clock an impressive 110mph.

Mr Kuzmanovic, an engineer from Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina, decided to make the car after attending a Formula 1 exhibition.

He created the shell of the car before attaching a 2.0 litre Mercedes-Benz engine and gear box.

The 46-year-old said: ‘My close friends ride motorbikes and they asked me if I wanted to ride with them but I decided to create something new and different and went to Belgrade in Serbia for a Formula 1 exhibition.

His dream car: Mr Kuzmanovic spent £20,000 and 1,000 hours creating the two-seater car which can reach speeds of 110mph

‘The cars on show impressed me but I thought I wouldn't be able to afford to make one.

‘After a lot of thought and consideration, I decided to go for it and build my dream car.

‘The car is road legal in Bosnia and Herzegovina and I am registered and legally drive it every day.’

The father-of-two started by making the shell of the car and then had to attach the engine and gearbox.

He said: ‘Everyone was enthusiastic about the idea. It didn't take me long to create the shell of the car.

‘Then all I had to do was assemble and attach the gearbox and engine.

‘I had the support of my friends and family who helped me out and in total, the production only took two years.’

Mr Kuzmanovic was determined to finish the unique car and dedicated a lot of his time to the car.

He continued: ‘I spent hours in my workshop and I'd try not to disturb others as they would have stayed up late into the night until two or three in the morning.

'Everyone loves it': Mr Kuzmanovic said he loves driving his unique creation and that most people were surprised by how good it looks

‘The car took up most of my free weekends - in total I spent around 1,000 hours making the car.’

The car is fitted with a state-of-the-art sound system and a 300-watt power amplifier.

It has a 2.0 litre Mercedes-Benz engine with two carburettors and Mr Kuzmanovic is delighted with the end product.

Mr Kuzmanovic: ‘The vehicle was not built for racing - I wanted to enjoy the car and love taking it out on the roads.

‘Most people can't believe that I've finished it and they are all surprised with how good it looks, everyone loves it.’
