Andre Schurrle insists Germany can deal with the pressure of becoming world champions for a fourth time.

The Chelsea forward, who scored a clever opening goal against Algeria to help them through to the quarter-final clash with France, is convinced they have the qualities.

Schurrle said: ‘When you come to a World Cup with Germany you are expected to win it.

'We don’t just come here to take part. When you have a team with these players, everyone in our country has big expectations.

'That is always the way. We have big expectations and we have that feeling more than ever now that we are in the last eight. We don’t think about the pressure on the field, we just think about our duels.’

Schurrle also admitted that Brazil remain favourite to win their sixth World Cup after setting up a quarter-final against Columbia in Fortaleza.

He added: ‘Brazil are still one of the favourites even if they are not at their best. They can still improve because they are playing at home and they have the players.

‘France are our neighbours and our rivals. Of course it is going to be a nice game. If we want to win the World Cup, we will have to do it the hard way.’
