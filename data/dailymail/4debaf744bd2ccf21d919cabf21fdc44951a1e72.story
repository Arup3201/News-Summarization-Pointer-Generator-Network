Family members of Nigella Lawson were yesterday seen delivering clothes to the Mayfair flat where she is staying, as the TV chef faces a second week away from husband Charles Saatchi.

It comes as 53-year-old Nigella told friends she wants to rebuild her troubled relationship with millionaire art collector Mr Saatchi and insisted: ‘I am not some sort of battered wife.’

She has confided that although she has no current plans to return home from the £10,000-a-week apartment in central London, she is still in love with her husband.

As she faces a second week away from Mr 
Saatchi, 70, friends have said she wants him to undergo anger management
 therapy or counselling to control his volatile moods.

In the first insight into the anguish that Nigella is suffering, a close friend said: ‘She desperately loves Charles and says he is her world.

‘She feels that if he would look at getting some sort of help, anger management or therapy then they can work at rebuilding their relationship.

'As in any marriage, there are issues and problems that arise, and he is under a huge amount of pressure and stress. But she feels she is never going to be able to live this down and move on.’

The Mail on Sunday has been told that Nigella would never have left the £14million family home if images of her husband grabbing her by the throat outside celebrity restaurant Scott’s had not been published.

The friend said: ‘Nigella feels her hand has been forced. She would not have left if the incident had stayed private.’

Photographer Jean-Paul, who took the pictures of Nigella being throttled by Saatchi, said he was originally expecting to simply take a picture of the TV chef leaving the restaurant.

But he told the Sunday People: ‘I was sitting reading the paper but keeping an eye out to make sure I didn’t miss them leaving. Then suddenly I saw Nigella’s head jolt backwards. I thought “this is odd”.

‘I put the camera up to my face to look through the lens and I saw his left hand on her throat, so I started taking pictures. From that moment on I kept taking pictures, and there were 27 minutes of it.

‘When I saw the very first pictures, I thought “he can’t be doing this”. I was in complete disbelief.’

Nigella has fled to a £10,000-a-week Mayfair apartment where she is struggling to consider the best way forward for herself and her two teenage children, and decide whether the couple has a future.

The friend added that while Nigella has not consulted divorce lawyers  she feels desperately exposed by the public scrutiny. They added: ‘Nigella feels frustrated that the whole world has an opinion about something she feels is a private situation.’

Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault following the publication of the damning pictures last Sunday, which he initially tried to dismiss  as ‘a playful tiff’. But the incident sparked an outcry.

It was raised in the House of Lords on Friday, as Nigella’s father Lord Lawson looked on, when Lord Avebury asked: ‘Do you think that the leniency shown to Mr Saatchi when he half-strangled his wife set the wrong tone?’

But as the public debate rages,  Nigella is craving privacy and quiet, and is tormented over how to proceed. Friends say the removal of her wedding ring last week was merely a sign of her confusion as she struggles to cope under the nationwide scrutiny of her most private relationship.

Most of Nigella’s family, especially her father Nigel and sister Horatia, are said to be furious that Saatchi has created this hugely embarrassing storm. Publicly they have refused to comment, but privately they are believed to have urged her not to return to him.

Her brother Dominic, former editor of The Spectator, does not wish to comment. But author Kathy Lette, who is close to the couple, was outspoken. ‘I’m not talking to Charles,’ she said. ‘He’s behaved appallingly.  I can’t believe that after so many years in the public relations business he’s handled this so badly.’

Divorce lawyer Vanessa Platt, who has represented many women who want to leave abusive relationships, was surprisingly supportive of Nigella’s private desire to save her marriage. She said: ‘When a high-profile woman is in a situation with a controlling  husband, people usually wonder why she won’t leave him.

‘But pressure from family and the press can be very overwhelming and doesn’t always help the situation. It can make it difficult for them to make a decision. I always recommend that the couple go for counselling.’

Platt suggests that Saatchi may have a narcissistic personality. ‘If it is the case he has anger issues, then he must see a specialist to get help. Nigella is right to insist that is a requirement for the marriage to continue.’

Baroness Fiona Shackleton, who  represented Prince Charles in his  1996 divorce from Diana and Sir  Paul McCartney in his 2008 divorce from Heather Mills, is a relative of Nigella’s and someone she might turn to for advice should divorce become  unavoidable.

The couple are not believed to have signed a prenuptial agreement.

Saatchi’s former wife, American Kay Saatchi, the mother of their 19-year-old daughter Phoebe, has previously said he was an ‘appalling bully’ but last week issued a statement saying: ‘While Charles has always had his faults, I never experienced him to be physically abusive.

‘He may be hard work, but I feel he is being treated unfairly.’

Brian Basham, a former business associate, said Saatchi had gone from a sweet and humble genius to becoming a ‘monster’ and a ‘deeply unpleasant man’. They fell out over a business deal in the late 1990s.

‘He was the most brilliant advertising man,’ he said. ‘Back then he was warm and nice, but it is almost as if the more successful he became, the meaner be got.

‘I sometimes wonder what went wrong and whether some personal disappointment turned him into the man he became.’

Nigella, it seemed, was one of the few people able to charm him back to good humour. Yet in spite of her high-voltage radiance, she is a woman who admits she is driven by a desperate desire to please. ‘I am so pathetic  I even crave the approval of my toothbrush,’ she once said.

It is not only the personal humiliation that is said to be worrying Nigella.

The daughter of former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson  and Vanessa Salmon, a socialite  and heiress to the Lyons Corner House empire, Nigella has admitted that she was often beaten by her bipolar mother.

Her friendship with Charles Saatchi began before the 2001 death of her husband, journalist John  Diamond, to whom she had been married for ten years.

That year she moved in to Saatchi’s Belgravia mansion with her children Cosima, now 19, and Bruno, now 17. She was already a household name following the publication of her first cookery book, How To Eat, in 1998. She was named author of the year for her 2000 follow-up, How To Be A Domestic Goddess.

Her television cooking shows made her a star.

Although Diamond saw her full potential – supervising her ‘makeover’ and persuading her to wear more glamorous clothes and make-up – it was Saatchi who saw her become a superstar.  

According to friends, none of whom wanted to be named, Saatchi made himself indispensable to  Nigella when her husband was dying. ‘He saw her as Mother Theresa, struggling to cope with two small children, and he rode in like Sir Galahad to rescue the situation.’

He met her at a private dinner and was immediately totally captivated. But as her career flourished he apparently became less comfortable. ‘Charles prides himself on being the lone wolf, the enabler,’ said a friend who knows the couple well. ‘He grew frustrated as he had less and less control over her.’

Another friend said: ‘It appears Nigella has had to put up with a shedload more at home than she  will ever let on. She has to be capable for her children. She wants to be remembered as a nurturer, not some weak, needy woman.’

The current debacle has added strain to a relationship that has  been rumoured to be in trouble  for some time. But it is not only the personal humiliation that is said to be worrying Nigella.

Her new success in America, where she found fame with the television reality show The Taste last January, could now be vulnerable.

A spokesman for Nigella refused to comment last night.
