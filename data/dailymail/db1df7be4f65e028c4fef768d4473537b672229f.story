Thousands of British tourists  heading to Cyprus for Easter have been told to take bundles of cash with them – and to make sure they are adequately protected against thieves.

The Foreign Office amended its advice as officials warned the island had just ‘hours’ to prevent financial collapse. With the banks closed, long queues at cashpoints and reports that retailers are starting to refuse payments by debit and credit card, official advice is now to take enough cash to ‘cover the duration of your stay, alongside appropriate security precautions against theft’.

For many families, this will mean taking thousands of euros in cash and being on constant guard against robbery.

But with the Foreign Office still not issuing formal travel restrictions, worried tourists will be unable to claim the cost of their holiday on insurance if they decide to cancel. Labour MP John Mann last night condemned the advice as a ‘recipe for muggings’.

He said: ‘As always the Government seem to be a few steps behind – advising people to take large amounts of cash to a place where people are desperate for it is an open invitation to criminals.’

Last night MPs in Cyprus approved a ‘national solidarity fund’ to ease the country’s banking crisis, and imposed new capital controls to prevent a run on the island’s troubled banks.

These are the first of a series of laws intended to raise the money it needs to qualify for a bailout.The EU is demanding that Cyprus raises £4.8billion before it will agree an £8.5billion package for the banks, which have been crippled by bad loans to Greece.

Out in force: Today Cypriot authorities were putting the final touches to a plan they hope will convince international lenders to provide the money the country urgently needs

A plan to levy a charge on all bank deposits was rejected by Cypriot MPs this week, plunging the rescue plan into chaos. Last night they were close to a compromise centred on a levy on those holding over €100,000. It could be limited to a 20 per cent tax on large deposits at the island’s biggest lender, Bank of Cyprus.

Experts had indicated that Cyprus’s politicians were buckling under pressure from Germany to raid the deposits of foreign savers and the better-off. Christopher Pissarides, a Nobel prize-winning economist who is advising the president, said: ‘It looks like they may be able to reach a compromise tonight, or possibly tomorrow morning. But it won’t be a good one.’ 

He said the tough German stance was causing resentment. ‘We have been given an ultimatum that unless we reach a solution there will be no more money for the banks and the whole economy will collapse.’

The plans need to be in place by Monday, when the European Central Bank has said it will cut off emergency support to the banks. That could trigger their collapse and devastate the economy, potentially pushing Cyprus out of the euro.

The worsening situation came on the first anniversary of the eurozone’s banking chief Mario Draghi boasting that the crisis in the single currency was ‘over’.

Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday warned that the EU’s botched handling of the situation risked setting off a wave of bank runs in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.

David Cameron discussed the worsening situation during a half-hour telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russian citizens, including some oligarchs and criminals, are reported to have £17billion deposited in Cypriot banks. But Cypriot efforts to clinch a contribution from Russia yesterday appeared to have failed.sits. Banks have remained closed for fear of queues of depositors withdrawing their savings.
