Emmanuel Adebayor has backtracked after his extraordinary rant against Tottenham supporters to insist he merely meant the players 'respond better to praise than criticism'.

The Tottenham striker attacked fans on Sunday for not making the team feel welcome at White Hart Lane during their Barclays Premier League defeat against Stoke.

And the 30-year-old, with five goals in 22 games, has urged them to get behind the team because the negative atmosphere does not help.

Emmanuel Adebayor has urged Tottenham Hotspur fans to get behind the team after his rant on Sunday

Adebayor admitted he preferred playing away rather than at home on Sunday following defeat against Stoke

Emmanuel Adebayor after Tottenham lost 2-1 against Stoke on Sunday said: 

‘When you are playing in front of your own crowd you want them to support you, but now it is like going through a sad moment and your family not welcoming you home. 

‘That’s the worst thing ever because you have nowhere to go. At the moment I don’t know whether we should play at home or whether we should play away.

‘At least you know I am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me (at Hull in their next game) rather than our own fans booing me. 

'And I am not just talking about me, I am speaking on behalf of all the players.

‘I think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win.

‘But when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder.'

'I just merely suggested that it would be more positive if they got behind the team more,' Adebayor tweeted on Tuesday evening.

'I love the club as do all the players in the dressing room. 

'We would all do anything to make this team win but like most people we respond better to praise than criticism.

'We will get this right. Please bear with us and we will improve.' 

The Togo international came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, having lost his place in the starting XI to 21-year-old striker Harry Kane. 

The former Manchester City striker afterwards described the  atmosphere at White Hart Lane as like 'your family not welcoming you home'.

He claimed he was 'speaking on behalf of all the players' but has now insisted on Twitter that he 'never criticised Tottenham fans'.

Spurs have the international break to reboot, with their next Premier League match coming against Hull City at the KC Stadium on November 23.

But they will be without Kyle Naughton after Tottenham's appeal against the full-back's red card for a trip on Stoke forward Victor Moses was dismissed.

Naughton will serve an immediate two-match ban and miss the visit of Everton on November 30, too.
