Reality television star Brynne Edlesten has finally moved out of the penthouse apartment she shared with ex-husband Geoffrey, her manager has confirmed.

The 'palatial' flat in the Paramount building, in central Melbourne, was filled with tension in recent months with the feuding former couple stepping on each others' toes in the luxury one-bedroom abode.

But it seems Brynne has finally found peace.

'She's moved from the apartment,' her manager Rob Menzies told MailOnline.

'At least she's in the process of moving. I've got nothing else to add.'

The 31-year-old buxom blonde officially split with multi-millionaire medical entrepreneur, 70, in January.

Their highly-publicised split was played out in the press across Australia.

Their marital apartment was described in Woman's Day earlier this year as a 'virtual war zone' in a published interview with Geoffrey.

In a New Idea interview in February Brynne said the divorce had left her so broke she was unable to attend her grandmother's funeral.

'I asked if Geoff was willing to help me with airfares to get to the funeral, but he wasnâ€™t,' she told the publication.

Brynne has moved into a flash new Melbourne pad which is rumoured to be the result of a divorce settlement, something denied by her manager.

He refused to confirm if she had bought, or is renting, the new apartment.

Meanwhile, her ex-husband Geoffrey is believed to be staying in a luxury hotel in Los Angeles and has reportedly been seen with a mystery woman.

'He's in a five star hotel in Beverly Hills,' a source told MailOnline.

Mr Menzies said neither her nor his client Brynne were prepared to comment on Geoffrey's movements.

The My Bedazzled Life star has seemingly had little difficulty in finding romance post-Geoffrey, who she married in 2009.

On Sunday she was snapped snuggling up to Australian cricket star James Pattinson in St Kilda.

The week before she was photographed kissing club promoter Alex Roberts in Melbourne's Eve nightclub.

The high-profile Melbourne socialite has told friends she is using her partying ability to move on after her messy divorce.
