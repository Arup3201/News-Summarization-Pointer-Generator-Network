The director of one of America’s largest spy agencies is catching flack for once working from a war room built with American tax dollars to mimic a fantastical space ship.

Keith Alexander heads up the National Security Agency and in addition to a lot on controversial revelations about his organization, a recent profile of the top spy says that when he ran the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, it was from the captain’s chair of the starship USS Enterprise.

Specifically, from the Enterprise of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. And the eccentric director known as ‘a cowboy’ reportedly used the odd room to woo lawmakers and other important officials who coveted the chance to play captain.

Make it so! While heading up the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Keith Alexander gave orders from a room designed to look like the bridge of Star Trek's Enterprise

Though it focuses a great deal on issues like the PRISM program uncovered by Ed Snowden’s major information leak, a profile of Alexander in Foreign Policy couldn’t help but include details about his old war room in Fort Belvoir.

Designed by a Hollywood set designer to mimic the famous ship’s bridge, Alexander’s base of operations in the Fairfax County, Virginia Army base was ‘complete with chrome panels, computer stations, a huge TV monitor on the forward wall,’ according to the profile.

The television displayed sensitive national security photos and information, but was so placed to look like the all-important Enterprise bridge screen on which the comings and goings of outer space would be displayed.

Excessive? The odd room featured a giant monitor at the front, just like the fantastical starship's. Also like the Enterprise, the doors made a 'whoosh' sound when they opened

There were even sound effects.

Just
 like in the Star Trek series, the doors to the so-called Information 
Dominance Center war room made a ‘whoosh’ noise as they opened.

‘Though
 it’s no surprise from a man described as ‘a techno-spy since the 
beginning of his military career,’ an audio component could seem 
excessive to some since tax dollars paid for the facility.

Instead of Vulcans and Klingons, high ranking government officials stepped on and off Alexander’s bridge.

Aye, sir: Now he's the leader of the embroiled NSA, an organization whose name has become synonymous with domstic spying since revelations that followed the Edward Snowden leak

‘When he was running the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Alexander brought many of his future allies down to Fort Belvoir for a tour of his base of operations,’ a source told Foreign Policy.

‘Lawmakers and other important officials took turns sitting in a leather 'captain's chair' in the center of the room and watched as Alexander, a lover of science-fiction movies, showed off his data tools on the big screen.’

The source, who was once in charge of VIP visits to the war room, revealed that Alexander used the remarkable space to help him woo officials.

'Everybody wanted to sit in the chair at least once to pretend he was Jean-Luc Picard,' said the source.
