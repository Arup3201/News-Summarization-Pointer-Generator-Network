Speaking out: Lady Justice Heather Hallett said that the pace of working life needed to change to help women

A senior woman judge has called for an end to the ‘frenetic’ working environment as she fears it holds women back.

Lady Justice Hallett, who is in the running to become the next Lord Chief Justice, said that society’s priorities need to change.

She said that we need to look at peoples quality of life, adding: 'I want to see a time when the Prime Minister is criticised for not spending time with his family on a Sunday.’

The mother-of-two said that women were put off becoming judges or senior partners in law firms as the hours are not conducive to a family life, reported The Times.

She believes that there needs to be a change of culture, and that politicians should not just talk about changing working hours for women to be equal in the workplace.

She said at a question-and-answer session held at the London School of Economics: ‘Even if you have a very modern partner, the chances are the burden of caring responsibilities – be it children when you are relatively young, or aging relatives when older – [will fall on the woman].’

Lady Justice Hallett is also deputy president of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court and has put her name forward for the lord Chief Justice role.

She couldn’t deny that she wanted the job, adding that she thought: ‘It is probably one of the best jobs in the world.’

The position becomes available when Lord Judge steps down at the end of September. Lord Justice Leveson and Sir John Thomas who is currently president of the Queen’s Bench.
