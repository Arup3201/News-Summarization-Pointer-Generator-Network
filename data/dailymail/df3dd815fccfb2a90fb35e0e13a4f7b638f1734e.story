A man has been charged over the death of a 19-year-old air hostess nine years after she was killed in a crash on the M25.

Zahid Masood is accused of causing the death by dangerous driving of Charlotte Smoker, who died in hospital the day after the crash on November 3 2003.

The 47-year-old, from Rochester, is also charged with perverting the course of justice by giving police false details after the road accident near junction 4 of the motorway in Kent.

Crash: Miss Smoker had been driving towards Dartford Crossing when the crash occurred near Junction 4 of the M25 in Kent

Masood was arrested on Friday. He appeared before magistrates yesterday and was remanded in custody.

Miss Smoker, from Bishop Stortford, Hertfordshire, had been driving towards the Dartford Crossing in a red Fiat Cinquecento when her car hit the central reservation and then collided with another vehicle.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A man has appeared in court charged with causing the death of a teenager and giving police false details in a road traffic collision nine years ago.

'Zahid Masood was remanded in custody when he appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court.

'He has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice following the collision, in which 19-year-old air hostess Charlotte Smoker from Hertfordshire died a day later from her injuries.'

Masood is due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on November 19.

Detective Sergeant Scott Lynch, from the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'This collision may have occurred nine years ago but we have been actively investigating it throughout that time.

'I would like to urge anyone who did not come forward at the time and remembers the collision to come forward now.

'They still may hold vital information. Call Kent Police's witness line on 01622 798538 quoting reference YY/007673/12.'
