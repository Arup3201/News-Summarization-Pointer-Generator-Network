An Occupy Wall Street protester who served food at the New York camp has been arrested on charges of sexually abusing a woman and is a suspect in a rape at Zuccotti Park.

Tonye Iketubosin, 26, was charged yesterday after allegedly groping an 18-year-old protester in a tent he helped her pitch on October 24.

The victim told police in a delayed report on Tuesday Iketubosin had refused to leave when she returned hours later to sleep.

Reports suggest the woman had managed to shove the man out of the tent after he grabbed her thigh and buttocks. It is not believed she was acquainted with him before the incident.

Police confirmed to MailOnline Iketubosin was arrested on Broadway and Liberty shortly after the incident was reported.

He was arraigned last night with bail set at $7,500 bond or $5,000 cash.

Iketubosin, who resides with his aunt in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, has a sealed juvenile record in Texas.

The prosecutor told the New York Post Iketubosin is a suspect in several rapes in the park.

He was being questioned over an alleged assault that occurred on October 29, after another 18-year-old woman from Massachusetts accused Iketubosin of raping her in a tent at the encampment.

Occupy Wall Street spokesman Patrick Bruner told DNA Info he was not aware of specifics about the alleged incidents. 'But I can say that we take security and safety very seriously at the park and have many dedicated working groups that are devoted to creating and maintaining a safe space in Liberty Square,' he said.

Reports of sexual assaults have prompted concerns about security in New York's Zuccotti Park, and other cities where Occupy demonstrations are taking place.

Dallas police recently arrested convicted sex offender Richard Wayne Armstrong, 24, for having sex with a 14-year-old runaway in the Occupy Dallas camp.

Armstrong is being held on felony charges of failure to register as a sex offender and sexual assault of a minor. The girl is in the custody of Child Protective Services.

ABC News reports on October 15, police responded to a delayed report of a sexual assault at Occupy Cleveland.

The news came as Mayor Michael Bloomberg cited unconfirmed reports today that Occupy Wall Street protesters are allowing crimes to go unreported and are instead chasing wrongdoers out of their park encampment. He declined, however, to say whether the information could be grounds for police to forcibly evict protesters from the site.

'Instead of calling the police, they form a circle around the perpetrator, chastise him or her and chase him or her out into the rest of the city to do who knows what to who knows whom,' Bloomberg said, although he noted the city was uncertain of the reports' accuracy. 'If this is in fact happening, and it's very hard to get good information, it is despicable.'

Meanwhile, in lower Manhattan today, 17 Occupy Wall Street protesters were arrested today at Goldman Sachs' headquarters.

Many of the protesters were carried off by police after refusing to move.

Cause: Protesters marched from  Zuccotti Park and delivered statements demanding the financial giant take responsibility for its role in the economic crisis

Several hundred activists marched from Zuccotti Park a few blocks away. Officers flanking them had handcuffs strapped to their waists.

At the Goldman Sachs building, police demanded that the protesters get off the private pavement in front of the entrance. Most did. But the rest sat down and refused to walk.

Also in New York City, more than 50 people arrested at an Occupy Wall Street march rejected offers to get disorderly conduct cases dismissed by staying out of trouble for six months, saying they wanted trials on what some called unjustified arrests.

Prosecutors say the demonstrators blocked traffic and prevented pedestrians from getting by. But many of the protesters say the disorderly conduct charges weren't justified. They say they stayed on the sidewalk, took care to leave a path for others to get through and followed police instructions.
