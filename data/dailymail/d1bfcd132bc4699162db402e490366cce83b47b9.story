Stephanie Roche (33%) 

Robin van Persie (11%) 

There was no fairytale ending to Stephanie Roche’s remarkable journey and there was no disguising her disappointment.

Roche is the girl from Dublin whose extraordinary volley playing for Peamount United in Ireland – right foot control, 180 degree turn and left foot smash – catapulted her into the glitz and glamour of Zurich on Monday night, alongside James Rodriguez and Robin van Persie.

It has been a life-changing couple of months for the 25-year-old, who now plays in France for ASPTT Albi, and one she has thoroughly enjoyed.

Yet when her name was not called out by World Cup winner Christian Karembeu, the competitor inside took of hold of Roche.

‘The whole thing has been fantastic and I just want to thank everyone who has got behind it,’ said Roche. 

‘There wasn’t too much of a difference in the percentage of the goals, so that is something. James Rodriguez is a fantastic player, he scored a great goal and I congratulate him.

‘I saw him at the hotel and I got a picture with him. I spoke to Alessandro Del Piero, who said it was a great goal and so did a few others. 

'That alone was a really good for me. Being a footballer and being a winner, it would be stupid of me to say that I wasn’t disappointed.

‘But a lot of people who know a lot about football said some very nice things about the goal. I am a bit disappointed, of course, but James is a great player and he deserves congratulations.’

STEPHANIE ROCHE 

PEAMOUNT UNITED vs Wexford Youths (Bus Eireann National League) - 20 October 2013

With her back to goal, Steph Roche collects a pass in her stride before unleashing a menacing left-footed volley on the turn. The fact that the ball didn't touch the ground once from the moment Roche touched it makes the strike all the more magnificent.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ 

COLOMBIA vs Uruguay (World Cup) - 28 June 2014

James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top scorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE

Spain vs HOLLAND (World Cup) - 13 June 2014

One of the iconic moments from this summer's World Cup as Holland thrashed the holders Spain 5-1 in their opening Group B match. Daley Blind hits a raking 40-yard pass intended for Robin van Persie. Running in between two Spain defenders, the Dutch captain meets the flight of the ball with a breathtaking diving header that looped over Iker Casillas in goal.
