Manchester United raised £210,000 for charity at the club's 15th annual UNICEF Gala Dinner on Tuesday evening. 

On a night when the focus was on events in Madrid and London, Louis van Gaal and his players gathered at Old Trafford to raise money for the world's leading children's organisation. 

Many of United's players attended the event with their partners and posed for pictures outside the ground beforehand.

Hosted by sports presenter Mike Bushell, the black-tie event was also attended by celebrities including Strictly Come Dancing star Robin Windsor, Countdown’s Rachel Riley (who is a United fan) and Emmerdale actor Chris Bisson. While Indie rock band The Enemy headlined the function.

Guests were able to bid on prizes during an auction, take part in a raffle and other fundraising games throughout the evening. 

Money raised from the event will help fund UNICEF’s work protecting vulnerable children in Vietnam from abuse, neglect and exploitation. 

Van Gaal said: ‘It does not surprise me that Manchester United is part of such a significant charity partnership and one that has impacted on the lives of so many children throughout the world.

'Our work with UNICEF is something this club can be very proud of and I was honoured to join the players at tonight’s 15-year anniversary event.’

Club captain Wayne Rooney added: ‘Any player who signs for this club soon realises how important UNICEF is to Manchester United. I’ve been attending the gala dinner for 10 years now and it’s always a great evening that raises a lot of money for United for UNICEF.

‘Like myself, most of the players here tonight have young families so it’s very moving to learn about the UNICEF project in Vietnam and the awful circumstances so many children have to face. I’m just glad we could help tonight and am grateful to all the supporters who joined us to make it such a special event.’

Catherine Cottrell, UNICEF UK Deputy Executive Director for Fundraising, added: ‘We are really proud to be celebrating 15 years of partnership with Manchester United this year; thanks to the continued support we’ve received from the club and its fans we’ve been able to transform the lives of millions of children.

‘All the money raised through tonight’s gala dinner will help us protect children in Vietnam who are living their lives in danger of abuse, neglect and exploitation. 

'On behalf of everyone at UNICEF I would like to say a huge thank you to those who donated tonight and helped us reach even more children in need of help and protection.’
