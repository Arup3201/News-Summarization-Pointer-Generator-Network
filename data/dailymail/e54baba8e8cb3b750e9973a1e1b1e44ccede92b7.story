Mark Zuckerberg has said it drives him ‘crazy’ when people claim that he is just out to make money with Facebook’s new advertising blitz.

The founder of the social network, who made $2.3bn last year from the company, said he just wants to connect people and not line his pockets.

Mr Zuckerberg added that he gets angry when he reads news articles that say his ‘goal is to make a lot of money’.

His claims will ring hollow to many users, not least as, according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, he personally approved adverts in the news feed.

Facebook users now have to endure news feeds which are cluttered with posts by companies like McDonald’s even if they have not ‘liked’ them.

Video adverts in the future could also start playing automatically, a move which many users believe is too intrusive.

The increase in advertising is because Facebook is now a public company.

The bottom line was brought into sharp focus by the bungled stock market floatation in May last year and the demands of shareholders, who want a profit on their investment.

Mr Zuckerberg is, as a result, being forced to turn from hoodie-wearing computer hacker to corporate chief executive, even if it means angering some users.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, he said that he had a ‘continuous trajectory’ for the company and that it was not just about profit.

He said: ‘It drives me crazy when people write stuff and assert that we're doing something because the goal is to make a lot of money’.

Mr Zuckerberg added that it was ‘not like I just decided to get more involved in ads’ and that it was part of a long process.

He said: ‘I needed to because basically the ad product had to be more integrated. And that created all these hard decisions that we needed to do well.’

Mr Zuckerberg’s change of mind happened just before Facebook went public in May last year - a bungled stock market launch which saw one quarter of its share price vanish in a day.

Until then he had resisted the idea of adverts in the news feed but stunned his top engineers by suggesting they do it during a meeting.

One executive who was present said that they were astonished and thought to themselves: ‘Oh, my gosh, he's actually open to it’.

The results have been dramatic and Facebook saw its sales jump 53 per cent to $1.81 billion in the second quarter of last year - the biggest increase it has ever seen.

Mr Zuckerberg has accepted that some users will quit in exchange for more advertising revenue, the article claims.

Internal assessments at Facebook showed that more adverts reduced user activity by two per cent although ‘engagement’ - a measure of user activity- rose.

In July, Zuckerberg addressed all 5,000 Facebook employees and told them: ‘We did a good job. We’re figuring this out’.

Facebook still faces long term difficulties, however.

Research last month found that Facebook is ‘dead and buried’ to teenagers who are turning to Instagram and Snapchat instead.

A University College London study found that young people were embarrassed by their parents being on the social network, so were quitting.

Facebook is being sued over claims it has been scanning users’ private messages for personal information to sell to advertisers.

The social networking site, is accused of monitoring messages and website links sent between users so they can profile what people read online.

This in turn allows the website, which has 24million UK members, to charge more for the information.

It is thought the information is particularly valuable because people are more likely to reveal their true interests in messages they think are private.

The alleged breach of privacy has been exposed by internet experts, who examined whether messages that Facebook insists are private were actually being monitored.

The claim relates to messages sent directly to a friend’s inbox, rather than posted on a profile wall, which can be seen publicly.

Many people use private messages to send friends links to other websites, such as news articles, shopping sites or sports blogs.

Facebook apparently tracked such messages so they could collect data on the interests of people who use the site. Advertising agencies and marketing companies are then allegedly sold this information so they can build up profiles of a person’s interests, and target them accordingly.

If the linked webpage contains a ‘like’ button, Facebook will activate this so any company who has been ‘liked’ will see the person is interested in their products.

Google, Yahoo! and LinkedIn are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit.

The allegations have been made in a US lawsuit taken out by Matthew Campbell, from Arkansas, and Michael Hurley, from Oregon.
