A woman's life was saved after a routine eye test revealed she had a potentially fatal brain condition.

Michelle Seddon, 28, decided to go to the opticians after experiencing excruciating headaches. 

Thinking it was nothing more serious than a sign she needed a new set of glasses, but as soon as she sat in the optician's chair she was advised to rush straight to hospital where she was diagnosed with a severe condition that can be fatal if left untreated.

Ms Seddon had received a letter from her optician reminding her to make an appointment, but she decided to put it off because she was saving up for her wedding.

But within weeks the mother-of-two from Chorley, Lancashire, began suffering from an excruciating headache and noticed her eyesight was deteriorating.

Ms Seddon, who normally wears glasses for driving and watching TV, said: 'I had been putting off going for an eye test because my partner Ben and I were saving up for our wedding.

' It had been two years since my last test.

'I started having an awful headache that was so painful it made me vomit, but I had suffered from migraines a lot when I was younger so I just put it down to that. I just took paracetamol and migraine relief tablets.

'Then a week or so later I was driving around town and I noticed that when I turned to the right it was taking my eyes a couple of seconds to focus. My eyes had definitely started to deteriorate, so I decided to make an appointment at Specsavers in Chorley.

'The optician took a photograph of the back of my eyes and straightaway he looked at me, looked at the photograph and asked me what my plans were for the rest of the day.

'I told him I was going to pay off the rest of my wedding and he said: 'I'm really sorry, but you're not going to be able to do that today. I need you to go to Royal Preston Hospital as soon as possible.'

'Then he started writing out a letter and said I had to take it with me to the hospital and show it to the doctors. I was really confused about what was going on. My headache had subsided by then and I felt fine in myself.'

Ms Seddon went to hospital where she was given further eye tests, a lumber puncture and a CT scan. Four days later she was told she suffering from intracranial hypertension - a condition which causes high pressure behind the skull and can lead to blindness, a stroke or even death.

Ms Seddon, who is getting married later this month, was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future 

The tests showed that the arteries behind her eyes had thinned so the blood couldn't get through, creating a build-up of pressure.

Ms Seddon said: 'I couldn't believe what they were telling me. I had never heard of the condition before and when they told me it can be fatal I couldn't believe it. The nurses told me if I'd left it any longer I could have gone blind or the worst case scenario would be the very worst case scenario imaginable.

'They could see from scans that I had already lost quite a lot of visual field on my right hand side but I've been told that will come back over time.

'The neurologist explained that my week-long headache was a symptom of the condition. The whole thing was really frightening.

'For all the time I was in hospital I felt absolutely fine. I felt like a fraud but they wouldn't let me go home because it was too dangerous.'

Ms Seddon, who is getting married later this month, was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future.

She said: 'That one trip to the opticians saved my life. I dread to think what could have happened if I'd put the appointment off any longer.'
