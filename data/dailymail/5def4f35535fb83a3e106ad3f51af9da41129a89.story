Jose Mourinho admitted he would be willing to sell Andre Schurrle if a 'phenomenal' offer was made for the midfielder. 

Mourinho said the German, who he insisted he wants to remain at Chelsea, would be selected for Saturday's's FA Cup fourth round match against Bradford but conceded he may be forced to sell.

Schurrle is understood to be keen on a move out of Stamford Bridge along with Mohamed Salah. The pair have grown frustrated at the lack of first team opportunities.

'The principle is that we would like him (Schurrle) to stay,' said Mourinho.

'The question is not to be allowed or not allowed. The question is to have a phenomenal offer and a player to be super keen of accept a new challenge in his career. We don't want to sell our players.

'But for Shurrle to get a first team place he must start playing better than Eden Hazard and Willian.'

Mourinho maintained he would field a strong line up against the Bantams but revealed John Terry and Thibaut Courtois will be among players rested for the Cup game.

Mourinho said: 'We have two knockout matches in three days, so we can after Tuesday we can be in four competitions or only two. Of course we want to try to be in all four. But it's two consecutive matches knockout, two cups, in three days. That says everything.

'The third match is just a Premier League match, one of 38, and that is different. It doesn't decide anything, but Bradford and Liverpool, yes. They decide if we are still in the competition.

'My team tomorrow [Saturday] reflects the fact that if we lose the game we are out and if we draw we have to go to Bradford. We don't want to be out and if possible we don't want to go to Bradford.

'This season we played already against League One teams and Championship teams and I don't remember an easy game.'

Mourinho also confirmed that Salah will start on Saturday despite interest in his services from Serie A side Roma.

Speaking about the potential for incoming and outgoing transfers this month, Mourinho added: 'The club doesn't move. We don't move. 

'Our desire is to keep the same squad, which reflects that we are happy with the players, that we are happy with the work we did in the summer to prepare the seaosn, reflects the trust we have in the group and if possible we don't want to be involved in the transfer window. 

'If we have to be it's because somebody pushed us, with some offer for our player, but Chelsea moving and looking for a change? No.'
