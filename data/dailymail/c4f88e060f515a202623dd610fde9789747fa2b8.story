A threatened stag will be given round-the-clock protection by former soldiers to protect it from hunters.

Red, an eight-year-old red deer, is one of just nine stags left on the Quantock hills in Somerset. 

The League Against Cruel Sports will fund the cost of protecting the animal, the Sunday Times reports.

The red deer stag is Britain’s largest mammal and can live to be 18.

They weigh up to 30 stone and are mainly concentrated in the Scottish Highlands, Dumfriesshire, Lake District, East Anglia and the south-west of England. 

Deer have a set of antlers which are regrown every summer, rather than permanent horns on the head.

Females are often attracted to the stag with the loudest roar. 

Under the 1991 Deer Act, the hunting of deer is allowed only with the permission of the landowner.

Several red deer stags have, however, been killed in recent years. 

Among them was the Monarch of New Forest, which was shot by illegal hunters trying to snatch its antlers  and the Exmoor Emperor, which is believed to have been shot by a licensed hunter in 2010.

To combat this threat, security guards will patrol the area of land where Red lives with a herd of female red deer, using cameras and security equipment to monitor its location. 

During the current rutting season, stags are more visible than usual.

Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the league told the paper: 'We own sporting rights and sanctuaries to provide safe havens for wildlife away from hunts so that animals can come and go as they please.

'Putting the lives of the animals residing there in danger will not be tolerated, which is why we have taken the decision to employ extra protection for Red.' 

Red was recently chased by a hound from a hunt, the organisation said. 

Paul Tillsley, the League’s head of investigations, said there was 'no doubt' that hunting had contributed heavily to the decline in stag numbers in the area.

He said: 'Red has become a symbol of the animals that suffer prolonged and terrifying deaths as a result of the hunts that are determined to continue hunting animals in the name of sport.

'It is more than 8 years since the Hunting Act came into force, but the three red deer hunts in the West Country continue to hunt and kill deer.'

There are an estimated 2million deer in Britain of which about 360,000 are red deer.
