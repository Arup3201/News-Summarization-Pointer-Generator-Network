A Tory MP potentially faces six  months in prison or a large fine after attending a Nazi-themed stag night in the French Alps.

Prosecutors have launched a criminal inquiry after receiving a complaint that Aidan Burley and 12 of his friends had ‘incited racial hatred and glorified crimes against humanity’.

The 32-year-old MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire was celebrating with the group in the resort of Val Thorens earlier this month.

Nasty party: Groom Mark Fournier attended his stag party dressed as a member of the infamous SS, while other guests saluted Hitler

During the stag party, accountant Mark Fournier, a 34-year-old Oxford graduate, wore a replica SS uniform. Another guest, sitting next to the MP in a restaurant, was filmed  raising a toast to ‘the ideology and thought process of the Third Reich’. 

Later, after moving on to a British-themed pub, some of the group chanted: ‘Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer!’, ‘Himmler! Himmler! Himmler!’ and ‘Eichmann! Eichmann! Eichmann!’ Heinrich Himmler founded the SS, while he and Adolf Eichmann were responsible for the Holocaust.

Sacked: MP Aidan Burley was dismissed from his post as parliamentary private secretary

A spokesman for Albertville prosecutors said a preliminary inquiry had been opened, and that those involved could receive up to six months in prison and large fines if convicted. Julien Andrez, counsel for La Foundue restaurant, where the stag night started, said they had filed a criminal complaint, as had Hamdy Boussouiba, director of French pressure group SOS Racism.

Calling for Mr Burley to be fired, Mr Boussoiba said: ‘The hotel management should have made a complaint straight away, but  better late than never.’ Mr Burley, who has since been sacked from his post as a parliamentary private secretary, has apologised for his ‘crass and insensitive’ behaviour and the ‘terrible offence’ he caused.

He strenuously denies that he took part in toasts to the Third Reich, and has distanced himself from the ‘inexcusable behaviour’ of other guests at the party.  But Mr Burley would not directly address claims that he hired the SS uniform for the stag night.

The Conservative Party said it was launching an investigation into Mr Burley’s behaviour.

Under the French penal code, it is a crime, unless required for a film, play or historical exhibition, to exhibit in public a uniform or insignia reminiscent of those worn by the Nazis.

Complaint: Owners of restaurant La Fondue filed a complaint against members of the stag party

Mr Burley said last night: ‘I have not been contacted by the French authorities and I have repeatedly apologised for what was clearly inappropriate behaviour which caused offence to others.

‘Being involved in a stag party where an SS uniform was worn was wrong and offensive. It was the wrong decision on my part, crass and insensitive.

'I am deeply sorry, and want to take this opportunity to offer the people of  Cannock Chase an unreserved, wholehearted and full apology for the terrible offence this incident has undoubtedly caused.’
