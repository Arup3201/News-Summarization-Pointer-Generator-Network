Crematorium staff put the remains of babies in cardboard boxes and secretly buried them in an unmarked grave for 45 years, it emerged today.

Officials at the council-run Mortonhall 
Crematorium in Edinburgh have admitted stillborn infants or babies who died days after being born were unceremoniously disposed of in this way since 1967.

Edinburgh City Council is now investigating the practice, which went unchecked for almost 45 years until new management took over the site last year.

Dorothy Maitland, the mother of one baby cremated at Mortonhall, was told by the new manager that 'laziness or a bad attitude' was likely to blame.

Grieving parents who took their babies to the site were told after the cremation that there was nothing left to scatter.

But
the remains were actually being placed in boxes and interred in an 
unmarked pit in a garden of remembrance behind the crematorium.

It is not known how many babies were buried in this way.

The council said it is now looking into installing a memorial in the garden of remembrance as a 'mark of respect'.

The discovery was made by Sands Lothian, a charity which counsel parents who have lost a child through stillbirth or neonatal death.

Edinburgh City Council has launched an investigation and environmental services convener, councillor Lesley Hinds, has offered a full apology.

Helen Henderson, 43, works at the charity and her son Nathan died in 2004 when he was just one day old.

She was told she could not have her son’s ashes and later discovered Nathan’s remains were dumped in a mass grave in a biodegradable box.

Helen, from Edinburgh, said: 'On the day of my son’s cremation I went to get his ashes and was told there wasn’t any.

'Now I know there were ashes and they lied to me. That was over eight years ago. It opens up the raw emotions again and is very upsetting.

'I want to know why they felt they had to do this. Somebody needs to be held accountable.'

Officials at Sands Lothian made the discovery while writing a book about parents whose babies are stillborn or die shortly after being born.

During research they found only some parents were given ashes and discovered the practice in place at the crematorium.

Dorothy Maitland, the charity’s operations manager, discovered the ashes of daughter Kaelen had been interred in the ground at Mortonhall.

Apology: Councillor Lesley Hinds said the council will look into a memorial for the garden

But 26 years earlier she was told there would be nothing for her to collect after the funeral.

Dorothy, 56, said: 'It’s come as a complete shock to me. For years I have had nowhere to go to put flowers, or grieve for Kaelen.

'The new manager at the crematorium has told me the only reason he can think why this happened in the past was either laziness or a bad attitude.

'We need to know how many babies’ ashes are buried there. My fear is that some kind of moral judgement was made and it was only babies who survived for a few days before dying who were buried, so who knows what happened to the ashes of those stillborn?'

It is feared the number of babies buried in this way could run into the hundreds.

The practice is understood to have been accepted policy at the crematorium from its opening in 1967 until last year following the arrival of a new manager.

It is not known whether the policy was devised by one official acting alone or approved by more senior managers at the local authority.

Mortonhall’s new manager has changed the policy so all parents who wish to receive the ashes of their babies now receive them.

Councillor Hinds said there was no indication of whether legal action was likely but it is doing 'everything possible' to find an explanation.

She said: 'We will be truthful about what’s happened and we will look into a memorial for the garden.

'We will also be making doubly sure people are now happy with the policy we have in operation and that they are getting the right information and choices.'
