She won widespread acclaim for her first literary effort, a detailed account of the women in the life of former Prime Minister Lloyd George.

Ffion Hague, the wife of Foreign Secretary William Hague, is now hoping to repeat her success with her latest publication, a book documenting what was believed to be the illicit gay love affair of an 18th century poet with the son of Britain’s first Prime Minister, Robert Walpole.

The Grand Tour, which is released next week, is Mrs Hague’s second book, and explores the relationship between Thomas Gray and his schoolfriend Horace Walpole.

The release of the publication comes just over three years after her 52-year-old husband was forced to release a personal statement denying internet claims of a gay affair with his young special adviser, Christopher Myers.

The 45-year-old novelist studied Gray’s life and work while a student at the University of Wales.

Her new work explores how Walpole and Gray became friends at Eton until they had a dramatic falling out during the European Grand Tour they took after university. There has been speculation among historians that this was the result of a lovers’ quarrel.

Previous biographies of both men have speculated about their sexuality. The American academic George Haggerty says that while Walpole and Gray’s intimate circle of male friends were not ‘identified as sodomites… several of them were known to feel desire for members of their own sex’.

Thomas Gray was even said to be known as ‘Miss Gray’ because of his effeminate behaviour.

Academic  Rictor Norton has speculated that Walpole was ‘the first great love’ of Gray’s life, and observing that Walpole’s letters to Gray ‘illustrate a “sentimental sodomy” characteristic of the many bachelors in Walpole’s circle’.

It was in September 2010 that William Hague issued an astonishing personal statement denying claims that he’d had a gay affair with his then 25-year-old male aide Christopher Myers, after admitting that the pair had shared a hotel room during a business trip.

He went on to add that he and his wife had tried to start a family, but Mrs Hague had suffered several miscarriages.

At the time, Mr Hague said responding to the rumours had not been ‘an easy thing to do’ but said that he and his wife ‘had had enough’ of the ‘untrue and malicious allegations’ about the nature of their relationship.

Mrs Hague’s first book was about the women in Lloyd George’s life, entitled The Pain and the Privilege, which was released to widespread acclaim from the critics. It went on to overtake Cherie Blair’s autobiography in the book charts when it was released in 2008.

Mrs Hague took a degree in English Literature at Oxford University, before going on to study Eighteenth-Century Welsh Poetry at the University of Wales. Her master’s degree was on the life and work of Thomas Gray, who was also the author of the 1751 masterpiece Elegy in a Country Churchyard.

After graduating, she joined the Civil Service and was posted to the Welsh Office. She was later appointed Private Secretary to the Secretary of State. On leaving the Civil Service, she became Director of Operations at the Arts & Business charity, which raises private finance for arts projects.

In 2000, she became a headhunter and in 2003 she went on to become director of recruitment firm Hanson Green. Ffion was a trustee of The British Council and also a judge of the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2000.

Talking about her decision to begin writing books, which was released almost six years ago, she said she had been inspired by her husband’s literary success after he published biographies on former prime minister William Pitt the Younger and politician William Wilberforce.

At the time of the release of her first work, she said: ‘Having him around as an experienced author was an immense help. I saw the satisfaction and success he had with his books and I realised I didn’t want to put writing this one off any longer.’
