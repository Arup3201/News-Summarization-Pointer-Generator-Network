A married teacher has been suspended from an exclusive girls' school in New York following allegations he had an affair with a teenage student.

Jonathan Fuller, 55, was taken out of his class at the Upper East Side Nightingale-Bamford School on Friday following a complaint about an alleged relationship with a former pupil.

Mr Fuller's removal from the school left staff and parents shocked and came just two days into the start of the new school year.

According to the New York Post, one source within the school said: 'They canceled his classes and pulled him out.

Costing nearly $40,000 per year, the 
school is one of the most elite in New York and inspired the hit TV show
Gossip Girl - which follows the lives of privileged teenagers at an 
elite private school in the city.

The children of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein are known to have attended Nightingale-Bamford as well as the daughters and relatives of the Tisch and Bronfman families.

The popular science and psychology 
teacher's suspension emerged following a letter to parents from the school's new 
headteacher Paul Burke.

Within
the three-paragraph letter, he said: 'I am sorry to have to tell you 
that this morning I suspended an Upper School faculty member in light of
reports received over the past two days that, if true, describe 
behavior that is not only inappropriate, but also completely 
inconsistent with our rules and values.'

The letter did not reveal the inappropriate behavior or name the teacher.

But the letter did say that the teacher could be sacked if the allegations were confirmed to be true.

An independent investigator has now been brought into the school to look into whether the teenager was underage when the alleged relationship started.

The investigator will also try to establish if Mr Fuller - who was believed to have been a favourite among students at the school - had any other affairs with pupils.

Although he was not named in the letter,
Mr Fuller's name was mentioned by school officials during a meeting 
with staff to discuss the scandal yesterday.

He did not attend the school yesterday and his syllabus, schedule and name was taken down from the school's website.

Mr Fuller declined to comment.
