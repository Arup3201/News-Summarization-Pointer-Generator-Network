She certainly knows how to keep the spark alive.

Heating up her love life, Irina Shayk was seen shopping for some new racy lingerie pieces at Agent Provocateur in New York City's SoHo neighborhood on Monday.

The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model was believed to be browsing for her football star boyfriend, Cristiano Ronaldo.

Irina seemed to be drawn to the vibrant and lacy numbers and was seen examining them as she perused the boutique.

Laying low, the 27-year-old Russian model  sported a casual black wrap dress and studded sandals.

Her face was covered with minimal make-up and her brunette locks were tossed into a relaxed updo.

The shopping trip was undoubtedly a success, as Irina exited the store carrying two large bags.

Meanwhile the model is said to be seeking a restraining order against a stalker who managed to get access to her New York home.

The Russian beauty has filed two police reports following multiple sightings of a man loiteringÂ  around her West Village apartment, according to the New York Post's Page Six.

Late last year the man managed to get inside Shayk's home while it was being renovated after it was damaged during Superstorm Sandy. Irina managed to escape and call police.

The stalker has also been sending her gifts and flower over a two year period, the publication reports.

Besides this ongoing stressful situation, Shyak - an aspiring actress - revealed earlier this month that she has landed a big-screen movie role opposite Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

'For my first time on the big screen...I'm so excited and honored to say ill be working with Brett Ratner on his new movie Hercules!!! Thank u,' she tweeted.

Meanwhile, Irina's Portuguese beau has been holidaying in Miami, Florida.

Yesterday, the 28-year-old showed off his ridiculously sculpted physique as he lounged aboard a luxury yacht with some of his friends.

But while he has been lapping up the Miami sun, his footballing future seems unclear, with constant rumours circulating of late about his next move.

Ronaldo has been reluctant to enter talks to re-sign for his current club Real Madrid, with rumours circulating that he could re-join his old team Manchester United.

Writing on his Twitter page earlier this week, he said: 'All the news about my renewal with Real Madrid are false.'
