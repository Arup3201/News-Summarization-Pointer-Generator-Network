Councils across the U.S. Midwest are closing hills and banning sledding to prevent being sued in injury claims.

It is not known just how many cities have banned or restricted the pass time, but every year the list grows.

The latest city council to get on board is Dubuque, Iowa, where they are moving ahead with plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks.

Marie Ware, Dubuque's leisure services manager, told Newsok that the council had 'all kinds of parks that have hills on them' and can't 'manage the risk' at all of the locations. 

More than 20,000 children each year were treated at emergency rooms for sledding-related injuries between 1997 and 2007, according to a study by Ohio-based Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

Dubuque council members had been against the move, but conceded it was necessary given liability concerns and to meet demands from their insurers. 

They had cited two sledding lawsuits. One had involved a $2 million judgement against Omaha, Nebraska, after a 5-year-old girl was paralyzed when she hit a tree, and the other involved a $2.75 million payment to a man who injured his spinal cord after hitting a sign. 

Instead of out-right bans on sledding, some cities had lessened their liability by banning sledding only on certain slopes and by posting warning signs. 

In 2013, Paxton, Illinois officials removed their sledding hill altogether out of fears sledders may crash into trees. The 20-foot rise was more of a dirt mound - made to cover rubbish and junk metal - but it was  often crowded with sledders.

After losing a lawsuit, Omaha banned sledding at a popular hill one winter, but later dropped the restriction as people were continuing to sled there.

The city has now posted warning signs at sledding sights and put pads around posts and hay bales around trees.   

Kenneth Bond, a New York lawyer who represents local governments, told the website that most people realize that cities must restrict potentially dangerous activities to protect their citizens.

He said previously people may have accepted they were responsible for their own actions, but they now expected the government to prevent dangers whenever possible.  

Steve King, who runs a website that promotes sledding, said he understands why cities impose restrictions. Most sledders don't wear helmets and it's near impossible to steer away from trees, rocks or signs, he said.

Mr King said: 'We live in a lawsuit-happy society and cities are just being protective by banning sledding in areas that pose a risk for injury or death.'
