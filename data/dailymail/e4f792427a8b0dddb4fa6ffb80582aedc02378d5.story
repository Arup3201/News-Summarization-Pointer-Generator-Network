UKIP leader Nigel Farage has vehemently denied having sex with his aide Annabelle Fuller and says he has not even kissed her.

And he has dismissed claims that his 14-year marriage to German wife Kirsten is in trouble as a result of the latest headlines about his  so-called ‘womanising’.

Controversial Euro MP Mr Farage spoke out after it was claimed in the European Parliament that UKIP press officer Ms Fuller was ‘his former mistress’ and he was using public funds to employ her and Mrs Farage, his £25,000-a-year assistant.

Chatting in between pints, over balloons of brandy, Nigel Farage unleashes his torrent of rage of people who have wronged him in ope way or another

In his most candid interview ever, the man bidding to change the landscape of British politics in May’s Euro elections told The Mail on Sunday:

Interviewing Nigel Farage requires stamina.

We met at 11.15am on Friday at his Mayfair campaign HQ, (one floor above PR man Max Clifford’s office and directly behind Claridge’s Hotel) and parted at 3pm.

In between, we chatted in his office, continued over pints of London Pride ale in the suitably patriotic Iron Duke pub over the road, and adjourned to the nearby La Petite Maison French restaurant for lunch with two bottles of red wine between us and two brandies each.

Sitting in the sunshine on the restaurant’s pavement terrace enabled Mr Farage to indulge in two of his many politically incorrect pleasures: smoking (he got through half a dozen cigarettes, breaking off to buy another pack after the main course, complaining ‘bloody £8.80 that cost me, outrageous!’); and taunting climate change zealots – he cosied up to a giant patio heater, blamed by many for adding to global warming, scoffing: ‘People like Prince Charles talk such nonsense.’

Annabelle Fuller, who worked in UKIP press office, and was the alledged mistress of Nigel Farage

The ex-stockbroker was wearing his trademark blue blazer (he buys his suits, all Italian-made, from John Bray tailors in London’s Jermyn Street), pressed pink shirt, cufflinks (his favourite pair has a Spitfire motif) and tightly knotted club tie. Does he ever undo his top button?

‘Weekends, of course, but not at work.

'That’s what posers like Dave (Cameron) do to show they are a man of the people. It’s all cobblers.’

With forecasts of a major UKIP success in May, Farage has panicked the main parties, in particular the Tories, into attacking his party and its notorious ‘fruitcake’ candidates.

He trumpeted: ‘We’re like Millwall Football Club, “Everyone hates us and we don’t care!” The penny’s dropped, the great British public knows we cannot have our own immigration policy and stay in the EU.

We’re on the edge of the biggest migratory wave yet – it could be a million plus over the next few years including a huge number from Romania.’

He derided attempts by David Cameron’s hard-hitting Australian born election campaigns chief, Lynton Crosby, to undermine UKIP.

‘Mr Crosby and his gang can paint me out to be the biggest, most dishonest, drunken womaniser or whatever they blooming well like, but they misunderstand why they’re in trouble.

Tories won’t vote for them again because they don’t see Dave as a Conservative.

‘I accept that in the early days UKIP had all sorts we’d rather not have taken home to meet mum for tea.

'The Canadian Conservatives disappeared overnight - we could do the same to the Tories'

But we now have thousands of decent men and women, ex-Conservative, ex-Labour, policemen, school teachers, businessmen.’

He’s been called the ‘heir of Thatcher’ but seems more Denis than Maggie to me. ‘He was a top chap!’ erupted Farage with boyish glee.

‘Wow! If I’m compared to Denis Thatcher – he fought for this country in the war, was decorated, made vast sums of money, was respected and lived well into his 80s – sounds pretty good to me.’

With recent successes of the UKIP party, Farage has caused worry amongst the three major political parties, especially the Tories who have had major attacks on his 'fruitcake' candidates

How will he tackle Europhile Mr Clegg in debates, starting this week? ‘I’ll say, “Come on Nick, tell me why you think British people want the EU flag, anthem and Mr Rumpy Pumpy [EU President Herman Van Rompuy] – I’m all ears. Clegg’s European at heart, not British.’

But his grin turned to a glare when I raised a different type of ‘rumpy pumpy’ – former UKIP ally Nikki Sinclaire’s bombshell claim in the European Parliament that Farage employed his wife Kirsten and ‘former mistress Annabelle Fuller’ on his MEP’s payroll.

Mr Farage and Ms Fuller, 32, issued statements denying they had an affair, but his initial apparent failure to do so meant the rumour mill kept turning.

Ms Sinclaire added insult to injury in last week’s Mail on Sunday, calling him a ‘bullying, hypocritical, preening show pony’. Farage’s frog eyes bulged with fury.

‘You normally rely on people on bail for fraud charges, do you?’ he scowled, leaning forward aggressively.

(Ms Sinclaire was arrested in 2012 in connection with claims concerning alleged expenses fraud at the European Parliament. She denies any wrongdoing.)

It’s obviously got under his skin.

Farage is equally dismissive of critics who say UKIP¿s widely predicted success in the Euro elections will melt like spring snow in next year¿s General Election

‘What gets under my skin is that the BBC decided it was headline TV news,’ he shot back, nostrils flaring.

He maintains Ms Sinclaire held a grudge because Ms Fuller was picked ahead of her as a UKIP press officer in 2006.

Farage trades on his colourful character to win votes, so he can’t complain if other aspects come under scrutiny.

Has he had sex with Annabelle Fuller? ‘I don’t think we should go into the grisly details.’

Has he slept with her? ‘No.’ Has he kissed her? ‘No. When you work in a tight team, I understand why people might get the wrong idea.’Why hadn’t he denied it immediately in the European Parliament? Farage falls back on his best weapon: wit.

‘There’s an old saying, if you pick a fight with a chimney sweep you get covered in soot!’

Twice-married Farage does not deny he had a fling with a 25-year-old Latvian woman eight years ago: ‘I put myself in a very bad position there. I am not saying I am beyond stupidity and yes, I’ve made mistakes.’

Kirsten, 39, mother of two of his four children, is ‘pretty cheesed off’ with the claims about him and Ms Fuller, but he insists their marriage is not on the rocks.

He is equally dismissive of critics who say UKIP’s widely predicted success in the Euro elections will melt like spring snow in next year’s General Election.

‘In 2009 we came from nowhere, like a horse on the rails, in the European elections. Everyone said, “Jolly well done Nigel, now bugger off back to the pub, you’ll never achieve anything in domestic politics."

'Protestors smashed in my car when I was driving Enoch Powell'

'And blow me down, last year we got nearly a quarter of the vote in the English county council elections.’

He boasts UKIP could win up to 20 seats in 2015 and plans to stand as a candidate, probably in his native Kent.

‘The Canadian Conservative Party disappeared overnight – we could do the same to the Tories here over Europe. Believe me.’

As he downed a fourth large glass of Chinon red wine a passer-by, Steve, a hedge-fund manager, approached and told Farage how much he admired him.

Farage invited Steve to pull up a chair and vigorously debated with him for half an hour, a common event for man of the people Nigel.

Farage has also been described as 'not a compassionate man', who during the period of his interview, ignored a Big Issue seller on the street

But he had no time for the homeless man who tried to sell him The Big Issue, ignoring him completely.

After the bedraggled toothless chap eventually gave up and trudged off, Farage quipped: ‘That’s the first Big Issue seller I’ve come across for a while who isn’t a Romanian immigrant!’

He doesn’t ‘do’ compassion.

By the time we had progressed to the Napoleon brandies, Farage ripped into Cameron’s handling of the Ukraine crisis.

‘Egged on by reckless Dave and (William) Hague, the EU has incited the Russian bear and surprise, surprise, the bear has hit back.

'What’s Dave going to do if the Scots vote for independence, send troops to Edinburgh? Madness.’

Farage prefers Right-wing Tories like Enoch Powell and briefly acted as his chauffeur in his 20s.

‘He had spoken at my school and I was later asked to drive him to a by-election rally, I think they chose me because everyone else available had a Morris Minor and I had a Merc! It was scary.

'Protesters smashed the back of the car when we arrived but Enoch didn’t blink.’

Powell’s ‘rivers of blood’ immigration rhetoric made him a hate figure: naughty but nice Nigel is more Ronnie Corbett than Oswald Mosley.

Farage found new inspiration when he visited Athelney in Somerset during the floods.

Athelney is where King Alfred the Great hid before defeating the Danes in 878.

‘From a few flooded acres of land Alfred beat the Danes and created what we now know as England,’ he said with misty-eyed fervour, swirling the brandy in his glass.

‘If it wasn’t for him we would have been taken over by the Vikings.’

UKIP’s King Nigel is just as determined to repel the EU.
