Kansas City Police Department 
spokesman Darin Snapp confirmed details of the apparent murder-suicide 
in a video posted on the Kansas City Star website.

'A little before 8am this morning we got a call to a residence on Crysler (Avenue) with regard to a shooting,' Snapp confirmed.

'When officers arrived, a lady came 
out to say that her daughter had been shot multiple times by her 
boyfriend, and she identified him as Belcher, being a Chiefs player.

'At around 8.10am we received a call 
from the Arrowhead security stating that there was an individual - they 
identified him as Belcher - with a gun to his head standing in the 
parking lot.

'When we arrived, officers were 
getting out of the car and observed Scott Pioli and also coach Romeo 
Crennel and another individual were outside talking to Belcher.

'When the officers approached and 
tried to get into the conversation, that's when Belcher turned around, 
walked approximately 30 feet in the opposite direction of everybody, and
shot himself.'

A statement on the Chiefs' official 
website, kcchiefs.com, earlier confirmed an incident had occurred 
outside the stadium and that an investigation was under way.

'We can confirm that there was an 
incident at Arrowhead earlier this morning. We are co-operating with 
authorities in their investigation,' the statement read.

The Chiefs are due to host the Carolina Panthers at Arrowhead Stadium tomorrow.

There had been widespread speculation
that the game would be postponed to a later date in the wake of the 
tragedy, but the Chiefs confirmed in a statement that they would take to
the field as planned.

'After discussions between the league
office, head coach Romeo Crennel and Chiefs team captains, the Chiefs 
advised the NFL that it will play tomorrow's game vs. the Carolina 
Panthers at its originally scheduled time,' the statement read.

Chiefs chairman and chief executive 
Clark Hunt had earlier expressed the club's distress at the day's 
events, saying: 'The entire Chiefs family is deeply saddened by today's 
events and our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy, thoughts and 
prayers for the families and friends affected by this unthinkable 
tragedy.

'We sincerely appreciate the 
expressions of sympathy and support we have received from so many in the
Kansas City and NFL communities, and ask for continued prayers for the 
loved ones of those impacted.

'We will continue to fully co-operate
with the authorities and work to ensure that the appropriate 
counselling resources are available to all members of the organisation.'

Belcher, who was in his fourth year 
with the Chiefs, grew up on Long Island, New York and, despite showing 
promise as a high school wrestler, played college football in Maine 
before entering the NFL draft in 2009.

Despite being projected to be a 
sixth-round pick, Belcher went undrafted but later agreed a free-agent 
contract with Kansas City.

Belcher became the franchise's 
starting inside linebacker for the 2011 season and had played in all 11 
games this season as the Chiefs racked up a lamentable 1-10 record ahead
of tomorrow's meeting with the Panthers.

As news of today's events emerged, Belcher's team-mates and peers took to Twitter to pay their respects.

Fellow Chiefs linebacker Tamba Hali 
posted: 'I am devastated by this mornings events. I want to send my 
thoughts and prayers out to everyone effected by this tragedy.'

Chiefs wide receiver Dexter McCluster wrote: 'Times like this you have to pray!!! I love you man, brothers for life!!!!'

'This just doesn't seem 
real...praying for 59 and his family,' added Chiefs offensive lineman 
David Mims - 59 was Belcher's shirt number.

Houston Texans quarterback Matt 
Schaub said: 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the families and the Chiefs
organization during this time. So sad.'
