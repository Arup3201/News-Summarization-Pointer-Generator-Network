Two transit officers delivered a special gift for a Philadelphia couple this Christmas - their baby son.

SEPTA Police Sgt. Daniel Caban and Officer Darrell James responded to a call around 5.50pm on Thursday and when they climbed on the train, they could already see the baby's head, they said.

A group of riders had formed a circle around the mother to give her some privacy as she went into labor on the Market-Frankford Line, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 

The officers, who both have children of their own, donned their gloves and Caban knelt down to catch the baby boy as he was born at the 15th Street station.

Response: SEPTA officers rush on to a train after reports of a woman going into labor on Thursday

Delivery: Cell phone footage captured the moment the officers checked the baby after he was born

The newborn's parents, an Asian couple in their late 20s or early 30s, spoke very little English but the officers were able to ask the father for a sweater to wrap the baby. They then placed the little boy into his mother's arms.

'The mother was at peace with the baby,' Caban told the Inquirer.

The youngster's umbilical cord was slightly tangled around his neck, but he looked healthy and was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital.

Surveillance footage taken inside the carriage showed a medic smiling as he held the healthy newborn.

'It was such a joy to see a baby born on a train, you're not expecting that,' passenger Loreta McNeil told ABC6.

Relief: A medic can be seen carrying the baby boy, who was wrapped in his father's sweater

Healthy: The tot was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital and he and his mother are doing well

The officers said they had been looking forward to a quiet shift before heading home to their families but they were more than happy to help the couple.

'It was the best Christmas gift that I would ever be able to ask for,' said James, who has three kids with another on the way. 'Having a kid born on Christmas but also being able to help a family.'

'I was hoping for a quiet day, but this is worth it,' Caban told CBS. 'This is what our job about.'

He added: 'I had already opened all my presents I didn't know I had another one waiting for me around 5:53 this afternoon.'

SEPTA spokeswoman Kristin Geiger said the baby and his mother had been taken to Hahnemann University Hospital for evaluation.

Excitement: Thomas J Nestel, the SEPTA police chief, tweeted his excitement about the incident on Friday

Happy to help: He quipped that the little boy would not have to pay a fare

'Both the baby and mother are doing fine,' she said. 

SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel III later tweeted his congratulations.

'Transit Police SGT and PO deliver baby on Market Frankford El train!!!! WOOHOO!!! Now that's a Christmas gift!!!' he wrote.

In a later tweet, he added: 'For those that have asked, I have waived today's fare for our newest rider.'
