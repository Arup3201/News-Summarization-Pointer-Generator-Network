A mother of four who tried to use her £60 a week child benefit to maintain 11 horses admitted animal cruelty and neglect offences when the RSPCA took her to court today.

Sabrina Willey, 35, could not maintain her £700 a week horses, as she tried to afford their upkeep using her benefits, and her husband Phillip Gee's Job Seekers' Allowance.

When the RSPCA contacted Mrs Willey about the under-feeding of her horses, she told a welfare officer: 'You Can Burn in Hell'.

Animal cruelty: Sabrina Willey from Blackpool admitted mistreating her horses after she tried to maintain them from her and her husband's benefits

By the time the RSCPA could rescue the horses one of them, a grey mare called Sarn, had to be put down.

Sarn was seen suffering at Mrs Willey's stables, Oaklands in Blackpool, so a Facebook campaign 'Save Our Sarn' was launched last year.

When a protest was organised outside Mrs Willey's paddock last year, 200 horse owners turned up.

The RSPCA  issued warning notices to her, but they 
were ignored. 

The animal charity then found that Mrs Willey moved the horses to another area of Blackpool that had no grazing.

When they were rescued: The horses kept in Mrs Willey's paddock were immediately rehomed, apart from one that had to be put down

When they found Sarn, she was in a field containing poisonous ragwort, metal and broken glass.

The mare 
had to be put down the following day.

District Judge Jim Clarke sitting at Blackpool Magistrates Court told her: 'When you look at your home and financial circumstances you could not avoid them avoiding suffering and cruelty.'

'You could not afford any treatment or proper livery and feed for them'.

Mrs Willey shared a council house with Mr Gee, 44, who was unemployed and receiving £140 a fortnight in benefits.

The RSPCA asked for £12,100 costs for their investigation and prosecution costs.

Gee is to do 150 hours unpaid 
community work, with a one year probation order. He was told by the 
judge to try to find himself a job.

Poor condition: Bones on this horse's back and ribs were clearly showing through

Horrendous conditions: Mrs Willey kept her horses in fields with no grazing, littered with broken glass and rubbish

Mrs Willey, who was said to be the driving force behind keeping the horses, got an 18 month probation order.

Both were banned from keeping horses or ponies for ten years.

Gill was happy to sign over his 
remaining three horses to the charity, but Willey held onto hers until a
 court order forced her to do so.

Mr Gill's lawyer said that he had 'no problem about being banned from ownership. He does not want anything to do with horses.'

A
 horse owner with stables near to those once run by Willey said: 'It 
costs about £60 a week to keep each horse in stables. It is easy to work
 out what eleven could cost.'

'You can't maintain that when you are on benefits...that money should be for the kids.'
