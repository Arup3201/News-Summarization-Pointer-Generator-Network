Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took another step towards full fitness for Thursday's crunch clash with Uruguay when the Arsenal midfielder trained with the England squad for the first time since picking up a knee injury.

The England players were training in public for the first time since defeat to Italy in Manaus and all of the players looked relaxed and in good spirits despite Saturday's defeat.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had heavy white strapping on his right leg and knee, broke off from training with the rest of the group after around fifteen minutes to do some individual work as he builds his way back to full fitness.

Defeat 
against Uruguay, who are likely to have Luis Suarez back in their 
starting line-up, would mean a premature end to England's World Cup 
campaign.

Much of the 
attention is currently focused on Rooney who has been widely criticised 
for his performance against Italy and pressure is mounting on the 
England manager to either play the Manchester United striker up front or
 leave him out altogether.

If
 Hodgson makes the big call of dropping the countryâ€™s highest-profile 
player then then the versatile Oxlade-Chamberlain would be a leading 
candidate to take over on the left.Â
