Prince Charles has earned more than £1 million from people dying without a will in the past six years, it has emerged.

Financial accounts published by the Duchy of Cornwall - the private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of Charles and his family - reveal he earned £552,000 from the unusual power this year alone.

Under constitutional law dating back to medieval times, the Prince of Wales is entitled to the estates of people who die without a will in Cornwall, but for the past 40 years he has decided to donate the money to charities.

In Britain, dying without a will, known as ‘dying intestate’, means money left by the deceased goes to the Government.

But in Cornwall, their property passes to Prince Charles in what critics say amounts to the Royal overseeing a secret fiefdom.

Accounts that go back to 2006 published on the Duchy’s website disclose total earnings of £1.019 million.

Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, which is calling to abolish the Duchy said: 'Prince Charles has absolutely no right to that money. It is a ridiculous situation.

'Anywhere else in the country that money goes into the public purse but in Cornwall it goes into his pocket. It needs to stop.'

As the Duke of Cornwall, Charles has several little known rights and powers, including the right to veto Westminster legislation.

One of these is Bona Vacantia - from the Latin meaning vacant land - the right to claim the estates of people who die without heirs in the county.

Under the Charter of Edward III, the eldest son of the ruling monarch inherits the title of the Duke of Cornwall.

The title comes with the land and income of the Duchy of Cornwall - some 132,000 acres of land, much of it in Cornwall.

The Prince’s annual income as Duchy of Cornwall was £18.3 million last year - the majority earned from residential and commercial property rents on the land.

According to the Duchy website, all money derived from people dying without a will is donated to charity through the Duke of Cornwall’s benevolent fund.

A Duchy of Cornwall spokesperson said: 'The Prince of Wales decided almost forty years ago that the bona vacantia funds should be given to charity.'

Charles pays income tax voluntarily at the highest rate, netting the Inland Revenue around £4.5 million last year.
