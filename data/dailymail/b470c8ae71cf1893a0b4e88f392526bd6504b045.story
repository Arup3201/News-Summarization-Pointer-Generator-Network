'Murdered': Lauren Patterson, 24, is believed to have been found dead hours after flying back to the Middle East from her grandmother's funeral

The body of a British teacher allegedly murdered in Qatar was found in the desert, it has been claimed.

Lauren
Patterson, 24, was reportedly last seen with two men, including an ex-boyfriend, at
a nightclub in Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Saturday night.

Her body was later recovered and two men, said to be locals, were arrested over her murder.

A
friend told The Times that Miss Patterson and her ex-boyfriend broke up
several months ago after they had talked about getting engaged.

Amid confusing reports, there were suggestions from friends that Miss Patterson had left a nightclub at the five-star hotel La Cigale with a group of Qatari men and had texted friends to say she was being taken to the wrong house.

One close friend also posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘Lauren was raped and brutally murdered. Her body was found in the dumpsters behind La Cigale.’

However, the duty manager of La Cigale claimed police have not asked to examine CCTV footage or question staff at the hotel.

George Forzi told MailOnline: 'I don't know anything about this story.

'I have not seen police at all, at any time. They have not asked me to see the CCTV.'

Sources have now told The Times that she was found in the desert.

Doha police said they could not confirm whether Miss Patterson had died, what had happened to her or the progress of their investigation.

Miss Patterson is believed to have been killed hours after flying back to the Middle East from her grandmother’s funeral.

News of her disappearance had prompted her family and friends to launch a frantic campaign on Facebook and other social media to find her.

But 40 hours later her boyfriend, James Grima, posted a message saying she was dead.

It was followed by dozens of tributes praising a ‘truly amazing’ young woman.

Miss Patterson’s Kent-based mother, Alison, has reportedly flown to Qatar to formally identify her body.

In an online tribute, she wrote: ‘She was truly a remarkable girl, my rock, always there for everyone. I know she’s in heaven now in her Daddy’s arms.’

Miss Paterson had flown back to the Middle East on Friday and was a primary teacher at Newton British School in Doha.

They had moved back to Britain only recently, after living in Luxembourg for seven years.

On
Sunday, Miss Patterson’s boyfriend Mr Grima, an IT technician and DJ 
based in Malta, posted an appeal to track her down after becoming 
concerned about her whereabouts.

On Facebook, he said: ‘I can’t believe that it had to end this way Lauren, I really don’t.

‘I was so happy that I had finally found someone that could change my life so much, and in such a positive way too...

‘Rest In Peace babe ... I will always look up at the sky cause you always were the brightest star and always will be.’

Mr
Grima added: 'I love you so much babe, I really do and I can’t get over
the fact that you were taken away so cruelly, it really breaks my heart
to think about it.

'I know you’re watching over us, wherever you are, 
and I know that I will meet you again one day.'

The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports that a body had been discovered but were unable to comment further.

A spokesman said: ‘We are aware of a British national, Lauren Patterson, reported missing in Qatar.

Qatar, which will host the World Cup in 2022, is considered to be one of the safest spots in the Middle East for expatriates.

But
last November an American pre-school teacher, 40-year-old Jennifer 
Brown, was allegedly killed there by a Kenyan security guard.

He will face trial next month and could be given the death penalty if convicted.
