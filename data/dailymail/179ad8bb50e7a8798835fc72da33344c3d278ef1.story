Sir Malcolm Rifkind, head of Britain's spy watchdog, has condemned claims by Edward Snowden's reporters

Claims by supporters of rogue agent Edward Snowden that Britain’s spy agencies were as sinister as their counterparts in Russia and China were condemned last night as ‘insidious’ and unforgivable.

The comments by the head of Britain’s spy watchdog, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, will be seen as a direct attack on The Guardian newspaper.

It published vast amounts of previously secret information stolen by Snowden, pictured, from his former employers at the CIA which revealed in detail the extent of secret surveillance in the UK.

In a speech at Oxford University’s Wadham College, Sir Malcolm, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), said: ‘It is ironic that Mr Snowden, in the name of privacy and the rule of law, chose China and Russia from which to launch his attack on the United States.

‘Intelligence agencies exist in every state, both democratic and authoritarian, throughout the world. While they share certain things in common, we must never lose sight of the differences.

‘Intelligence agencies within authoritarian systems may wish to protect the public from terrorism and some types of serious crime.

But their primary objective is the preservation of the regime they serve.

‘Unfortunately, the insidious use of language such as ‘mass surveillance’ and ‘Orwellian’ by many of Mr Snowden’s supporters to describe the actions of Western agencies blurs, unforgivably, the distinction between a system that uses the state to protect the people, and one that uses the state to protect itself against the people.’

Unlike spy agencies in authoritarian countries, Britain’s spies do not want to be ‘all seeing’ or ‘all hearing’, he said. Instead, they operate with ‘noble motivations’ and under ‘lawful authority’.

His comments came ahead of the publication today of a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee calling for the ISC to be stripped of its monopoly of scrutiny of the three intelligence and security agencies.

In what will be seen as a power grab, it called for wider scrutiny by Parliament and for direct elections to the committee by MPs in the House of Commons.

The committee declared that the current governance arrangements were designed for the Cold War era of John Le Carre and had failed to keep up with the modern era.

The report said current scrutiny was ‘ineffective’.

With reference to Le Carre’s fictional Cold War spy George Smiley, Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: ‘The current system of oversight is designed to scrutinise the work of George Smiley not the 21st century reality of the security and intelligence services.

‘The agencies are at the cutting edge of sophistication and are owed an equally refined system of democratic scrutiny.

‘It is an embarrassing indictment of our system that some in the media felt compelled to publish leaked information to ensure that matters were heard in Parliament.

‘The Intelligence and Security Committee should be given a democratic mandate in the same way as other Select Committees. We will then be able to robustly defend our methods of scrutiny and better serve those who protect us, and the public.’

While accepting that scrutiny could be improved, Sir Malcolm defended his work and pointed to holes the arguments made by critics of the services.

He said: ‘Our agencies are not, and do not wish to be, ‘all-seeing’, nor ‘all-hearing’. Their capabilities have been designed to pursue their lawful, narrowly-defined objectives.

‘True public servants operate with noble motivations, lawful authority, and subject to rigorous oversight. These are the values that distinguish public servants from a public threat. That is how those who work for our intelligence agencies see themselves.’

Comparisons with the US were false, he added, because of different approaches to surveillance in the two countries. Britain has no database of its citizens’ telephone communications, he said, so cannot abolish it, as President Obama is proposing.

He pointed out that when a terrorist atrocity occurs, the public asks why so little was known about who did it. By contrast in the wake of the Snowden revelations a ‘smaller but vocal minority’ has been asking why so much surveillance is needed.

And he said the internet age and the use of new technology by terrorists meant more surveillance was needed and greater intrusion tolerated than when the enemy was foreign governments.

He said: ‘Most people recognise that if actual or potential terrorists are to be apprehended, there is likely to be a considerably greater degree of intrusion into the privacy of the public by the security services than was required when our enemies were restricted to foreign governments.

It was wrong to claim that intelligence agencies had some ‘sinister intent’.

Earlier this year Mi5 director general Andrew Parker warned in a speech that revealing details about the work of GCHQ was a ‘gift to terrorists’, while Sir John Sawers, head of MI6, said terrorists were ‘rubbing their hands with glee’.

Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency (NSA) and CIA stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to The Guardian and the Washington Post.

He eventually sought refuge in Russia where he was granted asylum.
