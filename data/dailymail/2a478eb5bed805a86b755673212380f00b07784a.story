New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker joined in on Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's annual 'airing of the grievances' on Twitter this year, playfully suggesting that the Republican lawmaker shed his curly locks ahead of his probable presidential campaign.

Paul, a likely but unconfirmed White House contender, was sending the tweets as part of the fictional 'Festivus' holiday, made popular in the 1990s 'Seinfeld' sitcom when he teased Democrat Booker for not retweeting him more often.

Booker responded in kind and said he had only one grievance for his colleague in the Senate.

'SHAVE YOUR HEAD. Those curls are offensive. Plus If running for a higher office u'll be far more aerodynamic,' he joked.

Earlier in the day Paul had mocked the media for obsessing over his hair and questioning the authenticity of his curls.

Paul is an unconfirmed presidential contender but is expected to join a broad GOP field in the coming months, but he could just be referring to his Senate re-election bid 

After Paul teased Booker for not retweeting him more, the New Jersey Senator - who is bald - mocked Paul's curly hair

'The hair is real & mine. Don't know why ur fascinated with it or compare it to alien life forms,' he tweeted along with a photo of himself with his hair circled in red. 

Booker and Paul are on opposite sides of the political divide but they have bonded in the Senate over their support for criminal justice reform.

After his initial tweet sharing his artificial grievance with Booker, Paul noted that in the past year the two had 'discussed hemp, med marijuana, crim justice reform. Some of that has now passed, all of it we've worked on together this year.'

Paul added,'My grievance there though remains the same. Not enough looking for agreement in Washington. @CoryBooker and I will keep trying.'

Booker also followed up his lighthearted message with one that was serious in tone.

'Rand, in honor of #Festivus, here's to u & I with our colleagues showing a true feat of strength & passing crim justice reform,' he said.

'Festivus' is a made-up secular holiday that the cantankerous 'Seinfeld' character Frank Costanza forced on his family each year two days before Christmas as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah.

Its celebration, he explained on the show, included a Festivus dinner during which people told their family members 'all the ways they've disappointed you' during the year.

Instead of a tree or menorah, the Costanza family erected an unadorned silver 'Festivus pole.' The day-long event also included 'feats of strength' and 'Festivus miracles' – which were ordinary events with simple explanations. 

Earlier in the day Paul had pondered the media's obsession with his hair and confirmed its authenticity

Paul's grievances included ribs at his political opponents, including Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, outgoing Senate Majority Leader and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.

In a tweet directed at Grimes, who unsuccessfully challenged incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the last election and will likely challenge Paul in the next one, Paul made of the Democrat for refusing to acknowledge her support for Obama during her last campaign.

'I am still wondering who @Alison4KY voted for,' he said, facetiously.

Paul also rubbed salt in Reid's election-inflicted wound, tweeting, 'To my friend @SenatorReid , wishing you a long and fruitful tenure as minority leader #sorrynotsorry'

As a result of Republican gains in November Reid was demoted and Republican McConnell ascended to the Senate's top leadership post.

Paul mostly left his Republican colleagues alone, save Rubio, who he has been feuding with for the past week over the Cuba policy.

'Tempting to air a grievance @MarcoRubio again, but we've done that enough for this week. Instead I will say an early Merry Christmas,' Paul said, laying down his sword in the holiday spirit.

Taking a jovial tone, Paul joking griped that 'no matter how many times I ask [McConnell] he won't let me borrow this awesome sweater vest.'

'We all know having a fashion forward campaign is important to success, as [former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum] showed us in 2012 #festivus,' he said in a tweet accompanied by a photo of Santorum on the campaign trail. 

Paul's 'airing of grievances started with a jab at incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's fashion sense before he posted his own Photoshopped shirt

Did a US senator just announce he's running for president on Twitter, or is he toying with us? Kentucky Republican Rand Paul tweeted this photo on Tuesday 

But what started as jabs about sweater vests worn quickly switched on Washington's buzz machine when Paul added a Photoshopped pic of a turtleneck sporting a 'Rand Paul 2016' slogan.

'Of course, everyone has to be themselves, and I have my own style,' he tweeted. 'I think this will be a popular item this year.' 

Many who follow the senator on Twitter took him seriously.

'Strangest way to announce you're running for President, achieved,' tweeted one user.

'If Rand Paul just announced his presidential campaign vis a vis a Festivus rant, I have to vote for him. No choicem,' wrote another.

But others noted that Paul is also up for re-election to the Senate in two years.

Asked whether the senator was really making a campaign announcement about the presidency, a Paul spokesman wrote back – complete with a smiley-face emoticon: 'Senator Paul is running for the Senate in 2016 :-)'

'Ive got a lot of problems with you people!': Paul quoted Frank Costanza, a 'Seinfeld' character, who berated his family members around the dinner table two days before Christmas

On 'Seinfeld,' Frank Costanza, the crusty father of George Costanza, created Festivus as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah 

He has signaled, however, that he could run for both the Senate and the White House simultaneously, a prospect that Grimes has said she will try to block.

Grimes lost her own Senate bid to McConnell in November by a 15-point margin.

'The law is clear,' she told WHAS-TV a week ago. 'You can’t be on the ballot twice for two offices.'

'At the end of the day, we’re not going to be bullied,' she pledged.

Grimes herself could be a Senate front-runner if Paul were forced to choose and picked a presidential bid over running for a second six-year term in Congress. 

Making a big political announcement on social media isn't unprecedented. Last week former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush used Facebook and Twitter to declare that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee.
