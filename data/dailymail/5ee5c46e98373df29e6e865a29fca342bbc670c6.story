Necessary: Investigations are underway into how police officers dealt with Miriam Carey's driving rampage in Washington, DC on Thursday

Washington police will now investigate officers' use of force in killing Miriam Carey, the 34-year-old woman who tried to ram her car through a White House barrier on Thursday.

Investigators will study the car chase and shooting and look into whether police officers took the right steps in stopping Carey's rampage, which briefly put the U.S. Capitol on lock down.

So far, Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer believes that the officers 'did the best they could under the situation.'

But Carey's sisters have both made statements expressing how they disagree.

Her sister Valerie Carey, a retired New York City Police Officer, said there was 'no need for a gun to be used when there was no gunfire coming from the vehicle'.

'We're still very confused as a family why she's not still alive,' sister Amy Carey-Jones said in New York on Friday.'I feel like it's not justified, not justified.'

Sgt Gainer says officers working at high-target buildings must make quick decisions to confront threats.

'This is not a routine highway or city traffic stop. It is simply not that,' Gainer said yesterday. 'The milieu under which we're operating at the United States Capitol and I suspect at the White House and at icons up in New York is an anti-terrorism approach, and that is a difference with a huge, huge distinction.'

Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine was also happy with the way his officers acted under pressure, saying they were 'heroic' defending the Capitol.

Speaking out: Miriam Carey's sisters- Valerie Carey (left) and Amy Carey-Jones- held a press conference near Amy's home in Brooklyn on Friday

Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase

Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression

Carey was killed on Thursday after she
slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it 
was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she 
had her young daughter in the backseat.

Witnesses
say Carey plowed through a temporary barrier and hit a Secret Service 
agent who was trying to wave her off - sending him flying onto the hood 
of her car.

The Secret Service opened fire on her car as she turned and fled.

The people who knew: Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones spoke to Anderson Cooper about the doctor's decision to taper her off medication he had prescribed for post-partum depression

Surrounded: Police officers surround the car with their weapons drawn after the female driver rammed a barricade close to the White House on Thursday

Police pursued her through the streets of Capitol Hill during a frantic chase that hit speeds up to 80pmh.

Video
footage shows the Capitol Police officers - who have not been paid 
since Tuesday because of the government shutdown - surrounded Casey's 
car - guns drawn. At one point an officer even sticks his weapon inside 
her open passenger-side window.

But
even being blocked in by cops didn't stop her, she wheels the car 
around, hitting a police cruiser and nearly striking several officers, 
and flees.

Officers can be heard shooting at her car as it drives off.

Moments later, Carey was shot and killed - within sight of the Capitol Building, and just behind the U.S. Supreme Court.

She was not armed.

Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy 
(right) said that there is no clear reason why Miriam drove down to DC 
where she met her death on Thursday

Since
the shooting, police have revealed that Carey suffered from post-partum
depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose 
name has not been released.

After searching Carey's Stamford, 
Connecticut home, police found files confirming her former mental 
diagnosis, though the clearest reports come from the interview with the 
victim's sisters.  

'My 
sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why
she was in DC. Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not 
have ended there,' Valery Carey, one of her sisters, told CNN.

Amy
described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored 
by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication 
for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior 
issues.

'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said.

'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication.

'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable.

'There (were) not moments of her walking around with delusions- that's not what was going on.

'She
had her challenges as a new parent and I always spoke closely with 
her,’ Amy said, describing those challenges as ‘nothing out of the 
ordinary’.

'She seemed to be overwhelmed.'

The
biggest question- why she did it- will be one that remains with family 
members for the rest of their lives as Valerie Carey said that 'she was a
law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda'.

'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' her sister Amy said.

Miriam's boyfriend has told investigators that she feared her house was under surveillance by President Obama, though her sisters dispute that theory.

'What I can say is she has never disclosed of anything of that nature and since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable,' Valerie told Anderson Cooper during the Friday interview.
