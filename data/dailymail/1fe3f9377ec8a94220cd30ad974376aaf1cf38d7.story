As India and Bangladesh relaxed with games of football before their World Cup quarter-final, the underdogs came out swinging.

Defending champions India are almost everybody's overwhelming favourites to sweep aside Bangladesh in Melbourne. 

But Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, however, knows what it feels like to score an important victory over India and is confident the underdogs can cause a shock.

He was only months into an outstanding international career, which currently places him at the top of the International Cricket Council all-rounder rankings, when he made a half-century in the five-wicket success in Trinidad which sent India out of the 2007 World Cup - almost exactly eight years ago.

Shakib, and Bangladesh, have had little success against their super-power neighbours in the intervening years and were beaten by their fellow co-hosts as India steered their championship route in this tournament in 2011.

But as Bangladesh enter unchartered territory, as quarter-final debutants, Shakib warns anything is possible.

'This is the first time we're playing in a World Cup quarter-final - but at the same time we need to understand it's another game of cricket,' he said. 'Obviously, on paper, India are a better team than Bangladesh - no one has any doubt about it.

'But on the day, it's a one-off game - and if we have a good day and they have a bad day, you never know.'

Will he be taking extra confidence then, for Thursday's match, from that win way back when in Port-of-Spain?

While Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India, as is their wont, declined to speak publicly until they must on the eve of the match - and even chose not to play any cricket either at the MCG, preferring football practice - Shakib was not minded to make too much of Bangladesh's 2007 win.

'It will be in our memory,' he said. 'But it's a new game, and we all know it. India are a very good side - they have some world-class players. Obviously, it's going to be hard for us. We know that, but we're up for the challenge.'

The indications in Bangladesh's campaign so far, according to Shakib, are encouraging.

He said: 'I think we played fearless cricket [in 2007], and we all want to play that brand of cricket.

'So far in this World Cup, I think we're doing it. India are the defending world champions - they've got some world-class players - but we're doing well in this World Cup. Our confidence is high enough, and we're up for the match.'
