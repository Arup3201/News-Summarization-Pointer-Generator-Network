A driver sent a ticket for speeding past a primary school has successfully had his case dismissed after arguing the white lines marked either side were too short.

David Erasmus, 55, opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone.

After receiving the ticket, the former engineer had revisited the spot where he was caught and noticed that the white road markings, used to measure the speed that a vehicle is travelling between them, seemed short.

David Erasmus (pictured) opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone in Hendy, west Wales 

Adamant he had not been speeding, he measured the markings and found they were three inches shorter than at other speed camera locations. 

During his trial, Mr Erasmus, of Hendy, near Llanelli, west Wales, was able to convice Llanelli Magistrates Court that the shorter lines made it appear he was going faster than he actually was.

His case has now been formally dismissed.

Mr Erasmus has now had his case formally dismissed at Llanelli Magistrates Court and said the ruling was likely to impact other drivers

The decision could mean hundreds of other drivers have been wrongly convicted of speeding - some may even have been banned. 

'The lines were three inches short, which is a big difference. It will impact on other drivers,' he said after the trial.

'It was worth challenging it as I got it to court and the case was dismissed.'

A spokesman for GoSafe, which is responsible for speed camera enforcement in Wales, said it would look closely at the evidence in the case.

'The camera and secondary check marks on the A4138 has been fully type approved by the Home Office and the secondary check marks in particular, meet the required tolerance.

'The outcome of the case is a matter for the Magistrates Courts, however, we are keen to understand the circumstances and will review the case in due course.'

Carmarthenshire Council transport manager John McEvoy said: 'The markings referred to will be measured by our team this week to confirm the interval measurements reported to the court and, if necessary, amended.'
