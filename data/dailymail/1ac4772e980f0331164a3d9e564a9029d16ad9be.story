A Michigan man came home Wednesday evening to find his wife had been stabbed to death and their 'psychotic' 19-year-old son is now charged with her murder.

David Kellen Grow was arraigned Thursday on an open murder count in Jackson County District Court for accusations that he used a knife to kill his mother, 49-year-old Robin Denise Grow, in their Concord home.

The 19-year-old's parents had hospitalized him for mental instability for 10 days in January until a judge ordered that he be released against his parents wishes. It was 23 days later that he allegedly murdered his mother.

in his second floor bedroom window and harming him and his family,' 
Grow’s father, Ronald Grow, wrote in a chilling 'petition for 
hospitalization' dated Jan. 25.

The suspect was hospitalized at Allegiance Health before he was discharged on Jan. 28, mlive.com reported. 

Ronald Grow encountered a gruesome scene that prosecutors described as 'horrendous' when he entered his home at 224 W. Center St. in Concord Wednesday. No further details regarding the crime scene or Ms. Grow's injuries have been revealed.

According to court records, David Grow has autism spectrum disorder and psychosis.

When he was hospitalized on Jan. 18, he was 'having disorganized speech' and actively chanting and hallucinating, physician assistant Jennifer Underwood wrote in a petition for hospitalization.

The petition noted that his behavior was
'substantially supportive' of the expectation that he would hurt 
himself or someone else.

Dr. Aurif A. Abedi reported in the petition that Grow was unable to communicate and lacked 'total insight.'

Another doctor wrote that he was confused and incoherent, while a third doctor called him 'acutely psychotic.'

But Judge Diane Rappleye denied the petition to keep him hospitalized and ordered him discharged.

Twenty-three days later, he allegedly killed his mother.

At his arraignment, Grow was somewhat unresponsive and barely spoke, apart from mumbling to himself.

Judge Daniel Goostrey had to ask him to confirm his identity several times before he eventually nodded to acknowledge his name.

Goostrey ordered Grow to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the state Center for Forensic Psychiatry in Washtenaw County, where officials will determind whether he is fit to stand trial. He will remain in custody until then.
