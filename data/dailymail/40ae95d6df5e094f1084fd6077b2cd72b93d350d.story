Amie Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to her Staffordshire Bull Terrier at Newcastle Magistrates' court yesterday

A cruel owner is facing jail after starving her Staffordshire bull terrier to death and locking it in a filthy kitchen filled with rubbish and faeces.

Amie Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal after the emaciated body of her white terrier, Rocky, was discovered by police in her Tyneside home.

The starving animal had become so desperate for food that he chewed tins of dog food which had been left on the floor, Newcastle Magistrates' court heard yesterday.

When his body was examined by a vet, Rocky was found to weigh just 11kg, when he should have been more than 18kg.

Police entered Smith's home in Walker, after a worker from Your Homes Newcastle, reported 'a smell of death'.

Prosecutor Denise Jackman said: 'The officer found a deceased, white Staffordshire bull terrier lying on the kitchen floor among a vast amount of rubbish. The body of the dog was emaciated and had ribs protruding.

'There were faeces all over the floor. There was an empty water bowl and tins of food with dints in, as if the dog had attempted to open the tin with his teeth.

'The RSPCA inspector said there was an over-powering smell and that the kitchen was extremely cluttered. 

'She noticed the tins of dog meat, which had been chewed.

'The vet said the unnecessary suffering of starvation would have caused immense stress. The hunger would have caused loss of consciousness before death occurred.'

When interviewed, Smith, who now lives in Wallsend, said she asked a friend to look after the dog while she went away to Blackpool between February 5 and March 26 this year.

David Parish, speaking in her defence, said Smith suffers from mental health issues and was ashamed of her actions.

He said: 'This is a lady with significant difficulties and significant mental health problems.

'She was the victim of domestic violence, which occurred where the dog was found. She was not able to cope and felt she couldn't return to the property.

'She is deeply sorry, deeply upset and deeply ashamed at what has happened.'

Magistrates adjourned sentencing until later this month for the preparation of reports.
