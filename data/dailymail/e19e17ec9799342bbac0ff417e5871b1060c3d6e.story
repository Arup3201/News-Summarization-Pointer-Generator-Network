West Brom will step up their interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher following his failure to move to West Ham.

Fletcher can commute from his Cheshire home, Joleon Lescott makes the same journey down the M6, and head coach Tony Pulis is keen to do business, preferably a deal until the end of the season with an option. 

Fletcher, 30, was poised to sign for the Upton Park club after travelling to London on Friday to undergo a medical and discuss terms.

However, after further talks, West Ham then tried to make the transfer a loan rather than a permanent deal and Fletcher and United pulled the plug.

United had agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer. Manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement.

'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.'

Fletcher was due to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal worth around £60,000 a week. 

Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season. 

Fletcher has made 342 appearances for Manchester United but the Scotland international has started just five times during Van Gaal's reign.
