Marouane Fellaini has braided his hair ahead of the new Premier League season as he looks to kick-start his career while fearing the chop from Manchester United.

The 26-year-old was pictured on the Facebook page of Belgian organic cosmetic JYB Cosmetics sporting his new do.

Maybe, after a disappointing season with both club and country, he has decided it's time for a fresh start and a new look?

The 26-year-old is coming off the back 
of a terrible debut season at Manchester United, where he failed to 
score in 21 appearances in all competitions.

He did come off the bench to score in Belgium's first World Cup game against Algeria, but underwhelmed throughout the rest of the competition, as they crashed out at the last 16 stage.

It also seems as though he's slipping down the pecking order at Old Trafford, with midfielder Ander Herrera having already arrived, and more reinforcements apparently on the way.

Perhaps the trim will help convince Van Gaal that he is a man that means business this season.
