Daniel Levy will begin a major restructuring of Tottenham’s scouting and recruitment procedures after their poor start to the Barclays Premier League season.

The Spurs chairman is planning the overhaul to help manager Mauricio Pochettino’s short-and long-term transfer activity.

Although Levy is deeply unhappy with the performance of the team under their new head coach, the Argentine has the chairman’s full support. 

Tottenham went on a chaotic spending spree after selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for £86m

Erik Lamela was signed for £30m but missed most of last season through injury

Roberto Soldado was signed for £26m from Valencia but has failed to convince the White Hart Lane faithful

Etienne Capoue (right) was signed from Toulouse for £8.6m but has yet to fulfil his potential

Vlad Chiriches (right) was signed from Steaua Bucharest for £8.5m and has also struggled

Christian Eriksen (right) has been Tottenham's best signing since Gareth Bale left

After Gareth Bale was sold to Real Madrid for £86m, Tottenham reinvested that money into their squad - with little success.

Paulinho - £17m from Corinthians 

Christian Eriksen - £11.5m from Ajax 

Roberto Soldado - £26m from Valencia 

Nacer Chadli - £6m from FC Twente 

Etienne Capoue - £8.6m from Toulouse 

Vlad Chiriches - £8.5m from Steaua Bucharest

Erik Lamela - £30m from Roma

Instead Levy is planning a shake-up to ensure the proper procedures are in place to scout and recruit talent after spending the £86million from Gareth Bale’s sale last summer.

The club’s head of analysis Jonathan Beaker has already left the club and has moved to Australia, but Levy has plans to restructure his scouting policy in the coming weeks.

Spurs are still recovering from that chaotic spending spree last summer and Levy wants to make sure there is a system of accountability in place after last season’s blame game. 

Tottenham are widely recognised as the most political club in the Premier League and the fingers were being pointed after last season’s depressing results.

Their director of football administration, Darren Eales, who was hugely supportive of staff at their new training ground, is serving his notice period. His departure for MLS side Atlanta, announced last month, is unrelated to his work at Spurs. He is leaving for personal reasons and is expected to complete the move to the United States in the next couple of weeks.

Paulinho was bought for £17m but the Brazil midfielder has failed to establish himself in the team

Nacer Chadli has hit form this season after a poor first season at White Hart Lane

Mauricio Pochettino still has Levy's backing despite disappointing start to the season

Levy wants to bring people in to assist Pochettino before the transfer window opens in January. Sporting director Franco Baldini is expected to play a key role in future plans, but Levy is driving the project.

He was disappointed by the club’s failure to push on last season under Andre Villas-Boas after he sold Bale to Real Madrid for a world record fee.

Instead they squandered vast sums on Paulinho, Nacer Chadli, Roberto Soldado, Etienne Capoue, Vlad Chiriches, Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen.
