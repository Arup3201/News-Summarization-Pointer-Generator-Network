Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing and distributing indecent images of children

The ex-girlfriend of paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins has denied that she carried out a campaign to expose him out of jealousy over his affairs with other women.

Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing and distributing indecent images of children and encouraging Watkins to send her images.

The mother-of-one said she wanted to get 'inside' Watkins's head by taking part in graphic online sex chat, which also included references to the abuse of babies, as a way of trapping him.

She insisted she had a 'legitimate reason' for the possession of indecent images of children as it was part of a plan to bring the musician - jailed for 35 years for trying to rape a baby - to justice.

Mjadzelics from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, denied all charges and claimed her campaign to expose him as a child abuser was motivated by protecting victims and not out of spite.

Police found a computer file titled 'Jo Filth' on which the pair discussed online incest while acting out being brother and sister and cross-dressing.

They also talked about kidnapping a brother and sister from outside a school, killing one and raping the other.

Mjadzelics told the jury: 'Playing him, leading him on, telling him what he wanted to hear, telling him that I loved him, although I don't think I did, just telling him what he wanted to hear.

'Dirty talk, filthy talk, describing horrible things... just to play along.'

Michael Wolkind QC, defending, asked her whether she was driven by jealousy because Watkins had a string of lovers.

'No, I was concerned he was molesting a child,' she said.

Earlier, Mjadzelics told the court she could not remember the indecent photographs she is accused of sending to Watkins, or searching for them.

'I'd remember if I'd done it but I haven't done that,' she said.

The jury has previously heard that Mjadzelics - a former prostitute and special constable - first reported Watkins to the authorities in 2008 and claimed the police would not listen to her concerns.

She said police branded her a 'nut job' who was 'harassing' the musician and his family.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences

The 39-year-old told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. 

Mjadzelics told the court she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009.

She said she also wrote letters to Watkins' mother warning her of her son's paedophile activities only to be questioned by police in March 2009 over 'harassment' of his family.

She said she broke contact with Watkins in 2009. 

Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby

But she told the court they met again in a Leeds hotel in 2010 where he opened his laptop and showed her a video of a 'child crying and being raped' while Watkins had an 'evil smirk' on his face.

Mjadzelics said: 'He was looking at me for a reaction and I cried and told him to get out of the hotel room.'

She told jurors that she tried repeatedly to report the crime to police but she was 'ignored'. 

It was then, she claims, that she decided she needed to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him.

She said: 'We contacted each other again in May 2011 and by that time I had decided it was no good crying and sending him away anymore.

'I had to basically change the game and change my reaction and play him.' 

She said the next time he contacted her he told her he had gone to Los Angeles to listen to his album, and had raped a 12-year-old girl and plied her with cocaine. 

Mjadzelics first met Watkins in 2006 after going on the Lostprophets website looking for show tickets for a friend.

She received a reply from someone called Ian who she eventually realised was Watkins and their online conversations became sexual with him inviting her to meet him at a Leeds hotel.

Mjadzelics, who was working for a private bank, said Watkins filmed their first sexual encounter and later others too. 

She was arrested  in January 2013 for conspiracy to rape a baby.

Her defence barrister said she damaged her health because of the 'incompetence and indifference' of the police and child agencies she asked for help.

'She is stressed, traumatised, has suffered a stroke, has disabling migraines', Michael Wolkind QC told jurors. 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has three ongoing independent investigations into the response of South Wales Police, Bedfordshire Police and South Yorkshire Police to allegations that Watkins was abusing children.

The trial was adjourned until Monday.
