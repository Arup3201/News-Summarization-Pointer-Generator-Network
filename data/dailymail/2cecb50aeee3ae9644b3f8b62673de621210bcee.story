A vast shipyard which is larger than a football pitch and built ships for Roman emperors, including Hadrian, has been discovered by British archaeologists.

Experts from the University of Southampton, among others, excavated the remains of a building more than 150m long and 60m wide at Portus, the ancient port for Rome.

The five-storey high structure is thought to be from about 117 AD, in the reign of Trajan, was used to either build or service ships that travelled across the empire 2,000 years ago to keep Rome supplied with food and goods.

The largest find of its kind in Italy or the Mediterranean, it was found close to a distinctive existing hexagonal basin or 'harbour' at the centre of the huge ancient port complex, which covers two square miles.

It sits by the side of Fiumicino airport and is now more than two miles from the Mediterranean.

The building is so grand archaeologists think it had some form of imperial connection and might have been used for a base for galleys that transported emperors, such as Hadrian, across the empire on their way to places like Britain.

Hadrian (Publius Aelius Trajanus Hadrianus Augustus) lived from 24 January 76 AD â€“ 10 July 138 AD and was Roman Emperor from 117 to 138.

He is best known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Roman territory in Britain.

In Rome, he re-built the Pantheon and constructed the Temple of Venus and Roma.

In addition to being emperor, Hadrian was a humanist and was philhellene (had a love of Greek culture) in all his tastes.

He was the third of the so-called Five Good Emperors.

The latest discovery comes after the team found an ornate private amphitheatre at the same site two years ago.

The new building is further proof of a link to the leaders of the Roman world and the importance of the ruins.

University of Southampton professor and Portus project director, Simon Keay, said: 'This is an exciting and important discovery and the building is a really, really fantastic thing to find.

'Emperors leaving and coming back in this period, like Hadrian, must have come through Portus and they must have had a place to stay and leave from that was of a status similar to what we have found.

'At first we thought this large rectangular building was used as a warehouse, but our latest excavation has uncovered evidence that there may have been another, earlier use, connected to the building and maintenance of ships.

'Few Roman imperial shipyards have been discovered and, if our identification is correct, this would be the largest of its kind in Italy or the Mediterranean.'

Portus was a crucial trade gateway linking Rome to the Mediterranean throughout the Roman period and the archaeologists have been investigating the port's significance over a number of years.

Until now, no major shipyard building for Rome had been identified, apart from the possibility of one on the Tiber near Monte Testaccio, and a smaller one recently claimed for the neighbouring river port at Ostia.

'This was a vast structure which 
could easily have housed wood, canvas and other supplies and certainly 
would have been large enough to build or shelter ships in,' Prof Keay 
said.

'The scale, position and unique nature of the building lead us to believe it played a key role in shipbuilding activities.'

Already archaeologists have found tacks which would have been used to nail lead on to the hulls of ships inside one of the bays.
