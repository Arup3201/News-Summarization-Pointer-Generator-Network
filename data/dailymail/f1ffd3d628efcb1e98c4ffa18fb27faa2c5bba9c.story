Edinburgh made it four wins out of four with a comfortable 24-6 victory over a London Welsh in the European Rugby Challenge Cup at the Kassam Stadium in Oxford.

Welsh have yet to pick up a win in the Challenge Cup or Aviva Premiership this season and found themselves 9-3 down at half-time after Sam Hidalgo-Clyne kicked three penalties to Chris Elder's one to put Edinburgh ahead.

The hosts should have taken advantage when Edinburgh centre Andries Strauss was sin-binned.

However, they failed to do so, losing Lachlan McCaffrey to a yellow card just before the break to go down to 14 men.

Hidalgo-Clyne and Elder again traded penalties soon after the restart before Scotland wing Dougie Fife, released by Jack Cuthbert, made the significant breakthough with a try in the 56th minute for Edinburgh.

Welsh lost a second player, lock Dean Schofield, to a yellow card before the end and their misery was complete three minutes from time when Roddy Grant crossed and Greig Tonks converted.
