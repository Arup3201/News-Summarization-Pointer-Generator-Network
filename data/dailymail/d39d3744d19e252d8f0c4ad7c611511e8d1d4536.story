The 18-year-old will ride Ed Dunlop-trained horse

Red Galileo is priced at 125-1 to win Saturday's prestigious Flat race

Murphy has ridden 84 winners and is based with Berkshire trainer Andrew Balding

Twelve months after working at Epsom’s Investec Derby meeting as a stable lad, apprentice sensation Oisin Murphy will ride in the world’s most prestigious Flat race on Saturday after being booked for Ed Dunlop-trained Red Galileo.

Murphy has little chance of winning the prestigious mile-and-a-half race on the 125-1 rank outsider but the 18-year-old’s booking is another sign of his meteoric rise through the jockey ranks.

The mount on Red Galileo will be only the second he has had in a group one race, the first arriving just over an hour earlier on William Knight-trained Beacon Lady in the Coronation Cup.

The youngest jockey to win the Derby was 16-year-old John Parsons, who won the 1862 race on Caractacus.Lester Piggott was 18 when he won the first of his nine Derbies on Never Say Die in 1954.Walter Swinburn was a year older when he romped home on Shergar in 1981, the same age as Mickael Barzalona (Pour Moi, 2011) and Joseph O’Brien (Camelot, 2012).

This time last year, the Irish teenager who is a nephew of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning jockey and trainer Jim Culloty, had had only a handful of race rides and was still awaiting his first winner.

Murphy, who has now ridden 84 winners including 13 in Australia in the Winter, is based with Berkshire trainer Andrew Balding, brother of C4 racing anchor Clare Balding.

He shot to prominence with a headline grabbing 9,260-1 four-timer, including Highland Colori in the Ayr Gold Cup, in September.

His 28 winners this season make Murphy clear leader in the 2014 apprentice jockey race and he is on course to lose his apprentice weight allowance in record time.

Dunlop and owner Ronnie Arculli were persuaded to use Murphy after watching his winning performance on sprinter Hot Streak in last month’s Group Two Temple Stakes at Haydock.

Murphy said: ‘It is a great opportunity and good of Mr Dunlop and the owner the chance. It is genuinely beyond my wildest dreams. The Derby and the Arc are the two biggest races in the world. It is unbelievable.This time last year I hadn’t ridden a winner.

Sealed with a kiss: Murphy, 18, was all smiles after he landed the Ayr Gold Cup

‘I led up Here Comes When (on Oaks day) at Epsom last year. I experienced the atmosphere a little bit but it will be very different this time.

‘I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to ride Hot Streak and it is unbelievable that one chance just leads on to another.

‘I have one ride for Mr Dunlop before.’

Dunlop added: ‘We had a list of possible jockeys and watching him win the Temple Stakes, the decision was made to book Oisin.

‘He has got a ride in the Coronation Cup earlier in the day which will be good experience.’

Red Galileo has run twice this year, finishing fourth behind Western Hymn in the Sandown Classic Trial and sixth to Snow Sky in the Lingfield Derby Trial.

Murphy cut his teeth on Ireland’s Pony Racing as well as regularly riding the jump horses of Culloty, best known as the jockey of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate.

Waitng game: Frankie Dettori's hopes of not missing out on the race for a third consecutive year now appear to hinge on Aidan O'Brien offering him the mount on one of his four entries not chosen by son Joseph and Ryan Moore

Murphy has jumped fences during schooling sessions on Lord Windermere, the winner of the Gold Cup for his uncle in March.

Red Galileo had been one of the few remaining riding options in the Derby for Frankie Dettori.

The Italian’s hopes of not missing out on the race for a third consecutive year now appear to hinge on Aidan O’Brien offering him the mount on one of his four entries not chosen by son Joseph and Ryan Moore.

Irish jockey Kevin Manning, who won the race in 2008 on New Approach but endured a torrid time on hard-pulling, well-beaten favourite Dawn Approach 12 months ago, rides Charlie Appleby’s Godolphin-owned Lingfield Trial third Sudden Wonder.

Andrea Atzeni missed his three rides at Yarmouth on Tuesday night after a heavy fall at Windsor on Monday.

He should return on Thursday and is first Derby mount, Kingston Hill, continues to attract support, being clipped to 8-1 third favourite by Coral.
