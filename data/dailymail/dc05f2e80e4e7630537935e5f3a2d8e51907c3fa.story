May and Rob Cook were sin binned for the visitors

Ryan Lamb landed a late penalty as relegated Worcester edged out Gloucester at Sixways to claim a second Premiership win of the season.

Lamb weighed in with 18 points in total, claiming one of the Warriors' three tries and landing two conversions and three penalties.

Freddie Burns' third and final penalty of the match edged Gloucester, who led 17-15 at the break, ahead but Lamb held his nerve to land the penalty that clinched victory for the home side.

England wing Jonny May scored two tries for the visitors but he and Rob Cook had spells in the sin bin which ultimately proved costly as Gloucester suffered a defeat that saw them drop to ninth place in the Premiership.

Gloucester struck first when May burst clear inside his own 22 and went over for his first try of the afternoon and Shane Monahan quickly added a second try for the visitors to give them an early stranglehold on the match.

Burns could not add the extras to either try and Lamb landed his first penalty to get the Warriors on the board at 3-10.

Sione Kalamafoni forced his way over for Gloucester's third try to put them firmly in command but Worcester responded quickly with a Semisi Taulava try from a lineout to give the home side renewed hope.

May was sent to the sin bin with half-time looming when he played the ball on the ground after halting Alex Grove's break.

The Warriors cashed in, Lamb capping off a slick move to cross under the posts before adding the extras.

England Sevens wing Josh Drauniniu gathered a cross-field kick after the break to edge the Warriors ahead for the first time, with Lamb converting.

But May, back from the sinbin, finished off a speedy break to leave Burns a straightforward kick that edged Gloucester back in front.

Cook was yellow-carded for killing the ball with just over 10 minutes remaining and Lamb landed the penalty to put Warriors one point ahead.

Burns responded to give Gloucester the advantage but when Lamb's final penalty chance game he took the chance to give the Warriors an encouraging end to a disappointing season.
