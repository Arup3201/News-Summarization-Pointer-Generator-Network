With two growing teenage daughters in the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama has put her foot down when it comes to their social media presence.

Talking to ABC News' Barbara Walters in an interview set to air on 20/20 at 10pm tonight, the 49-year-old said she doesn't want Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, to have Facebook accounts just yet.

'I still am not a big believer in Facebook for young people. . . particularly for them, because they're in the public eye,' Mrs Obama said in the interview, her first with the President this year.

Talking to ABC News' Barbara Walters in an interview set to air on 20/20 at 10pm tonight, the 49-year-old said she doesn't want Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, to have Facebook accounts just yet

'Some of its stuff they don't need to see and be a part of. . . So we try to protect them from too much of the public voice.'

While Sasha isn't old enough to be on Facebook yet, Malia's access to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks is still limited.

But with President Obama leaving his post as commander-in-chief in 2016, the parents say they encourage their daughters to grow personally through other avenues.

For example, Malia, a sophomore in high school, is allowed to date and the daughters are given permission to have frequent sleepovers on the White House's third floor.

Though Mrs Obama won't reveal whether Malia is in fact dating anyone at the moment, she said that the teenager 'can't wait until this light has dimmed to start becoming a person.'

'You know, we think about not just her life here, but her life after,' said Mrs Obama. 'Because she's gotta be an independent, strong, smart, capable woman in the world. So she has to get her training now.'

Touching on family life in the White House, Mrs Obama admitted that their home is a 'sanctuary.'

While Sasha isn't old enough to be on Facebook yet, Malia's access to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks is still limited

'The girls are there and they dominate,' she said. 'They're not talking about issues of the day, they're talking about 
issues of their day, which has nothing to do with what is going on in the rest of the world.

'Everyone has to have their safe haven, a place of peace and calm: that's
 home for us,' Mrs Obama added, saying that she 'tries to stay out' of the President's ear when he is home. 'He already has enough people in 
his ear,' she said.

When asked whether the President thinks the First Lady would have made a better president than, the couple laugh.

'I still am not a big believer in Facebook for young people. . . particularly for them, because they're in the public eye,' Mrs Obama said in the interview, her first with the President this year

Though Mrs Obama won't reveal whether Malia (left, pictured with Sasha, right) is in fact dating anyone at the moment, she said that the teenager 'can't wait until this light has dimmed to start becoming a person'

'Of course,' he said. 'That's an easy question. But she's smart enough that she might not want to go through the process.'

Mrs Obama disagreed, saying: 'He has a level of patience and focus and tenactity and calm that doesn't come by with anyone. I defintly dont have that patience.'
