Carl Cox driving an old banger, Norman Cook taking some time out in a fluffy towel and Danny Howard slipping into his PJs to catch the Coronation Street omnibus. These superstar DJs, they're just like us, you know.

Cox, Cook and Howard are just three DJs who took time out of their hectic, jet-setting lives to share their more private passions with British photographer Jessica van der Weert for a charity exhibition raising awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA) – an organisation that supports people with the debilitating hearing condition that affects almost 10% of UK adults and which affects many DJs.

Pop culture photographer van der Weert has spent two years snapping her favourite music men and women, including Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Paul Oakenfold and Mary Ann Hobbs, for the exhibition which is set to show in Berlin, New York and Ibiza this summer after a standout London debut (complete, of course, with an epic after party).

Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - is one of the DJs to be photographed by Jess van der Weert for charity exhibition Flipside

FlipSide, in association with art agents Beautiful Crime and Eddie Lock, combines van der Weert's two loves, music and photography, and is particularly a celebration of the dance music industry, bringing some of the world’s biggest techno, trance and house music DJs and producers out from behind the decks to reveal a rather more private side.

While some works feature global music heavies in their other favourite places - Carl Cox doing burnouts in his Lotus, artist Goldie covered in paint in his studio - others feature the superstar DJs re-enacting their fantasies, such as Boy George dressed in full combat gear amidst clouds of purple smoke, re-enacting a scene from Platoon.

Norman Cook - aka Fat Boy Slim - is a huge supporter of the project, and was pictured by van der Weert in the changing room of his beloved Brighton FC.

The 51-yr-old says: 'It's an original project with some insanely good pictures and it's also for a really great cause.'

Other works feature the global music heavies in their other favourite places, like Annie Mac in her dressing room surrounded by clothes and shoes

Zane Lowe and Annie Mac are two of 28 global music professionals who feature in the project by pop art photographer van der Weert

Van der Weert spent two years photographing her favourite artists and in association with art agents Beautiful Crime will take the show on the road this summer, visiting New York, Berlin and Ibiza

Car fan and global music phenomenon Carl Cox, 52, says: 'This is not a normal exhibition, this is a celebration of dance music, a collaboration between Jess and ourselves, and the images are personal, big, bold, colourful and fun.'

Van Der Weert adds: 'Flipside is an intimate glimpse into the private lives of these global superstars.

'These are my favourite DJs and producers, responsible for bringing us so much utter joy and making life that much better.

'But it's not just about me having a great time with my favourite artists, Flipside has a serious aim too. Tinnitus is a condition that affects 8% of individuals and can ruin lives. As clubbers and DJs we are far more likely to be affected and so this worldwide exhibition aims to raise awareness of the condition, how to avoid it in the first place, and most importantly how to cope with it if you already have it.' 

Van der Weert says: 'it's not just about me having a great time with my favourite artists [such as Danny Howard, pictured here on the Coronation Street cobbles], Flipside has a serious aim too.'

Example was photographed in a slick cinema for the exhibition, which debuted in London with a huge after party

Van der Weert chose DJs from many genres, including house music, hip hop, trance and techno

Carl Cox, photographed racing cars in Brighton, said: 

Goldie was pictured making art (and mischief) in his personal studio

Paul Oakenfold, another football fan, got busy for the camera at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground
