A Muslim father has removed his six-year-old daughter from school in protest at her teacher who confiscated her Islamic necklace.

Muhammed Tariq, 34, said his daughter Saniya was upset after a teacher took away her religious locket because she was swinging it around in class.

The Year 2 pupil was told to take off her taweez - a chain containing verses from the Koran - after she was caught playing with it at Nottingham Academy last Monday.

As a result, Britain’s biggest school have now made a U-turn on their uniform policy, which dictates pupils can only wear one plain pair of metal studs, and say she can now wear the jewellery in class.

However, Mr Tariq has still pulled his daughter out of lessons for over a week after he branded the teacher’s actions an 'insult to Islam.'

He is now demanding that she be placed in a different class away from the teacher who banned her 'sacred' locket.

Yesterday Mr Tariq said: 'My daughter was really upset about it when she came home - she was in floods of tears.

'This is very sacred to her and to our religion. It should not be taken off Muslims and it is something she holds very dear indeed.

'To have it taken off her for the entire day and be shouted at by her teacher like that is an insult to our religion.

Nottingham Academy has since changed its jewellery policy and said the child can wear the necklace

The row began when a teacher confiscated Saniya's taweez - a chain containing verses from the Koran

'She said she had only been itching her neck and had got the taweez out to scratch her neck.

'But the teacher thought she was playing with it and swinging it about.

'The whole thing really upset her and I don’t think she is happy in the class any more.

'I think it will be better if she moves to a different class so I have taken her out of school until we can get this issue resolved.

The academy has now agreed that Saniya can wear the item on religious grounds - except in PE and swimming.

Saniya, who lives with her parents in Bakersfield, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I wear it every day.

'My taweez means a lot to me and I think she should have asked my parents before making me take it off.'

Saniya said she was very upset when the teacher took away her taweez

Headteacher Steve Jones said: 'After speaking to Mr Tariq about his daughter, we decided Saniya could keep her necklace on in school, under her polo shirt, apart from the PE and swimming lessons.

'We would always consider exemptions on the basis of religious principles.

'Indeed, in Saniya’s case, we were able to reach a compromise with Mr Tariq.'

Yesterday other parents gathered at the school gates gave mixed opinions on the incident.

One mum, whose son goes to the school, but did not wish to be named, accused the head of caving in and bending the rules.

She said: 'It is ridiculous that they felt threatened enough to change the rules like this.

'If it was a lad with a Christian cross and he was messing with it then I am almost certain the rules wouldn’t have been bent to let him wear it.

'At the end of the day if the girl is messing with the chain and it is distracting her or others from working then that’s why the rules are there.'

Another father said: 'I agree it was wrong as it does mean that much to them as a religion.

'However, they have said she can wear it in class now - so surely that should be the problem resolved.'

Nottingham Academy is the largest school in the UK and can cater for up to 3,600 pupils aged between three and 19-years-old.

The academy is split over three sites in Nottingham and is sponsored by the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust (GDFT) - which is now the sponsor of 21 Academies.
