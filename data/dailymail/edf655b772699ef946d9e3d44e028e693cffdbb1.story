Mr Camuto has long-been recognized as one of the fashion industry's leading lights when it comes to shoes and accessories, having co-founded popular shoe brand Nine West in 1978, before going on to launch his eponymous fashion house the Camuto Group in 2001, which was followed by his globally-successful label Vince Camuto in 2005.

The father-of-five also helped to launch singer Jessica Simpson's multi-million dollar brand in 2005, acting as her mentor throughout much of the last ten years and helping her to achieve phenomenal success with the label. 

Ms Simpson, 34, posted a heartbreaking tribute to her long-time friend and business partner on Instagram last night, shortly after learning about his death. 

Alongside a picture of herself posing with Mr Camuto and his wife Louise, she shared an inspirational quote from the designer, commenting: '"It is never about one person. It’s the teams you put in place. Without the right people, you’re nowhere” - Vince Camuto'

She then added a touching message of her own, saying: 'Thank you, Vince, for the humble power that has taken me everywhere.

Earlier this year, Mr Camuto spoke to WWD.com about his plans for the future of his company, telling the fashion website about his determination to keep growing a business that his wife, his children and his employees would be proud to be a part of.

'My children are my proudest accomplishment,' he said in 2013, shortly after launching his men's lifestyle label. 

'Even at the office, I feel like everyone is family. Family is what is most important to me.' 

Mr Camuto's designs, from his shoes to his clothing, were loved by a number of Hollywood's hottest stars, from Olivia Wilde and Jennifer Lopez, to Julianne Hough and Emily Blunt, and were frequently showcased on the red carpet.

In February 2013, Miss Hough actually collaborated with Mr Camuto on a collection for popular shoe label Sole Society.

At the time, the Dancing With The Stars judge told Racked of her design partner: 'I feel so privileged and lucky to be in this partnership because I'm a huge fan.

'I feel super fortunate that I've been able to step out of my comfort zone with all the colors, and try really fun things that maybe I was a little nervous or hesitant about before.'
