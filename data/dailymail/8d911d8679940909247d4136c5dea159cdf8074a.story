Partygoers are dressing up for Halloween as fighters from the Islamic State in the latest trivialisation of the world's horrors.

Social media has been flooded with pictures of people wearing ISIS-style outfits, just weeks after the jihadists beheaded four Western hostages during their reign of terror across Iraq and Syria.

Some people are pictured holding fake machetes and severed heads in a twisted reference to the group's brutal executions. The group routinely beheads opponents and its members often post horrific photographs of themselves posing with the bodies.

Bad taste: This image of a party-goer dressed in an ISIS-style Halloween costume was one of several posted on the Twitter account of Baghdadi Al-Rolexi with the message: 'Another victory!! So many converted ISIS recruits at Halloween parties. I tell you, best strategy girls and booze!'

 It comes days after businesses were accused of cashing in on the Ebola outbreak by selling 'sexy nurse' costumes as the death toll from the deadly virus nears 5,000.

One set of ISIS-style Halloween images was posted on Twitter with the message: 'Another victory!! So many converted ISIS recruits at Halloween parties. I tell you, best strategy girls and booze!'

Some show revellers wearing face masks and jihasist-style black gowns while brandishing fake automatic weapons.

 In another, four women sport skimpy versions of Islamic State attire while pulling gun poses with their hands.

On Instagram, user Keno486 published a image showing him dressed in a black face mask and holding what appears to be a fake sniper rifle. 

Sinister: One picture posted by Twitter user TJ@Skinny215 shows a group of ISIS-looking militants with the caption: 'Where's the Halloween parties... Isis will be there'

'We both needed an escape from the everyday hardships that have come our way! #ISIS #TERRORIST #MEMBER #ALLFORFUN #HALLOWEENPARTY #LP #GOODTIMES'.

One partygoer appeared to have refashioned a ninja outfit for their jihadist-themed costume. 

Heidi Harris posted the image on Twitter with the message: 'ISIS costume at the party I'm attending #ebola suits were big, too #isis'.

ISIS have beheaded four Western hostages in recent weeks - U.S. freelance journalist James Foley, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning and American journalist Steven Sotloff.

It comes after websites and bars were accused of cashing in on the Ebola outbreak by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers risking their lives to treat people infected with the deadly disease. 

The costume - which is available in a male and female version - has appeared on the brands on sale website.

A description of the suit says: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.'

The costume has gone on sale as flyers were released advertising a 'Saturday Night Ebola Fever' Halloween event in London. The name of the event was later changed. 

In a separate controversy, Bar Risa in Birmingham admitted it had made 'a huge error' by staging an Ebola-themed Halloween party on Wednesday night.

Fancy dress firms have also come under fire for selling Halloween  outfits labelled as 'skitzo' and 'psycho ward', with a British government minister saying the 'horrendous' costumes 'demonise' people with mental health problems.

Jokers' Masquerade's website, www.joke.co.uk, is selling a £12.45 'Adult Skitzo Costume', consisting of an orange jumpsuit with 'a set of black vinyl shackles and belt, plus a restraining face mask to complete the look'.

It also offers a £20.99 'Maximum Restraint Halloween Costume' consisting of a straightjacket and a mask similar to that worn by Anthony Hopkins when he played cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs.

Liberal Democrat Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb will give a speech today urging retailers not to 'demonise' people with mental health problems by selling mocking party outfits.
