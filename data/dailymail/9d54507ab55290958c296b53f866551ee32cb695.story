Luxury car maker Rolls-Royce has unveiled a limousine where travelling celebrities will be in good company as its entire roof lining has been turned into a starry night.

Designers spent nine months perfecting the lining to make sure it is an exact copy of the sky on the night the first Rolls-Royce Phantom came off the line.

Using more than 1,000 fibre optic lights, the replica of the sky has been given the stamp of approval by experts at the South Downs Planetarium in Chichester.

Cosmic car: The Rolls-Royce Celestial Phantom celebrates the ten-year anniversary of the limousine model with a replica of the sky in its roof

The luxury British firm is experiencing the most successful period in its long history - selling more than 3,500 cars a year, something which the firm gives credit to the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

The Rolls-Royce Phantom became the first car to leave the factory in Goodwood, Chichester, under the BMW regime on New Years Day 2003.

To celebrate ten-years of the luxury 
model, staff at Rolls-Royce have replicated the exact sky from the 
historic night the limousine was completed.

The one-off Rolls-Royce Celestial Phantom's exterior colour scheme has been designed to ‘evoke the night sky’ by integrating fine glass particles into the paint to give a sense of depth and light.

And inside is a set of leather seats which are presented in a ‘dusk’ hue, which the firm says ‘alludes to the inky quality of a cloudless night sky’.

Stars for the stars: It took staff at the luxury car firm nine months to perfect the star constellation, which has been hand woven into the roof lining

Ultimate bling: As if the stars in the roof were not enough, the anniversary Phantom's clock has been decorated with diamonds, reflecting the lights of the 'night sky' above

Cause for celebration: The Phantom was the first car to leave Rolls-Royce's West Sussex factory the under the BMW regime

Time for reflection: The replica of the sky has been given the stamp of approval by experts at a local planetarium, bringing passengers back to 2003

Under the bonnet of the Phantom is a 6.75-litre V12 engine which develops a whopping 463bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of 5.8 seconds and a top speed of 150mph.

The Celestial shows off Rolls-Royce’s craftsmanship with the aluminium body made up of 500 parts and 100-metres of weld.

The Celestial makes its global debut at next week’s Frankfurt Motor Show - however, Rolls-Royce is refusing to reveal how much more it would cost over the standard Phantom’s £300,000 price-tag.

A spokesperson for the car maker said: ‘The Celestial Phantom celebrates a landmark moment in Rolls-Royce’s history, the very moment Rolls-Royce’s renaissance under BMW came to fruition with the handover of the first Phantom to its eagerly awaiting customer on January 1, 2003 at midnight.

‘In beautifully recreating the night sky at midnight, we showcase the breadth of skills at the heart of the bespoke team.’
