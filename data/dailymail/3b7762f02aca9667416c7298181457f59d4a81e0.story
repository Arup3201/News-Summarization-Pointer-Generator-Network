A passer-by reported a woman assaulting another female on a remote country road earlier this month.

The victim identified Fernandez who she said rammed the back of her vehicle repeatedly and caused it to careen off Country Road 42.

Fernandez's husband, who was in the car with the unnamed woman, ran from the vehicle before his girlfriend was attacked by his wife.

Fernandez's husband told police that the couple were still married but he had left home and was dating the victim.

After Beatriz Fernandez was found she was taken to hospital for treatment as officers said she appeared drowsy.
