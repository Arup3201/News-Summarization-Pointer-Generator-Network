Well-paid BBC stars should stop criticising the corporation in public and get on with their jobs, one of its top directors said last night.

In a thinly-veiled broadside at some of the BBC’s top talent - including David Dimbleby and actress Jennifer Saunders - the corporation's Director of Television Danny Cohen said staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale.

Speaking at a press launch of the BBC’s Christmas Drama schedule, he said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation in public rather than deal with any issues or concerns internally.

‘The BBC is an imperfect institution and ‘critical friends’ are an important way for us to keep improving. We must never be immune to criticism or unwilling to learn from others.

‘But I know that BBC staff often wonder why some of our on-screen talent and some former members of staff choose to attack or undermine the BBC in public rather than express any concerns they have in private conversations within the BBC. In short, this drives BBC staff mad.’ 

Although Mr Cohen refused to give names, BBC insiders said he was particularly incensed by a recent interview given by Mr Dimbleby, 75, as well as comments by Absolutely Fabulous star Miss Saunders and former head of TV news Roger Mosey.

Last month, Mr Dimbleby - who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years – publicly accused the BBC being ‘too big for its own good’ and criticised its ‘terrible’ coverage of last year’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant.

It followed an outspoken attack by Miss Saunders in a magazine interview, in which she said the BBC’s management was ‘top heavy’, and a devastating critique by Mr Mosey in a leader column for The Times newspaper.

The former executive accused the BBC of being too big and too left wing, and suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of TV channels reduced.

But instead of welcoming their contributions to the debate over BBC management, Mr Cohen accused them of damaging the corporation.

He said: ‘I would also like to call on those who are paid by the BBC but criticise it in media interviews and in public to think hard before they join the daily chorus of BBC-bashing that takes place in some quarters.

‘It is damaging to an institution that I’m convinced they love and would not actually want to harm.

‘From now, I’d like to call on everyone who believes in the BBC to get behind it, to speak up for it, to celebrate its successes and help us explain why the BBC really matters and sits proudly at the heart of public service broadcasting and Britain’s creative industries - rather than find ways to undermine it.’

He added: ‘When problems do arise, let’s deal with them in the most effective way we can and instead use the privileged platform enjoyed by those in public life to highlight the unique attractions of the BBC and help ensure it is as healthy, vibrant, impactful and creative in its 2022 centenary year as it has ever been.’ 

Speaking to the Daily Mail after his public speech, Mr Cohen denied he wanted to clamp down on free speech by preventing whistleblowers from speaking out.

He said: ‘We welcome public debate about the BBC.

‘But those who work for us, and who are well paid for doing so, should come to their managers with their concerns.

‘We should be working to make the BBC better, rather than attacking it.’
