The husband of a woman who went missing 13 years ago has set up a new tip line in hopes of solving her disappearance as he prepares to face his third murder trial in connection to the case.

Michele Harris was last seen on September 11, 2011, leaving her waitressing job in Waverly, New York - a rural Upstate town.

Though her body was never found, husband Cal Harris, of Spencer, New York, was arrested and charged with her murder in 2005.

Looking for mom: Cal Harris and his four teenage children renewed the search for his wife Michele, who went missing 13 years ago as he prepares for his third murder trial in connection to the case

Memories of mom: Michele Harris was last seen leaving her job as a waitress on September 11, 2001. Her children were between two and 7-years-old at the time of her disappearance and are now all in their teens

Where did she go? Cal Harris was arrested for wife Michele's murder even though her body was never found

Harris, 52, has twice been convicted of killing his wife, but had both judgements thrown out on appeal.

This new push for information comes as he prepares to start his third murder trial, set for September.

'I did not have any involvement in Michele's disappearance,' Harris said at the Wednesday press conference. 'I would never hurt the mother of my children and I would never do anything to hurt them.'

Harris recently hired a new legal defense team as well as investigators with cold case experience to find answers to Michele's mysterious disappearance.

Cal's four children, who were between two and 7-years-old when their mom disappeared, are the reason for this renewed search.

'Up until now I have tried to shield my children from the public's eye and the fire storm of media coverage that has surrounded this case,' Harris said, 'however they have reached the age where they understand what's going on and want answers for themselves.'

The Harris' eldest daughter Cayla, 18, spoke at the press conference herself.

'We need to know what really happened to our mother," Cayla Harris said. 'We know our dad had nothing to do with her disappearance, we also know there are people out there with information that can help us get answers.

'We want to keep our family together and not lose our father again. We plead to those of you who can help us, to please come forward with information,' the teen added.

All grown up: Cal Harris says he tried to shield his children from the media attention surrounding their mother's disappearance but they're now old enough to demand answers themselves

The tip-line number is 607-215-5166 and since it was given to the media, investigators say they've received seven phone calls.

Harris' attorney Bruce Barket says they've already started focusing on a small group of potential suspects that are 'interesting to us'.

'We've developed some information about them and that information continues to grow. We've waited til now to do this tip line, because we're kind of at a critical point where we think the influx of new information will hopefully put us over the top,' Mr Barket said.
