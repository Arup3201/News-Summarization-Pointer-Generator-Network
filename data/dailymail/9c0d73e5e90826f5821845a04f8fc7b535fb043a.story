A ‘tipsy’ Michael Gove has launched an extraordinary wine-fuelled attack on Boris Johnson, saying he ‘has no gravitas and is unfit to lead the nation’.

The Education Secretary also claimed the London Mayor’s appeal would ‘wear thin’, Home Secretary Theresa May had ‘no appeal’, and George Osborne is the only man capable of succeeding David Cameron.

Mr Gove’s remarks, made during a private dinner at Rupert Murdoch’s home in Mayfair, Central  London, come amid a bitter Tory leadership row that threatens to disrupt party unity in the run-up  to May’s European polls and next year’s General Election.

Tipsy: Mr Gove, pictured with Boris Johnson after a dinner at the exclusive Mayfair restaurant Scotts last year, reportedly said the London mayor did not have enough gravitas to lead the Conservatives

He made his comments as he and fellow guests enjoyed several £100 bottles of red wine from Mr Murdoch’s Californian vineyard.

Friends of Mr Gove confirmed he was ‘tipsy.’ The Education Secretary’s outburst shocked fellow guests – who repeated his comments to Mr Johnson when he dined with Mr Murdoch the following evening.

The revelation threatens to intensify the bitter rift involving the four main contenders to succeed Mr Cameron: Mr Johnson, Mr Osborne, Mrs May and Mr Gove.

Culprit: Several £100 bottles of Moraga Cabernet Sauvignon were circulating

Mr Gove told the dinner guests:  ‘There are only two people fit to be Prime Minister: George Osborne and William Hague. William has made it clear that he doesn’t want it so that leaves only one candidate – George. Boris is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas. He isn’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time.

‘The whole Boris routine will wear thin with the electorate very quickly if he became PM. And he can’t make tough decisions.

‘George is a team player who is serious and substantial. Look at all the tough stuff he has done already in Downing Street. Theresa May has little chance of gaining the support of the electorate – she can’t even gain the support of her colleagues.’

One witness said: ‘It was an extraordinary and sustained onslaught by Gove. He fired an Exocet at Boris and had a go at Theresa May for good measure.

‘Like the rest of us, Michael enjoyed Mr Murdoch’s wine and tongues became looser as the evening progressed. Everyone was gobsmacked at what he said.’ The dinner took place on December 5 – the day Nelson Mandela died. Other guests, who included senior editors at Mr Murdoch’s News UK newspapers, including The Sun, left early to change their late editions.

Mr Johnson had already been invited to dine the following evening, along with several of Mr Murdoch’s executives, many of whom had been there the previous day.

By the time the London Mayor arrived, he had already got wind of Mr Gove’s attack. Guests immediately challenged him to rebut the Education Secretary’s criticisms.

‘We told him Gove had said he wasn’t up to the job and a lightweight compared to Osborne,’ one said. ‘Boris relished it and gave a robust reply. He gave a long list of his tough decisions in London – and his record as an election winner.’ Tory MPs have been taken aback by the outbreak of hostilities between Mr Gove and Mr Osborne on one side, and Mr Johnson on the other.

Contenders? Gove is said to favour George Osborne but Theresa May could also be in the running

The Mail on Sunday revealed on February 2 how the Chancellor and Mr Gove have joined forces in an attempt to deny the Tory leadership crown to Mr Johnson.

And on March 2, we revealed how a furious Mr Johnson called Mr Osborne a ‘liar’ for claiming he had urged him to return to the Commons as an MP in next year’s Election to ‘prove his loyalty’ to Mr Cameron.

An ally of the London Mayor said: ‘Boris was puzzled and hurt by Michael’s unwarranted attack. He had thought of him as an ally. It seems he has thrown his lot in with Osborne instead. He will regret it. Osborne has zero support among the public; Boris has enormous appeal.’

Mr Gove sparked further controversy yesterday by claiming  there is a ‘ridiculous’ number of Old Etonians among the Prime Minister’s inner circle. The comment was seen as another sideswipe at Old Etonian Mr Johnson, rather than Mr Cameron, a close friend of Mr Gove.

The adopted son of an Aberdeen fishmonger, Mr Gove issued a fresh denial yesterday that he has leadership ambitions, saying he lacked the ‘extra spark of charisma and star quality’.

Influence: The high-profile figures were dining at the private Mayfair home of Rupert Murdoch

But some Tory MPs believe his increasingly high-profile political activities and pronouncements, in private and public, indicate he is preparing his own leadership campaign.

One female Conservative MP said: ‘Michael is the perfect Tory role model. He won a scholarship to a fee-paying school on merit, not thanks to Mummy and Daddy’s cheque book. He’s a proper Tory who loathes Brussels and favours low taxes. He may be an ugly duckling but so is Boris, and he is every bit as witty. People could grow to like him.’

An ally of Mr Johnson said: ‘Gove and Osborne keep laying traps for Boris to fall into but he is too smart for them. He will return to the Commons at a time of his choosing – not theirs.’

The wine that loosened Mr Gove’s tongue was from Mr Murdoch’s 16-acre Moraga Canyon estate in Bel-Air.  The 2007 and 2008 Moraga Vineyard Bel-Air Cabernet Sauvignons sell for up to £100 a bottle.

A friend of Mr Gove said: ‘Michael had several glasses of wine at the Murdoch dinner and was tipsy. Whatever else he said, the truth is he likes Boris.’
