A Tennessee cotton factory is being investigated after a supervisor was allegedly recorded threatening to 'hang' a black employee if he drank water from the 'whites-only' fountain.

In something that could be straight out of the Jim Crow era, the unidentified supervisor at Atkinson Cotton Warehouse in Memphis is also heard comparing black employees to monkeys and pining for the days of racial segregation, claiming 'now everybody is made to think it's bad.'

After enduring months of racist taunts, forklift operator Antonia Harris resorted to secretly recording the bullying using his cell phone.

Now he and fellow victim Marrio Mengrum have filed a racial discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying the shocking treatment has had a lasting effect on them.

Claims: Forklift operator Antonio Harris made a secret recording of a man, allegedly his warehouse supervisor, telling him he would be 'hanged' for using a 'white people only' drinking fountain in Memphis, Tennessee

The recording on his phone was sent to news channel WREG and features a man, allegedly his factory supervisor, firing racist abuse at Mr Harris as he tries to drink from a water fountain. 

'Hey', says the man. 'I need to put a sign there that says "white people only"'.

After an argument, the man laughs as Mr Harris says: 'Put your sign on the wall then, because I'm feeling to drink it. What they do when they catch me drinking your water?'

'That's when we hang you,' the man replies.

Mr Harris is also heard saying he wants to use the microwave.

'Hell no!' the man replies. When asked why not, he says: 'Because you are not white.'

Incredulous, Mr Harris says: 'For real?'. The reply comes: 'As a white man, we don't even let Larry [a black employee of more than 10 years] use it.'

The recording also features the man saying 'nobody thought anything' of segregation in the past and 'now everybody is made... to think it's bad.'

Mr Harris and Mr Mangrum told the news channel they had been left hurt by the way they were treated.

Mr Harris added: 'I think about this every day of my life'.

The pair have filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

They also say black workers were called 'monkeys' and the supervisor told them to 'kiss his white tail', though this was not recorded on tape.

'We all know what monkey means,' Mr Mangrum told ABC News. 'That’s very offensive.'

'I had to bite my tongue a lot,' Mr Harris added.

The cotton industry was once synonymous with slavery in the Deep South.

After the 1793 invention of the mechanical cotton gin, a machine for separating fibers from seeds, slave-produced cotton spread throughout South Carolina and Georgia.

The link is so prevalent that the phrase 'cotton-picking' is widely regarded as a racial slur.

However, Mr Harris said he had worked in the cotton industry for 12 years and he had never encountered problems until now.

Lawyers watching the case said the warehouse will need to settle.

'I’m sure there will be other witnesses who can also confirm these things were said,' employment and labor law attorney Matthew Billips told ABC.

The company that runs the warehouse, Federal Compress, released a statement to ABC News saying it had 'zero tolerance' for discrimination and that the supervisor was no longer employed with the company.

The cotton warehouse could not be reached for comment by MailOnline, and provided no comment to WREG.

The EEOC said it was prohibited from giving any details on individual cases.
