A curry-mad couple longed for their favourite Indian takeaway so much that they had it delivered almost 500 miles to their new home.

Whitney and Adam Gardner, from Crawley, Sussex, moved to Brittany eight months ago but complained that they couldn't find a decent takeaway in France.

So they convinced their mothers to pick up orders of chicken dansak, pilau rice and Peshwari naan from Tarana Restaurant in Turners Hill before making the six-hour journey through the Channel Tunnel.

And the Indian restaurant's food is so popular that they have customers requesting for it to be flown over to Greece and even as far as Dubai.  

The couple relocated to Brittany to start their own fishery business and claim it is impossible to get a decent takeaway in France.

Whitney, 27, said: 'It's a beautiful way of life over here, very relaxed and calm, but you just can't get the same food.

'There are kebab places but it's not the same thing. I don't think they [the French] have the taste for it.

'We used to live in Pound Hill in Crawley and had our UK leaving party, and joint hen and stag dos in Tarana restaurant. We absolutely love the food.'

The couple's strange demands are nothing new for Shah Jahan, who has been the manager of the restaurant in Turners Hill since it opened nearly six years ago.

He has a customer who took a curry to their sister in Poitier, France, and even one who sent someone to pick up an order to take to Greece by private jet.

A businessman in Dubai has offered Shah plane tickets to take their in-demand food abroad.

Mr Jahan said: 'The guy in Dubai keeps asking for our recipes and asking if I'll take some food to him by plane.

'I'm originally from Bangladesh and my flights home always stopover in Dubai, so I told him the next time I go out there I'll bring him something.

'But I'm not going there just to deliver a takeaway. We don't even deliver to our Turners Hill residents, so it would be really unfair to deliver to someone in Dubai and not them.' 

On a recent trip, Mr Gardner's mother Lorraine popped in to grab the takeaway order before making the journey to visit the couple.

The busy duo haven't had time to tuck into the meal yet and are saving it for a quiet evening when they can heat it up and enjoy it together. 

'We keep joking with Jahan that he should come over and open an Indian takeaway in France,' Mrs Gardner said. 

'Sometimes he sends it over fresh or frozen, depending on what we want.

'He'd bend over backwards for anyone.'
