Gareth Southgate has given a clear indication that Harry Kane’s scintillating form will be rewarded with a senior call up for England’s internationals in March.

The Tottenham striker has enjoyed an outstanding season, scoring 20 goals, securing a new five-and-a-half-year contract and the final gloss would be for Roy Hodgson to name him in his party for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy next month.

Southgate, England’s Under-21 head coach, will have no qualms if Hodgson does take Kane from his group rather than leave Kane to be selected for the Under-21s key friendlies against the Czech Republic and Germany.

The Under 21 coach says that Kane could still join up with his side in the summer

Kane has been an integral part of the Under-21 team in the last 12 months and is expected to be a key figure at the forthcoming European Championships and Southgate believes it is possible for him to go up to the seniors before dropping back down in June.

‘There is no reason he wouldn’t come with us in the summer,’ said Southgate. ‘It is easy for him to do both. He falls into that category that he has been with us right the way through. I think he would want to come and be on that stage really.

‘It is still a terrific stage when you look at some of the players in the last couple of tournaments; all of the Spanish group, including Thiago Alcantara and Isco. Marco Veratti (Italy), some of the French boys at the Under-20 World Cup, (Paul) Pogba.

‘Clearly someone like Harry, going as well as he is, might get the nod (in March). That’s Roy’s call. It depends how others are doing and if he is still delivering when we get nearer that time, which is still a few weeks.

‘But it has been brilliant how he has kept his form for quite a sustained period so let’s hope he can continue that. He’s in a great place at the moment, as is Danny Ings. Danny is going to improve and improve. He has the right mentality and is at a club where the ethic is good, to work and learn.’

Kane has been in sparkling form for Tottenham this season and has scored 20 goals in all competitions

Roy Hodgson has admitted he is impressed by Kane's form and is considering calling the striker up

Kane won his first Under-21 cap when Hodgson took temporary charge for the friendly against Scotland in August 2013 and has gone on to make nine more appearances, scoring eight times. But this season he has looked a different player and Southgate puts that down to his club manager’s influence.

‘I know the way Mauricio Pochettino works and I am sure the sessions they are doing on and off the training ground will have helped that,’ said Southgate. 

‘We saw with Mauricio last year at Southampton he is not afraid to give people a chance if they are doing well. He has given Harry an opportunity and he is keeping some outstanding players out of the team.’
