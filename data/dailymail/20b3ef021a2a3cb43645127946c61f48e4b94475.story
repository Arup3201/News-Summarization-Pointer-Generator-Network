Tony Abbott never explained what he meant when he threatened to 'shirtfront' Vladimir Putin but that hasn't stopped it from being named 2014's Word Of The Year.

The Australian National Dictionary Centre chose the term following Prime Minister Tony Abbott's somewhat undiplomatic threat to the Russian president over the Australian victims of MH17 ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane.

'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' Mr Abbott infamously said in October.

'I am going to be saying to Mr Putin Australians were murdered.'

Shirtfront has been named the 2014 Word Of The Year after Tony Abbott's threat to Vladimir Putin

Australian National Dictionary Centre president Amanda Laugesen said the word was selected after it became prominent following Mr Abbott's statement – largely because there was confusion over what he meant

The comment made global headlines and was described as 'unfortunate' by the Kremlin.

Australian National Dictionary Centre president Amanda Laugesen said the word was selected after it became prominent following Mr Abbott's threat – largely because there was confusion over what he actually meant.

Shirt-front is mostly used in AFL to describe an aggressive front-on bump to an opponent and in rugby it refers to grabbing an opponent's jersey.

But Dr Laugesen said it has a lesser-known figurative meaning - to challenge or confront a person – which dates back to the 1980s.

'We don't know for sure what Abbott meant when he said it because he never really returned to it,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'But he certainly could have been aware of that more figurative use.'

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reports the term has now entered the diplomatic lexicon of many countries.

British Prime Minister David Cameron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both used the word in jest when addressing federal parliament.

Also on the centre's short list were man-bun (as worn by Chris Hemsworth, left), Ned Kelly beard (right)

Shirt-front was triumphant over another prime ministerial catchphrase - 'Team Australia'.

Also on the centre's short list were man-bun, Ned Kelly beard and coward punch.

'Man-bun and Ned Kelly beard are both associated with hipsters,' Dr Laugesen said.

'We often pick up on popular culture type words, so those are the two we saw really take off this year both in people adopting them and their use mainstream media.'
