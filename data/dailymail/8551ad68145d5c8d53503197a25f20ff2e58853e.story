Ed Miliband today insisted he had enough 'life experience' outside politics to lead the country - because he had been an adviser to Gordon Brown.

The Labour leader said roles in the Treasury and lecturing at Harvard University in the United States before he became an MP qualified him to be prime minister.

Mr Miliband highlighted his previous jobs as he took questions at from young voters today after being asked how he represented ordinary people. 

Ed Miliband worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown before becoming the MP for Doncaster in 2005

He was asked: 'Outside of politics, what life experience do you have ... to indicate you should be the one to represent the people of Britain?'

Mr Milband, speaking at an Ask The Leaders session organised by Sky News and Facebook, replied: 'I've done a number of things which I think are relevant to this.

'I was obviously an economic adviser in the Treasury. I think that's important because the economy and how we change our economy is at the heart of the country.'

He added: 'I taught at Harvard University. I actually taught around government and economics and I think that, actually, one of the things that that did for me (was learning) to listen and engage with people about what their issues are, what they're interested in.'

Mr Miliband went to Oxford University before working briefly as a researcher in the media, and then becoming a Labour Party researcher.

He was an adviser to Gordon Brown in the Treasury between 1997 and 2002, at which point he took an 18-month sabbatical to teach economics at Harvard.

Ed Miliband became a Labour Party and Government adviser after leaving Oxford. He later spent 18 months teaching at Harvard University

Mr Miliband returned to the Treasury until 2005, when he successfully stood for parliament in Doncaster North.

David Cameron also graduated from Oxford, before working as a Conservative Party researcher and adviser to the former chancellor Norman Lamont and former home secretary Michael Howard.

He then worked in PR for the television company Carlton before becoming an MP in 2001.
