A man previously

Officer Marissa Mayer has been arrested by Texas police on
suspicion of sending her sexually graphic emails, according to
police records released on Friday.

Gregory Calvin King, 30, was booked on Thursday into the
Travis County Jail in Austin, with bond set at $100,000.

He was charged with stalking, a second-degree felony that
can carry a punishment of two to 20 years in jail.

However it is not the first time King has been caught harassing Mayer.

He was sentenced in a California court in 2012 to three
years probation for stalking the executive.

Then his probation was revoked
after he was found to have violated its provisions.

In 2014
King was ordered to be sent to a federal prison, according to
court records.

After his release in February, King sent more than 60
messages to Mayer from several locations in the Texas capital,
including 'unwanted and sexually graphic emails,' a police
arrest affidavit said.

King had also been under surveillance by security personnel
for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo since he entered Austin,
it said.

Mayer has been at the head of Yahoo! since July 2012.

She spent 13 years working for Google before the appointment.
