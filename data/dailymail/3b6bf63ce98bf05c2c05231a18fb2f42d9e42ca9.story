Usain Bolt has swapped his Lycra for a Lederhosen once more as he returned to this year's Oktoberfest for a second time.

The Jamaican sprint king posted a picture via his Instagram account gearing up for his latest instalment of the annual beer festival with three friends.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Oktoberfest here we come @johnsteffensen @rickysimms #NJ #Lederhosen #Munich,' the 28-year-old can be seen sporting the traditional German attire with a green-chequered shirt.

It is the second time the double Olympic 100m, 200m and 4x100m champion has attended the famous event this year after he a tweeted a picture basking in the culture of the world famous event last month.

Returning to Germany will always bring back happy memories to the Jamaican who shattered both the 100m and 200m world records during the 2009 World Championships held in Berlin with times of 9.58 and 19.19 seconds.

Bolt added to his international medal haul in August when he was part of Jamaica's successful gold medal 4x100m relay team at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.  

Oktoberfest runs from late September to the first weekend in October and attracts more than six million people from around the world every year.
