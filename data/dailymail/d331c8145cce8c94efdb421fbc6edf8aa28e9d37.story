When it comes to getting ahead at work, it seems many women lack the confidence to ask for a pay rise or a promotion.

Despite an increasing success in the corporate world, a survey has found the glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management. 

The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) of women aren't climbing the career ladder because they aren't confident to ask their bosses for more.

Over a third of women said their lack of confidence stopped them from asking for a promotion or pay rise

According to the study, which was carried out by O2, this lack of self-esteem is stopping women workers from asking for the promotion or pay rise they feel they deserve.   

Further highlighting this crisis in confidence, luck was by far the biggest reason attributed to success. 

Qualities such as skill, hard work, talent and ambition hardly featured in the responses of the 2,000 women polled.

Management consultant, Emily, 27, who used to work in Westminster, knows how it feels to struggle with confidence. 

'I only realised my confidence was holding me back when a more junior male colleague asked for a double promotion, which would have put him above me, whereas I hadn’t even thought about going for the job myself. He didn't get it, but it was a wake up call.'

Despite women's increased success in the corporate world, the dreaded glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management

Emily puts her lack of self-esteem in the workplace down to the male-dominated environment she worked in:

'Often, I would be the only woman in meetings and male colleagues would be making laddish jokes and I would be ignored and spoken over.

'I thought it meant I didn’t have a valid or valuable contribution. It drained my confidence.' 

In response to the findings, O2 is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses

Despite women often displaying  self-doubt at work, they still dream big. Nearly a third of women said they aspired to be the CEO (28 per cent) or on the board of a company (35 per cent).

However, when asked about their own career, a third (32 per cent) revealed that it had failed to meet their expectations. 

Poor quality line management (33 per cent), a lack of effective training and development programmes (22 per cent), and negative office politics (28 per cent) were the main reasons women felt hindered their progression.

Half (48 per cent) of women polled also believed all the decision-makers in their company are male. 

In response to the findings, O2, in association with the CIPD, The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses on how to support female leaders of the future.

Along with insights from 2000 working women, the guide incorporates insights from O2, the CIPD, and a coalition of contributors made up of senior businesswomen from a range of roles and industries including IT, law and engineering. 

The guide provides advice to businesses of all sizes looking to implement their own programmes to help women reach leadership roles.

Christine O'Brien, partner at Baker & McKenzie LLP who contributed to the guide, said: 'We're dealing with a proportion of the population with a genuine disability – an acute lack of confidence. 

'This is the single biggest obstacle that women face.'  

Ann Pickering, O2's HR director and board member, added: 

'Our research shows that, while the diversity debate has moved on outside of the office, not enough women are actually seeing this progress at work. 

'If we're to achieve sustainable and long-lasting change, we can't just look at women already at the top - we need to focus our efforts on women at every level, creating a strong pipeline of female talent across British businesses.'
