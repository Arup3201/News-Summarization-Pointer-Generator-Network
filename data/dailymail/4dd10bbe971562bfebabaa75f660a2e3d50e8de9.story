Tens of thousands of Greek workers began a 48-hour general strike in the latest protests against austerity cuts.

The strike was called by Greece’s two biggest labour organisations.

It is the third in two months against £10billion spending cuts and reforms that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras wants parliament to approve today to unlock international aid in a crucial vote.

Crucial: It is the third strike in two months against £10billion of proposed spending cuts and reforms. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras (pictured) wants parliament to approve them today to unlock international aid in a crucial vote.

Thousands of Greek workers took to the streets as part of the 48-hour strike in Athens earlier today

Angry: Passions are high in the Greek capital as protestors march against austerity measures ahead of a crucial Parliamentary vote for emergency cuts and tax increases

On the march: Protestors clutched banners and placards as thousands gathered together to voice their opinion in the Athens sun today

Shouting: One 65-year-old protestor said that the government should go to 'hell and beyond' rather than approve more spending cuts

If accepted the cuts will prove massively unpopular; if rejected, Greece could go bust within weeks.

Transport was severely disrupted across the country and schools, banks and local government offices were shut. Hospitals were working on emergency staffing.

Trains, buses and the subway came to a halt.

Many flights have been cancelled, ships remained tied up at ports and taxi drivers also stayed off the streets.

Police beefed up security for midday rallies in Athens that often end in small-scale rioting and clashes with hooded protesters.

About a dozen police vans were on standby around the main square outside parliament.

The government has implored Greeks to endure the cuts to avoid national bankruptcy but a quarter of the nation is jobless, poverty and suicide levels are soaring and many feel angry with the political class.

'They should go to hell and beyond,' said Anais Metaxopoulou, a 65-year-old pensioner.

'They should ask me how I feel when I have to go to church to beg for food.

'I wouldn’t hurt a fly but I would happily behead one of them.'

Athens needs parliamentary approval for the package - which includes slashing pensions by as much as a quarter and scrapping holiday bonuses - to ensure its European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders release more £25billion of aid, much of it aimed at shoring up banks.

The strike coincides with the vote in parliament on Wednesday when the government is expected to just about win backing for austerity cuts and labour reforms that the smallest party in Samaras’s coalition has refused to back.
