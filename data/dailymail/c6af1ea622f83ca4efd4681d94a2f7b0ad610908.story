Dave King launched his move to oust the entire Rangers board by formally submitting a demand for a General Meeting on Friday night.

As hundreds of fans gathered outside Ibrox in protest at plans to mortgage off Ibrox and Murray in return for a £10million loan from Mike Ashley, the South African-based businessman insisted he is confident of gaining the 51 per cent backing required to remove chairman David Somers, chief executive Derek Llambias, finance director Barry Leach and non-executive director James Easdale.

King, the largest single shareholder at the club, proposes that he is elected onto the board in their places alongside fellow former club director Paul Murray and John Gilligan, a one-time managing director of Tennent Caledonian Brewers.

Llambias and Leach would, initially, retain their executive roles — but be off the board — before new appointments were made.

The notice seeking the General Meeting was hand delivered to Ibrox on Friday night, the day after it emerged that advance notices of security over the stadium and Murray Park had been lodged at the Reigstry of Scotland on behalf of Ashley’s Sports Direct firm.

The move has been viewed as a precursor to the board accepting Ashley’s loan ahead of a rival funding offer from a Douglas Park-led group. George Letham, one of Park’s associates, visited Ibrox on Friday for talks after the consortium pledged to up their initial £5m proposal in a bid to block Ashley.

Park, Letham and George Taylor have around 19 per cent between them, while King has 15 per cent. Approximately 11 per cent is owned by fans with the likes of Walter Smith, Ally McCoist and recent investor Felix Magath holding another three per cent, which would give a total of around 48 per cent.

King firmly believes he will gain sufficient further backing to cross the line and seize control at a meeting which will take place within the next six weeks.

‘The requisition consists of four resolutions for the removal of the incumbent board and three resolutions for the appointment to the board of myself, Paul Murray and John Gilligan,’ said King.

‘The resolutions do not seek to review the employment of the two executive directors presently on the board. They will merely be removed as directors.

‘I would not have called for a General Meeting if I was not confident, from my review of the present shareholder register, that it will be supported by more than 50 per cent of the total registered shareholders.

‘While many of the shareholders hold differing views as to what is right for the club, I believe that a clear majority are like-minded on one key point — the need to remove the incumbent board and to replace it with individuals who can gain the trust of fans, sponsors and the shareholder community.’

King’s own planned position on the board could be subject to scrutiny by the SFA given his previous issues with the tax authorities in South Africa, although he has previously insisted he sees no issue in meeting ‘fit and proper person’ requirements.

The Castlemilk-born tycoon — who lost a £20m Rangers investment made during Sir David Murray’s tenure — would seek to expand the board if successful at the General Meeting, which could lead to representation from within the Park consortium.

King wants an in-depth study of the commercial contracts and pledged to pursue any instances where it is deemed they are not in the club’s best interests. He would also seek a new nominated advisor (NOMAD) in the City of London to replace WH Ireland as part of an overhaul.

‘It is also desirable to partner a NOMAD that is willing to move forward and away from the recent poor governance at the club,’ added King.

‘I have already had initial discussions with potential NOMADs on the basis of two key conditions. Firstly, that the resolutions at the AGM are passed. Secondly, that the board is expanded as soon as possible thereafter to incorporate experienced independent non-executive directors such that the highest level of corporate governance is achieved and maintained.

‘That is exactly what all stakeholders should want to happen after experiencing so many years of different boards that have lurched from one crisis to another. In advance of the General Meeting I will further engage with NOMADs willing to embrace the standards that we will set for the future and ensure that an appropriate arrangement is in place to be adopted immediately on conclusion of a successful vote at the General Meeting.

‘The most pressing task for the incoming board will be to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the club. A secondary important task will be to conduct a forensic audit of the management and commercial contracts undertaken over the last few years to determine whether they are truly arms length and whether the affairs of the company have been pursued in accordance with the fiduciary obligations of those entrusted with that responsibility. Any malfeasance will be pursued aggressively and transparently.
