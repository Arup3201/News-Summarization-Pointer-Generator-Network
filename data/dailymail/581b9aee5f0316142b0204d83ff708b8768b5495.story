Police are searching a landfill site for a £2.2million painting that had just sold at auction in Hong Kong when cleaners accidentally threw it away.

The 2012 painting Snowy Mountain, by Chinese artist Cui Ruzhuo, was reported missing by auctioneers Poly Auction on Tuesday afternoon after the auction on Monday. 

Ming Pao newspaper reported that police had checked CCTV footage at the Grand Hyatt hotel, where the auction took place, which showed cleaners removing the painting.

That raised fears that the painting had been sent out with the garbage to the city's landfill.

Police told AFP a theft case was reported on Tuesday by an auction house staff member regarding a painting, without giving further details.

A Grant Hyatt spokeswoman would not confirm if the painting had been dumped as trash but said hotel staff did not handle items sold at the auction because they were too expensive.

She said in an emailed statement to AFP that organisers would hire their own security and contractors for such events involving 'high-value' items.

Poly Culture did not comment immediately when contacted by AFP.

The spring sale was the first major auction organised by Poly Culture in Hong Kong following its stock debut in March.

Poly Culture Group, the world's third largest auction house by revenue behind Sotheby's and Christie's, is a subsidiary of state-run conglomerate Poly Group.

On Tuesday, a rare Ming Dynasty 'chicken cup' broke world auction records for Chinese porcelain after it sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.3 million/£21.6 million) at a Sotheby's sale in Hong Kong, exceeding the $32.4 million paid for a Qing double-gourd vase in 2010.
