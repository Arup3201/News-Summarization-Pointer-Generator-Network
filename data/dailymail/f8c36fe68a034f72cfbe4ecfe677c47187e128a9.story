Lewis Hamilton is living his American dream, with rap star friends, the celebrity Los Angeles girlfriend and a giant bling necklace.

And the championship leader, who is mobbed in Austin, has even spoken about the possibility of raising a family on this side of the Atlantic.

'I enjoy it here, it's pretty cool,' he said. 'New York is a cool place to live. I was in Knoxville [Tennessee] the other day. It's beautiful, by the lake. But there is too much fast food. I'm always thinking about where I would raise a family and I haven't figured out where that would be.

'It feels a little bit early but at some stage I want to have a family and continue the family name.'

Hamilton, 29, trains in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and regularly travels from his home in Monaco to LA to see Nicole Scherzinger, his pop star girlfriend.

A friend of rappers, he is keen on the music industry - an interest he could now actively look to develop into a business opportunity having just parted company with Simon Fuller's XIX management stable.

Hamilton will wait until the end of the season before deciding who will look after his affairs, but non-racing concerns are sure to be a factor in that process.

He is sporting a bold new look with his giant gold necklace with a picture frame containing a Warhol painting of Mercedes cars. 

'I designed it myself,' said Hamilton, who stopped off in New York en route to Austin to appear on ABC's Today show. 

His latest bling follows his trademark diamond earrings, a host of tattoos and a giant flat-peak cap — a look that makes him stand out amid the more corporate and conservative world of modern Formula One.
