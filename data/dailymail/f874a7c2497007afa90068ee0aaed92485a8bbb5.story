Organisers in Britain sought to beat the record of seven million people who took part last year.

A
 live event was streamed by WWF-UK from the Southbank in London 
featuring an acoustic performance from pop band McFly, who did the 
Harlem Shake in panda onesies to launch the campaign.

Recordings of Rudyard Kipling's Just So stories were made by Kevin McCloud, 
Miranda Richardson and Alistair McGowan and celebrity chefs Gordon Ramsay, Raymond Blanc and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall created special recipes for families to prepare and eat by candlelight.

The aim is to highlight the 
charity's call on governments, organisations and individuals to pledge 
their commitment to tackling climate change.

Earth Hour 
started in 2007 in Sydney, Australia, when 2.2 million individuals and 
more than 2,000 businesses turned their lights off for one hour to take a
 stand against climate change.

strongly enough, you can achieve amazing things. These stories aren't 
unique, this is happening all over the world.'
