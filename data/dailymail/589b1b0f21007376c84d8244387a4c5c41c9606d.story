Martim Onofrio, 24, used to study in London and died in Sunday's nightclub blaze in Santa Maria

A former London student was one of the 231 people killed in a Brazil nightclub fire during the early hours of Sunday morning.

Martim Francisco Mascarenhas de Souza Onofrio, 24, died at Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria after a band's onstage pyrotechnics set alight to the roof's highly-flammable foam insulation.

Administration graduate Mr Onofrio 
recently returned home to live in Santa Maria after living with a host family in Wood Green, north London, while he studied
at the Avalon School of English near Covent Garden.

It comes as 30,000 Santa Maria mourners, dressed in white and carrying flowers, 
balloons and placards bearing the names of the dead, held a 
commemorative march back to where the tragedy happened.

Bridget Golden, 70, his Wood Green landlady, told the Evening Standard: 'We are very sad. He was an exceptional young man.'

Former classmate Kizy Sorato Tavares, 22, said: 'He was my classmate on an English course in London. He was an incredible person - the type you like to be close to because he makes you laugh and he had such a good heart.'

Mr Onofrio is survived by his parents, older brother and younger sister.

Mourners gathered in the Santa Maria's Saldanha Marinho square yesterday afternoon before starting an evening vigil in memory of the victims of a fire that ripped through Kiss nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Outside the club, which still gives off a strong smell of burning, people gathered, shouted 'Justice Justice Justice' and demanded accountability for a tragedy that has touched the entire community.

It signalled the start of a wave of police probes, lawsuits and recriminations that could drag on for months and followed a day of burials that started at 7.30am and went on late into the night.

Two of the club's owners have been arrested, along with two members of the band that was playing at the time of the blaze and are believed to have caused the fire by using an onstage pyrotechnics machine.

It is understood that sparks from the show set alight to highly-flammable insulation foam in the club's roof which triggered the fire.
