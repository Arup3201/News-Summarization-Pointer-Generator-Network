Hundreds of mourners - some from as far afield as Australia - paid their respects to a Second World War veteran today, answering a plea after he died with no family.

George Thompson was a pilot in the Second World War, and flew night missions over the Burmese jungle in the fight against Japanese forces.

He died aged 96 earlier this months with no living relatives and few friends remaining. But a plea from the RAF for people to attend the ceremony at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium in Sheffield received an overhwleming response.

Packed: Around 300 mourners turned up to pay their respects to George Thompson, who died aged 96 earlier this month

Full: So many attended that the chapel at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium in Sheffield could not contain them all

Response: The mourners had seen a plea online from the RAF for attendees

Before the service Wally Walsh, 72, of Australia, said: 'We had come over from Australia on holiday and were staying in Berkshire.

'We saw the appeal for people to come in the news and my wife and I decided we would make the trip to pay our respects. It’s a fabulous to see so many people gathered today.'

As the coffin was brought up to the church, servicemen, led by the sound of bagpipes, saluted the Mr Thompson.

The coffin was then brought inside and at least 300 people - including servicemen, war veterans and members of the emergency services - packed into the tiny chapel.

Procession: Military men and women, as well as members of the emergency services were among the hundreds of mourners

Salute: Mr Thompson's coffin was draped in a Union flag as well as a flag showing the RAF's roundel

So many arrived that the chapel could not accommodate everybody and some waited outside.

Civil Funeral Celebrant David Hayes led the service and began by thanking people for the 'phenomenal' attendance and read memories of George’s long life.

Mr Hayes then read the poem High Flight, by John Magee, and spoke of the love Mr Thompson had for Millie, his wife of 56 years who died in 2004.

One of Mr Thompson's friends Joan Hunter said: 'I am pleased you are all here, I would like to thank all of you individually - I am overwhelmed'.

'Overwhelming': One of Mr Thompson's remaining friends praised the unexpected mourners

'Incredible': The director of the funeral spoke of his surprise at the huge numbers who came. Pictured is a serviceman

As the mourners left the chapel We’ll Meet Again, by wartime singer Vera Lynn, was played.

After the funeral Mr Hayes said: 'It was an incredible achievement that so many people came to pay tribute to an amazing man.

'It was an honour to be a part of it and I am so pleased we gave George the send-off he clearly deserved'.

The huge funeral attendance - prompted by Mr Thompson's story being extensively shared online - echoes similar events earlier this year.

In April John Campbell, a former major who died aged 92, had around 500 mourners attend his funeral. Harold Jellicoe Percival, who lived to 99, received a similar send-off at his funeral held on Armistice Day last year.
