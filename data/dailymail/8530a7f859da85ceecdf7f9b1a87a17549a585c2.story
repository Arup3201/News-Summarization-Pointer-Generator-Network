A 65-year-old man has been arrested as part of the Jimmy Savile investigation

A 65-year-old man has been arrested by detectives investigating allegations that emerged after the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal.

The man was held in Somerset this morning on suspicion of sexual offences, Scotland Yard said.

Allegations against him are not linked to Savile, the force confirmed.

The man is the twelfth person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted by allegations against the disgraced television presenter.

Yesterday, another of the men arrested under Yewtree was charged with five offences.

Driver David Smith is accused of two counts of indecent assault, two of gross indecency and one of buggery in 1984, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

He is the first person to be charged as part of the investigation.

Smith, 66, from Lewisham in south east London, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 8.

All of the counts relate to one alleged victim.

Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said yesterday: 'The CPS has carefully considered the evidence gathered as part of Operation Yewtree in relation to David Smith, who was employed as a driver at the time of the allegations.

'The CPS received a file of evidence on December 21 2012. Further enquiries were necessary and the result of those enquiries was received by the CPS on March 18.

'We have concluded, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest for David Smith to be charged with five offences.'

The charges are two counts of indecent assault on a boy under 14 between June 1 and July 21 1984; two counts of gross indecency with a boy under 14 between the same dates and sexual assault of a boy under 16 between July 1 and 21 1984.

BBC News reported that Smith had worked as a driver for the broadcaster and possibly other employers.

But a BBC press office spokesman said she was unable to confirm whether he had been employed by the organisation, as the Corporation's records do not go back as far as 1984.

Wilfred De¿ath who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being 'over-zealous'

Last month an 82-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of the Jimmy Savile investigation.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said that the man, who has not been named, was interviewed under 
caution on November 29 last year, five days after a search warrant was 
executed at an address in Berkshire.

Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged

He has been given police bail until May. Earlier this week the Mail revealed that as few as three of the men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged.

Details of the small number of Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965.

Wilfred De’ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’ because they had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive.

Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged.

The 70-year-old entertainer was arrested in November over claims he attempted to grope a 14-year-old girl in Jimmy Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974.

A woman called Karin Ward claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 year ago. He vehemently denied her claims.

Last month a Metropolitan Police report said Savile had abused adults and children across the country over more than five decades.

The NSPCC said Savile, who was 84 when he died, had been one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history.
