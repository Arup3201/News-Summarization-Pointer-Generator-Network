Heroic: Dance teacher Donna George, 48, right, who managed to steer her car to safety after suffering a brain haemorrhage

A dance teacher driving pupils home managed to pull her car over at the side of the road moments before she collapsed and died.

Donna George, 48, from Shepley, West Yorkshire, had taken around 10 of her teenage pupils 
out for a meal and was driving them home down steep country lanes when she suddenly became ill.

Mrs George pulled over her car in Lepton, near Huddersfield, and then collapsed at the side of the road from a brain haemorrhage.

She was rushed to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary but doctors were unable to 
save the mother-of-two.

Her husband Ken said: 'Donna’s motherly instincts must have 
taken over and she managed to steer into the kerb.

'The dancers had been 
really helping her so she decided to take them out for a meal as a 
treat.

'The girls were 
brilliant. While a 17-year-old gave Donna CPR, a 14-year-old stopped 
traffic and they called 999. They kept going until paramedics arrived.'

Mrs George had been out for a meal with a group of her pupils at Orlando’s restaurant in the village of Grange Moor on Wednesday night. She became ill while traveling home at around 10pm.

Mr George said today that Donna’s heart had stopped for around 30 minutes, but the 
999 crew managed to restart it in the back of the ambulance.

When she arrived at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary an emergency team was 
waiting to take her straight to the intensive care unit.

Sadly Mrs George died on Thursday at around 3pm with her family - including her children Elliot, 22, and Courtney, 19 at her side.

Mr George said: 'Donna remained in a deep coma until the end, but we would like to think she knew we were all there with her.'

He said tributes continue to pour for his wife - who was a teacher for over 20 years and set up set up the Georgie School of Theatre Arts in her home village.

Mr George added: 'I
knew Donna was so special, but now I realise that everyone else thought
the same. She helped to shape so many lives in such a 
positive way.

'She was a 
very caring person who lived life to the full and she wanted everyone to
reach their full potential.

'She was very good at guiding people and had
a sixth sense of what to say to get the best out of people.'
