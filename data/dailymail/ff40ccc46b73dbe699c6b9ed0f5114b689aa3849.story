Hillary Clinton won't be keeping her supporters in suspense over whether she will run for president for much longer, after promising to reveal her decision on January 1, 2015.

Clinton was speaking on Friday at a charity event in Mexico for a foundation run by telecom billionaire Carlos Slim when she stated her choice would be made by the 'first of the year.'

The former secretary of state and presidential candidate also said she had a 'unique vantage point' on the position of president, according to Reuters.

Business Insider notes that Clinton didn't move that fast during the run-up to the 2008 election, only announcing the launch of her campaign on January 20, 2007.

Clinton has kept a high public profile after leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013.

In an article last month in the Atlantic, Clinton put some of the blame for the rise of ISIS on President Obama.

'The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad—there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle—the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,' said Clinton.

Clinton also focused on releasing her book Hard Choices, which was published by Simon & Schuster in June.

The tour had some salivating for a 2016 run

USA Today said the tour could be a good 'preview' of Clinton on the presidential trail while the Boston Globe called it a 'campaign-disguised-as-book-tour' and panned it.
