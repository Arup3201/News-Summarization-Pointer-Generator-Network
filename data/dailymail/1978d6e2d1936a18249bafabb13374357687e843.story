We all have a favourite 'photo face' or pose, the expression/shape that we pull when someone whips out a camera in a bid to avoid unflattering social media snaps.

Sadly, we're not always quick enough to get into position before a picture is taken that may haunt us in the online realm forever.

So how do our favourite celebrities, who are followed by thousands of flashbulbs every time they step out in public, manage to get every picture right?

Victoria Beckham is one celebrity who has mastered a signature pose, engineered to achieve the slimmest possible silhouette while showing off clothes to their best advantage

Stars such as Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Beyonce and Kim Kardashian never seem to be caught off guard when it comes to paparazzi shots. 

And that's because they have perfected a pose that  makes them look their best from most angles, and they execute it every time a lens is trained upon them.

FEMAIL were keen to discover if we could master the A-listers' perfect posture and test whether or it really does make you look good wearing anything.

We called on a posing coach and posture expert to teach our writer Deni Kirkova the tricks of the trade.

Liz Lark, a yoga and postural expert from Champneys, whose clients include the English National Ballet, Indian Dance Company Sujata Bannerjee and Ralph Fiennes, gave FEMAIL an insight into each celebrity's pose before assisting Deni in perfecting each one.

One glance at a photograph of Victoria Beckham, 40, posing nonchalantly on the red carpet and it looks pretty simple, right? 

Wrong. Look a little closer and you'll notice the pose - the lean back, one leg out and a slight head tilt. And it's not a one off. Victoria has spent years mastering her signature pose - and you'll notice it's the same at every photo opportunity. 

She's been at it for years! Obviously Victoria feels the pose works for her, she's been doing for five years. To achieve it, the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular S-shaped curve with her body

The pose - known to every catwalk model and celebrity in the business - is engineered to achieve the slimmest possible silhouette, while showing off clothes to their best advantage.

And Victoria has it nailed. 'Victoria has a lovely pose,' says Liz.  'I can't see any postural difficulties with Victoria, which means she's been trained well. She has mastered the anterior tilt of the pelvis, where the lumber curve of lower back is reduced.'

Liz explains that by posing in this way, the figure is accentuated, improving the lower back curve and enhancing the glutes.

To achieve it, the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular S-shaped curve with her body. 

Her left foot is stepped slightly in front and crossed over the right, slimming her silhouette, enhancing the curve of her body and bringing her legs down to a neat point.

Her right shoulder is pushed down and back, accentuating the 'couture curve' of her body, and her right arm is held behind her to narrow the profile further.

Her head is always held straight and high to elongate her neck, her chin tipped down to slim the face, or held up and back to create a firm, youthful jawline and lengthen the neck.

Beyonce is another celebrity who always manages to look picture perfect thanks to her signature pose.

The singer, 33, has mastered the 'double grab', which Liz says exudes confidence and draws attention to her petite waist.

Placing her hands on her hips helps flatter her arms and the slight lift of her pubic bones steadies her centre, says Liz.

'Her stance is so well centred that it highlights her hourglass figure perfectly and makes her look graceful and feminine,' she added.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has adopted a pose similar to Queen Bey's. The X Factor judge does, however, place one hand higher on her hips on one side. This, says Liz, helps to add curves and definition to her petite frame.

'As always, Cheryl looks lovely and effortless, but a fair amount of work goes into looking this good on the red carpet.

'Notice she knocks her right knee in, and weakens her outer thigh, adding shape to her physique and making her body "pop".' 

Hippy: Cheryl Fernandez Versini always puts on hand higher on one side of her hip, which Liz says makes her body 'pop' - she also puts more weight on one leg, which flatters them

Adding shape: Deni tested out Cheryl's signature pose and, as you can see from the after snap, right, it gave her body more shape and flattered her legs (dress by Nicole Scherzinger for Missguided)

As one of the world's most photographed women, Kim Kardashian has got her pose down.

Clearly designed to highlight her shapely derriere, the 33-year-old reality TV star often poses by looking over her shoulder, with her back arched and hand on placed on her lower back, just above her iconic bottom, or coyly placed on her cheek.

'Kim's pose is just fabulous,' mused Liz. 'The key here is activating her thoracic (mid back), by arching it slightly and making it look more curved. This also helps to extend the upper portion of her spine.

'By glancing over her shoulder, she is clearly showing off what she sees as her best side.'

Kim clearly knows how to work her best angles. She's been showcasing the over-the-shoulder pose since her first appearance on the red carpet - and it's still working a treat.

Shaping up: While Deni isn't blessed with a bottom like Kim's, Liz taught her how to make the most of hers - although it took her a few attempts to pull off the over-the-shoulder stance with aplomb (dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com)

Giving Kim a run for her money is showbiz stalwart Jennifer Lopez, who has mastered her red carpet pose: the left lean.

Speaking about the 45-year-old's pose, Liz said: 'Her standing leg is hyper-extended (or locked at the knee), which strengthens the legs and makes them appear longer and more toned.

'She also engages her core by leaning slightly to the left, lifting her pelvic floor and engaging her lower abdominal muscles. This pose takes some serious practice but it really pays off.

'Altogether, this stabilises her body and cultivates confidence. She looks gorgeous.'

Left lean: Jennifer Lopez has perfected her pose, which sees her lean to the left, extend her leg out and exude some serious confidence

A celebrity who Liz feels doesn't quite master the perfect pose is Lady Gaga, whose awkward pose matches her taste for avant garde fashion. 

Liz said: 'How very strange this pose is! Her shoulders are hunched up, she needs to roll the shoulders away from her ears and release the shoulders downwards, opening the chest. 

'She should rotate the upper arms externally, to avoid "penguin" arms, which closes the chest and makes her appear less confident.

'As for her knees, they appear to be knocking together. She needs to place the feet hip width wide before bending the front leg knee, to keep her body grounded.' 

Odd: Lady Gaga has an awkward pose that matches her taste for avant garde fashion. Liz said: 'How very strange this pose is! Her shoulders are hunched up, which makes her appear insecure'

FIND YOUR FEET: Imagine you are standing on a trampoline. Ground the four corners of your feet into the earth and unlock your knee joints, as if the earth feels springy beneath you.

MICRO BEND KNEES: Slightly bend your knees, which will activate the leg muscles and therefore give more shapely legs 

NEUTRALISE PELVIS: Tilt the pelvis forward and back, like a belly dancer, and find the middle place between the two: this will stabilise the centre and begin to active the core

AVOID PUSHING TAILBONE DOWN TO FLOOR: This will loosen the lumbar (lower back) curve and give you a beautiful shape, which will enhance your glutes

ACTIVATE THE CENTRE: Draw the navel to the spine, gently draw your lower belly inwards, on exhalations, slightly lift the pelvic floor on exhalations

LENGTHEN THE SPINE: Lift the ribcage above the pelvis, elevate the heart and line up the pelvic floor with the crown of the head

SHIFT WEIGHT FROM FOOT TO FOOT, ROCK FORWARD AND BACK: This will realign the body and awaken energy, unlocking knees

BREATHE!!!!!! Especially exhalations out of the mouth to release stress

ROLL SHOULDERS BACK, RELEASE SHOULDER BLADES DOWNWARDS: Open the chest and smile from armpit to armpit

ROTATE THE UPPER ARMS EXTERNALLY, TO OPEN CHEST: Present yourself to the world, avoid the ‘penguin’ effect
