On the run: Suspected cop-killer Eric Frein remains at large in the Poconos after a search Sunday failed to turn up signs of the self-taught survivalist 

Authorities searching for suspected cop killer Eric Frein are believed to have found a handwritten note penned by the suspect.

The letter, discovered as the manhunt for the survivalist sniper entered its fourth week, is being considered a confession, reports suggest. 

It details the the shooting of two Pennsylvania state troopers last month and then goes on to talk extensively about the escape, according to CNN. 

However the note doesn't reveal a motive and it doesn't seem to explain why he wanted to go on the run and hide out in the woods on the Monroe and Pike County borders.

It wasn't clear where it was found, but sources told the station that the detail it goes into suggests it was written by the suspect.

Frein, 31, is of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson  and injuring Trooper Alex T. Douglass during an ambush at the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12th.

Since then, a number of agencies have been involved in the search, including the FBI and state police, but he has continued to evade capture. 

State police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly issued a statement on Monday saying that he could not confirm the letter or any information provided by unnamed sources.  

It is not the first item that Frein has left behind since the search began.

Police have found two pipe bombs at a campsite used by Frein and have found 90 rounds from a rifle of the type used in the ambush. They've also found tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food and clothing. 

This latest blow to the search for Frein comes following a possible sighting of the suspect on Sunday, that narrowed the search area to just a one square mile-and-a-half area.   

However Pennsylvania State Police spokeswoman Trooper Connie Devens said the identification was not positive.

'The search teams are following up on a possible sighting by law enforcement in the area from earlier this afternoon,' she said. 'And other teams that are searching in other areas of Price and Barrett Townships.'

Discarded: Police recently found a campsite they believe was left behind by Frein in their three-weeks long search. They've also found cans of tuna fish, ramen, noodles and other food and clothing 

Looking: A member of the Scranton, Pennsylvania, Police Special Operations Group, prepares to enter the woods on October 2 in the search for Frein. The 31-year-old has been on the run in the Poconos since September 12, when he shot and killed a state trooper and wounded another

Wanted: Frein was taught how to shoot a gun by his father, a retired Army major, and is a self-trained survivalist. Above, a wanted ad for the shooting suspect pictured above near a trail entrance in Canadensis, Pennsylvania 

'One of the things he seems to be surviving on predominantly would be cans of tuna fish and ramen noodles,' said Lr. Col. George Bivens. 

Bivens said seizing these supplies is crucial, as Frein does not appear to be trying to live off the land.

'I believe his food is running out and we've seized a big amount of it,' he said. 

Frein learned how to shoot from his father, who is a retired Army major, and is a self-trained survivalist. 

He is also a re-enactor with a special interest in Eastern European military and weapons.
