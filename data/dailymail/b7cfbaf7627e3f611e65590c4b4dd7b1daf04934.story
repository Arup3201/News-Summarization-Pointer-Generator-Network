A Red Sox pitcher said he was shocked when he was told there was nothing he could do after his phone was hacked and his wife's nude photographs were leaked.

Clay Buchholz and his wife Lindsay Clubine immediately contacted lawyers after photos she sent him while he was on the road were spread on the internet. 

But they were told that, because the source of the leak came from the Netherlands, it would be almost impossible to prosecute the hackers.

Buchholz and  Clubine immediately contacted lawyers after photos she sent him while he was on the road were spread on the internet but were told it would be impossible to prosecute 

'It was crazy,' Buchholz told WEEI. 'They just told us there wasn't a lot we could do.'  

Buchholz said if they could have, they would have prosecuted. 

Clubine said she was 'devastated' when she found out the photos only meant for her husband had been leaked, she told TMZ.

The former Deal or No Deal briefcase model said she was also upset because she had been wrongly identified in other 'hardcore' photographs that a wife of a teammate had also sent her husband.  

Buchholz said his wife was 'shaken up' after the incident that he advised her to try and 'forget about it'. 

'Everybody knows stuff happens,' he said. 'People are going to use you for whatever they can.'

Clubine's photos were leaked in October during a massive hack that saw almost hundreds of racy photographs featuring celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton posted on 4chan before they spread to sites such as Reddit.

Reddit announced on Tuesday a new ban on all naked or sexual photographs that were posted without the subject's consent. 

Previous rules had only banned child pornography. 

Reddit's interim CEO Ellen Pao acknowledged that the site 'missed the chance' to act swiftly as the celebrities' nude photos were leaked. 

Thousands of people had accessed the pictures before the site eventually took them down.  

As for Buchholz, he said he's definitely being more careful and keeping everything 'secure'. 

'It's just as simple as you dropping your phone and losing it, and somebody guessing your password,' he said.
