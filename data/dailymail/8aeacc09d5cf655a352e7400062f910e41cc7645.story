PC Neil Doyle, 36, died after an early morning assault on a group of three officers near a city centre nightclub - just weeks before his honeymoon

The wife of murdered off-duty police constable Neil Doyle has described his death as 'a great loss' as it emerged a second man has been arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Pc Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was attacked in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of yesterday morning during a Christmas night out with colleagues. 

Last night a 28-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of murder after he handed himself in, Merseyside Police said.

This evening a second man, from the same area, was also arrested on suspicion of murdering the police officer.

The 30-year-old man was taken to a police station to be interviewed by detectives. The 28-year-old is still being questioned.  

The officer's wife, Sarah, 37, said: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all.

'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.'

The couple got married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month.

A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain.

This was caused by damage to major blood vessels supplying the brain and is consistent with an assault.

Pc Doyle was with two other off-duty officers when they were attacked by three men in Colquitt Street at around 3.15am. 

The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt.

Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. 

His colleagues were both treated in hospital for facial injuries - one for a fractured cheekbone and the other for a less serious facial injury.

Two other off-duty policemen, who were with the victim and were also assaulted, were taken to hospital but have since been discharged

A Merseyside Police spokesman said detectives were investigating the possibility that the officers were recognised from their work.

'It's one line of inquiry that we are looking at but it's by no means the set-in-stone motive,' he said.

Pc Doyle, who joined the force in May 2004, was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital after the attack, but died a short time later.

The officer was previously awarded a commendation for his actions in arresting three men after a violent robbery.

He was based at Eaton Road police station in West Derby.

Peter Singleton, chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, said the police community was 'devastated' by Pc Doyle's death.

'Devastated is the nearest word I can think of,' he said. 'His family, friends and colleagues are absolutely devastated. I spoke to the colleagues who were out with him and they were in absolute bits.

'He exemplified the British bobby. He was a solid, good, hard-working, honest copper. Losing a colleague like Neil in such a tragic way is absolutely devastating.'

He added: 'He had commendations from the force for his good work. Sometimes it seems hollow and false to say these words but he really was a good, skilled, dependable cop, who would always do his best for the public.

'If you're a sergeant, police constables like Mr Doyle are exactly what you want. He will be sorely missed.'
