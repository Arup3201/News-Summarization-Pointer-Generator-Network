A schoolboy from top Sydney eastern suburbs school, Rose Bay Secondary College, is one of the six teenagers who made the racist threats to Jewish children on a school bus this week, Daily Mail Australia can reveal.

Two teenage boys from a second nearby boys' high school are also in the 'hate attack' group, but both the schools, the NSW Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli and the NSW Department of Education have all gone to ground, refusing to comment on the attack.

Rose Bay Secondary College principal, Richard Skinner, refused to speak to Daily Mail Australia and both the department and minister Piccoli's office refused to respond.

Instead, the NSW Government has decided to deal with the racial attack as a 'transport matter', referring inquiries to the authority which looks after buses and bus drivers, the State Transit Authority.

The point where the boys, who are aged between 14 and 17, boarded the bus and began terrorising children as young as five years old is almost half way between the two schools.

Racist attack: a student from Rose Bay Secondary College is one of the five youths aged between 14 and 17 years old who are accused of making a vile racist attack on a busful of terrified Jewish children on the way home from their schools in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs on Wednesday. Principal Richard Skinner refused to speak about his student and the Department of Education and the minister, Adrian Piccolli have also gone to ground

One member of the gang of six youths who unleashed an anti-Semetic tirade on a school bus on Wednesday have been identified as a student of Rose Bay Secondary College

Shut down: the Department of Education has refused to comment, as has the NSW Education minister and two schools about the racist attack by anti-Semitic youths on a bus full of schoolchildren ob Wednesday

It is alleged the six males were drunk when they boarded the school bus near the corner of Darley and Allison roads near to Sydney's Centennial Park at around 3.50pm on Wednesday afternoon.

Blue school bus 660 was headed for Bondi Junction from Maroubra. It was carrying 25 primary school students aged between five and 12 years old, all of them pupils from three Sydney Jewish schools, Moriah, Emmanuel and Mt Sinai colleges.

They youths, some of whom wore parts of their school uniform, began chanting anti-Semitic threats including 'kill the Jews and 'Heil Hitler' to the frightened children. One of the 
teenagers also said to them the group would 'slit their throats'.

Five of the youths, believed to be aged between 15 and 17, were arrested at 3.30am on Thursday as they roamed the streets of Dover Heights in Sydney's east.

Several hours later, a sixth teenager, believed to be aged 14, was interviewed by police. Inspector Box said he believed the incident was opportunistic, 'isolated and random'.

They were released into the care of their parents after interviews at Waverley Police Station and reinterviewed the following day in their parents' company.

The Department of Education has refused to comment on whether the youths have been suspended pending the police investigation, or make any comment at all about the schools, the alleged offending pupils, or the incident.

Media inquiries were directed to the NSW State Transit authority.

Detective Superintendent Jason Box said 'it's believed the six juveniles were intoxicated'. The youths have been interviewed and released, their schools refusing to confirm if the students have been disciplined

Police were set to interview a key witness on Friday, who says she saw the attack begin. The woman, who said she was 'a prominent member' of the local Jewish community requested she not be identified.

'I saw the whole thing happen and how it all started,' she said.

'It was terribly distressing.'

The STA say the driver had 'followed all the necessary protocols'.

'This was not a private charter bus, it was a school bus and the bus driver has followed correct procedure in allowing students on,' a spokesman said.

Jacqui Blackburn's three daughters, aged 8, 10 and 12, were on board the bus at the time of the incident.

'Iâ€™m very angry. If these guys get away with this there will be hell to pay,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's not good enough that they will all walk away with a slap on the wrist. How does it happen?'

Prominent Sydney Jewish commentator Jeremy Jones said the schoolboys involved might need to undergo an anti-racism education programme and learn about Jewish people and their history.

'But in my experience people who show anti-Semitism or racism of any kind are nearly always bullied,' said Mr Jones, who is the co-chair of the Global Forum for Combating anti-Semitism.

'This does not happen because of circumstances or events overseas or in Australia. They may feel empowered by that, but they are racists and bullies.'
