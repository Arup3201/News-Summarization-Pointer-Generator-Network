Quarterback Colin Kaepernick has signed a bumper new contract at the San Francisco 49ers - worth a mammoth £75million.

The six-year deal, which will see him stay at the 49ers until 2020, has rocketed him among the top earners in the NFL and will see him earn £12.5m annually.

Amazingly, the 26-year-old was due to make only £600,000 this season before this deal increased his wages 125-fold.

Mega money: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick at his £75million contract signing

Colin Kaepernick (pictured) will earn £240,000-a-week - only Rooney and Van Persie are paid more in the Premier League

1) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) - Reported weekly wage of £300,000

2) Robin Van Persie (Manchester United) - Reported weekly wage of £250,000

3) Yaya Toure (Manchester City) - Reported weekly wage of £230,000

4) Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) - Reported weekly wage of £220,000

=4) Luis Suarez (Liverpool) - Reported weekly wage of £220,000

Kaepernick will rake in £240,000-a-week in his new contract and, when this is compared to the salaries of the Premier League's top earner, only Wayne Rooney (£300,000-a-week) and Robin Van Persie (£250,000-a-week) take home more.

Kaepernick's new deal includes more than £34m in guaranteed money, a person with knowledge of the contract said, speaking on condition of anonymity because terms weren't disclosed.

The sides had made it a top priority to get a deal done before the start of pre-season training next month.

'They were able to get it done six weeks earlier than what I think everyone thought,' Kaepernick said.

Money: He will get £240,000 a week - 125 times what he was earning before the six-year extension

'I'm very excited to have it done at this point and we don't have to worry about talks or anything like that moving forward.

'I'm always striving to be in that group. An elite group in the NFL. Not necessarily pay, but as far as a player.

Whatever comes along with that comes along with it.

'I'm very grateful for it. ... I don't think my motivation is money-driven.'

Kapernick was a second round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, but he quickly took over the starting berth from Alex Smith, leading the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season - a match they lost to Baltimore by three points.

He then guided them to the NFC championship game last season - and another a three-point defeat, this time to 49ers' rivals and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.

Going for the ring: Kaepernick's main goal in the coming years is to go to as many Super Bowls as he can

After signing the contract, Kaepernick declared: '(My next mission is) trying to win as many Super Bowls as I can.'

Kaepernick has completed 382 of 639 passes for 5,046 yards and 31 touchdowns.

He has also started all six post-season games in which he has appeared, earning four wins and passing for 1,374 yards and seven touchdowns.
