The new Big Brother housemates are usually made up of regular people who we will come to love or hate over the next few weeks.

However, some eagle-eyed celebrity spotters may find one particular housemate looks rather familiar - alternative model Sallie Axl.

The tattooed blonde, 26, was photographed just two months ago in a passionate clinch with The Only Way Is Essex star Tom Pearce in London.

The pair had obviously met up at the DSTRKT nightclub and were spotted all over each other as they left the venue in the early hours.

Then then hopped into a taxi together, presumably to get to know each other better.

Making her debut on the new series of the Channel 5 reality show on Thursday night, the bisexual model showed off plenty of her figure and tattoos in her skimpy outfit as she made her way into the house.

In fact, Sallie's outfit choice quickly earned her the nickname 'Sideboob Sallie' among viewers who tweeted their shock at the revealing nature of the ensemble.

What do you think of this year's Big Brother contestants?

Sallie boasted she had slept with over 70 girls, but describes them as 'head f**ks'.

She also claims to have slept with various celebrities, including footballers... and presumably Tom.

She is currently single, having ended her last relationship after discovering her 'weirdo' boyfriend going through her phone.

Sallie has a three-year-old daughter who lives with her for several days every other week, while her father looks after her for the rest of the time.

Model Sallie describes her little girl as the most important person in her life, and says every second they have together is precious.

'T**s and tatts, that's me!' Sallie summarises herself

While Sallie has made a name for 
herself as a model, she was actually only signed up six months ago, and 
says she is proud to be one of the first tattooed models to break into 
the mainstream industry.

And while Sallie's days are taken up 
with modelling, she works as a DJ in the evenings, counting DJing as one
of her main hobbies along with extreme sports and fire-breathing.

Her new housemates have been warned she could be difficult, as she described herself as a 'b**ch'.

Get a room: Sallie boasted she has slept with several celebrities, one presumably being Tom

She said: 'I get my boobs out in public, because I love it. T**s and tatts that's me'.Â 

Before entering the house she said 
she differs from most models because: 'I don't wear heels, I don't wear 
push up bras, glamour girls can be tomboys too.'

When someone pointed out Sallie's presence on BB to her former kissing partner Tom on Twitter, he replied: 'Ha ha ;-).'
