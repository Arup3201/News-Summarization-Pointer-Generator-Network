Packaged meals and snacks for kids have always been a quick and easy answer for parents during a busy day, but they could also be hurting young children.

Most pre-made food for toddlers contains excessive amounts of salt and sugar and could contribute to obesity and other health risks, according to a government study released today.

About seven in 10 toddler dinners contained too much salt, and most cereal bars, breakfast pastries and snacks had extra sugars, found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The study also notes that almost one in four U.S. children ages two to five are overweight or obese. 

Foods studied included popular brands of baby food, as well as toddler dinners including packaged macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, rice cakes, crackers, dried fruit snacks and yogurt treats - but didn't list brand names. 

The researchers analyzed package information and labels for more than 1,000 foods marketed for infants and toddlers. 

And almost 80 per cent of kids ages one to three exceed the recommended maximum level of daily salt, which is 1,500 milligrams.

Mary Cogswell, the study's lead author, said that this kind of excess sugar and salt can contribute to obesity and elevated blood pressure both in childhood and later in life.   

'Blood pressure tracks from when children are young up through adolescence into when they're adults,' she said. 

'Eating foods which are high in sodium can set a child up for high blood pressure and later on for cardiovascular disease.'

One in nine children have blood pressure above the normal range for their age. 

The study found that although the majority of infant foods were low in sodium, foods for toddlers averaged well above the daily recommended salt intake.  

Under Institute of Medicine recommendations toddler food should contain no more than 210 milligrams of salt or sodium per serving. 

The average for toddler meals studied was 361 milligrams - almost 1.5 times higher than the limit.   

Sodium amounts per serving ranged from as low as 100 milligrams to higher than 900 milligrams.

Many foods in the study also contained high sugar content, which is defined as more than 35 per cent of calories per portion coming from sugar.

The study found that sugar contributed 47 per cent of calories for infant mixed grains and fruit, 66 per cent of calories in dried fruit snacks, and more than 35 per cent of calories in dairy-based desserts.  

And about one in three toddler dinners and most toddler cereal bars and dried fruit-based snacks contained at least one added sugar.

Added sugars, including high fructose corn syrup, dextrose and glucose, raised concerns because they boost calorie totals without health benefits.

'It's just additional calories that aren't needed,' Cogswell said.

One group is fighting the new study that could put parents on edge. 

The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group whose members include makers of foods for infants and toddlers, issued a statement saying the study 'does not accurately reflect the wide range of healthy choices available in today's marketplace ... because it is based on 2012 data that does not reflect new products with reduced sodium levels.'

The study 'could needlessly alarm and confuse busy parents as they strive to develop suitable meal options that their children will enjoy,' the group said.

Researchers for the study analyzed package information and labels for more than 1,000 foods marketed for infants and toddlers that were available in 2012. 

They said theirs is the most recent, comprehensive data on commercial foods for young children. 

One Chicago mom won't be entirely banning prepackaged food from her kitchen, but she does have a strategy for striking a healthy balance. 

Kathleen Burnett said she tries to buy healthy foods for her three young daughters. 

She recently switched brands when she found out her favorite kids' yogurt was full of sugar.  

'When you're in the grocery store and things seem quick and simple, it's very tempting to take those things, and we certainly have,' Burnett said. 

'We just try to use moderation in those prepackaged foods.'
