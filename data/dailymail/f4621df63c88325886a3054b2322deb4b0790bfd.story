Two soldier brothers banned from fighting together to prevent a double tragedy were both blown up the same stretch of road in Afghanistan.

But the two bothers have both returned home alive, with their escapades bearing a striking resemblance to Steven Spielberg's film Saving private Ryan.

Welsh brothers Nathan, 22, and Craig Williams, 21, were prevented from fighting together by military bosses to prevent their family from losing both in a single attack.

Brothers in arms: Nathan Williams, left, and Craig Williams, right, were both involved in Taliban IED attacks in Afghanistan. But both brothers have returned home safely to Swansea, Wales for Christmas

The safety measures proved futile, however, as both brothers were involved in Taliban attacks in the same area only three weeks apart.

Thankfully for the Williams family, the brothers have both returned home to Swansea for Christmas after their lucky escapes.

The soldiers from Delta Company of 1st 
Battalion The Royal Welsh spent six months based just kilometres apart 
in Nad Ali in Helmand Province.

Younger brother Craig was the first to be involved in a Taliban attack while on patrol.

Recalling the incident, he said: 'We would routinely travel on one of the main routes between Nad Ali and Lashkar Gah.

'But the villages there had a heavy Taliban presence and IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) were a constant danger.

Similarity: In Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning Saving Private Ryan, an army captain, played by Tom Hanks, seeks to find a private and bring him home during World War II when his three brothers are killed in battle

Success: Saving Private Ryan, starring Tom Hanks, left, and Matt Damon, centre, was nominated for 11 Academy Awards

'One
day towards the end of my tour, we’d been taking some troops to a 
checkpoint and were on our way back to camp when we hit the IED.

'The only thing I really remember is our vehicle been flipped on its side and a plume of black smoke filling the air.

'We received covering fire from a vehicle behind us and all got out. We had a few bruises and one of the lads knackered his back but all in all it was a lucky escape.'

Older brother Nathan was behind the wheel of a Mastiff 
armoured vehicle when another IED exploded only three weeks later.

Nathan said: 'The Mastiff vehicles are an immense piece of kit and undoubtedly saved our lives.

'Without them we’d have probably both been killed.'

Blast: The two incidents occurred within three weeks of each other at the same location on a route between Nad Ali and Laskkar Gah

Wreckage: A large hole can be seen blasted in the ground following a car bomb in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Monday. The bomb exploded outside a compound housing a U.S. military contractor in the Afghan capital

Nathan was on his second tour of Afghanistan, while Craig on tour in the country for the first time.

Nathan said: 'I would come up to his checkpoint every three to four days when we needed to re-supply them.

'I don’t think back and worry about having a close escape, it doesn’t bother me, I know the dangers involved.

'I worry a lot more about him, his close escape effects me more than mine.'

In Steven Spielberg's
Academy Award-winning film Saving Private Ryan, an American army 
Captain, played by Tom Hanks, and his team endeavours to find Private 
James Ryan, played by Matt Damon.

Set during World War II, following the invasion of Normandy, Private Ryan is the last-surviving brother out of four servicemen.

Good to be home: When the brothers told their mother about the incidents she called them 'idiots'

Following Government orders to return Private Ryan to his mother safely, Hanks's character is given the task.

The Welsh soldiers said their parents Christopher and Tracey found it difficult to have them both away at the same time.

Craig said: 'We told our dad first about the bomb blasts because he understands that these things happen.

'But when we told mum about both being blown up she called us idiots.'

The brothers have three siblings, Chelsea, 20, Aleisha, 15 and 14-year-old brother Leon.
