A lawyer acting for a high school girl who threw a wild party at the home of a family for whom she was cat-sitting says a text message received from the family indicated to the teen that it was OK for her to have friends over.

Michael S. Taheri says the 17-year-old City Honors School student agreed to look after the Binder family's seven cats while the family were away from their home in Buffalo.

Taheri claims the text message gave the teen the impression that she was welcome to invite friends over to the house on Florence Avenue, where her school friend Zoey Binder, 18, and her father Stephen Binder and mother Kristen Segebarth live.

Destroyed: Teens did thousands of dollars of damage to the home of Steven Binder and his wife, Kristen Segebarth

The text from Segebarth read: 'The kitties thank you and said that if you need to rendezvous with someone in the house while the Binder family is away, they’ll stay in the background [no huge drunken orgies tho, ok? Just small ones.] Heard the Yale interview went well!' reports the Buffalo News.

This apparently gave the girl to understand that she could invite some friends over and she asked two girlfriends over to keep her company.

Taheri says that the girl then went on a babysitting job and that it was one of the friends who invited the rest of the teenagers, who caused thousands of dollars of damage to the house and stole jewelry and $6,000 cash.

Segebarth told the Buffalo News that the message was sent in jest and that her meaning was the exact opposite of her words.

In case there was any confusion, Segebarth says she had her daughter also text the teen, saying 'NO [expletive] PARTIES IN THE HOME,' sent just before the family left for their dream vacation to Costa Rica to celebrate Zoey Binder's graduation and her impending study at the University of Pennsylvania.

Upon their return from vacation though, the family discovered that their home had indeed been the scene of a bacchanal of huge proportions.

Used condoms litter the floors and puddle of vomit, urine and feces were found in beds, reports the Buffalo News. There was graffiti and even holes in the walls as wells cash and jewelry missing.

Taheri says the teen cannot be held responsible for the actions of the almost 50 teenage partygoers who were at the home on December 27.

If anything, he says, she is also a victim of the circumstances, rather than an instigator.

'This is a young lady who is an honor student, applied to Ivy League colleges, has exceptional SAT scores and has no criminal record whatsoever. Zero,' Taheri said.

'We have fully cooperated with the police, given a list of the people at the party to the police and the family. They have also notified their homeowners insurance policy and gotten a claim number for the Binders,' the attorney said.

The girl returned from her babysitting job and tried to herd everyone out of the house, a feat she achieved at 1am.

She came clean to her parents about the party the following afternoon.

'At 1:45 p.m., she texted us that she had lied,' the mother told the Buffalo News, 'that there had been a mob at the house the night before and she was cleaning up and needed our help. She said she hadn’t slept because she was so upset and got up early in the morning and went back there to clean.

'Several kids came and helped for about an hour in the morning. We went over and there was vomit everywhere, broken furniture and dirt and mess. We helped her vacuum, do laundry and take out trash and broken glass …'The girl's family says that her own savings will be used to reimburse the family for the damage done, but that Stephen Binder's request for $8,500 for the cost of the holiday is unreasonable.

Binder wants the money reimbursed because the family's holiday was ruined by the actions of the girl.

Gross: The homeowners found urine, feces and vomit all over their house

Binder and Segebarth say they have had to initiate all contact with the cat sitter and her family and had no idea that they had retained the services of a lawyer.

When Binder asked the teen's parents to 
pay for the damages, they offered him $90, which wouldn't even begin to 
cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house, the 
jewelry that was stolen, or the $6,000 in cash that was taken from the 
house.

When Binder and his family entered their home, they found the mother of the cat-sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner. She explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner.

But Binder - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home, as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage.

'What the hell happened?' he asked the girl's mother.

Friends of the 17-year-old cat-sitter, who the family describes as a 'trusted friend' of their daughter,  from many of the area's elite private schools - with names like City Honors School, Nardin Academy, St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute had converged on the home.

As if the urine feces and vomit wasn't bad enough, Binder tells the Buffalo News that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house.

Then video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites.

In one of the videos, a male was seen urinating on 18-year-old Zoey Binder's bed - as another teen is narrating, saying 'this is for you.'

'The destruction to our house is considerable. There was human feces, urine and vomit in numerous locations. Every floor in the house was rifled. There was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms,' Binder told the paper, as he and his wife explained that it wasn't until last week that the stench from the December 27 party was finally gone.

'It took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit, and we keep discovering more,' Binder said. 'I don’t know that I won’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit. There was vomit everywhere.'

According to Binder, the cats the 17-year-old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party 'that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home.'

Authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat-sitter played in throwing the party.

Authorities say that 25 of the teens involved in destroying the house attended City Honors, seven were from 
Nardin Academy, six from Canisius High School, four from St. Joseph’s 
Collegiate Institute - which charges fees of $10,000 a year - three from a Williamsville high school and one was
 an exchange student.

The identity of the 17-year-old cat-sitter has not been made public.

In addition to the video of a teenager urinating on Zoey Binder's bed, authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party:

'If I didn’t die last night, I’m probably living forever.'

'I am DISGUSTED by every aspect of this night.'

'Never realized that I go to school with such horny people.'

'Roll another bowl.'

Binder says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat-sitter. He says they asked them to reimburse the $8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home. The girls' parents, however, gave them a check for $90 - the amount they'd paid the girl to watch their cats.

If no criminal charges are filed, Binder will likely sue the parents of the cat-sitter in civil court.
