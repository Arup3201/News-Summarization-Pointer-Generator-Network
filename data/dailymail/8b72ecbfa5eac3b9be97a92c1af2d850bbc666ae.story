After driving all around Mars with four rovers, Nasa wants to look deep into the guts of the red planet.

The space agency has decided to launch a relatively low-cost robotic lander in 2016 to find out what makes the Martian core so different from Earth.

The Insight project was chosen by Nasa's Discovery programme over missions to a Saturn moon and comet, drawing complaints from scientists that it is too focused on Mars.

The Nasa science chief, John 
Grunsfeld, said while all three proposed missions, which cost no more 
than $425m (£270m) were good, the Mars project showed the best chance of
keeping within budget and on schedule.

The
Insight mission includes two instruments, one French and one German, 
that will examine the geology of Mars in depth, exploring the core's 
size, composition and temperature.

Mars's interior is a mystery.

It has no magnetic field, and scientists are unsure whether its core is solid or liquid or if it has frequent quakes like Earth.

'What kind of Mars quakes are there? How big is the core of Mars? Does it have remnants of a molten core like the Earth does?' asked the Discovery programme chief, Lindley Johnson.

Jay Melosh of Purdue University said geologists have been asking for this type of crucial information for decades and said a project like this was overdue.

The mission will be run by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab in California, which is basking in the success of the $2.5bn (£1.6bn) Mars Curiosity rover, which is starting to explore the planet's surface after landing this month.

Earlier this year, Nasa pulled out of two Mars missions with the European Space Agency because it lacked the $1.4bn (£0.9bn) funding for the proposed 2016 and 2018 mission.

Nasa is still working on another possible Mars mission to replace the cancelled missions, with a decision due this month.

The mission will study the interior of Mars in a bid to find out how it formed. Here, the red planet's geography is revealed with a topographical map.

But Carolyn Porco, a prominent scientist who studies Saturn and its moons, criticised the decision, saying there was 'too much emphasis on Mars in our current plans for planetary exploration'.

She said: 'Most of the solar system resides beyond the orbits of the asteroids.

'There is more to learn there about general planetary processes than on Mars … Why more Mars?'

Mars beat missions to explore Saturn's moon Titan and its odd methane oceans, and a mission to land on a comet as it nears the sun.

Opponents of further Mars missions say Nasa has not approved missions to the other outer planets or a comet since a Pluto mission was picked in 2001.
