Meet Coronation Street's latest fresh-faced cast members who are all fighting for the same role.

Erin, Eilah and Elsie, are triplets who all play 13-year-old Faye Windass's baby girl Miley, taking it in turns in front of the camera.

They were chosen after the soap put out a call to casting agents and put up posters in hospital maternity units in the region asking for identical twin girls to play the newborn.

The five-month-old triplets were selected after parents Martyn Halliwell and Laura Slinger, from Padiham, near Burnley, put them forward after hearing that triplets are often in high demand in television. 

Martyn said: 'My cousin, who is a theatre actor, suggested that we should get in touch with an agent. He said "there is a high demand for twins, let alone triplets".

'We sent some photos over and within two hours we heard back to say they had a client who was interested. On the Monday we were at Coronation Street.' 

Martyn, 29, a  sales manager, and  Laura, 26, a beautician, are delighted at how well the girls, born on October 27, have taken to being on the soap.

And the family has received a warm welcome from all the cast and crew - particularly from Ellie Leach, who plays teen mum Faye in the controversial storyline, and her mum Anna, played by Debbie Rush.

Martyn says that despite only being a few months old his baby daughters are already developing quite a talent when it comes to being on screen. 

The triplets are swapped each scene while playing the daughter of Faye in the controversial story line that saw the Corrie character give birth at just 13-years-old 

'Everybody is shocked at how good they are,' he said.

'One of the triplets cries on cue, so when they need a crying baby we take Elsie down for filming. When they need a calm baby we take Erin.

'Everybody wants to look at the girls and they make a fuss of them, especially Debbie and Ellie. Ellie has been fantastic with the girls.'

The triplets, who have a six-year-old  brother Maddox, were born ten weeks early at Liverpool Women's Hospital.

Erin arrived first at 5pm weighing 2lb 2oz, followed by Eilah at 5.01pm weighing in at 3lb 1oz and Elsie, a minute later weighing 2lb.

Martyn added that he hopes that their early start on show might have given them the acting bug. 

'Hopefully they will stay on the show if they are enjoying it. 

'I have grown up watching Coronation Street and so has Laura. They have made us at home and comfortable and everybody is one big family.'

The triplets will make their first appearance on Good Friday when a shocked Faye goes into premature labour.
