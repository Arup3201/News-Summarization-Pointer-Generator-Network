Four Arsenal football fans were arrested inside Liverpool's Anfield stadium after a man was beaten to death on a city centre street.

Stuart Smith, 33, from London, died in hospital in the early hours of Sunday morning following an alleged assault in Liverpool city centre.

The four men, two aged 39, a 33-year-old and a 27-year-old, who are also from the London area, were later arrested at Anfield during Liverpool's game against Arsenal.

The men remain in custody for questioning.

Merseyside Police said detectives do not believe the incident, which may have been recorded by a passer-by on a mobile phone, is football or gang-related or that Mr Smith was known to the suspects.

Police were called to Back Colquitt Street at about 2.45am on Sunday following reports that Mr Smith had been assaulted.

He was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital where he died a short time later.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'Officers are keen to talk to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident.

'They are particularly keen to trace a man who may have captured part of the assault on his camera phone.'

A post mortem examination is due to be carried out later by a Home Office pathologist to establish the cause of death.

Forensic examinations have taken place at the scene of the incident, in a busy part of the city centre and close to a number of popular bars and nightclubs.
