This office worker certainly means business when it comes to Christmas cubicle decor.

Angela Westfield, a saleswoman at the W Minneapolis hotel in Minnesota, spent 18 hours building a log cabin out of cardboard carpet rolls in a bid to give her desk space a wintry lift.

The festive structure, over 6ft high, includes a walk-through door, a snow-covered roof and an alpine garland topped with flashing fairy lights.

Red and green stockings also hang from the exterior.

Out to win: Each year, Angela's office runs a cubicle decorating contest - the winner will be announced Monday

Angela's co-worker, Matt, told CNN he 'uttered a swear word' when he first laid eyes on her transformed cubicle. 

Angela hopes her hard work will help her score first place in her office's annual cubicle decorating contest.

She started building her hut in the garage at home with help from her husband, Alex.

Each of the tubes, from a local DIY store, had to be trimmed to the exact length before being glued together.

Cooey: Angela even included a window in her design so colleagues can check she isn't slacking

Explaining the inspiration for her wintry abode, she said: 'I love the idea of log cabin Christmas, I always have. Really cosy, log-cabin feel'

Angela even included a window in her design to enable her boss to check up on her.

Explaining the inspiration for her wintry abode, she said: 'I love the idea of log cabin Christmas, I always have. Really cosy, log-cabin feel.'

Once the cabin was complete it was  transported it to Angela's workplace in downtown Minneapolis.

All of the trimmings were then added to give it an extra Christmassy feel.

A photograph of Angela's holiday hut soon made the rounds on social media. Many fans have applauded her novel idea.

The winner of the cubicle  contest will be announced Monday along with the prize.
