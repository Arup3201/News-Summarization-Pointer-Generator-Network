It may look like stunt out of a B action movie but footage of this near death moment on a busy highway is just an extremely lucky close call.

Footage of the incident from February 8 on Live Leak shows a group of cars on a Louisiana highway tailgating one another at a fast pace, an already dangerous activity.

When the driver of a black vehicle spots a cop car at a traffic stop a few feet ahead of him or her, the driver slams on the brakes and accidentally swerves on the highway in front of another car.

Swerving car : The tires of the car smoke as the car swerves on the Louisiana highway after hitting the breaks

By some luck the two cars kiss bumper to bumper and don't collide but set off a chain reaction of more almost crashes.

As the black vehicle swerves, a silver van skillfully pulls over to a grassy knoll to avoid being crushed to death.

As the footage continues one can see a cop in the middle of pulling over another vehicle.

The driver of that vehicle gets in their car to happily drive away as the police begin walking towards the car that may be getting a ticket but is lucky to be alive. 

Kiss of death: The car swerves in front of another car and just misses crashing into it in a head on collision 

Cop ahead: The cop ahead was conduction one traffic stop and now he'll definitely have to conduct another
