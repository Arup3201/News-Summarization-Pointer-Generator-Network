Jeremy Bowen, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC's news programmes, said the issue of high pay had given the corporation's opponents 'sticks and stones to chuck at us'

Bumper pay packets handed out to BBC executives have caused 'massive damage' to the corporation and created a 'them and us divide', according to its Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen.

The journalist, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC’s news programmes, said the issue of high pay had given the corporation’s opponents 'sticks and stones to chuck at us'.

Director-general Tony Hall introduced a cap on pay-offs of £150,000 when he took over following the furore over the £470,000 paid to his predecessor George Entwistle.

Mr Entwistle was paid a year’s salary when he left the BBC’s top job - double what he was entitled to - even though he had only been in place for 54 days before resigning over his handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Bowen told the Guardian: 'The over-remuneration of people was a huge mistake and it’s caused massive damage to the BBC.

'It’s caused it internally, because the vast majority of people who work at the BBC do not get brilliantly paid.

'But
 the massive salaries given to top management angered people on the shop
 floor, exaggerated the "them and us" feeling that there was a 
chauffeur-driven top of the corporation with enormous salaries and 
massive bonuses.

'And that caused a lot of resentment and still does. I resented it personally.'

Bowen, who joined the BBC as a trainee, 
has covered conflicts in the Gulf, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, 
Somalia and Rwanda throughout his career.

During the last financial year, the BBC paid out more than £25 million in severance payouts, including former Director General George Entwistle, who received £470,000 after he was forced to resign after Newsnight broadcast false allegations about Lord McAlpine.

Other senior figures who walked away with huge sums include former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who got £680,000, and deputy director general Mark Byford, who departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000.

In 2012 it emerged that the corporation had used more than £6million of licence-fee payers’ money to pay 14 executives more than £300,000 each.

The figures reveal that redundancy payoffs almost doubled to £58million between 2010 and 2011.

In 2010, 481 BBC staff received redundancy payments worth a total of £27million, while in 2011, 1,281 staff were handed payoffs totalling £58million.

In the first six months of 2012, 270 
staff members were given £14million. The average payout for departing 
BBC workers was £51,000.

It means that in total, the corporation paid £277million in redundancy to almost 6,000 staff in the seven years leading up to 2012.

Four executives took more than £8.5million in payouts and pension deals with them between 2010 and 2012 alone.

Former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, right, who got £680,000, and deputy director general Mark Byford, who was given a total payout of £949,000, were also given huge sums when they left the BBC

MPs were 
left ‘incredulous’ when learning that former chief operating officer 
Caroline Thomson left with a £670,000 pay-off in September 2012 - more 
than twice her £330,000 salary - even though she had wanted to quit.

Sharon
 Bayley, the former director of marketing, communications and audiences,
 left in October 2010. She was given a payout worth nearly £400,000, 
despite having been at the BBC for less than two years.

The
 biggest payoff was awarded to Mark Byford, the former director of 
journalism, who received £949,000 as compensation for loss of office, 
while an unnamed finance officer was given a £420,000 payoff.

George Entwistle quit in November 2012 after only 54 days in charge. But on top of his well-publicised £450,000 pay-off – double that to which he was entitled – his lavish exit package included another £45,000 for bills for lawyers and communications advisers.

The deal included up to £10,000 for the legal advice to help him secure his pay-off and £1,200 per year for a Bupa policy.

Caroline Thomson left the BBC in 2012, having spent more than 23 years at the company.

She walked away with a pension pot
 worth more than £1.7million, having been on an annual salary of 
£330,000. It later emerged that she left with a payout of £670,000 - 
more than two years' salary.

This included a year's salary for making her role redundant and the payment of her 12-month notice period.

Mark Byford, the former deputy director general, left the BBC in 2011 after 32 years and was given a severance package of almost £1million. As with Miss Thomson, this was made up of his notice period and redundancy payment.

He also left with a huge pension pot, thought to be worth in the region of £3.5million.

Sharon
 Bayley, the former director of marketing, communications and audiences,
 left in October 2010. She was given a payout worth nearly £400,000, 
despite having been at the BBC for less than two years.
