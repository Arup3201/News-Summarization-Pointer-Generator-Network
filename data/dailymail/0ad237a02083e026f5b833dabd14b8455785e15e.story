Celtic have stepped up the role of sports psychologist Jim McGuinness by asking the Irishman to concentrate his efforts on the Parkhead first team.

The 42-year-old quit his successful role as manager of the Donegal GAA team recently to spend more time in Glasgow.

And he admits he has hit it off with coach Ronny Deila to such an extent he has stepped up from working with development players to assist the first team.

A prominent figure on the touchline before Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Ross County, McGuinness flew to Dublin after the game and told RTE’s Saturday Night Show: ‘Since the new manager has come in he wants me to work pretty much exclusively now with the first team. I work on the psychology things with players.

‘We are very like-minded in our approach. Other than the fact I was very defensive and he is very offensive, the principles are exactly the same.

‘And that is what he wants, high-octane football, energy, workrate, a lot of preparation and a lot of offensive energy going forward – taking the game to the opposition.

‘That’s the style of play he brought from his previous club and he wants to implement that.

‘If you take that philosophy forward there are a lot of demands within it. The energy levels can sometimes become a problem so the key thing for a manager is that the players are happy and have high energy levels.

‘If you want to train at 100 per cent every day and work hard every day and want high energy on the pitch and in drills then you have to be demanding. That’s why my role has become more important. If it was a situation where he wasn’t demanding that much it would be a bit easier for the players.’

Brought to the club by major shareholder Dermot Desmond under Neil Lennon’s tenure, McGuinness quit Donegal after their All Ireland final loss to Kerry.

Admitting his role at Lennoxtown has evolved significantly, he added: ‘When I first went to Celtic initially it was for players who were very close to getting into the first team. Can we bridge that gap and get them over the line and take them into the first-team set-up?

‘From that point we tried to put a lot of systems in place to develop the players. In soccer a lot of it is about opinions, so when I went there based on my own sports science and psychology and coaching background I wanted to try and make it more objective.

‘To try to develop key performance indicators that would give us a reading on players on a consistent basis. That has been rolled out now from the under-nines up to the under-20s.’

McGuiness has also developed links with Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and was spotted at Gleneagles for last month’s win over the United States.

‘Paul’s father Mick is an ardent Donegal supporter,’ he explained. ‘Mick called me up and said Paul would like to meet me.

‘I wanted to meet him, he wanted to meet me as well. Paul had just managed Ireland in the Seve Trophy and wanted a handle on team dynamics because golf is an individual sport

‘He had spoken to Martin O’Neill and Alex Ferguson, but was interested in what we had done with Donegal and interested in man management and what we had done with players and building relations and stuff.

‘I went down and met him and there was a match on the TV. It was Christmas time, it started at 8pm and I didn’t leave until three in the morning. Our relationship has really grown very strong.

‘There has been a lot of speculation about what I was doing with the Ryder Cup team. But the reality is that I probably have leant on Paul more than he has leant on me because he has been a very good source of counsel as issues came up.’
