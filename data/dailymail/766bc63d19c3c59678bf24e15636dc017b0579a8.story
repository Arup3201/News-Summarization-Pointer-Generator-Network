A Southern California teen fatally shot himself early Monday morning in front of his family after telling his cousins he was going to play Russian roulette, authorities say.

The 17-year-old boy allegedly put the .38 Special revolver to his head and pulled the trigger while his cousins begged him 'not to do it,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez told the Los Angeles Times.

In Russian roulette, a revolver is loaded with one bullet and participants take turns putting the gun to their heads and pulling the trigger.

Russian roulette: Police responded around 4 a.m. Monday morning to reports of a shooting and found a 17-year-old boy bleeding from a single gunshot wound

NBC4 reports security guard Donald Gordon responded to reports from neighbors of screaming that lasted a minute, followed by a gunshot.

'He was on the ground, gasping for air, saying he really needs some help,' Gordon said, after he found the teenager bleeding on the ground.

Police arrived around 4 a.m., after which the boy was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the sheriff's department. 

The teenager reportedly lived with his older brother and sister-in-law at the Harbor Cove apartment complex in Torrance.

'They were pleading with him not to play with the gun, not to play Russian roulette,' said sheriff's department Sgt Scott Hoglund.

'The victim did not listen and proceeded to put the gun to his head and pull the trigger,' Hoglund added. 

Police say they recovered the gun from the scene and are trying to find whose name the gun is registered under. 

'Additional information about the weapon is still under investigation,' the department said in a statement.

Family members told NBC4 they did not know how the boy had gotten hold of a gun.
