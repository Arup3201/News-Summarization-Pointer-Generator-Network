Arsene Wenger has quashed reports of Joel Campbell leaving Arsenal this summer, insisting the young forward is in his plans for the new season.

The Costa Rica star, 22, showed fans what he could do in his nation's heroic performances at the World Cup in Brazil, but was linked with a Premier League loan move ahead of the new season. 

Wenger though says he is here to stay and should feature in this weekend's Emirates Cup.

Good mood: Wenger was speaking at a press conference on Friday ahead of the Emirates Cup

 'Yes, he [Campbell] is part of my plans. He might play tomorrow against Benfica,' Wenger told reporters at a press conference on Friday.

And talking about the South American influence at the club in the shape of new signings David Ospina and Alexis Sanchez, the French boss continued.

'We follow closely what's going on in South America because I believe, in some positions, they are stronger than European clubs.

'Especially up front. If you make a classification of a world-class striker today, that's in favour of South America.'

Campbell signed for Arsenal back in 2011 but has yet to make an appearance because of work permit issues, and has featured for three European sides in the meantime.

Loan shark: Campbell was impressive on his year away at Olympiacos last season

Lorient, Real Betis and most recently Olympiacos have all reaped the rewards from acquiring the youngster on loan.

AC Milan and Galatasaray are two more clubs who are thought to have enquired about Campbell this summer, but even the striker wants to stay.

'The Premier League's the most interesting in the world and I've always wanted to play here. It's my dream. And I believe I'm good enough,' Campbell told The Sun.

'I've played around 100 games in three different divisions in Europe. Lorient in France, Real Betis in Spain and Olympiakos in Greece, where I played Champions League too.

'I'm confident of being successful in any division in the world.'

Campbell scored twice as Costa Rica reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup this summer, and will be looking to make a contribution this season.

He may feature in the Emirates Cup against Benfica (Saturday) and Monaco (Sunday).
