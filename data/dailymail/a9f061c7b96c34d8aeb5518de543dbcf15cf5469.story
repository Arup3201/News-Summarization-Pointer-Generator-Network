The European Union hopes to strike a deal to restore relations with Cuba by the end of 2015 after cutting ties with the country back in 1996.

It froze relations with the country  19 years ago until it reformed areas such as human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy.

Now the two sides have agreed to intensify the pace of talks which began in 2014 aimed at improving bilateral relations, the EU's foreign policy chief has said.

'Slow progress': Ms Mogherini said the EU wants to finalise the framework for an agreement between the two bodies by the end of 2015

Federica Mogherini said the pace of progress was 'slow' but  it was gaining 'political momentum' after meeting with Cuban president Raul Castro and other high-ranking officials in Havana.

She said: 'We decided today to speed up the rhythm of our negotiations, hopefully to manage to finalise the framework of our dialogue and agreement by the end of this year. 

The negotiations they began last April were seen as part of an improvement in relations since the 28-nation bloc lifted diplomatic sanctions on Cuba in 2008. 

But only three meetings took place in the next 11 months, prompting the Europeans to quicken the pace which Cuban officials agreed to.  

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez will now visit
Mogherini in Brussels on April 22 and like the EU chief's trip to
Havana, the meeting will fall outside of formal negotiations.

Between now and then they will also see each other at the
Summit of the Americas set for April 10-11 in Panama, to which
both Cuba and the EU are invited for the first time.

Cuba has also begun to engage in talks with the
United States after the former enemies announced they would restore diplomatic relations in December.

Relations between the countries are still strained but they have improved drastically since Fidel Castro stepped down as leader of Cuba and Barack Obama became president of the United States.

After assuming office, Obama said he was open to scrapping the trade embargo if Cuba underwent political change and in 2009, he eased some economic sanctions on the country and eased travel restrictions too.

 Cuba's president Raul Castro reciprocated Obama's policies and in July 2012 he said his government was willing to hold talks with the United States to 'discuss anything'.

They two leaders famously shook hands at former South African president Nelson Mandela's state memorial service. 

The United States and Cuba quickly arranged high-level
meetings in Havana and Washington, while EU-Cuba talks were
postponed twice.

Though not as severe as the open conflict between the United
States and Cuba, Europe's relations with the Caribbean island
have also been strained through the years.
