West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has fanned the flames of his row with Louis van Gaal by now claiming that he is the most sophisticated manager in the Premier League.

Allardyce accused Manchester United of employing long-ball tactics during their recent 1-1 draw at the Boleyn Ground. But Van Gaal, armed with a statistics dossier at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, hit back at Allardyce's claims. 

But now the 60-year-old West Ham boss has gone one step further by insisting that he is the most advanced coach in the country.

Allardyce said that only Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has more Premier League experience than him 

'I don't think there is any coach more sophisticated than me anymore,' said Allardyce. 'That's not trying to criticise any other coaches but there is only (Arsenal manager) Arsene Wenger who has done it longer than me.

'They may well have gained more experience by managing abroad like Louis van Gaal, Ronald Koeman and people like that but, in this country, with the experience they've got, I don't think there is any coach that would be in that position as more sophisticated. I'm just as good as everybody at this stage.

'That comes from the amount of time you do the job, how much experience you gain in the job and how much knowledge you strive for on a regular basis to keep the cutting edge.

'The cutting edge is what's new in football, what's the next level, where is it going to be, how can you find it, how can you implement it into your club.

'I've always been that way inclined. I've never stood still and it's probably why I am still here managing in the Premier League for the last 13-14 years.'
