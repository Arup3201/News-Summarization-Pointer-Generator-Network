As the U.S. government ground to a halt at midnight, social media and the world's press promptly derided politicians for their inability to come to an agreement.

The foreign press treated news of the shutdown with bemusement but little surprise - although some commenters expressed concern that gridlock could stunt other economic recoveries.

And on social media, users poked fun at the government while federal employees who are forced to take time off both celebrated and complained about not being able to work.

The impassioned responses came after the government closed for the first time in 17 years as it failed to come to an agreement over its spending bill. It meant that non-essential services were shut, forcing some 800,000 workers to take unpaid leave.

The shutdown, which came as Republicans and Democrats clashed over Obamacare, could cost the economy a staggering $1 billion a week - which the rest of the world promptly pointed out.

'It is a risk to the world economy if the US can't properly sort out its spending plans,' British Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday.

In Germany, Der Spiegel Online claimed 'a superpower has paralyzed itself' while The Welt said the could be 'fatal consequences' that could damage the U.S. recovery.

But it also noted that the world's markets did not panic and there has been little impact, which suggests it had been expected for weeks and priced in accordingly.

In France, Le Monde noted that the last government shutdown cost $1.4 billion (or $2 billion today), and turned the public against the Republicans, whom voters blamed for the chaos.

'Jefferson, wake up, they’ve gone crazy!' Le Monde said in an editorial, calling the shutdown 'grotesque'.

The French were clear to point out that the repercussions were being felt across the Atlantic Ocean as the American cemeteries in France from World War II were closed as a result of the shutdown.

In the UK, The Guardian noted called it 'bizarre' and that the final hours 'could well have been scripted by Hollywood' as the sides worried more about who was going to get the blame for the shutdown rather than actually stopping it.

The Australian also derided the U.S. system, writing that the inability to reach a decision didn't 'say 
much for the budgetary processes in the world's largest economy'.

It comes as little surprise that the Russian press saw the shutdown as an opportunity for ridicule though some of the sting got lost in translation.

The Rossliskaya Gazeta splashed a headline reading 'The "Elephants" are Robbing the U.S. Government', making a play on the Republican mascot.

The largest newspaper in South Korea made a point to calm local concerns, reiterating that the shutdown would not lead to any military reductions for American troops abroad, as the U.S. plays a pivotal role in their regional security when it comes to North Korea.

In the U.S., commentators and the public expressed their dismay on social networks - and even Obama had something to say.

'They actually did it,' his Twitter feed read. 'A group of Republicans in the House just forced a government shutdown over Obamacare instead of passing a real budget.'

NASA Voyager 2 quipped: 'Due to government shutdown, we will not be posting or responding from this account. Farewell, humans. Sort it out yourselves.'

A mock U.S. government Twitter account added: 'The government is currently on shutdown. Be prepared for no noticeable difference. The government wasnt working anyways.'

And Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane wrote: 'Per several Family Guy episodes: whenever there’s a government shutdown, we can all steal a zoo animal. Go get yours.'

Other users who are being forced to stay at home as they are deemed non-essential workers also had something to say - with some enjoying their days off in the sun.

'Spending my #furlough day drinking sangria and eating nutella crepes,' one wrote.

Amber Straughn, a NASA astrophysicist, added: 'Mid-day #furlough run!  Nice day out there. Except for, ya know, the inability to do my job.'
