A Nasa spacecraft orbiting the red planet has found the 'strongest indication' that liquid water may still exist on the Martian surface.

Images taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal 'finger-like' markings on Martian slopes.

Experts say that although they do not yet have a 'smoking gun', they believe the markings are made by minerals which could not have left without flowing liquid.

Dark, seasonal flows emanate from bedrock exposures at Palikir Crater on Mars in this image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Astronomers believe the dark 'fingers' above hold the key to water on Mars.

Known as 'recurring slope lineae' or RSL for short, they are dark lines that are observed moving down the slopes of some Martian mountains as temperatures on the surface rise.

Experts believe these flows might be caused by saltwater containing a iron sulfate solution to keep it from freezing in Martian temperatures.

'The features are dark, finger-like markings that advance down some Martian slopes when temperatures rise,' Nasa said.

The new clues include corresponding seasonal changes in iron minerals on the same slopes and a survey of ground temperatures and other traits at active sites.

These support a suggestion that brines with an iron-mineral antifreeze, such as ferric sulfate, may flow seasonally, though there are still other possible explanations.

Researchers call these dark flows 'recurring slope lineae'.

'We still don't have a smoking gun for existence of water in RSL, although we're not sure how this process would take place without water,' said Lujendra Ojha, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, and lead author of two new reports about these flows.

He originally discovered them while an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tucson, three years ago, in images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Ojha and Georgia Tech assistant professor James Wray more recently looked at 13 confirmed RSL sites using images from the same orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument.

They found 'distinct and consistent' spectral signatures of ferric and ferrous minerals at most of the sites.

'Just like the RSL themselves, the strength of the spectral signatures varies according to the seasons,' said Ojha.

River on Mars? This image combines a photograph of seasonal dark flows on a Martian slope with a grid of colors based on data collected by a mineral-mapping spectrometer observing the same area.  
Nasa believes it could reveal salty liquid water. The purple and pink colors of the image represent spectra with absorption of light at wavelengths of 920 nanometers and 530 nanometer, which the researchers say indicate a concentration of ferric iron, and a clue that water flows in the area.

'They're stronger when it's warmer and less significant when it's colder.'

These results are in a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The leading hypothesis for these features is the flow of near-surface water, kept liquid by salts depressing the freezing point of pure water.

'The flow of water, even briny water, anywhere on Mars today would be a major discovery, impacting our understanding of present climate change on Mars and possibly indicating potential habitats for life near the surface on modern Mars,' said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Scientist Richard Zurek, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In a seperate paper, by Georgia Tech scientists and colleagues at the University of Arizona; U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Ariz.; and Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, a team used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to look for patterns in where and when the dark seasonal flows exist on Mars.

Their results indicate that many sites with slopes, latitudes and temperatures matching known RSL sites do not have any evident RSL.

'NASA likes to 'follow the water' in exploring the Red Planet, so we'd like to know in advance when and where it will appear,' Professor James Wray said.

'RSL have rekindled our hope of accessing modern water, but forecasting wet conditions remains a challenge.'
