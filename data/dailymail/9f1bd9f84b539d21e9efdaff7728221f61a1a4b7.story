Team news

Tottenham 

Mauricio Pochettino will once again be without striker Emmanuel Adebayor for Tottenham's Capital One Cup quarter-final tie with Newcastle.

The Togo striker has returned from compassionate leave but Pochettino does not believe he is fit enough to return to his squad in time for the visit of Alan Pardew's side.

Pochettino made 10 changes for Tottenham's win in the previous round and could rotate this time out with a hectic festive schedule ahead - with Kyle Walker likely to sit out having played twice in the past week.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Dier, Rose, Davies, Fazio, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Mason, Capoue, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Kane.

Harry Kane could start for Tottenham against Newcastle with Emmanuel Adebayor still missing

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will welcome Steven Taylor and Moussa Sissoko back from suspension for Wednesday night's Capital One Cup quarter-final trip to Tottenham.

Central defender Taylor missed Saturday evening's 4-1 Barclays Premier League defeat after being sent off for two bookable offences during the 2-1 victory over Chelsea, while midfielder Sissoko sat out following his fifth booking of the campaign in the same game.

Full-back Daryl Janmaat will not figure at White Hart Lane after collecting his own fifth caution of the season against the Gunners, while keepers Tim Krul (ankle) and Rob Elliot (thigh) and midfielders Mehdi Abeid (toe), Rolando Aarons (hamstring), Ryan Taylor (knee) and Siem de Jong and Gabriel Obertan (both thigh) remain on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Alnwick, Woodman, Dummett, S Taylor, Williamson, Coloccini, Streete, Haidara, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Cabella, Colback, Gouffran, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.

Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko will return from suspension against Tottenham on Wednesday

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Tottenham won the most recent clash against Newcastle in the League Cup back in 2008/09 (2-1), courtesy of goals from Roman Pavlyuchenko and Jamie O’Hara.

Newcastle have won their last two games at White Hart Lane, this after losing the previous four.

Spurs have scored in each of their last 25 home games in the League Cup. They last failed to score in a League Cup game at White Hart Lane in Jan 1999 versus Wimbledon.

This will be the Magpies first appearance in the quarter-finals of the League Cup since 2006/07, when they were eliminated by Chelsea (0-1).

Alan Pardew’s side have already knocked out two Premier League sides in the League Cup this season – Crystal Palace and Manchester City.

Tottenham have been eliminated in five of their last seven League Cup ties against fellow Premier League teams, including last season in the QF against West Ham.

Harry Kane has scored in each of his last three appearances in the competition; two of which have been as a substitute.
