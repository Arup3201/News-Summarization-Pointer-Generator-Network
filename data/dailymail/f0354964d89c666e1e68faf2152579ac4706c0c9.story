Former Everton midfielder Andy van der Meyde rates Zlatan Ibrahimovic alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the world's greatest players.

The Dutchman, who had a troubled stay on Merseyside after being signed by David Moyes in 2005, played with Ibrahimovic during the Sweden striker's time at Ajax between 2001 and 2003.

Although Messi and Ronaldo are widely regarded as the game's standout players, Van der Meyde insists that the Paris Saint Germain forward deserves to be recognised in the same company.

'Ibrahimovic is one of the best players in the world with Messi and Ronaldo,' Van der Meyde told Goal.com.

'He is such a big and strong guy. He can be an intimidating figure. Plus he has amazing technique as well for someone with a big body like his.

'He's the type of player who wants to win at all costs. He is arrogant, but that's him. It's a positive sort of arrogance if you ask me. He is a true great.'

Despite retiring from football in 2011, Van der Meyde still recalls how Ibrahimovic's feats in training left him and his teammates breathless.

'We didn't need long to realise that he was going to be a great player. He did things on the training pitch where we could only look on with our mouths open out of admiration.

'The kind of actions he makes now as well, with his acrobatic backheels. Although he didn't really managed to perform during games early on.'

The 32-year-old will head back to Ajax when PSG travel to the Amsterdam ArenA for their opening Champions League group game on Wednesday.
