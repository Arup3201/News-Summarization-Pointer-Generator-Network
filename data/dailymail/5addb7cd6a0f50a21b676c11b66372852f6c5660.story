Prince Harry risked landing brother William in marital hot water yesterday when he told him at a charity event: ‘Stop flirting.’

The royal brothers were brokering multi-billion pound deals at BGC Partners in the heart of London’s finance district when they squared up to each other on the trading floor.

The sibling rivalry between the pair was clear to see as they hit the phones at the global brokerage company to help raise millions for two charities close to their hearts, WellChild and SkillForce.

Oops: Prince Harry may have landed his brother William in hot water with his wife Kate after ordering him: 'Stop flirting, get on with it' during the charity day

The event is held each year in memory of the 658 employees who died in the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Centre in New York, with the entire profits from the day’s trading being given to good causes.

Brotherly banter saw the pair raise several laughs on the trading floor of the firm in Canary Wharf, as they joined forces to negotiate huge deals, including a company record worth €25billion.

During one joint telephone call, Harry complained that new dad William, who welcomed his son, Prince George, in July, was taking part in too much ‘baby talk’.

‘He's on the phone, it's all baby chat,’ Harry complained to a broker helping him seal a deal.‘I'm much better at helicopter chat.’

flirting, get on with it.’

Broker Nick Thompson, 45, helped Harry and William seal a lucrative deal while colleagues cheered and shouted around them.

He said: ‘It was interesting listening to them both to see who was more confident. Harry took to it very well.’

Asked how baby George is getting on by one client on the phone, William revealed: ‘He's very well thanks. He's sleeping quite well.’

Doting dad: Prince William happily told one caller how his son George, born in July, was doing, telling them: 'He's very well thanks. He's sleeping quite well'

As the brothers, both dressed smartly
in suits and ties, switched from desk to desk negotiating deals with 
firms including Barclays and Merrill Lynch, traders presented Harry with
a gift for his nephew, a red, white and blue baby gro and a teddy bear 
from the Little White Company.

Harry thanked the team for the gift and promised to pass it on to his brother.

At
one stage the Apache helicopter pilot appeared flustered by the 
frenetic atmosphere of the room, saying: ‘Everyone's shouting different 
things.’

During another deal, Harry spoke to a broker called George over the phone and gave the name the royal seal of approval. ‘A good, strong name,’ he joked.

He then urged brokers to raise the 
value of the deal, calling out figures and lifting his hand to indicate 
the final figure needed to be higher.

A grinning Harry quipped: ‘Are you feeling like making some money for charity today? Good. Whatever you're thinking you can double it.’

At one point William tried to break the ice with star-struck brokers by joking he wasn't really the prince.

Broker Neil Fordham, 45, revealed when Wills got on the phone with a trader, he said: ‘It's all a wind up, I'm Gary.’

Neil added later: 'It put everyone at ease. He was very good and came across very well. He did a trade that made us about £3,000 sterling. He's a bit of a natural.'

The Princes each made a handful of high-value deals during their 50-minute visit.

At
first they appeared a little timid, but they soon got into the swing of
things as the raucous trading floor buzzed around them.

At one point William remarked to a broker: 'Bloody hell, was that a billion?!'

Xavier Alcan, executive managing director at BGC, said: 'William was extremely pleasant and he was very efficient.

'He was making enough efforts to concentrate on the transaction with all the noise around him.'

The charity day is in its ninth year and has raised $89million to date. The money raised is split between several charities in the UK and abroad.

In their biggest deal made together, the pair broke BGC's record for a forward foreign exchange trade, with a 25billion Euros agreement. It is not known how much the deal will have netted for the charities.
