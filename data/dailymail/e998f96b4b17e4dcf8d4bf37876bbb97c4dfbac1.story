Janet Ellis, who has suffered the pain of ten miscarriages shared her story to promote health charity Wellbeing of Women

It is a heartache she chose to keep private for many years.

But having suffered the pain of ten miscarriages, Janet Ellis feels she is well-placed to observe how women can often be ‘stoic’ when it comes to their feelings.

Miss Ellis, 58, one of Blue Peter’s best-loved presenters, had a string of miscarriages between 1994 and 1999.

She eventually gave up on having a fourth child to focus on her daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, now 35 and a singer, and her two younger siblings.

Sharing her story to promote health charity Wellbeing of Women, she said her gender has a tendency to ‘suffer in silence’.

‘I talked to the people who needed to know ... I didn’t want it to become the main thing about me,’ she said.

Miss Ellis said she believes women often neglect their own wellbeing to care for others, adding: ‘There is a tendency for women to ignore their own health problems until things get really terrible.

‘I think most women are quite stoic about how they are feeling. They tend not to mention the trivial headache or the cold, whereas it does sometimes become a bit more of a production for men.’

Miss Ellis presented Blue Peter from 1983 to 1987. She quit after giving birth to her son Jackson, now 27, with her second husband John Leach.

At the time it was speculated that the presenter was forced to leave the BBC because they were unmarried at the time.

But she now insists the decision was entirely her own. She said: ‘I was prioritising baby. With two small children, and that amount of filming and live shows, it wasn’t a difficult decision to make.

‘Blue Peter was perfect while it lasted. Sophie was young enough to fit in with what I was doing. But I think that sort of thing becomes harder when children get older.

'I might have stayed on a couple of years if I hadn’t had Jack, but he was a jolly good reason to leave. So I never regretted it.’

Calling for more older women to be put on TV, she added: ‘I think the right person for the job, and if she happens to be an older women, then of course. A bit of positive discrimination doesn’t go amiss.’

Miss Ellis went on to have her second daughter Martha-Rose in 1991.
