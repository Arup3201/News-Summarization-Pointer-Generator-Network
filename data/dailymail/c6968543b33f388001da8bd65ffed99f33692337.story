A Canadian prisoner was photographed apparently smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol while incarcerated.

QMI Agency reported Michael Simoneau-Meunier, who is spending time inside the Bordeaux prison in Montreal, was snapped in the photos and uploaded them to Facebook.

Simoneau-Meunier captioned the photos 'Xo and blunt living da jail life.'

High times: Michael Simoneau-Meunier published these photos of himself apparently smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol while behind bars 

Look at me! Simoneau-Meunier has also published a number of shirtless selfies to his Facebook page 

The news service pointed out 'Xo refers to his $250 bottle of cognac and blunt is slang for a marijuana joint.'

Simoneau-Meunier has a history of run-ins with the law, according to the Canadian news service.

The inmate has also been sharing shirtless photographs of himself online, QMI agency noted - and one such snap was published as recently as Wednesday.

Several of Simoneau-Meunier's Facebook friends like the image and seemed to comment on it positively.  

The news service, citing a source, revealed 'inmates [at Bordeaux] are smuggling in cellphones faster than guards can confiscate them.'

The Journal de Montreal reported that multiple Bordeaux inmates have been posting shirtless selfies online. 

The newspaper reported that Simoneau-Meunier has already been sentenced for various charges and 'is jailed awaiting sentencing for a robbery.' 

Between 2007 and 2013, prison personnel recovered 567 cell phones at Bordeaux, the newspaper revealed.

Three men broke out this year using a helicopter, according to The Journal.
