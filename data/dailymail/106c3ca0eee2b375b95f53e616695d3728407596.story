A Texas psychiatrist and three other men have been indicted for running an international human trafficking ring that brought female dancers from India and forced them to become strippers and prostitutes in New York City.

Federal prosecutors say the alleged criminals would find female dancers in India and promise them cultural exchange jobs in the US.

But
 once the women arrived, they were forced to 
dance in nightclubs for 12 to 14 hours a night, seven days a week, and were pressured to have sex with clients, court records show.

Charged with labor conspiracy and visa fraud by a Manhattan grand jury are: Riyaz
 Mazcuri, known as 'the Doctor,' Sabja Khimani, Rashmikant Patel and 
Mehmood Hassanali Dhanani, known as 'Sam' and 'Mehboob.'

Texas psychiatrist Riyaz Mazcuri is one of four men charged with labor conspiracy and visa fraud. Prosecutors say they lured women to work in cultural exchange programs but forced them to become strippers and prostitutes

Between 2008 and 2010, the criminal ring kept the women in their service by confiscating their passports and locking the victims in hotel rooms when they were not working.

Assistant US Attorney Peter Skinner, who is handling the case, would not say where in New York City the women were performing or whether the nightclub management is suspected of any criminal activities.

More people are expected to be charged with involvement in the trafficking ring, a source told MailOnline.

Mazcuri, a graduate of the University of Karachi in Pakistan, has been a licensed psychiatrist in Texas since 1986.

Riyaz has been licensed to practice psychiatry in Texas since the '80s. His Texas clinic, pictured here, remains open

He has no history of medical malpractice or other criminal activity, and his record reflects no disciplinary actions have ever been taken against him, according to the Texas Medical Board.

The doctor appeared before a judge in Texas on Friday afternoon and was released on $300,000 bond, according to KLTV. He's expected in at a hearing in New York federal court on Friday.
