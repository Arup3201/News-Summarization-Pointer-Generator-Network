A Hurricane, Utah mother is wracked with guilt at the death of her 11-month-old daughter, whom she accidentally left in the car for hours on Friday during 90-degree weather.

Skyah Suwyn was just one week short of her first birthday when mother April Suwyn broke her normal routine and brought her beloved daughter along in the car to drop off her two young sons with a babysitter.

But the urgent need to use the restroom meant April parked her car and rushed back into her home, leaving Skyah behind in the hot parked car.

It was only when she went back to the car around 1pm that she noticed her grave mistake.

Paramedics life-flighted Skyah in extremely critical condition to Dixie Regional Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

Skyah became the twentieth child to die of heatstroke after being left in a car this year, in a tragic recurrence that has claimed the lives of about 38 each year since 1998.

Neither April or her husband Micah have made statements regarding their only daughter's death, but April's sister and a family friend have spoken to the press in their defense.

'It was an accident,' a crying Aimee Wright, April's sister, told the Deseret News. 'If people who are being negative could even see how hard she is on herself. If they could see that she keeps saying, "If only. If only. If only. I wouldn't have been out of my routine that day. If only I had gone to the gym." She blames it all on herself.'

Wright says that Skyah's death was the result of a change of routine for her sister, who usually has a neighbor look after her daughter while she takes the boys to a babysitter.

But she decided to take Skyah along for the ride that day.

There was construction going on in the neighborhood so Mrs Suwyn had to park a few blocks away from her home, where she does nails in her in-house salon while watching Skyah.

Mrs Suwyn rushed out of the car after parking, since she needed to use the restroom, and went about her day under the impression she took Skyah out of the car and put her down for nap as usual.

She found her daughter hours later when she went back to the car to pick up her sons.

The incident is under investigation by local police, and as of Saturday no criminal charges has been pressed against April. 

Authorities are investigating these cases more seriously after the death of a Georgia toddler in similar circumstances this past June.

Prosecutors say the boy's father, Justin Ross Harris, left him alone on purpose after finding suspicious web searches on his computer.

'This incident is very tragic and our hearts go out to those involved, especially the family,' the Hurricane police said in s statement on Skyah's death. 'The temperature in a vehicle can rise substantially very quickly, which makes it a very dangerous situation.'

But those close to the Suwyn family say there's no question Skyah's death was an accident.

'They loved her so much,' family friend Lacie Van Dam told KSL. 'They never, never set her down. She was just...everybody loved her.'

Ms Van Dam went on to call her friend April a 'fantasic mom' who' loves her children more than anything in the world.

However, some have lashed out at the mother online for causing her own daughter's death.

April's sister and Ms Van Dam have urged these people to stop, since the family is already torn up with guilty.

'She doesn't need the negative. It's eating her away. It's eating the family away. She's a good mom and she made one simple mistake that she'd take back in a heartbeat,' Wright said.

Many are reaching out to the family however, with an online crowdfunding campaign and Facebook support page.

A campaign on Go Fund Me had raised over $11,000 as of Sunday night, while those close to the Suwyns and strangers have rallied on Facebook to show their love.
