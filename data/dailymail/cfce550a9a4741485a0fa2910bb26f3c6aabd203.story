A recluse failed to notify the authorities after his elder brother died and lived with the corpse for three years, continuing to claim his dead sibling's benefits.

Alistair Brown fraudulently claimed more than £38,000 before the gruesome case came to light - when firefighters discovered his brother John's 'badly decomposed' foot sticking out from under a bed.

The firemen had been called out to the flat the brothers shared in Denny, Stirlingshire, after reports of a burst pipe, Alloa Sheriff Court was told.

Recluse: Alistair Brown lived with the body of his elder brother John for three years and fraudulently claimed benefits totalling more than £38,000

They notified police, who arrested Brown, 61, at a nearby hotel. He told officers that his brother 'had not been keeping well'.

John Brown's foot was discovered in December 2010 - three years after he is believed to have died, aged 69.

Ann MacNeill, prosecuting, told the court that the authorities had been to inspect the flat on a number of occasions before the gruesome discovery.

She said: 'On December 20, 2010 the remains of a dead male were found by members of the fire brigade called to inspect water running in the flat.

'The crews entered a bedroom and found furniture on the bed.

'There was a human foot coming out from the bottom of the bed and police were immediately called.

'The accused was traced by police on December 21, 2010 at the Royal Hotel in Bonnybridge playing in a domino tie.

'He attended at the police station and said that he had been residing with his brother, who had not been keeping well.'

The depute fiscal added: 'The body was in such a state of decomposition that the cause of death could not be attained.

'It was later found that there had been no ill-will but that the accused had used a bank machine to remove money from the dead man’s bank account.'

Brown, now of Falkirk, admited concealing his brother’s body and continuing to withdraw the deceased man’s benefit payments, totalling £38,237.84, to which he was not entitled.

The court heard that John Brown was thought to have died in mid-December 2007. He had problems with alcohol and had suffered a number of strokes.

Defence agent Gordon Addison described the case as 'tragic and unusual'.

'The body was in such a state of decomposition that the cause of death could not be attained'

He said the brothers were 'very close' - and neither of the men had any contact with other members of their family, including John’s two grown-up children.

Mr Addison added: 'We all have to cope with death in our own way but most of us have family and friends to help. If you have no-one to turn to the consequences can be out of the ordinary.

'My client is quiet, introverted, lonely, and shy, and his actions have had tragic personal and awkward legal ramifications.

'Ian was his last living brother and the last contact he had with his family. No-one had spoken to either of them for three to four years prior to the man’s death.

'After his partner’s death, Ian was living alone. Alistair was a janitor but gave up his job and went to live with his brother to look after him.

'Ian was largely housebound and the accused dealt with all his needs, such as shopping.

'On the day he died, Ian had not been feeling well and Alistair attended to his needs.

'He then went to the pub and came back to find his brother dead.'

Mr Addison said that Brown had suffered what social workers have described as an ‘acute and unusual grief reaction’.

'He had no-one to turn to and knew he would be in trouble,' the defence agent added. 'He felt he was in a hole he could not get out of.'

Mr Addison said Brown would have been entitled to various benefits himself but never applied to the State. Both men lived off John Brown's benefits.

Sheriff Kenneth McGowan ordered Brown to perform 240 hours of unpaid work, saying it was in the 'public interest' not to jail him.

He told Brown: 'The circumstances are bizarre.They do not fall into a simple category for sentencing.

'If the court was to approach this as a £38,000 fraud then you would be going to jail for a significant period of time.

'But I am willing to accept that the true loss to the State is substantially lower than that amount as you would have been entitled to funds of your own.

'Therefore, it is clear that the net loss will be substantially less than £38,000.

'I believe that the public interest will be served by a community-based disposal.'
