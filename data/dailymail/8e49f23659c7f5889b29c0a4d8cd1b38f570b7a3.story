National treasure: But Delia Smith was once fired from the BBC because her show wasn't sexy enough

Delia Smith is one of the best-known faces on television after forging a pioneering career as the woman who inspired Britain to cook.

But 30 years ago, she was kicked off TV screens by BBC managers who though she was 'not sexy enough', she revealed this week.

Bosses thought her show was too 'educational' - but Delia went on to even greater success, and now says the axing was 'the best thing that ever happened to me'.

The 71-year-old chef, whose empire of cookbooks, TV programmes and now online broadcasting has made her a national icon, was given a special Bafta award for her services to television cookery.

At the award ceremony on Tuesday night, Delia recalled that despite her stellar career, not every enterprise has been a total success.

In the 1980s, she made a number of programmes on BBC1 showcasing modern cooking techniques and encourage Britons to get into the kitchen.

'They sensed it was popular and put me at the end of Nationwide, which had millions of viewers,' she said, according to the Daily Mirror. 'But when that ended, many millions switched off.'

The show was moved to BBC2 - but when a new controller took over, he apparently decided that it was too dry, and deemed that Delia was not exciting enough.

She said he told her: 'I don't think this is sexy enough. I don't think it belongs on my channel. I think it should go to education.'

While this could have been a blow to the chef's burgeoning popularity, she told the gathering this week: 'That was the best thing that ever happened to me.'

Delia added: 'Apparently I was not sexy enough. I suppose it was a blow, but you can't be everything can you?'

The future star worked as a swimsuit model in the 1960s before starting a job as a waitress at a restaurant in Paddington, where she was eventually allowed to help with the cooking.

She landed a newspaper cookery column in 1969, which brought her to the attention of TV executives.

Delia made it her mission to teach Britain how to cook again, appearing on a number of BBC programmes before being given her own show.

In the 1990s, she made a string of blockbuster shows in which she recommended ingredients such as eggs and cranberries, which promptly saw massive spikes in their sales.

Earlier this year, she announced she had retired from the television and has set up the 'Delia Online Cookery School', which enables would-be chefs to learn at their own pace using recipes and videos posted on her website.

'My online cookery school is the most amazing experience I've had,' she told the Bafta ceremony on Tuesday. 'We show exactly what we want to show.

'There is no better way to teach. When I have done this I will stop, as it will be done for ever.'

She also said that the best part of her job was interacting with her legions of fans, adding: 'I think the most rewarding and satisfying thing is meeting the people who use the recipes, reading their letters - well, now their emails - but that's always rewarding when you realise you are actually reaching people through this wonderful medium called television.'

Outside the kitchen, Delia is known as a passionate supporter of Norwich City, of which she and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones are the majority shareholders.

However, at the ceremony she insisted she was not 'a recognisable face' despite her high profile.

'I'm very lucky because when I'm all dolled up like now, people might recognise me, but most of the time, without my make-up on, I'm a bit of a scruff and I don't get recognised,' she said.
