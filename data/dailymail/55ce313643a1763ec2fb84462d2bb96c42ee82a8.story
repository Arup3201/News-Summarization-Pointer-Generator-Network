The neighbourhood watch captain who shot dead an unarmed black teenager last month wanted to be a police officer and called 911 nearly 50 times within the last year, according to new reports.

No charges have been filed in the February death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, shot in a gated community near Orlando by self-appointed watchman George Zimmerman, 28.

Zimmerman, who admitted to shooting the teen, said he fired in self-defense and has not been arrested in the case.

According to the Miami Herald, 
Zimmerman volunteered as chief watchman at the Retreat of Twin Lakes 
Townhomes after its homeowners association decided to jumpstart the 
programme following a spate of burglaries.

Licensed to carry a concealed firearm 
and a student of criminal justice, neighbours told the newspaper 
Zimmerman took nightly patrols while walking his dog, and was passionate
 about his duty.

Records acquired by the Herald show his self-appointment led to a series of calls to police. From January 1, 2011 to 
February 26, 2012, Zimmerman reportedly phoned authorities 46 times - to
 'report disturbances, break-ins, windows left open and other 
incidents'.

His calls account for some of the 402 made to police from the 260-unit complex, according to the Herald.

Cynthia Wibker, secretary of the homeowners association, credits him with solving crime in the area.

'He once caught a thief and an arrest was made,' she said, adding that he helped to solve 'a lot' of crimes.

But Trayvon’s family attorney, Natalie Jackson, told the newspaper Zimmerman took his new position too seriously.

Tragic: By the time police officers arrived, unarmed Trayvon, who had been carrying Skittles and soda, was dead on the ground from a single gunshot

'Zimmerman felt he was one of them; he felt he was a cop,' she said.

Sanford police officials, who have not
 charged Zimmerman after accepting his claim that his actions were in 
self-defense, released eight 911 calls on Friday after mounting 
pressure.

'Zimmerman felt he was one of them; he felt he was a cop.'

Zimmerman had called 911 to report a 
suspicious man and can be heard pursuing Trayvon on foot against the 
dispatcher's advice causing the teen to run away.

Moments later the police are bombarded
 with calls from terrified neighbours as a voice in the background can 
be heard desperately screaming for help before the sound of two gun 
shots.

When police arrived at Twin Lakes they
 found Trayvon, who had been returning from a store with candy for his 
younger brother, had been shot dead by Zimmerman.

'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his SUV.

Fighting for justice: Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said 911 calls show the teenager spent the last few moments of his life terrified - and says Zimmerman should be charged

He added that the black teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.

'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said.

During Zimmerman's initial call, he 
told the dispatcher he was following Martin and the dispatcher told him,
 'You don't need to do that.'

'We’re hoping this doesn’t happen 
again to another family, and that America opens their eyes ... even 
though this won’t bring Trayvon back. We don’t want there to be another 
Trayvon.'

- Tracy Martin, victim's father

But Zimmerman sounds as if he continues to pursue the teen saying: 'He ran.'

He then refuses to meet police 
officers at an agreed location and asks for them to call him on arrival 
instead so he can tell them where he is.

Moments after Zimmerman's initial 
call, dispatchers were bombarded by seven 911 calls from frantic 
neighbors describing a fight between two men, screaming and then a 
gunshot.

'There is somebody screaming outside,'
 one female caller said, as an unknown male voice can be heard crying in
 the background. Then a shot is heard.

A male caller described a physical altercation between Martin and the shooter.

'I just heard a shot right behind my 
house,' The caller said. 'They're wrestling right behind my porch. The 
guy is yelling 'Help.' I'm not going outside.'

By the time police officers arrived, 
unarmed Trayvon, who had been carrying Skittles and soda, was dead on 
the ground from a single gunshot

Another woman said a man in a 'white top' was on top Trayvon.

Martin's family had demanded the 
release of the calls to help better understand how Martin died while 
walking home from a convenience store.

'We are committed to having somebody 
review this to see if we made a mistake. If we made missteps and there is something there, we will act
 accordingly.'

- Sanford Mayor Jeff 
Triplett

'He was yelling for help, and no one 
could help him. He saw his life being taken away from him,'  the teen's 
father Tracy Martin said.

He said they will continue pushing for charges to be filed against Zimmerman.

'We’re hoping this doesn’t happen 
again to another family, and that America opens their eyes... even 
though this won’t bring Trayvon back. We don’t want there to be another 
Trayvon,'  Mr Martin said.

After listening to recordings of 911 
calls, Martin's family said they're more convinced than ever that the 
Zimmerman should be charged with a crime.

'You hear a shot, a clear shot, then 
you hear a 17-year-old boy begging for his life,' Ms Jackson said. 'Then
 you hear a second shot.'

The case has been turned over to the 
State Attorney's Office which can decide whether to file charges or 
present evidence to a grand jury.

Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is also 
representing the family, told reporters outside Sanford City Hall that 
Martin's parents both broke down and cried as they listened to the 
recordings.

'They are completely devastated, and 
they are in unbelievable grief,' Crump said. 'The last seconds of his 
life were in absolute fear.'

He added that a third witness has come forward saying it was the boy who was crying for help.

Trayvon's
 parents, Mr Martin and Ms Sybrina Fulton, previously sued to have the 
recordings released. A hearing for the case had been scheduled for 
Monday.

Earlier on Friday, Trayvon's parents called on the FBI to take over the investigation, saying they no longer trusted the Sanford police department.

Sanford police Sergeant David 
Morgenstern said the department stands by its investigation but welcomes
 help from any outside agency. FBI agent David Couvertier said the 
agency has been in contact with Sanford police and is monitoring the 
case.

'We are committed to having somebody 
review this to see if we made a mistake,' said Sanford Mayor Jeff 
Triplett. 'If we made missteps and there is something there, we will act
 accordingly'

Trayvon's family believe Zimmerman should be charged and brought to justice for shooting their young son

Several Sanford residents who spoke to
 The Associated Press said they think there would have been an arrest 
already if the shooter had been black and the deceased had been white.

They said blacks and whites in this 
city of 53,000 residents were pretty much in agreement that an injustice
 had been done with no one arrested, and that there was no racial divide
 in how the case is being perceived. The city is 57 percent white and 30
 percent black.

Zimmerman's father delivered a letter 
to the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, saying the way his son is being 
depicted in the media is cruel and misleading.

He also says his son has received 
death threats and moved out of his home. George Zimmerman is Hispanic 
and grew up in a multiracial family, the statement says.
