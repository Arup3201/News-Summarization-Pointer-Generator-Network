It’s one of London’s busiest Tube stations and also the site of a popular shopping centre so it was fortunate that no one was seriously hurt when a silver BMW plunged into a subway ramp at Elephant and Castle.

The car driven by a man in his thirties with a female in her twenties in the passenger seat smashed through railings at the busy roundabout, rolled onto its side and plunged 10ft down into the subway ramp.

Police were today investigating the cause of the accident which happened in front of stunned commuters in south London at 8pm last night.

Witnesses described hearing a crash 'like thunder' and seeing the car’s two occupants trapped in the saloon as it lay on its side on the footpath below.

Fire crews rescued the pair who were checked over at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital suffering minor injuries.

Jamie Smalley, 33, an entrepreneur, told the Evening Standard: 'It was unbelievable. I was in my office with the window open and it was like a crash of thunder. 

The driver and his female passenger walked away with only minor injuries despite being in the car which smashed through railings at the roundabout, rolled onto its side and plunged 10ft down into the subway ramp

'I could see an indicator light flashing in the ramp that leads to the subway. I went downstairs and I couldn’t believe a car had gone over the railings like that.

'They’re very lucky. It’s scary as I walk up that ramp every day and it’s so busy, it’s a miracle there wasn’t anyone walking up it when the car landed.'

Firemen and police spent several hours moving the car out of the subway

London Ambulance Service said a man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were treated at the scene and taken to Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in Southwark, one with a facial injury and the other with an arm injury both described as minor injuries.

Firemen and police spent several hours moving the car out of the subway.

Police said they were investigating and that no arrests had been made.
