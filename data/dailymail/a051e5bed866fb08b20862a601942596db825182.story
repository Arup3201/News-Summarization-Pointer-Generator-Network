Ryan Bertrand has hit out at the way he has been treated at Chelsea, which could pave the way to making his loan move to Southampton permanent.

The left back, who scored his first goal since moving to the south coast club in the summer for the season, has been on loan for nine different spells at seven clubs.

Now 25, Bertrand is still not deemed good enough to warrant a place in Chelsea’s squad and he claims that they have been dishonest with him.

Previous loan spells:

1. Bournemouth - November 2006 - December 2006

2. Bournemouth - January 2007 - February 2007

3. Oldham - August 2007 - January 2008

4. Norwich - January 2008 - May 2008

5. Norwich - July 2008 - May 2009

6. Reading - July 2009 - June 2010

7. Nottingham Forest - August 2010 - January 2011

8. Aston Villa - January 2014 - May 2014

9. Southampton - July 2014 - present

‘The situation became clear to me before I went on loan to Aston Villa [in January],’ he said. ‘Right from when I was 17, I was getting those 15, 20, 25, 30-plus games a season until I hit a stumbling block.

‘That’s when the alarm bells rang. Before that, I had a chance to move from the club – because I just want to keep my career moving – but I was advised I didn’t need to do that.

‘It all unravelled in front of my eyes, and certain things didn’t make sense in terms of what certain people had said to me, all I ask for is honesty, and I didn’t get that.

‘Since I left to go on loan to Villa, it’s been about me again. I’d never rule anything out, but it’s just been about getting out there and playing consistently without the thought process of what Chelsea think or whether I’m going back there.’

Bertrand has taken no time in replacing teenage sensation Luke Shaw, who left in a £31million transfer to Manchester United.

Bertrand was part of the Chelsea side which won the Champions League against Bayern Munich in 2012 

While Shaw has struggled with injury and fitness at his new club, Bertrand has been in scintillating form.

He hopes that his new lease of life at Southampton can help him break into the England team

‘I love playing for my country – I’ve done it twice at senior level and throughout the youth set up,’ former Champions League winner Bertrand added. ‘To get that taste of playing for my country was great. There’s nothing better than playing in front of a full house at Wembley. It’s what every boy dreams of.

‘That’s definitely one ambition. The first was to get into the team here and to play regularly, so if my performances are of a high enough level then I don’t see why not.’
