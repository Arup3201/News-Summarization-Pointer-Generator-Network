An execution date has been set for Georgia's only female death row inmate - the first time in seven decades that a woman will be executed in the state.

Kelly Renee Gissendaner, who was convicted of killing her husband in February 1997, is scheduled to be executed on a date between February 25 and March 4, the attorney general's office announced yesterday.

The 46-year-old was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty for persuading her boyfriend to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner.

Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman of 84 inmates facing the death penalty in the state, figures showed from a report by Georgia's Department of Corrections last year.

She is set to be the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735, according to the AJC. 

In 1997, she was convicted of having her husband killed by her boyfriend Gregory Bruce Owen, her co-defendant who she was having an affair with at the time. 

She told his sister she was planning to separate from her husband, according to prosecutors.

Owen suggested that Gissendaner divorce her husband, but she instead said to kill him because she did not expect Douglas to leave her alone after they were separated.

Gissendaner's boyfriend followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends.

Owen kidnapped Douglas, drove him to a remote area, and killed him by stabbing him in the neck and back repeatedly and beat him with a nightstick. Douglas's car was also burned with kerosene, according to 11Alive.

They also stole his watch and wedding ring to make robbery look like the motive in his death.

She is Georgia's only female death row inmate and will be the first woman in seven decades to be put to death

Owen was sentenced to life in prison, instead of facing the death penalty, after he testified against Gissendaner.

In the state of Georgia, the last time a woman was executed occurred in 1945. 

Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder  for shooting her boss.

In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense.

Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping.
