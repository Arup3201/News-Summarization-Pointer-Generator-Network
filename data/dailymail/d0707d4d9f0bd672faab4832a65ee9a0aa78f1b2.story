The parents of an ill teenage girl caught in the midst of a custody battle with doctors in Massachusetts won a small victory after a judge decided that their daughter should receive care from her original team of physicians.

Juvenile Court Judge Joseph Johnston ruled on Monday that Justina Pelletier, 15, should be under the care of physicians from Tufts Medical Center, who had been previously treating the girl forMitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness. The judge also lifted a gag order imposed on the girl's parents and doctors last year.

For over a year, parents Lou and Linda Pelletier have been fighting with Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts of Department of Children and Families, who in February 2013 took over custody of Justina when she was admitted for flu.

Justina Pelletier, 15, will now get treatment from Tufts Medical Center physicians, which is what her parents have been fighting for over a year

Boston Children's physicians said the teen was not suffering from Mitochondrial Disease but instead had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental 
illness where people 'imagine they are ill'.

The Pelletiers challenged that diagnosis, asking that their daughter continue treatment with her doctors from Tufts.

Boston Children's Hospital resisted and the state took custody of the girl, moving her to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013. She has remained in state care since.

'This is a victory, but the battle is long from being over,' her father, Lou Pelletier, told ABCNews this week.

'The [Department of Children and Families] is still in charge, Justina 
is still in a psychiatric residential facility and the child abuse 
charges have not gone away.'

Miss Pelletier is currently being treated at Wayside Youth & Family Support Network in Framingham, Massachusetts, far from where her parents live in West Hartford, Connecticut.

Her parents are still trying to regain custody of her and have her treated close to home in Connecticut.

A judge's decision last week to place Miss Pelletier in foster care and not be returned to her family caused her mother Linda to faint at a Boston courthouse. The 56-year-old, who is diabetic, was stretchered out and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital.

Linda Pelletier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital last week, accompanied by her daughter Jennifer, after she collapsed on finding out that her sick daughter Justina will remain in foster care

Speaking from her Connecticut home following her collapse, Linda Pelletier told MailOnline that doctors said her blackout 
was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter's
 ordeal, which the mother described as 'evil'.

Mrs Pelletier said: 'I ask my husband every day, ''Are they trying to kill her?'''

Mrs Pelletier, who has three other daughters and cares for her 93-year-old mother at home, told MailOnline last week: 'I have had no medical updates about my child. She is deteriorating - she can't stand, sit, she has chronic pain.

'When I saw her [recently], her stomach was distended, she didn't feel well. But nobody helps her.'

Massachusetts Department of Children and Families said in a statement: 'The Department of Children and Families does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody. Additionally, the Court has maintained a gag order in this case, prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it.'

Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Miss Pelletier is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases.

Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was admitted to hospital a year ago. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie (right)

Mrs Pelletier said last week that she has no faith in the justice system since her daughter was taken from her family, calling the court hearings a 'joke'. 

However the mother-of-four said her family was now being helped by several lawyers and organizations. She said: 'I'm so grateful, they have given me hope. I feel like God has finally listened.'

Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly'
