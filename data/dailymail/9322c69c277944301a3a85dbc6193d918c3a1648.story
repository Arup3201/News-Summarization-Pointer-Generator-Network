Teenage Briton Adam Peaty, competing at his second major international event, broke the 50 metres breaststroke world record in the European championships semi-finals on Friday.

The 19-year-old, who won gold medals in Berlin in the 100m breaststroke and the 4x100 mixed medley, clocked a time of 26.62 seconds.

The Englishman's effort eclipsed the previous record of 26.67 seconds set by South African Cameron van der Burgh in Rome in 2009.

Glory: Adam Peaty broke the 50m breaststroke world record during the European Championship semi-finals

Full flow: Peaty swam the distance in just 26.62 seconds to break a five-year-old record

'I feel absolutely amazing. I had to look at that scoreboard about five times before I knew I had broken it,' Peaty said.

'I haven't broken a world record before so I don't know how it feels. Hopefully, it will sink in by Saturday so I can get my head down and hopefully get a better performance out of myself in the final.

'It was not a perfect race due to my final touch so I can still improve tomorrow.'

Peaty also claimed two golds and a silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last month. 

On form: Peaty has already won a gold in the 100m breaststroke and in the 4x100m mixed medley so far
