An Australian comedian working for YouTube has staged an extravagant proposal which might just be up there with the best

Jehan Ratnatunga secretly flew back from Los Angeles to Melbourne and went all-out for his now fiance, incorporating all of Vishanti's favourite things into one huge song and dance proposal.

The proposal begins when one of Vish's friends shows her a video of her most-loved Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse recreating her favourite Bollywood song.

Comedian Jehan Ratnatunga proposed to his girlfriend in an extravagant performance inspired by all of her favourite things

Jehan learned to dance to form part of an epic Mickey Mouse troupe

Vish was initially led outside to sit in the driveway by Jehan in disguise

She's then told in the video to answer the doorbell, where she is met by a life-size Mickey Mouse who leads her out to the street and instructs her to sit down on a seat in the driveway.

From there, a troupe of Mickeys breaks out into a full-on medley of Michael Jackson and Beyonce songs, while Vish cries and laughs her way through the entire performance.

Jehan had been working for Youtube in California, but flew back in secret. He had also been taking dance lessons with The Secret Garden of Dance in Victoria, and recruited a whole heap of his friends and family to make the proposal happen.

She was then treated to song and dance medley of her most loved Michael Jackson, Will Smith and Beyonce songs

Vish spends the entire time laughing and crying at the spectacle

At the end of the performance Jehan removes his Mickey Mouse head, surprises Vish and leads her out into the middle of the street

The comedian then proposes to his now fiance, who through tears manages to say yes

The dance wraps up and all the Mickeys scatter except one, who takes his costume head off to reveal it's Jehan underneath.

He leads Vish out to the middle of the street to the tune of Hey There Delilah, gets down on one knee and proposes to his girlfriend.

The tears of happiness are so loud you don't hear Vish say 'yes', but it's pretty clear that's her response. Jehan then shouts 'She said yes!'.

Jehan is a successful comedian whose YouTube channel has over 100,00 subscribers, and the proposal video is already making its way around the world with almost 70,00 views.
