The pitch may have been artificial but there was nothing plastic about the performance.

This was a show of real character by Everton, fighting back from a goal down to plant one foot firmly in the last 16 of the Europa League. They even played the last half hour a man down after John Stones was sent off.

Romelu Lukaku led magnificently from the front with a hat-trick. The big Belgian striker has struggled to justify his £28million price tag from Chelsea last summer, but here he was almost unplayable. It was the perfect hat-trick — header, right foot, left foot — and his first since gatecrashing Sir Alex Ferguson’s farewell game, a potty 5-5 draw between West Bromwich and Manchester United at The Hawthorns two years ago.

‘When you want to describe Rom, he ticks every box as a striker,’ said manager Roberto Martinez. ‘He has the power, the control and the technical ability, it’s not normal for a big man like him. He’s a complete striker who can play with his back to the play or get in behind.’

The Everton boss was at pains to point out that this was a team performance, however, and he was right; one arguably even better than the victories home and away against Wolfsburg. Young Boys had won all seven European ties at the Stade de Suisse since reverting to an artificial surface after a 5-3 loss to Liverpool three years ago.

But they came up against an Everton team whose form in Europe has been in stark contrast to their struggles in the Premier League. Since qualifying for the knockout stage back in November, they had won only two of their 16 games in all competitions.

‘When you see us play we get back to the memories of last season — a real enjoyment, bravery and energy to what we do,’ added Martinez.

‘There’s no expectation or weight on our shoulders. I do feel that in the league this season we’ve felt a little bit cagey at times and we haven’t been able to express ourselves. The Europa League is completely different. It feels like a fresh competition, a fresh challenge.

‘It was a team performance. To come away and concede the first goal, it becomes a big mountain to climb, a real test of character. The response was incredible.’

Young Boys went ahead in the 10th minute when top-scorer Guillaume Hoarau, once coveted by former Everton boss David Moyes, scooped a shot just inside the post with Tim Howard well beaten. Everton continued to press, however, and stunned the Swiss with two goals in four minutes. Both were the result of crosses from the left. Gareth Barry sent over the first, picking out Lukaku who made no mistake as he guided a header past goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo.

Then in the 28th minute, Steven Naismith drifted back from what looked like an offside position and drilled the ball to the far post where Seamus Coleman was waiting to poke in. And Everton took a real grip on the tie when Lukaku claimed his second goal and their third six minutes before half-time.

Again it was fashioned on the left, and again it came from Barry, whose low cross was deflected into the path of the Belgian who could hardly miss from a couple of yards out.

There was still plenty of work left to do, however, and Sekou Sanogo Junior rifled a shot against the foot of the post before Lukaku completed his hat-trick.

The striker showed great pace to race away on to Ross Barkley’s through ball, and then real class to dink the ball over Mvogo as he raced out to try to smother.

Everton were reduced to 10 men two minutes later when Stones was shown a straight red card for bringing down Hoarau, who spooned the resulting penalty horribly over the bar. It might have made little difference, but Everton’s passage should be even more comfortable when the two teams meet again at Goodison Park next week.
