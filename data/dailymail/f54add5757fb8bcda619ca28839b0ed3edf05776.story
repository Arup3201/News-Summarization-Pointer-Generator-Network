Just days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was reported to have removed his powerful uncle from office, his relative has now been 'air brushed' out of a TV propaganda documentary.

Reports suggest Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, had been made made to 'disappear' from a repeat of a documentary featuring Kim which has been shown at least nine times on state television.

Marked man: People watch a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, and Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. But the Jang has disappeared from more recent showings

Jang Song Thaek is part of an aging cabal which surrounded Kim Jong-Un's father Kim Jong-Il

Kim Jong-Un was the star of the hour-long show, but in the most 
recent broadcast Jang had been removed or hidden in 13 scenes, the South 
Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported today.

According to viewers inside North Korea a recent showing had Jang was either edited out of scenes entirely or manipulated so that his face was out of focus.

The vanishing of Jang from the documentary is seen by North Korean watchers as proof that he has fallen out of favour with his 32-year-old nephew.

It had already been suggested Jang was removed from his number two position in the secretive country after one of his aides defected to South Korea, to the fury of the young leader.Â 

Jang's removal has also been seen as an 
indication that Kim is ready to change the aging cabal who stood close 
to his father and replacing them with younger faces.

The pair are rumoured to have fallen out after one of Jang's closest aides defected to South Korea

Jang, who is married to Kim's aunt - the daughter of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il-Sung - is believed to have helped Kim establish his grip on power in the past two years since he took over from his late father Kim Jong-Il.

His apparent fall from grace could mean he has lost his high-level titles, including that of vice chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission and membership of the ruling Workers' Party politiburo.

While he has apparently been made to 'disappear', analysts in the South Korean capital, Seoul, believe he has not met the same fate as a number of other aides, including two of his own - execution by firing squad.
