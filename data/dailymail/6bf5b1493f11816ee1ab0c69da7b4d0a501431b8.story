A man who casually spat his chewing gum on to the pavement has been ordered to pay £845 for littering the streets

Niklas Kotlar, 26, ignored an on-the-spot-fine imposed by a litter patrol officer who caught him spitting out his gum.

He was told he could pay a £50 on-the-spot fine or argue his case in court before magistrates.

But when he failed to turn up at court on the appointed date Kotlar was hit with a £600 fine and ordered to pay £245 in costs.

Councils say the cost of cleaning chewing gum from the pavements and roads costs around £150m a year 

He is the latest person to be hit with a big fine as councils across the UK get tough on people who casually discard rubbish on the streets.

Fixed penalty notices are regularly handed out to those people who throw away sweet papers, fast food wrappers and cigarette butts in the street.

But chewing gum has become the scourge of councils because it is so difficult to remove and local authorities have to bring in specialist cleaning equipment to vaporise it from the pavements. 

Councils say the annual cost of removing it from the pavements, roads and street furniture across the UK is around £150m a year and rising.

It has become such a widespread menace that a Chewing Gum Action Group (CGAG) has been formed with the backing of major chewing gum producers.

It has the support of Defra, the Keep Britain Tidy campaign, the Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Wastes Management.

Councils are cracking down on chewing gum 

It was set up with the purpose of delivering a long-term solution to the ‘irresponsible disposal of chewing gum’ and runs tailor-made campaigns across Britain.

Earlier this month the Queen advertised for a Royal chewing gum remover to keep her palaces and residences free of the sticky stuff.

An official advert for a cleaner at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh states the successful applicant must ‘arrange for the removal of chewing gum from Historic and State Apartments’.

The £16,000-per-year job listed on the British Monarchy website will require the staff member to pick sticky gum off furniture for four hours a day.

Bolton Council is the latest local authority to get tough on litterbugs with an anti-litter campaign that netted a handful of offenders.

Two other people were prosecuted at the same court for dropping cigarette butts and another for throwing a receipt on to the ground.

Marwan Alsamdai,19, pleaded guilty to dropping a cigarette outside Bolton College on May 20 but became aggressive with enforcement officers, swore, and left without accepting the fixed penalty notice. He was fined £400 landed with court costs of £240.

Jackaleen Howcroft, 17, dropped a cigarette butt in the town centre in February 6, did not pick it up, refused to pay the £50 fine and was hit with a fine for £600 and £260 court costs..

Andras Karaszi, 18, dropped a till receipt and was given a fixed penalty notice for littering. But he failed to pay the original fine and did not appear in court. He was handed £600 fine by magistrates and ordered to pay £334 in court costs.

Cllr Nick Peel, of Bolton Council, said: ‘All of them could have paid the fixed penalty notice of £50 if they had paid it within 10 days. Why they did not pay it I don’t know.

‘If you are caught throwing rubbish on the ground, you will be prosecuted. We are pleased the court is backing the council in taking a robust view on this sort of behaviour.’
