The awards season is upon us and personally I think it’s a toss up for Best Actor between Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything , Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game and Luis Suarez as Count Dracula in The Diving Game.

Somehow, even though there is plenty of video footage of Luis the Lip going down more easily than Linda Lovelace in Deep Throat , Senor Suarez is not on the list of Oscar nominations just announced in Hollywood.

Nevertheless he gets this column’s gong for his role as a simulator, holding off challenges in the second half of 2014 from several men he left behind in the Premier League, including such unlikely candidates as defenders Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill.

A mock-up of how Barcelona striker Luis Suarez may look accepting an Academy Award

Suarez had an eventful 2014, nearly winning the title with Liverpool before being banned for biting in the World Cup and finally sealing a multi-million pound move to Barcelona

Suarez clutches at his incisors after biting the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder at the World Cup

Suarez clashes with Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic after sinking his teeth into the Serb in 2013

Scandal Of The Year goes to the preposterous loan system which allows major clubs to abuse the original intention of reserve players and small teams helping each other.

Thus we have seen two innocent footballers dragged into the mire, unwittingly no matter how much it may suit their pocket and purposes in the end. 

In yet another example of the ills of multi-club ownership, which is supposed to be banned, Frank Lampard finds himself on the bench for Manchester City for at least the rest of this season when he thought he had signed to play for City’s subsidiary in New York.

On the red side of Manchester one Radamel Falcao, who was led to believe that United intended to make his transfer permanent when they borrowed him from Monaco, now discovers he is a loan of convenience at Old Trafford, not primed as a £45 million purchase.

Frank Lampard is top billing in New York City, but the arrival of the midfielder has been somewhat delayed

Lampard moved to Manchester City, via New York City FC, where he will stay until the end of the season

Radamel Falcao has been used sparingly by Louis van Gaal and the Colombian looks set to leave United
