Soap star Barbara Windsor could join an exclusive group of public figures immortalised at the National Portrait Gallery.

The Duchess of Cambridge and Sir Mick Jagger are among those whose portraits hang at the London exhibition space.

The subjects of the portraits are traditionally chosen by the gallery’s trustees.

But now for the first time  BBC viewers will select whose portrait will be hung from a closely guarded short-list that includes EastEnders star Windsor, Doreen Lawrence – mother of murdered teenager Stephen – and Monty Python’s Michael Palin.

BBC1 programme The One Show will unveil the final short-list of public figures later this month and viewers will be able to vote for their choice by telephone.

Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ‘Adding a new portrait to British history, as seen in the National Portrait Gallery, is an exciting prospect – and we are delighted to share the process through collaboration with the BBC.’

It is understood the winning subject will be painted by Nicola Phillips, whose double portrait  of Princes William and Harry was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in 2010.

Michael Palin is also on the BBC shortlist to hang on the hallowed walls of the gallery
