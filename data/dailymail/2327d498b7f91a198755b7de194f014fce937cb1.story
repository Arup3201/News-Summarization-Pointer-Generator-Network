A local fire and rescue volunteer in Oregon who rushed to save seven people from a raging duplex fire last week is now fighting for his own life after sustaining critical injuries in the blaze.

As a massive fire engulfed his Southeast Portland duplex on Wednesday morning John Zeller, 36, woke and selflessly hurried everyone out of the flames uninjured before becoming hospitalized for second-degree burns.

'John was screaming at everyone to get up, there's a fire. Half the garage was engulfed,' his sister Theresa Zeller emotionally recounted to KTVB.

Call to action: Mr Zeller is a volunteer with the Clackamas County Search and Rescue and sprung into action when this Portland duplex caught fire early Wednesday morning

Mr Zeller, a volunteer with the Clackamas County Search and Rescue, saved five family members and two neighbors that early Wednesday morning.

Today he rests in an induced coma at the Oregon Burn Center with a ventilator serving as his lungs that are otherwise severely charred from the flames.

'I didn't realize how bad it was because he was just so strong running through there, like there was nothing wrong with him,' Ms Zeller said.

'I keep seeing his eyes, his face, the fear,' she says while citing her and her other family members' safety for that described frightened look in his eyes.

Selfless act: Mr Zeller was the only one to sustain injuries that morning having successfully woken and alerted everyone else inside

Brother: Among those who visited Mr Zeller's bedside was his twin brother, Jeremy Zeller, who says he last saw his brother 17 years ago after embarking on tours of duty with the Navy

Among those seen emotionally leaning at his bedside this week was Mr Zeller's twin brother, Jeremy Zeller, who says he last saw his brother 17-years ago after embarking on tours of duty with the Navy.

'What if something happens, a turn for the worst and I waited all these years?' Jeremy Zeller lamented to KTVB. 'It's constant regret. It wasn't the reunion I wanted, but it was really nice being in the same room with him again.â€™

Portland Fire and Rescue spokesman Lt. Rich Chatman tells Oregon Live that firefighters initially received calls of a tree on fire in the duplex's front yard that spread to the building.

An investigation is underway into what may have started the fire.
