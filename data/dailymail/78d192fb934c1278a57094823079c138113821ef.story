In the dock: A saliva stain on the T-shirt of the victim of a fight allegedly involving N-Dubz rapper Dappy has a 'billion-to-one' DNA link to the singer, a court has heard. Dappy is pictured arriving at Guildford Crown Court this morning

Saliva linked to N-Dubz rapper Dappy was found on the T-shirt of the alleged victim of a mass brawl, a court heard today.

Guildford Crown Court was told that Dappy sparked a 'mob attack' when he spat at two girls who refused to get into a car with him and two friends at a petrol station in the early hours of the morning.

The spit missed the girls but he then spat at another person, David Jenkins, who had stood up to defend them before becoming subject to an attack.

Dappy, charged under his real name of Costadinos Contostavlos, swung a punch at him before Mr Jenkins put the rapper in a headlock, the trial was told.

Forensic scientist Carolyn Smith told the court that saliva linked to Dappy was detected on Mr Jenkins’ T-shirt.

She said: 'We estimated the probability of getting this DNA profile from another person who was unrelated to Mr Contostavlos as one in a billion.'

Paul Greaney, defending Dappy, asked Ms Smith if the saliva could have been wiped on to the T-shirt sleeve as a result of the headlock.

She replied: 'It could have been that way, there are numerous options.'

Brian Stork, prosecuting, told the jury that Dappy, 25, pulled up in a car at the Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey at about 3.30am on February 28 last year.

He and a friend, Kalonji Stewart, got out of the car along with a third man.

While Stewart went inside the shop Dappy began talking to the girls, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, who were in a group sitting on the kerb outside.

Mr Stork alleged that Dappy tried to persuade the two girls to come with them in their car and when they refused he called the girls sluts, said one was ugly and then spat at them, but missed.

Mr Stork said that after Mr Jenkins was spat at, Dappy swung a punch at him and the violence 'kicked off'.

The incident then turned into a 'mob-handed, utterly unlawful and aggressive attack', according to Mr Stork.

Dappy was joined by two other men, Kieran Vassell and Alfred Miller, who had arrived in a second Mercedes car with other unidentified men.

Mr Stork showed the jury CCTV footage, lasting just moments, from the garage.

It showed the men attacking Mr Jenkins and his two other friends, resulting in damaged teeth to Mr Jenkins and a fractured nose to another man. They then all got into cars and drove off.

Miller and Vassell are alleged to have used their feet and fists in the attack and Dappy is alleged to have got involved when he was released from the headlock.

Stewart also got involved but less so, the prosecution claims.

Taxi driver Tahir Jaffrey told the jury that he pulled on to the forecourt and saw a group fighting.He described how he locked his car’s doors because he did not want him or his fare-paying passenger to become inadvertently involved.

He said: 'I do not want to see violence, I just called police when I saw it happen.

'I saw these three guys and all of a sudden people came out of their cars and began fighting.'I do not know how this fighting started. It was very quick what I saw.'

Mr Jaffrey cowered in his taxi 
after pulling into the forecourt of a Shell petrol garage.

Accused: Dappy has been charged under his real name of Costadinos Contostavlos

He
said: 'Three people came out from the shop. There were three cars in 
front of me and people turned up - they started fighting with these 
three guys.

Mr Jaffrey, who 
claimed that the row involved 12 to 13 people, added: “I saw three cars,
people turned up, got out from the cars and they were shouting. 

'There
were three other people, they came out from the shop and they were all 
shouting. I saw one guy hit someone and he fell down on the ground.'

Mr Jaffrey continued: 'He fell down on the floor and then I think I saw he hit him again when he was on the floor.'

Asked
by Mr Stork how the incident had made him feel, Mr Jaffrey described 
how 'aggressive' those brawling were and added: 'I did not feel good - I
didn’t feel good.

'I was in my car with my passenger. I just called the police straight away.

'I
was sitting in my car and I locked the car. People are fighting. My 
passenger was there when there was fighting - I did not want to unlock 
the car.'

Paul Greaney QC, for Dappy, used CCTV to challenge Mr Jaffrey’s claim that he had seen the violence kick-off.

Mr Jaffrey answered: 'I saw what I saw. I came and I saw these three guys.

'All of a sudden people came out of the car and then started fighting.'

He added that some of those involved 'zoomed off' shortly afterwards.

Mr
Jaffrey was also questioned about why he had not given a statement on 
the incident until May, and whether he could have confused what he had 
seen with a different row.

Stewart and Vassell both deny affray. Miller has admitted the offence and will be sentenced at a later date.

Dappy denies two counts of common assault on the two women, one of assault by beating, of Mr Jenkins, and one of affray.

He is charged alongside Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, west London, and Stewart, 32, of Harborne, Birmingham, who are each charged with affray.

Miller, 28, of Brentford, west London, has pleaded guilty to affray and his case was adjourned for sentence at the end of the trial.

Mr Stork said Dappy told police when he was arrested that he was attacked, put in a headlock, his security came to help him and he then got straight into a car.

He denies spitting at anyone and said he cannot understand how his saliva came to be on Mr Jenkins’ shirt.

The other men made prepared statements to officers and then gave 'no comment' interviews.The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
