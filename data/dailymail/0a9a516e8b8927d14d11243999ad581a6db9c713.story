Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney enjoyed a night out with friends at a gay police ball after receiving a standing ovation for her tearful speech at the Ukip conference.

Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event at the Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone  on Saturday.

Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent.

Hundreds danced the night away at the Kent Gay Police Association Charity Ball which raised money for transgender organisation TGPals and the Bluebells Children’s Short Break Centre.

Alan Pughsley, the new Chief Constable of Kent, showed his support by attending the event which saw a cabaret performance from Lola Lasagne as well as a disco. 

Ms Maloney completed her look for the evening with black heels, layered gold necklace, black handbag  and understated make-up.

The twice-married 61-year-old, who underwent surgery in November last year to make her face appear more feminine, is almost two years  into her transition period to change gender.

As a boxing promoter she helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion. 

The longtime Ukip supporter was praised by Nigel Farage on Saturday as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'.

Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'.

She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide.

'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 

'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' 

The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading.

Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004.  At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. 

Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong.

'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise. 

'I had to come to terms with myself and accept that I was a transsexual. It is something I hid and something I fought.

'I wanted to transition very quietly, but unfortunately my transition is probably one of the most public events of 2014.'
