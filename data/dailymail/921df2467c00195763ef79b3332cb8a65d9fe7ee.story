A former party girl shed an incredible 5st 7lb in just eight months after overhearing a friend insulting her at a Christmas party. 

Caroline Gooster was left devastated when it was remarked that she would 'hoover up' any leftovers at a festive gathering - and decided to that at 16st 2lb  she needed to lose weight.

The now svelte 24-year-old admits her teenage lifestyle of binge drinking and takeaways caused her to balloon to a size 18.

Caroline has managed to drop from 16st 2lb (left) to a slim 10st 9lb (right) in just eight months 

On her first holiday abroad Caroline was too ashamed of her body to wear a swimsuit 

Despite trying fad diets, Caroline from Irvine, Ayrshire, couldn't stick to a regime for longer than two weeks and became even more miserable.

Even after her first foreign holiday where she covered up in sweltering 30 degree heat, it wasn't until she overheard the cruel 'joke' that she decided to act.

Caroline said: 'I heard one of my friends whisper "don't worry about the leftovers - Caroline will hoover them up".

'I was mortified - I nearly broke down in tears there and then.

'I knew I was big but didn't realise what other people thought of me - especially what I considered to be a friend.

'Ironically, that nasty comment gave me the motivation to start and continue losing weight.

'Whenever I lost motivation or wanted to eat a burger I'd say to myself "no, I'll show her" - and I did.'

At her heaviest, Caroline ate almost 4,000 calories a day getting through six rounds of white toast, two packets of crisps and snacking on cake and ice cream.

By ditching her party girl ways in favour of a healthy diet of fresh foods Caroline (left, before and right, after losing weight) has totally transformed her body and how she feels about herself

As a result, she reached a dress size 18 and became even more miserable, resorting to comfort eating.

When she went on her first holiday abroad in May 2013, Caroline dreaded what to wear and settled for covering up as much skin as possible.

She said: 'Whenever I did wear anything showing a bit of skin, I felt so uncomfortable like everyone was staring and laughing.

'When I got home I looked through the pictures and couldn't believe they were me.

Caroline (left before she lost weight and right, today) swapped dinners of macaroni, chips and garlic bread for chicken breasts, vegetables and sweet potatoes and discovered a love of running

'I knew I was big but I looked horrible.

'The main reason I'd gained so much weight was my teenage "party girl" years.

'Every weekend I'd go out, binge drink and wolf down takeaways - pizzas and burgers were my favourite.'

As soon as the New Year came, a determined Caroline bought a cross trainer and returned to a healthy eating regime.

But after a month of dieting, she started to get bored, but this time, instead of quitting, she signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan.

With the help of her consultant she swapped dinners of macaroni, chips and garlic bread for chicken breasts, vegetables and sweet potatoes.

In place of oil drenched packets of crisps and sweets for snacks, Caroline now grazes on apples and grapes.

Breakfast: 4 slice of white bread toasted with butter.

Morning snack: 1 or 2 packets of walkers crisps.

Lunch: Noodles and 2 slice toast with butter.

Afternoon snack: Handful of sweets e.g. Haribo etc.

Dinner: Macaroni, chips and garlic bread.

Pudding: Ice cream or cake or both

Breakfast: Porridge

Mid-morning snack: Apple

Lunch: Homemade butternut squash soup with wholemeal roll.

Afternoon snack: 130g of grapes.

Dinner: Chicken breast, sweet potato and veg.

Supper: One slice of wholemeal toast with low fat spread

A newly energised Caroline said: 'After my first week on Cambridge, I lost a massive 7lbs.

'I realised this was the diet for me and I just kept dropping 5lb or 3lb each week.

'Of course there were a few weekend slip-ups but with the help of my consultant I just picked my spirits up and carried on.

'Coupled with that I just remembered what my "friend" had said and that just spurred me on even more.

'At the start I was doing light exercise, but as I increased the amount of food I ate I started to introduce more.

'Now I'm fitter than ever and have found a sport I really love - running - which I never thought I'd say!'
