Traffic wardens have been fining drivers after a council mistakenly fitted a French ticket machine in a car park.

Motorists were baffled as to why they were unable to put English money in to the machine at the Ian Clough car park, in Baildon, West Yorkshire, and were being issued with tickets.

Bradford Council eventually slapped 'out of order' stickers across the machine, which was installed three months ago, as they struggled to work out what was wrong with it.

But on Friday it finally sprang into action when a motorist realised the machine was French and was configured to take Euros.

Council workmen have now removed the 'out of order' notices.

Two ward councillors Debbie Davies and Roger L'Amie were among those who had tried to use the machine at the car park.

'The pound coin simply would not fit in the slot,' said Ms Davies.

'There wasn't anything blocking it, it didn't go in and then fell out, the machine just couldn't take the pound.'

The machine has been adjusted and now takes British coins.

Councillor Davies added: 'After some 12 weeks of standing there doing nothing - the "out of order" signs have been removed and for the first time it's operational.Â 

'Suddenly my pound coin fitted perfectly and it issued me a timed and dated ticket. It's a miracle.'

Michaela Hall, assistant parking services co-ordinator for Bradford Council, said: 'The parking machines are configured for UK coins and our technician activated the new ticket machine.'
