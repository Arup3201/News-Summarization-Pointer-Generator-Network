The mother of murdered April Jones says she is 'disgusted' at reports that killer Mark Bridger has begged to move prisons because he is being picked on by other inmates. 

Bridger, 48, who is serving life for kidnapping 
and murdering the five-year-old girl, has complained of threats and 
mistreatment by fellow inmates at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

Last July he was attacked by another inmate, and he is said to be fearing for his life due to his treatment from his fellow criminals.

Victim: Father-of-six Bridger snatched five-year-old April near her home in Machynlleth, Wales in October 2012, Her body has never been found

However April’s mother Coral Jones says Bridger should see out his sentence at Wakefield, and should put up with the threats.

'He
 murdered a five-and-a-half year old girl, and he can’t take people 
saying things to him, and banging on his door,' said Mrs Jones.

'He’s killed a little girl. I think it’s disgusting that he can ask to be moved, just because he’s being threatened.

'I
 hope he’s threatened every day for the rest of his life. Every day I’m 
suffering - I’ve got a lifetime of hell to live through.

'He’s made me ill, I’ve lost so much weight and I’m still not feeling right. Him wanting to be moved is disgusting. He did the crime, now he’s got to do the time.' 

Father-of-six Bridger snatched April near
 her home in Machynlleth, Wales in October 2012 and was given a whole-life tariff by a 
judge in May 2013 at Mold Crown Court.

The five-year-old's body has never 
been found.

In July last 
year, Bridger was attacked and slashed across his face by Juvinai 
Ferreira, 22, an inmate who is serving a life sentence for murder.

He was said to have needed hospital treatment for a face wound, but was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched.

It has been reported that fellow criminals at HMP Wakefield are unhappy at Bridger’s bid to claim compensation for the assault.

He could be paid as much as £15,000 after he was slashed with a makeshift knife, while April's parents look set to receive just £11,000 in compensation for their daughter's death.

Bridger has reportedly asked to be moved to another prison - because he is allegedly being 'mistreated' by fellow inmates, and is said to be worried by the prospect of another attack.

A prison source said the father-of-six ‘moans continually’ about his situation, and has asked for papers to request a move.

If Wakefield governor, Susan Howard, finds reasons to support a move, she could contact other maximum security prisons like York’s Full Sutton or Frankland jail near Durham to see if they will take him, according to the Mirror.

But the paper’s source said Bridger would be a ‘marked man’ wherever he goes.

Machynlleth councillor Mike Williams added: 'I don’t advocate any form of violence, including the attack on Bridger, but I’m happy the full course of justice has taken place, and he should be prepared to stand his sentence.

'People don’t take kindly to child murderers.'

In January, Bridger abandoned an appeal against his sentence, 11 days before the hearing. He will die behind bars, after judges rejected a European ruling that no-parole terms breached human rights.

A prison service spokesman said the Ministry of Justice does not comment on how inmates move prisons for 'security reasons', and could not comment on Bridger reported wish to leave HMP Wakefield.

She added: 'We do not comment on individuals.'
