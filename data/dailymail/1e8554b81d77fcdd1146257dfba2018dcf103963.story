A Christian couple and their one-year-old son have been shot dead by Muslim gunmen in a 'religious attack' in Nigeria, police said today.

The family were in a village near the the city of Jos on Tuesday evening when the killers - believed to be Muslim herdsmen - opened fire.

Plateau state spokesman Pam Ayuba said today that assailants shot the Christian couple and their child near their home.

The attack just two days after Christmas is the latest in a spate of religious violence in the country.

In a separate attack, extremists threw a homemade bomb into an 
Arabic school in Nigeria's Delta state.

Seven people were wounded in the attack, including six children who were younger than nine.

The attack at around 10 p.m. on Tuesday 
came two days after a series of Christmas Day bombings on churches and 
other targets by Islamist militant group Boko Haram claimed around 32 
lives.

Boko Haram, which means 'Western education is forbidden', wants the imposition of strict Sharia law in Nigeria.

'Some men driving in a Camri car 
threw a low capacity explosive into a building where an Arabic class was
 taking place,' police spokesman for the state Charles Muka said by 
telephone.

'Children aged between four and nine were taking a lesson. Six children were injured and one adult (was),' he added.

Hundreds have died in recent years in 
communal attacks and reprisal attacks in the Jos area in the nation's 
'middle belt,' where the largely Muslim north meets the predominantly 
Christian south.

Around 90,000 people have so far been displaced during the clashes, according to the BBC.

Christians in northern Nigeria said 
yesterday they feared that a spate of Christmas Day bombings by Islamist
 militants could lead to a religious war in Africa's most populous 
country.

The attacks killed more than two dozen people.

The
 warning was made by the northern branch of the Christian Association of
 Nigeria (CAN), an umbrella organisation comprising various 
denominations including Catholics, Protestant and pentecostal churches.

The
 Boko Haram Islamist sect, which aims to impose sharia Islamic law 
across Nigeria, claimed responsibility for the blasts, the second 
Christmas in a row it has caused carnage at Christian churches.

Saidu Dogo, secretary general for CAN in Nigeria's 19 northern provinces called on Muslim leaders to control their faithful, saying Christians will be forced to defend themselves against further attacks.

'We fear that the situation may degenerate to a religious war and Nigeria may not be able to survive one. Once again, "enough is enough!",' Dogo said.

The attacks risk reviving tit-for-tat sectarian violence between the mostly Muslim north and the largely Christian south, which has claimed thousands of lives in the past decade.

Dogo said the CAN was calling on all Christians to continue respecting the law but to defend themselves when needed.

'We shall henceforth in the midst of these provocations and wanton destruction of innocent lives and property be compelled to make our own efforts and arrangements to protect the lives of innocent Christians and peace-loving citizens of this country,' Dogo said.

The most deadly attack killed at least 27 people in the St Theresa Catholic church in Madalla, a town on the edge of the capital Abuja, and devastated surrounding buildings and cars as faithful poured out of the church after Christmas mass.

Security forces also blamed the sect for two explosions in the north targeting their facilities. Officials have confirmed 32 people died in the wave of attacks across Nigeria, though local media have put the number higher.

But the church bombs are more worrying because they raise fears that Boko Haram is trying to ignite a sectarian civil war in the nearly 160million nation split evenly between Christians and Muslims, who for the most part co-exist in peace.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has come under pressure to do more fight the growing security threat which risks derailing economic gains in the OPEC member and Africa's top oil-producing nation.

Nigeria's main opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari, a northerner and former military ruler who lost a presidential election in April to Jonathan, accused the government of incompetence on Monday, saying government was slow to respond and had shown indifference to the bombings.

The CAN said in the statement that it was concerned that the perpetrators and their sponsors 'are well-known to government and no serious or decisive actions have been taken to stem their nefarious activities'.Â
