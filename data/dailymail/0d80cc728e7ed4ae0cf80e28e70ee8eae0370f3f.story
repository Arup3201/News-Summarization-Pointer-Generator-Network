A girl bullied so severely she developed selective mutism has overcome her fear of speaking by taking part in a beauty pageant.

Lucy Hammond, 12, was bullied at school and was almost completely unable to speak for three years.

But since entering Miss Junior Teen Great Britain last year she’s gradually regained her voice and will take to the catwalk and be interviewed by judges to in a bid to win the title.

Lucy, here in her school photograph, was so severely bullied she developed selective mutism - an anxiety disorder that stopped her talking almost totally

Lucy’s mother Liz said: 'We never thought that she’d come out of it

'But the pageant has given her a voice back.'

Lucy’s family noticed the change in her behaviour when she was just eight and she was so unhappy they thought she was physically ill.

Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder that prevents children speaking in certain social situations, such as school lessons or in public.

A child with selective mutism is not voluntarily refusing to speak but is literally unable to speak, feeling frozen.

In time, they may begin actively avoiding situations where they find it hard to speak.

Lucy, pictured here age 9, was almost completely unable to speak for three years, only uttering answers to questions from her mother and father

She was 
unable to talk to anyone, including her own grandparents, and uttered 
only answers to questions from her mother and father.

When
 her mutism became so severe she refused to return to school her mother 
Liz realised it was due to bullying and found a new school place Lucy.

But
 since her photos were accepted for the pageant and she was asked to 
represent the Coventry region her transformation has been incredible.

At
 the national finals in Blackpool on August 30, Lucy will be one of 30 
girls strutting the catwalk in fashion and evening wear rounds, 
dancing in a group and being interviewed by a panel of judges.

Lucy said: 'I wanted to do the pageant to give me more confidence in everyday life and that’s what happened.

'It’s been really great and I’ve got a really a lot more confident already.'

As
 part of her campaign to become Miss Junior Teen Great Britain Lucy has 
been organising fundraising events for Claire House Children’s Hospice.

Having changed school and entered Miss Junior Teen Great Britain, Lucy has managed to slowly overcome her selective mutism and has been organising fundraising events for Claire House Children’s Hospice

Liz said: 'When it first started, we didn’t know what was wrong for a year and we thought she was physically ill.

'She became more withdrawn and it was like she was different girl.

'Lucy wouldn’t even speak to her grandparents let alone a stranger.

'It’s been four very hard years but in the last year, ever since she entered the pageant and she was chosen to represent the region, the change has been remarkable.

'It’s a family atmosphere - there’s no throwing fake eyelashes and cat fighting behind the scenes.

'A lot of the girls are very similar to Lucy and have overcome something difficult too.

'It’s all just fun and giggles and we’re so grateful she’s found something to boost her confidence.'

Speaking to the MailOnline Professor David Messer from the Open University commented: 'The precise reasons for selective mutism are not fully understood as there are a range of circumstances associated with this condition. 

'It is important to bear in mind that there also are a range of events which can result in a child or young person regaining their speech.'

Selective mutism (SM) is relatively rare, affecting one in 150 children. Most primary schools will know of at least one child with SM.

It's more common in girls and children of ethnic minority populations, or in those who have recently migrated from their country of birth.

SM usually occurs in early childhood and is first noticed when the child begins to interact outside the family circle – for example, when they start nursery or school. It can last a few months but, if left untreated, can continue into adulthood.

Children with SM often have other fears and social anxieties and may have additional speech and language difficulties.

There is no evidence to suggest that children with SM are more likely to have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma than any other child. When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty. However, this type of speech withdrawal may lead to SM if the triggers are not addressed and the child develops a more general anxiety about communication.

Another common misconception is that a selectively mute child is controlling or manipulative, or that the child has autism. There is no relationship between SM and autism, although the two conditions can occur in the same child.

If left untreated, SM can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can persist into adolescence and even adulthood if not tackled.

With diagnosis at a young age and appropriate management, children can successfully overcome this disorder.

If you suspect your child has SM and help is not available, or if there are additional concerns, for example if your child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines, seek a formal diagnosis.
