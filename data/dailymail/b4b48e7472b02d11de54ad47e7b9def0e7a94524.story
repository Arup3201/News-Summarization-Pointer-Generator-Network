Sleek, stylish and boasting strong audio quality, the Jabra Revo Wireless Bluetooth headphones are something of a complete package.

And even though the hefty £199 price tag may put some people off, there’s no hiding their build quality. Take the shatterproof headband, featuring aluminum hooks and foldable cups. Or the touch-sensitive controls on the right cup that let you pause and play audio by tapping the centre.

Goodbye wires: Earlier wireless headsets suffered from a noticeable dip 
in audio quality compared to their wired counterparts, but these 
headphones are a shining example of just how far technology has come

This latter feature is slightly fiddly to start with, although more refined than, say, the Parrot Zik wireless headphones.

On the left cup is a 3.5mm headphone connector and NFC zone, which lets you sync to a mobile device. 

There are no issues with syncing – the process managed by a simple ‘on/off’ switch and charging is easy, too, via a smart-looking micro USB cable. The impressive packaging – so often the weakest link in high-end headphones – even contains a carry case.

Thankfully, audio echoes overall build quality. The 40mm dynamic speakers pack some hefty low-end thump, with minimal distortion. Pitches take a slight hit - sounding slightly muffled, but are still able to cut through and overall sound-stage is impressive.

By downloading the Jabra Sound app, this gives you access to Dolby Digital Plus, which offers even better performance. It also gives you 17 equaliser presets for different music genres.Noise insulation is strong but when tested outside some wind noise can intrude.

A system called Noise Blackout helps to minimise this when making a call using the in-built microphone.

Topped off with a remarkable 240-hour battery life in standby and 12 hours of wireless output between charges, and these headphones become pretty irresistible.
