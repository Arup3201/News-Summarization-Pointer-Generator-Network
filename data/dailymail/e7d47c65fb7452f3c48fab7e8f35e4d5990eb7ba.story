Former West Midlands Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire, 46, appeared before magistrates today charged with money laundering and misconduct in public office

A former Ukip MEP has appeared before magistrates accused of a money laundering offence after a police inquiry into her travel expenses.

Nikki Sinclaire, 45, who lost her seat in the European Parliament earlier this year, also faces a charge of committing misconduct in a public office.

Sinclaire, of Shirley, Solihull, spoke only to confirm her full name, address and date of birth during a three-minute hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.

The former MEP, whose lawyer said she strongly denied the allegations, was not required to enter a formal plea to either of the charges. 

The money laundering charge, brought under the Proceeds of Crime Act, alleges that she converted criminal property between October 2009 and December 2010.

The misconduct in public office charge relates to allegations that Sinclaire submitted false and dishonest claims for travelling expenses in the same period.  

Dressed in black trousers, a blue scarf and a dark jacket, Sinclaire was given unconditional bail to appear before a judge at Birmingham Crown Court on January 7.

The ex-MEP has previously described the allegations as 'ludicrous' and unfounded.

In a statement issued in July, Sinclaire said she would be firmly defending herself against the charges, which related to a time when she was 'under the guidance and oversight' of Ukip. 

Sinclaire lost her seat at May's European elections after leaving UKIP and standing for the We Demand A Referendum Now party.

She was charged in July this year after a two-and-a-half-year inquiry by West Midlands Police and the European Anti-Fraud Office. 

In a statement issued as she left the court, Sinclaire described the proceedings as 'a complete waste of taxpayers' money'.

She added: 'The people of the West Midlands who are watching this will know from the work I did over five years that I was hard-working.

“I completely refute these charges and I'm confident of being found innocent.' 

On bail: Sinclaire, who lost her seat in May's European elections, has said she will 'firmly defend' herself
