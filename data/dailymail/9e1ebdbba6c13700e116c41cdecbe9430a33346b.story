Wife number four: George Galloway outside his London home with new wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi

Politician George Galloway married for the fourth time yesterday - but it was not long before the father of his third wife accused the MP of being a 'bigamist'.

The 58-year-old tied the knot with Dutch-born consultant Putri Gayatri Pertiwi - who is 31 years his junior - in a civil ceremony at the Houses of Parliament on Saturday.

But the father of Mr Galloway's third wife, Rima, declared he was in fact still married to his daughter.

'Rima is still legally his wife according to Muslim law, which British law does not accept. He has committed bigamy,' Haschem Husseini told The Sun.

A spokesman for Mr Galloway confirmed the couple married yesterday and vehemently denied the MP had committed bigamy.

When asked about the accusation that the Bradford West MP is still married, his spokesman replied: 'Are you suggesting he is a bigamist? I having nothing more to say, whatsoever.'

The Respect leader's first marriage was to his childhood sweetheart Elaine, in 1979. The couple were married until 1987 and had two children together.

He next tied the knot to Palestinian Dr Amineh Abu-Zayyad in 1994 in a Muslim ceremony, and in 2007 he married Lebanese-born Rima. They have a four-year-old son Zain, and a second son, Faris, who was born at the beginning of this year.

In April, Rima launched a bitter verbal assault when it was announced that Mr Galloway had gone through a ceremony with Putri, 27, in Amsterdam.

At that time, the Lebanese 
researcher said: ‘We are still married under Islamic law. There is a 
misconception you can have up to four wives in Islam – but it’s just not
 true in the 21st Century.

‘It may have been the case hundreds 
of years ago as a way of looking after women in the villages who had 
lost their husbands, but it doesn’t exist now.

‘It’s just a stupid, man-made thing in some Arab countries. It’s not true. Under Islamic law we remain married.’

The new Mr and Mrs Galloway will continue to live in the £1.4million home they share in Streatham, South 
London.
