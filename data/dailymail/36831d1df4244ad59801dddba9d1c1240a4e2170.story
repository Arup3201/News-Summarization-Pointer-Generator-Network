This is the moment a ‘reckless’ motorcyclist tore along a suburban street at 92mph in a 30mph zone.

Michael Lambert has been banned from driving after camera footage caught him speeding through the village of Seghill in Northumberland at more than three times the limit.

The images show the 32-year-old crouched over the front of his bike in a racing style, without number plates, when he was clocked on the A190.

Residents living in the village of Seghill, Northumberland, have described the incident as 'disgraceful'

Police were forced to use other CCTV footage in the area to track Lambert down following the incident, which has been described as ‘disgraceful’ by residents.

Police motor patrols chief inspector, Julian Bowran, said: ‘At 90mph he was doing more than three times the legal limit and his actions were reckless, foolish and could have been disastrous. 

‘A collision at that speed could have killed or seriously injured him or other road users.’

He added: ‘A speed camera caught Lambert on the A190 in Seghill and although we didn’t have his licence plate, motor patrols officers carried out inquiries, including checking CCTV footage in the area, and were able to identify him as the rider.’

Jim Clough, 82, who runs community groups for young and elderly residents in the village, said: ‘It’s just disgraceful going that fast. It’s very, very worrying.’

Resident Elsie Harvey, 76, of Seghill Community Association, added: ‘It could have been disastrous.’

Lambert, of Airedale, Wallsend, admitted dangerous driving following the incident on September 3 when he appeared at South East Northumberland Magistrates’ Court.

He was given a 10 week jail sentence suspended for a year and ordered to serve 180 hours community work and pay £500 in costs and a £80 victim surcharge.

Magistrates revoked his licence and banned him from the roads for 15 months, when he will have to re-sit his driving test.

Chief Insp Bowron added: 'These actions are that of one irresponsible and dangerous motorcyclist and we recognise he does not represent bikers as a community.

'The majority of bikers are safe and sensible, they know how vulnerable they are on a motorbike and how important it is that they ride safely and defensively.

'This case should send a message out to dangerous drivers and riders that dangerous driving will not be tolerated.'

Police in Tyneside recently launched Operation Dragoon to crackdown on dangerous driving and make the area’s roads safer.
