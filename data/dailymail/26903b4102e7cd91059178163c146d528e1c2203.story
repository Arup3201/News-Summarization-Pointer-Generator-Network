You might not be able to plan ahead to reach the venue of the annual Diner en Blanc but at least you'll always know what to wear.

Guests invited to the fine dining experience must only wear white and eat at tables adorned with table cloths and flowers in the same shade.

The dinner in white has taken place in Paris for the past half a century but the exact location is a closely guarded secret until the day. This year's guests, who attended the 26th function last night, were told an hour before that they should gather on six bridges across the French captial, including the Passerelle Debilly at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and Pont de l'Alma.

Fine dining flash mob: Guests at the annual Diner En Blanc in Paris

All white: The revellers must all dress in the shade

Surprise! People eating their dinner at the Invalides - they are only told of the venue an hour before

Lunch at a landmark: The golden dome of Les Invalides provides a beautiful backdrop for the diners

Champagne all round: Some ate on the Pont Alexandre III in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower  

Others were told to set up in front of Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is kept.

Thousands turned out smartly-dressed from top to toe in white for the occasion, which raises money for cancer research.

Although always in Paris, the event is held at a different location in the city every time. Last year, nearly revellers dined in the outdoor courtyard of the Louvre and at the Trocadero, while in 2012 the event took place at Place des Vosges and in front of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.

The tradition began in 1988 when a group of ten friends decided they wanted to eat at a forbidden spot in the city.

They ended up dining as a 200 strong flash mob at the Jardins de Bagatelle, once a favourite spot of French royalty including Marie Antoinette.

Since then the event has gone global with versions of the dinner taking place in European cities such as Milan and Barcelona and much further afield in more than a dozen locations in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and even Rwanda and the Ivory Coast.

The craze finally made the short journey from its Paris home across the Channel to London in 2012 when thousands of diners converged on the South Piazza of Covent Garden.

But the Paris version remains the tradition's definitive one. Each year the guest list exceeds 15,000 say organisers and past dinners have taken place at such illustrious settings as the Pont des Arts, the grounds of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles.

Those on the guest list will have either attended the previous year's event or been invited by someone who did.

Everyone who is invited must bring a guest and arrive by public transport.

Guests must bring a picnic table, a picnic basket, foldable cheers and a table cloth - all in white of course.

Men and women sit on opposite sides of the table to one another and guests are forbidden to sit down until their entire row have set up their table.

They must only drink wine and champagne and must leave before midnight as discreetly they arrived, taking all their rubbish with them to leave no trace of the event.
