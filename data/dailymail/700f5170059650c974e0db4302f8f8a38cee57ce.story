An Indian court has sentenced three men to death and a fourth to life in prison for the brutal gang rape of a photojournalist.

The quartet subjected their victim to the attack inside an abandoned textile mill in the financial hub of Mumbai last year.

Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison.

One of the four men sentenced for gang raping a photojournalist in Mumbai last year. Three men were condemned to death and a fourth was sentenced to life in prison

He
 said he pushed for the death sentence under a strict anti-rape law 
introduced in response to public outrage over a fatal gang rape in New 
Delhi in 2012.

'This is the first case in India in which the death penalty has been given to convicts while the victim is alive,' he said.

The
 three men were found guilty last month of raping a call-center operator
 at the same abandoned mill in July 2013, a month before the attack on 
the photojournalist.

Nikam described the three as habitual offenders.

Judge
 Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi said the offence was 'diabolical in nature and
 the punishment would send a strong message to society'.

India
 increased penalties for sex crimes and moved rape trials faster through
 its notoriously slow justice system after a 23-year-old medical student
 was gang raped on a moving bus in the capital and later died.

Four
 men were sentenced to death in the New Delhi case. The trials in the 
New Delhi and Mumbai cases were completed within seven months.

The four men convicted in the Mumbai case can appeal the death sentence in an appeals court in the next three months.

The sentencing came on Friday, as 24 men were sent to prison for raping a teenager who was abducted in Kerala state in 1996.

A court had acquitted all but one defendant in 2005, but India's top court ordered a retrial last year.

It was completed in six months, prosecutor Anella George said.

One man was sentenced to life in prison and 23 others to 7 to 11 years, George said.

The 16-year-old victim was abducted and raped in homes, hotels, cars and public buses over one and a half months.

The men convicted in Ernakulam town included a retired professor, lawyers, businessmen and government officials.
