Britain's biggest baked bean fan is having 60 images of his favourite food tattooed on his head.

Barry Kirk, 59, who officially changed his name to Captain Beany, is getting the ink to mark his 60th birthday next month and hopes the act will raise more than £3,000 to help a three-year-old girl with cerebral palsy.

Mr Kirk walks through his hometown of Port Talbot, South Wales, dressed in a bright orange costume, has transformed his house into a 'Baked Bean Museum of Excellence' - and even ran for Parliament as Captain Beany.

Fundraising: Mr Kirk, pictured right in his Captain Beany costume, has asked people to sponsor £60 for each one of the 60 beans he will have tattooed on his head to help Marlie-Grace Roberts, pictured left

Planning it out: Mr Barry and tattoo artist Craig Jenkins plan out his new ink. He hopes to raise more than £3,000 to help Marlie-Grace Roberts, pictured with her grandparents, who was born with cerebral palsy

His love of the food started in 1986 when he spent 100 hours sat in a bathtub filled with baked beans for charity.

Now Mr Kirk is appealing for people to donate £60 for each one of the 60 beans he will have tattooed when he turns 60 on 23 September.

He hopes the drive will raise more than £3,000 to help a three-year-old girl with cerebral palsy walk unaided.

Mr Kirk said: 'Having the bean tattoos is just another step in my lifelong love of the baked bean.

'It all began way back in 1986, when I spent 100 hours sitting in a bathtub of beans for charity.

'I thought I could adopt a superhero persona like Batman or Superman and live out my passions in real life. So I became Captain Beany and even stood for Parliament.

'Now everywhere I go people can see that I am full of beans - with the tattoo on my head.'

'Crazy idea': Marlie-Grace's grandparents said that Mr Kirk has been 'amazing' and 'so supportive' since they launched the appeal to raise money for their three-year-old granddaughter

Mr Kirk, of Port Talbot, South Wales, aims to raise more than £3,000 for an operation to help Marlie-Grace Roberts, three, walk unaided after she was born with cerebral palsy.

Marlie-Grace's grandparents have bought a pair of Barry's tattoo baked beans to become the first 'beanyfactors'.

When Mr Kirk is not busy being Captain Beany and curating his Baked Bean Museum of Excellence, he works as an impersonator of U2's Bono.

Tattooist Ash Robinson said: 'My first thought when he came and told us what he wanted to do, was: "Oh My Goodness".

Mrs Roberts, Marlie-Grace's grandmother, said: 'Barry came to us to tell us about the crazy idea and we decided to support it.

'Barry has been amazing and so supportive since we launched our appeal.  We now regard him as a part of our family. He is a truly amazing man.'
