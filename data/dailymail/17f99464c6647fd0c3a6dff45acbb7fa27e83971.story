Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, died after she was stabbed at least four times in the neck in an attack in Tottenham, north London

A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a community nurse in Tottenham, north London.

Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, was repeatedly stabbed in the neck in an attack on Wednesday afternoon.

Dariusz Miakienko, 46, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham appeared before Highbury Corner Magistrates today charged with the stabbing.

Miakienko appeared in the dock wearing a long grey t-shirt and spoke only to confirm his name through a Belarusian interpreter.

Deputy District Judge Kevin Gladwell told Miakienko: 'Because of the nature of the offence, I transfer the case to the Central Criminal Court. You will make your first appearance, in custody on Monday.'

Ms Turner, described by colleagues as a 'lovely, lovely lady’, was leaving her Castle View Surgery work place on Wednesday when the attack happened.

Witnesses at the scene said they saw a man standing over her body rolling up a cigarette as she lay dying on the floor.

It is believed Ms Turner was heading home to the terrace house in Fulham, west London she shares with her husband William, 61, and two sons, aged 22 and 19, when the stabbing took place.

Bruce Grove in Tottenham was cordoned off yesterday while a police team combed the street for potential evidence

A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mrs Turner ‘doted’ on the couple’s sons.

They added: ‘She just loved her family to pieces. They’re upstanding members of the community. It’s a massive shock. She was such a gentle woman. She’s an angel.’

She said of Mrs Turner’s husband: ‘He is shell-shocked. It is just so raw. He’s not sleeping.’

Witnesses at the scene of the attack told of their horror after Ms Turner was approached and stabbed in broad daylight.

One of Ms Turner's colleagues, Dr 
Fariba Azarian, said Ms Turner's workmates had been left 'shocked and 
distraught' by her death.

She added: 'She was an absolutely lovely, lovely lady. One of the most professional and caring people that I have seen.

Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen the attack to come forward

Witnesses at the scene of the stabbing said they were left shocked by the violence, which unfolded in broad daylight

'She was somebody who would go out of her way to help people and patients. She was very, very kind.’

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, who is leading the murder investigation, said: ‘Mrs Turner was a hard-working mother of two boys.

‘I would like to directly appeal to anyone who may have captured images or footage before and after the incident to contact us immediately.

'In particular we would like to speak to a black male who was wearing a white tracksuit top who witnesses saw taking images at the scene.

‘I would appeal to him or anyone else to contact us with the footage or images they took as a matter  of urgency, and not to upload them to the internet or share them with friends as it may harm our investigation.'
