Gareth Bale has been included in the Wales squad to face Belgium in their Euro 2016 qualifier next weekend despite the forward's recent injury absence.

The most expensive footballer of all time made his return for Real Madrid for the final 30 minutes of their Champions League victory over Liverpool on Tuesday night having missed their previous five matches with a buttock muscle injury he picked up in Wales' victory over Cyrpus last month.

But he is named in a strong Welsh squad ahead of next Sunday's clash in Brussels along with midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen who make welcome returns after injury but there is no place for the suspended Andy King, who serves the first of a two-match suspension, and injured trio Simon Church, Sam Vokes and David Edwards.
