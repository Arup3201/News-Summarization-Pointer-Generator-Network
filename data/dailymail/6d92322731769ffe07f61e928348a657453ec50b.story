As one of the most successful British singer-songwriters of the past decade, KT Tunstall seemed to have it all.

Having sold four million albums since her debut, Eye To The Telescope, she toured the world and picked up prestigious Brit and Ivor Novello awards.

One week, she’d be in a sequinned dress on the LA red carpet with Justin Timberlake and Mary J. Blige. The next, she’d be playing a gig in Greenland with Jarvis Cocker and visiting New Zealand with members of Radiohead.

On a personal level, too, things were going well. Five years ago, the Edinburgh-born singer married Luke Bullen, the drummer in her band, in a ceremony on the Isle of Skye.

But last summer, everything changed.

In August, her father, David Tunstall, 73, a lecturer at St Andrews University, died.

A month later, she and Bullen separated and are now divorcing. Facing a ‘tsunami of emotions’, KT admits she is still coming to terms with it all.

‘Losing Dad made me examine my own life, and my priorities have changed,’ she says.

‘He had Parkinson’s disease, so he wasn’t well. But he died as a result of a cycling accident.

‘It was very sad, as he was always an impressive man physically. He ran marathons and hated getting old. But he had lived a good life. He didn’t want to stick around in a bad shape.’

Tunstall — whose initials are an abbreviation of her real name, Katie — is less forthcoming about the end of her marriage, but hints that the pressures of combining professional and personal lives under one roof took their toll.

‘Being a touring musician can be very intense,’ she says.

‘Luke and I played in the band for a year before we got together as a couple, so it was always impossible to untangle our personal lives from the music.

‘I could have patched things up, but I didn’t want to do that. I’m nearly 38, and I’m a different person. Music isn’t who I am any more — it’s what I do.’

Even before last year’s momentous events, KT had been getting itchy feet as a musician.

Weary of the treadmill of a major artist, she’d released a low-key, acoustic EP, The Scarlet Tulip, before decamping to Arizona in April 2012 to work with  U.S. musician Howe Gelb, of  alt-country band Giant Sand.

Those songs, with some recorded in the 
same studio in November, comprise her fourth studio album, Invisible 
Empire // Crescent Moon.

Not surprisingly, the record is her most 
personal yet.

A move away from the ‘stompy, sensitive girl-blues’ of old, it is a stripped-back, gentle affair, with strings, clarinet and euphonium adding subtle colour.

It is also a record of two halves — hence the double-headed album title.

She says: ‘It would be easy to say I’ve been gifted traumatic material, but half the songs were written before last summer.

'Maybe my subconscious worked ahead of me.

‘The songs written in November are different to the ones written in the spring.

'The early ones are introspective and uptight, but the second half is more of a rebirth.’

Now Tunstall is looking forward to playing live again, with this month’s solo gigs followed by an autumn tour with a full band — though life on the road will also be different this time.

‘I’ve calmed down a lot. Some people have said they want the old, fun KT back.

'But I don’t think she has gone. My new record isn’t morose.

'It’s not a death or a break-up album. It’s one that affirms life.’
