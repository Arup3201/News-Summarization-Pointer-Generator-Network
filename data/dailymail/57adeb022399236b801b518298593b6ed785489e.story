Police have named a man and woman who were found dead at a luxury five-star hotel.

The bodies of Igor Pavlov, 27 and Daria Kuchuk, 35, both from Russia, were discovered in a room at the Scotsman Hotel in Edinburgh last Thursday.

The couple, who lived in the city, were found by hotel staff at around 12.15pm.

Officers wore specialist suits to enter the room where the two bodies were found at The Scotsman

Their deaths were chemical-related 
and a number of items seized from the room continue to undergo forensic 
analysis, Police Scotland said.

The pair took the chemical into the hotel with them prior to their deaths.

An address in the Royal Mile area of the city was searched on Friday but no further traces of chemicals were found.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 
'Inquiries are ongoing into the full circumstances surrounding both of 
these deaths, which continue to be treated as unexplained at this time.'

Staff at the five-star hotel found 
the couple in a room on the sixth floor alongside containers of 
chemicals, prompting a major emergency response.

Investigators entered wearing special protective suits and guests were evacuated from the historic building.

Hotel guests said they had noticed a strong smell 'like sewage' before the bodies were found.

Around 25 specialist firefighters were sent to the scene as part of a Scottish Fire and Rescue chemical incident team.

A ‘detection, identification and monitoring unit’ was also called in to check for hazardous materials.

Investigation: A large cordon was put in place outside the hotel entrance in North Bridge

Precaution: The sixth floor was evacuated while officers carried out checks of the luxury hotel in Edinburgh

The sixth floor was evacuated and a large cordon put in place outside the hotel entrance in North Bridge.

The bodies were later removed from the hotel and post-mortem examinations carried out.

Suicide has not been ruled out, police said.

Thousands of performers and tourists were in Scotland’s capital for the Fringe Festival, which started on the same day.

Among those evacuated from the building were guests attending a wedding reception.

The Scotsman Hotel is just off the Royal Mile and a short distance from Princes Street, the city’s main shopping thoroughfare.

Standard rooms cost upwards of £250 a night, while the rate for the penthouse suite in late August is £1,125.

Norma and Derek Cameron, from Kelso, 
Roxburghshire, are staying at the hotel for two nights. They were 
prevented from returning to their room on the eighth floor after 
spending a day in the city.

Mrs Cameron, 71, said she and her 
husband had intended to get ready for an evening at the Royal Edinburgh 
 Military Tattoo. ‘We wanted to get in and get refreshed,’ she added.

‘The police weren’t giving anything away. They just said that the hotel had been closed and everyone evacuated.

‘It’s horrible to think about. I’m not sure I want to go back in now.’

Lynn Massie, 34, and Neil Cooper, 31,
 from Aberdeen, were awaiting to collect their luggage after a two-day 
break when the incident happened.

Miss Massie said: ‘We’re really 
shocked. I feel very sorry for the families of the two people. I don’t 
know what happened but it’s quite sad.

‘You don’t expect something like this to happen at a five-star hotel. It’s a shame for the hotel staff too.’

US tourist Betty Cuniberti, from San 
Francisco, California, said she was in her bedroom on the sixth floor 
when the fire alarm sounded and firefighters went round the hotel asking
 people to leave.

She said: ‘There was a very loud bang
 on the door and when I opened it, it was a fireman and somebody from 
the hotel saying it was being evacuated.

‘They told me it was safe to take the elevator but I wasn’t happy to do that so I took the stairs.
‘I feel just terribly about what’s happened. It’s really tragic.’

The hotel opened around 12 years ago. It was once home to the offices of 
The Scotsman newspaper.

The building opened its doors to the public in 
Edinburgh for advertising in 1831. The middle floors of the building, 
now home to luxurious rooms and suites, were originally used for 
editorial offices.

The North Bridge Brasserie was once 
the grand reception area. In 2001, the newspaper moved to its own 
purpose-built offices in Holyrood, paving the way for development of the
 hotel.

Now it has 56 rooms and 12 suites, including the split-level penthouse suite with a private sauna and a terrace with views across the city, which was built as part of a 
£19.5million refurbishment project.
