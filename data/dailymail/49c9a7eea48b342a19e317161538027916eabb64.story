A Utah father will serve 30 days in jail and 30 days of house arrest for chaining his 7-year-old son to a bed while he was at work.

State Judge Brandon Maynard insisted on jail time Monday despite a recommendation from prosecutors that 29-year-old Sammie Hodges from Logan only serve house arrest.

Utah father Sammie Hodges, 29, chained his 7-year-old son to a bed while he was at work because he couldn't afford daycare

The judge said he didn't want to keep father and son apart, though.

'My goal is not to undermine reunification efforts with your son, but rather to reinforce making good parenting decisions,' Maynard said.

Hodges was charged in June with four counts of child abuse and pleaded guilty to one count in November as part of a deal with prosecutors.

His son wasn't injured by a heavy chain padlocked to his ankle in June and had access to snacks, water and a bathroom, police said.

Police acting on a tip found the boy in a middle-class neighborhood in Logan, a city of about 49,000 people 80 miles north of Salt Lake City.

Defense attorney David Perry said Hodges chained the boy to keep him from running around the neighborhood because he couldn't afford day care.

Prosecutor Jacob Gordon said his actions absolutely rose to the level of child abuse, according to The Herald Journal.

'This is an inappropriate way of child care; there is no way around it,' Gordon said.

The unnamed boy is in foster care.

Hodges was also sentenced to 80 hours of community service, and will have to take anger management and parenting classes.

He will be released to go to work during his jail sentence.

Hodges was ordered to report to jail on December 26 after spending the holiday with his son.
