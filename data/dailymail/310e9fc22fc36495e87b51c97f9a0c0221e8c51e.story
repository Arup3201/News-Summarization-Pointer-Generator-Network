'I don't want to be Shouty Mum... I want to be Fun Mum!'

Our favourite new word at home is 'listicle'. In the real world it's used to refer to the lists of funny facts which seem to populate every website my kids love.

Things like 'ten car parks that look like Cher', for example, or '14 kittens that dance like Wayne Sleep'.

These so-called listicles have tickled us. Every day, we throw out a few family ones. One million reasons Mum thinks she is always right, as my husband is fond of muttering. Eleven red carpet dresses Henry, seven, wishes he'd worn before I stopped him cross-dressing. That kind of thing.

So as New Year is prime listicle season, I've told the family I am compiling a personal listicle of things I will not be saying in 2014. Why? Because after a decade of parenting I am getting sick of the sound of my own voice nagging away like a stuck record repeating the same thing again and again.

So, Team HobNob, you won't hear me say any of the following next year: 'Clean your teeth, brush your hair, wash your hands, eat your  broccoli, flush the loo, turn the computer off, turn the volume down and stop arguing.'

Also banned will be: 'Leave her head alone!' This one is peculiar to my son, who loves to repeatedly sniff his toddler sister's hair, provoking the same reaction in her that I'd imagine you'd see if you woke a hibernating bear - violent rage.

Whenever I say these things, they are either ignored or a  child proposes an alternative to which no fool would agree - for example, she will flush the chain if she can have a biscuit.

The 'asked and answered' parenting theory is that once you've answered a child's question, you shouldn't have to answer it again

My New Year listicle is the first step in my 2014 resolution for Positive Parenting (stay with me, you may learn something) because I am getting ever more frustrated at being the one who has to say no all the time to endless ridiculous requests from my four fabulous children.

I don't want to be 'Shouty Mum' any more. I want to be 'Fun Mum' (as the woman in the cold and flu advert says). And I think I have found a solution.

A new book by U.S. parenting guru Amy McCready reckons there are just three words you need to use to stop yourself becoming a negotiating nag. Just three words to put an end to the relentless requests that occur on an hourly basis with children and teenagers. The magic words are: 'Asked  and answered.'

When your child asks if they have to do their homework and you say yes, you shouldn't have to tell them again

And this, my friends, is how you use them according to the book:

Child/monster-in-a-hoodie (sorry, I mean teenager) asks irritating question to which I have already replied no. For example: 'Can I have ice cream for breakfast/wear a skirt so short my lower intestines will catch a chill?'

Instead of saying no a second time, and then being asked the same question again and again until hell freezes over, you say: 'Asked and answered.'

Your perplexed but determined child/teenager asks the same question again.

You say: 'Have you asked that question before?'

Child/teenager: 'Yes.'

You: 'Do I look like the kind of mum who would change her mind since the last time you asked?'

Child/teenager realises you are most definitely not the kind of mum who changes her mind.

Again you say: 'Asked and answered.'

If you like, you can draw a picture of the question and not speak at all, just point at the picture with 'asked and answered' written under it.

Amy McCready's book about positive parenting aims to end a number of problem behaviours, and says it can spell the end to childish nagging

I like the sound of this. With this new tactic in my parenting toolbox I won't need any of the nags on my listicle.

But I will wait until the New Year because over the festive period we have indulgent relatives to stay whose resolution won't be as strong as mine.

Some of them are prone to agree to jelly and ice cream for breakfast (recognise anyone, Grandma?) so 'asked and answered' will be devalued.

Everyone has to stick to the 'asked and answered' rule or it won't work.

Mr Candy will need intensive training because his default reply to a question being asked 20 times is: 'Ask Mum.' He never wants to be bad cop and I suspect he wouldn't be much help in terrorist negotiation situations.

If you want to come up with your own listicle, do let me know how the 'asked and answered' approach works for you.

Particularly successful candidates might win the chance to take on the ultimate challenge - my stubborn two-year-old Mabel.
