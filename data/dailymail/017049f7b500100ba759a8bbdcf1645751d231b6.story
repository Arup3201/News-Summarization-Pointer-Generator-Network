A Syrian helicopter pilot who was shot down by the Turkish military was beheaded by rebels, it was claimed today.

Horrific footage which purports to show a man's headless corpse dressed in military-style helicopter flight suit and dumped in a ditch has been circulating online since last night, just a few hours after the aircraft crashed.

The film also zooms in on a bloody head lying a few yards from the corpse.

Shocking footage apparently shows a Syrian helicopter pilot beheaded by rebels after he was shot down by Turkish forces

It has been impossible to establish 
if the disturbing images do indeed show the chopper pilot or if it is rebel propaganda.

According to website Weasel Zippers, 
the pilot was beheaded by Syrian rebels after the helicopter was shot 
down by Turkish warplanes.

The video, which has been released on LiveLeak, shows one of the men searching through the pilot's pockets.

It is believed that the man's head was probably removed after his death.

A further two amateur videos have also 
emerged which apparently show Syrian rebels shooting at the pilot as he parachutes from his stricken craft.

It
 is unclear which side of the border the pilot and the helicopter landed
 on, but the videos of the shootings are said to have been shot in 
Lattakia, in the Al-Akrad mountains, in Syria.

The videos are the latest in a series of disturbing images to have emerged from the Syrian crisis which show the brutality from both sides.

Last week, MailOnline reported on a 
public execution that took place on August 31 in the town of Keferghan 
in the north of the country.

The whole barbaric episode is watched by a crowd of jeering men, many of them armed.

Sitting on a low wall only a few feet from where the wretched captive died so violently is a line of young boys.

They
 were still there as the dead man’s head was dumped on his body. Another
 child, even younger, was led by the hand past the corpse.

The
 picture forms part of a set taken by a photojournalist - whose identity
 has not been revealed in order to protect him - who was given 
unprecedented access to the gruesome proceedings.

Among the other photos are an 
executioner lining up his sword before delivering the final blow as his 
victim kneels in the village square - and a victim's head being held 
aloft by a jubilant fighter.

Although
 it is difficult to confirm the political affiliation of those involved,
 an eyewitness told Time that the executioners belonged to ISIS - an 
Al-Qaeda faction opposed to President Bashar Assad's regime.

The
 captives, meanwhile, are understood to belong to the fearsome Shabiha 
('ghosts') - thugs loyal to Assad who are said to roam the country 
massacring women and children.

Human Rights Watch yesterday, meanwhile, released details of a massacre, possibly one of the deadliest since the start of the conflict in Syria.

The organisation claimed Syrian forces brutally slaughtered 248 people in the coastal towns of al-Bayda and Baniyas in May.

The chilling accounts are detailed in the 68-page report, 'No One’s Left’: Summary Executions by Syrian Forces in al-Bayda and Baniyas' and are based on interviews with 15 al-Bayda residents and 5 from Baniyas.

Syria's army acknowledged the helicopter had strayed into Turkish airspace for a short time while monitoring 'terrorists' moving across the border into Syria

And in May a video that appeared to 
show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead 
government soldier was posted online in an horrific propaganda stunt.

Turkey has confirmed it shot down a Syrian helicopter yesterday after it crossed into Turkish airspace.

The government has warned it had taken all necessary measures to defend itself against any further violations.

Turkey
 said it scrambled two F-16 jets along the border between its southern 
Hatay province and Syria after warning the Mi-17 helicopter it was 
approaching Turkish airspace shortly before 2.30pm, the military said in
 a statement.

Syria called the reaction 'hasty' and accused Turkey of trying to escalate tensions along the border.

A
 voice on the video of rebels shooting at the pilot as he parachutes 
from the helicopter is heard saying: 'Allahu Akbar... Allahu Akbar... 
Ahfad ar-Rasoul in the cost, downing an aircraft, downing an aircraft...
 Allahu Akbar.'

As people inspected the wreckage, a voice over the video can be heard heard saying: 'Here are Bashar al-Assad aircrafts.'

News agency Reuters has said it cannot 
independently verify the authenticity of the videos which were uploaded 
on a social media website.

'Turkey will definitely not allow any 
violation of its borders ... We will defend our borders and our people's
 security to the end' 

- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu

 

The video shows the helicopter falling from the sky in a ball of flames and exploding when it hits the ground.

Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said a warplane shot down the helicopter after it ventured up to a mile into Turkey near the border town of Yayladagi.

'It was repeatedly warned by our air defence elements,' he said.

'Turkey will definitely not allow any violation of its borders ... We will defend our borders and our people's security to the end,' Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Paris.

'No one will have the nerve to violate Turkey's borders in any way again,' he said after a meeting to discuss Syria with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, British Foreign Secretary William Hague and their French counterpart Laurent Fabius.

Davutoglu said details of the incident would be provided to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. Security Council and fellow members of the NATO military alliance.

Syria's army acknowledged the helicopter had strayed into Turkish airspace for a short time while monitoring 'terrorists' moving across the border into Syria.

The Syrian military said the helicopter strayed into Turkish airspace by accident and that the aircraft was on its way back when it was shot down

The Syrian military said it was an accident and that the aircraft was on its way back when it was shot down.

In a statement carried by state news agency SANA, it accused Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government of trying to increase tensions between the two countries.

'The hasty response from the Turkish side, especially as the aircraft was on its way back and was not charged with any combat missions, is proof of the true intentions of Erdogan's government toward Syria to increase tensions and escalate the situation on the border between the two countries,' it said.

Turkey, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's fiercest critics, has advocated military intervention in Syria'

It shares a 560 mile border with Syria and is sheltering a quarter of the 2 million people who have fled the Syrian conflict.
