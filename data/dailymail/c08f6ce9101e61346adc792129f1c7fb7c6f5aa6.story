David Cameron has been accused of yet another royal gaffe, after allegedly sharing a joke with MPs at the Queen’s expense.

The Prime Minister apparently gossiped about how the monarch had to be corrected for ‘mistakenly’ claiming to have the original of a painting that hangs at his country seat, Chequers.

However there was confusion last night about whether the Queen was actually wrong, with experts supporting her claim.

Mr Cameron told Tory MPs about the private conversations with the Queen during a visit to Chequers earlier this year

New details of David Cameron's habit of gossiping about the Queen emerged today, with the monarch unlikely to be amused

Details of the indiscretion came just days after Mr Cameron was forced to apologise to the Queen for saying she ‘purred’ down the phone when given the results of the Scottish referendum.

Mr Cameron described that incident, which took place last Tuesday in New York, as ‘embarrassing’ and vowed never to discuss conversations with the monarch again. 

His latest blunder is said to have occurred last Monday, hours before he flew to New York, when he invited 20 MPs to Chequers.

According to the Evening Standard, the group was given a tour of the 16th-century Buckinghamshire mansion, which has been the weekend home of successive Prime Ministers since 1921. 

Reports of Mr Cameron's latest gaffe emerged as he was pictured enjoying himself at the Tory party conference

At one point, the Prime Minister pointed out an Anthony van Dyck painting of a family then went on to recount a conversation that took place when the Queen and Prince Philip made a visit to Chequers in February.

According to Mr Cameron, the Queen was taken on the same tour as the MPs. 

When she spotted the Van Dyck she remarked that she had the original hanging at Windsor Castle. 

Mr Cameron allegedly told MPs that a Chequers curator set the Queen straight – insisting that the version she was looking at was in fact the original, and hers must be the copy.

The Queen’s no doubt diplomatic answer remains unknown – and the party is said to have moved on.

However last night there was confusion about whether the Queen or Mr Cameron and his curator at Chequers was right. While political sources claim the PM was ‘on the money’, website Art History News insisted the Queen, who it says, ‘knows her art’ was ‘absolutely right’. 

The issue stems from the fact that a Van Dyck painting called A Family Group actually hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts in America. 

Experts think Mr Cameron could instead have been referring to another Van Dyck painting of a family, featuring children of Charles I.

In an extraordinary sequence last week, David Cameron was heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote

Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state

In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that The Queen 'purred down the line'

In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: 

'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something....

'She purred down the line...

'But it should never have been that close.

'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…

'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through.

'It was very nervous moments.'

The portrait – called The Five Eldest Children of Charles I – is currently held by the Royal Collection. A copy of the painting is held by the Chequers Trust. 

But a spokesman for the Royal Collection confirmed to the Mail last night that the original of The Five Eldest Children of Charles I by Van Dyck is indeed currently hanging at Windsor Castle.

The Art History News article said: ‘If the curator at Chequers really did not know that Van Dyck’s original was indeed in the Royal Collection, they should be sent to the Tower.’

Downing Street last night refused to comment. But a Tory MP present at the Chequers meeting said the Prime Minister had talked about his exchange with the Queen, saying: ‘The anecdote about the Queen was just a jokey thing. I’m sure he didn’t mean any disrespect by it.’

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the story but have no comment to make on any private conversation between the Queen and the Prime Minister.’
