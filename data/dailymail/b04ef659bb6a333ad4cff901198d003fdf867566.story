Balder Succes is 5-2 favourite with Coral for Saturday’s 888sport Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown after 10 runners were declared for the grade one contest.

Alan King’s six-year-old, winner of the Grade One Maghull Novices’ Chase at Aintree last season, has a seven pound pull in the weights for the five lengths he was beaten by God’s Own in the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter last month.

King said: ‘He has come out of his race at Exeter well. We are hopeful of a good run.’

Who will pull it out of the ‘stocking’ for the 888 Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park this weekend?

Richard Johnson has been booked for the ride on Balder Succes while Mick Channon has called up AP McCoy for last year’s runner-up and Haldon Gold Cup sixth Somersby.

Irish-based Davy Russell takes the mount on Harry Fry’s well-backed Vukovar, who is racing over fences for only the fourth time.

God’s Own could face a three-pronged attack from the Willie Mullins stable at Sandown on Saturday

Godolphin trainer Saeed Bin Suroor has been fined £1,000 and Sky Hunter disqualified from winning the Doonside Cup at Ayr in September after the gelding tested positive to omeprazole, a gastric ulcer medication not allowed in a horse’s system on race day.

Coral and Ayr have announced that they had signed a new five-year agreement for sponsorship of the Scottish National.

Coral first sponsored the race in 2007 and during that time it has grown not only in prestige but also in value with this year’s renewal carrying £210,000 in prize money –the second richest jumps race run on a Saturday in Britain behind only the Crabbie’s Grand National.
