The NHS operates on the wrong body part once a week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted today as he warned one in five hospitals is not being honest about the scale of medical blunders.

Mr Hunt revealed that 29 NHS trusts are under-recording the number of serious errors and near misses that occur due to mistakes by staff.

He said it was 'not acceptable' that preventable mistakes are made, which cause patients and families ‘immeasurable harm’ and cost the health service £800million annually in extra treatment and legal bills.

Concerns: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will warn that 29 NHS trusts are under-recording the number of serious errors and near misses that occur due to mistakes by staff

It is estimated that as many as 12,500 patients die every year following mistakes by NHS staff and there are an average of six ‘never events’ every week.

They include one woman who had her fallopian tube removed instead of her appendix, leaving her potentially infertile, while another patient had the wrong toe amputated.

Mr Hunt is today ordering hospitals to drastically improve their safety record and also ensure they are more honest about mistakes.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Once a week we operate on the wrong part of someone’s body, and that is not acceptable.

'This is really a very big moment because we have identified that the key to this is having an open and honest reporting culture.'

In a speech announcing his plans today, he says: ‘The NHS is leading the world in achieving new safety standards but the battle to reduce avoidable harm is constant.

‘Unsafe care causes immeasurable harm to patients and their families, and also costs the NHS millions in litigation claims.’

All hospitals are meant to alert the NHS’s National Reporting and Learning System whenever a patient dies, comes to harm or there is a near miss as a result of mistakes by staff.

But an analysis by Department of Health has identified that 29 of 130 the hospital trusts in England are not always reporting these errors – known as Patient Safety Incidents.

Officials compared the number of incidents which would be expected at a trust -based on its size and vulnerability of patients – with those actually reported.

A total of 18 per cent of 130 hospital trusts in England were deemed to be ‘good’ at reporting errors, 62 per cent ‘okay’ and 20 per cent ‘poor’.

As part of the measures announced today, patients will be able to check the safety of their own hospital with others nearby on the NHS Choices website.

Each trust will be rated ‘good’, ‘okay’ or ‘poor’ on a number of measures including how well they prevent infections, falls and pressure ulcers. The information is expected to be available later today.

Hospitals are also being told to draw up plans to reduce pressure ulcers, medication errors and two other categories of preventable harm of their own choice.

Ministers hope that the measures will save at least 6,000 patients lives from unnecessary harm over the next three years.

One of the safest: Staff at Salford Royal (pictured), in Greater Manchester, ask patients if they need help getting out of bed and also check they are not wearing slippers or shoes that may cause them to fall

One trust believed to be one of the safest in the NHS which has drastically reduced the level of harm is Salford Royal, in Greater Manchester.

Staff ask patients if they need help getting out of bed and also check they are not wearing slippers or shoes that may cause them to fall.

'Healthcare carries inherent risk and while healthcare professionals work hard every day to reduce this risk every day, harm still happens. Some is unavoidable but most isn’t'

Sir David Dalton, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust chief executive

Senior managers carry out unannounced safety ward-rounds once a week to inspect whether patients are liable to come to harm through falls, bedsores or lack of care.

Since the measures were introduced in 2008, the trust claims to have reduced infections by 70 per cent, falls by 50 per cent and bedsores by 40 per cent.

Sir David Dalton, chief executive of the trust who has been put in charge of this new safety campaign said: ‘This is the right thing to do.

‘Healthcare carries inherent risk and while healthcare professionals work hard every day to reduce this risk every day, harm still happens. Some is unavoidable but most isn’t.’

In 2007 study by the now defunct NHS Patient Safety Agency estimated that mistakes due to medication alone cost the health service £774 million a year in legal fees and necessary treatment.
