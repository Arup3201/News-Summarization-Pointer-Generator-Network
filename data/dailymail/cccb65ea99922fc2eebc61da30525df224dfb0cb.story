There is one Royal birth tradition, dating back several centuries, which the Duchess of Cambridge was probably happy has been abandoned: the Home Secretary was not be present at the birth.

It was once customary for the Home Secretary, as a senior member of the Cabinet, to attend royal births to ensure the new arrival was a genuine descendant of the monarch and had not an imposter smuggled in.

But last week the current Home Secretary, Theresa May, confirmed the convention had firmly been left in the past.

Waiting game: But while the Home Secretary was content not to be involved in the birth of the new royal baby, the rest of the world couldn't stay away with thousands of well-wishers gathering outside Buckingham Palace awaiting news of the arrival or the prince or princess

The tradition dated back to the so-called 'Warming Pan Scandal' of the late 17th Century. As King James II and Queen Mary Beatrice celebrated the arrival of their new born son, James Stuart, rival families put about that he was an imposter.

The Hanoverians claimed the real child had been born dead and replaced with a new-born infant carried in to the birth chamber in a warming pan.

The last time a Home Secretary attended the birth of a future monarch was for the arrival of the Queen herself in 1926.

Tory Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks was reported to have conveyed the news by special messenger to the Lord Mayor of London.

The tradition began after 'Warming Pan Scandal' of the late 17th Century when rival families put about that the new born son of King James II, pictured, and Queen Mary Beatrice was an imposter

Mrs May was quizzed on the tradition while giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee last week.

Tory MP Michael Ellis, who was chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, said: 'Until relatively recently there was a convention that home secretaries attended royal births, I understand this happened with Her Majesty, the Queen.

He asked: 'Do you have any plans to visit the Lindo wing any time soon, following this convention?'

Mrs May said: 'In fact, it is no longer the case that the Home Secretary is required to attend a royal birth, but I suspect Mr Ellis with your royal connections you might have more information about these things than I do.'

She added: 'The home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby hadn't been smuggled in.'Â 

Return: The Queen arrived at Buckingham Palace this afternoon after leaving Windsor Castle
