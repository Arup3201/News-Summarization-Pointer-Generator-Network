Controversial: Planning Minister Nick Boles has defended the proposals

The revolt against proposals to allow large extensions in back gardens spread to the planning minister’s back yard yesterday.

Nick Boles, MP for the Lincolnshire constituency of Grantham and Stamford, has defended the controversial plans to enable homeowners to build out as far as 26ft without the need for planning permission.

But yesterday, Conservative-run Lincolnshire Council came out against the plans – warning that a ‘rash of extensions’ could increase the risk of flooding in the low-lying county.

The councillor in charge of planning, Eddy Poll, urged district councils in Lincolnshire to follow the lead of Richmond Council in London, which voted on Tuesday night to oppose the plans.

One of Lincolnshire’s districts, East Lindsey, immediately backed the call. Lambeth Council, also in the capital, yesterday joined the growing rebellion against the proposed ‘planning free-for-all’ – saying it would put residents’ privacy at risk.

Last night, the leader of the Tory-run Kensington and Chelsea council also attacked the proposals.

Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association, said any changes must ensure councils are still able to take action to maintain the character of neighbourhoods. Homeowners are currently allowed to build a single-storey 10ft extension if they live in a terraced property and one of 13ft if they live in a detached house.

Earlier this month, David Cameron said he wants the limits doubled to 20ft and 26ft for three years in a bid to boost the economy.

'Planning free-for-all': Critics say relaxing the rules around extensions would blight streets and set neighbour against neighbour

Critics lambasted the plans, saying they would blight streets, slash property prices and set neighbour against neighbour.

Mr Boles said: 'The planning system needs to strike a balance between the rights of the homeowner and their neighbours.

'Our proposals will make it easier 
for thousands of hard working families to undertake home improvements to
cater for a growing family. It will also help generate new business for
local construction companies and small trader.'
