Sir Simon Rattle said the Barbican cannot compare to international venues

Britain’s most celebrated conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, has attacked the lack of world-class music venues in London.

Sir Simon said the acoustics at the capital’s Barbican – home to the London Symphony Orchestra – could not compare with the other international or even regional venues.

He said: ‘The Barbican is a good concert hall but it’s not a great concert hall. London deserves a great concert hall.

‘It would be wonderful if  there was a hall as good as in Birmingham or Manchester, or even the Snape Maltings in Suffolk. Great orchestras deserve a great instrument to play in.’

Rattle is tipped to take over at the LSO when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2018. Some sources say he will only accept if the orchestra leaves the Barbican, but he said speculation about his future  was a ‘pain in the rear’.

Sir Simon, 56, worked with the LSO at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games – along with Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean.

The conductor said: ‘The memory is being in the stadium with 80,000 and hearing them announce that Simon Rattle and the LSO will play Chariots Of Fire and hear 80,000 go,  “Oh!” And then, ten seconds in, to see Mr Bean and 80,000 people laughing. It is one of the most extraordinary sounds I have ever heard.’

Sir Simon – whose third wife, Magdalena Kozena, is expecting his fifth child – added it was important to protect the arts in a recession. He said: ‘It is always a mistake when arts are the first thing to be cut.’
