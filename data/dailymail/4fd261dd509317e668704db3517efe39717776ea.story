Scotland could break away from the rest of Britain 'by mistake', Gordon Brown warned today as he criticised the Tory government for patronising voters north of the border.   

The former Prime Minister warned the spectacle of minister from London issuing dire warnings about losing jobs, currency and even fish and chips created the impression that the independence debate is 'Scotland versus Britain'.

Speaking at a press gallery lunch in Westminster, Mr Brown also urged David Cameron to take part in a televised debate with Alex Salmond, to the irritation of Downing Street.

Mr Brown has said he returning to the political frontline to protect Scotland for his children, and his children’s children.

He spoke at an event in Parliament today, after almost deserting the Westminster bear pit since leaving Number 10 in 2010.

The former Labour leader said the success of the NHS, welfare, pensions and defence showed the strength of pooling resources between Scots, English, Welsh or Northern Irish. 

'This is an unparalleled achievement of the 21st century, the pooling and sharing of resources across the United Kingdom for defence, for security for economic opportunity and for welfare.

'And we are very stupid if allow this not to be talked to be talked about as one of the important cements together.

'Now, countries can be lost by mistake.' 

He took aim at the coalition government in Westminster for its attacks on independence.

Ministers faced ridicule for a web stunt, claiming Scots will be able to buy fish and chips every day for 10 weeks with the money they save by voting 'No' to independence.

The UK government was accused of 'patronising' Scots with a campaign website using Lego and the promise of fish and chips to persuade people to vote No

Gordon Brown has ramped up pressure on David Cameron by suggesting he should agree to a debate on Scottish independence with Alex Salmond.

The former Prime Minister said it would be a 'good idea if Mr Cameron took on the SNP leader in the run-up to September's referendum.

Mr Brown also repeated his warning that pro-union politicians were allowing nationalists to portray the vote as 'England against Scotland'.

Speaking to journalists at a Westminster lunch, the MP dismissed arguments that Mr Cameron should stand back from the battle because he was toxic to Scottish voters.

'The Prime Minister has got to be part of this debate,' he said.

Asked whether he thought that meant Mr Cameron should agree to the Scottish First Minister's demands for a debate, Mr Brown replied:

'People have to decide what the best way forward is.

'I think it would be a good idea if David Cameron did debate Alex Salmond, but I'm not involved in the negotiations.'

But Downing Street rejected the idea. 

Mr Brown said: 'If people come up to Scotland, and say Britain says no to Scotland having a share in the currency. Britain says you are not going to have defence jobs or Britain says you have got to go bankrupt, or last week, Britain says vote independence you will lose your fish and chips, pies and you’ll lose your holidays in Torremolinos in a patronising way that ought to be withdrawn immediately.

'Then it’s obvious the issue will become Scotland versus Britain.

'And people will say the debate is do you stand up for Britain or are you for Scotland.'

He also turned his fire on Fist Minister Alex Salmond, accusing him of making Scotland look 'small’ on the world stage after smuggling a Scottish flag into Centre Court in the handbag of his wife, Moira.

As the crowd stood to applaud Andy Murray’s win in straight sets last year, he pulled the Saltire out and waved it around directly behind Mr Cameron’s head.

The move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar.

In an interview yesterday said: ‘I didn’t like it when he [Salmond] got the Scottish flag up at Wimbledon.’ 

Today he was backed by Mr Brown, who told Sky News: ‘That was a terrible mistake. Take politics out of this. I personally felt very embarrassed.

‘The reason I felt embarrassed was it made Scotland look small. We're not a country in the end that goes for these gestures.

‘We're not a country in the end that wants to dwell on grievance or gripes, or scoring a cheap point against England or against Britain. I think that was a very bad mistake.’

Murray has revealed he 'didn't like it' but was nervous about expressing a view on Scottish independence

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander claims there would be a 'UK dividend' worth £1,400 for every Scot by staying in the union.

The Scotland Office released a bizarre list of 12 things that Scots will be able to buy with the cash - each illustrated using Lego characters and published online.

According to the Government, Scots will be able to 'scoff 280 hotdogs' at the Edinburgh Festival, drink more than 600 coffees or get a hair cut every month for three and a half years.

Mr Brown condemned the tactics. He said: ‘Last week when the Scottish Office and the UK Government put out that statement that Scotland would be £1,400 better off without independence - and they gave the example of fish and chips you could buy, or holidays in Torremolinos. I thought that was patronising.

‘So people can make mistakes and I think Mr Salmond ought to recognise that that made Scotland - because these pictures were shown all over the world - and I would never have done that.

‘I think it made Scotland seem small, when I actually think Scotland should be big.’
