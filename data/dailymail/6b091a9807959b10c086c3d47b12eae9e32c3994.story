Frustrated: David Cameron said sport in state schools was being 'squeezed out'

Too many of Britain's Olympic athletes went to public schools, David Cameron said yesterday as he called for barriers to be broken so all children could achieve their sporting potential.

The Prime Minister claimed that fee-paying schools were producing 'more than their fair share' of medal winners while sport in state schools was being 'squeezed out' with rundown facilities and children lacking ambition.

At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, almost 40 per cent of Great Britain's medal winners had been privately educated – and that rose to 100 per cent of winners in equestrian events.

With about a third of the 2012 squad expected to have been educated privately, Mr Cameron lamented the numbers of top sportsmen from less well-off backgrounds.

He said: 'Sport can change lives. So why is it that in so many schools sport has been squeezed out and facilities run down?

'The result is that independent schools produce more than their fair share of medal winners and too many children think taking part in sport just isn't for them. We've got to change that.'

Beginnings: Seb Coe started running with the Hallamshire Harriers. Amir Khan started boxing at Bury ABC

In a speech at Loughborough 
University yesterday, Mr Cameron, who went to Eton, one of the top 
fee-paying schools in the country, urged young people to look up to 
elite athletes such as runner Mo Farah and cyclist Victoria Pendleton 
who were both educated at state schools.

He
added: 'Some of the barriers that hold young people back are in their 
minds: about imagined barriers of aspiration and confidence. The 
Olympics are a chance to break  them down.

'I'm not claiming one Olympics will 
turn every child into tomorrow's Mo Farah or Victoria Pendleton, but 
just look where our great athletes have come from.

Seb Coe started 
running with the Hallamshire Harriers. Amir Khan started boxing at Bury 
ABC.

'Sustaining the momentum of the Games means opening people's eyes to the possibility of sport.

'Getting young people to follow their heroes and take part at school and in their local clubs.' 

His
comments came after Education Secretary Michael Gove warned that a 
'profoundly unequal' education system meant that private school pupils 
were dominating positions of wealth and power in Britain.

The Prime Minister went on to claim that the Olympics, which have so far cost £9.3billion, would boost the economy by £13billion over the next four years from new business deals, foreign investment and tourism.

Downing Street said the figure included £1billion in additional sales by British companies, up to £4billion in business opportunities, £6billion in foreign investment, and £2billion from an increase of about four million tourists.

Mr Cameron said: 'Now there's a further reason why the Games have got to be great for Britain too – they should be great for our economy.

'We shouldn't see them as some sort of expensive luxury in tough times. Because it's precisely because times are tough that we have got to get everything we can out of these Games, to support jobs and to support growth in the economy.'
