Construction crews in Tennessee are working to fill a sinkhole that opened at Austin Peay State University's Governor's Stadium.

The sinkhole started out small, about 3 feet by 5 feet, but workers have had to dig a much larger hole - about 40 feet deep and 40 feet wide - to find stable bedrock.

The hole was discovered about a month ago where the football field meets the track during a project to replace the main stadium building.

A sinkhole that opened at Austin Peay State University's Governors Stadium started at 3 feet by 5 feet, but workers have had to dig a much larger hole to find stable bedrock and repair the track

Workers have had to dig a a hole 40 feet deep and 40 feet wide in order to begin renovating the track which will be replaced sometime in June

Mike Jenkins, superintendent for Nashville-based Bell & Associates Construction, told The Leaf-Chronicle that sinkholes are common in the area and the budget included sinkhole remediation funding.

'You
 never know to what extent you’re going to run into them, but we know 
that Montgomery County, and Austin Peay State University specifically, 
is famous for sinkholes,' said Jenkins.

A
 sinkhole is defined as some sort of hole in the ground caused by the 
collapse of the surface layer around which everything around it drains. 
Sinkholes may happen gradually or suddenly, says National Geographic.

Jenkins
 said workers continued to excavate on Monday while officials met with a
 geo-technical engineer. He said the hole will be filled with rock, 
concrete, and asphalt beneath the new track and turf.

The
 hole will be repaired by the end of the week and Jenkins said they 
delayed the process so that it coincides with the demolition of the 
track.

A new surface will be installed sometime in June.

Renovations
 to the stands on the west side of the track are being treated as a 
separate project and Jenkins said that the sinkhole with not affect the 
budget nor will it delay progress.

Workers
 will also repair smaller sinkholes in the parking lot during the final 
part of the project which will be finished in time for the Govs’ home 
opener vs. Chattanooga on September 13.

The sinkhole complicates the project already underway to replace the main stadium building
