Police were forced to break up a clash involving angry protesters outside a Sydney Woolworths store who were opposing the supermarket giant celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

To celebrate the holiday, which began on June 28, Woolies put up ‘Happy Ramadan’ signs across 239 of its stores.

The move sparked outrage from some members of the public, prompting the Party for Freedom, a fringe political group, to organise a protest on Saturday.

Protesters outside Marrickville Woolworths clashed over the supermarket giant's Ramadan celebration signs on Saturday

There were eight protesters against Ramadan and about 60 people for Ramadan

During the demonstration, eight Party for Freedom members and about 60 pro-Islam protesters clashed outside Marrickville Woolworths on Illawarra Road.

Party of Freedom chairman Nick Folkes said the Islamic faith was 'incompatible' with the Australian way of life.

'I don’t know why Woolworths is celebrating a ideology that I think is worse than Nazism,' he said.

'It has brought nothing positive in Australia and you can see what’s happening in the Middle East…it’s just chaos.'

A journalist at the protest said the two groups exchanged words for about half an hour

Police were called to the Illawarra Road store about 11am to break up the protest

Party for Freedom was the group protesting against Woolworths celebrating the Muslim holiday

During Ramadan Muslims abstain from food and other pleasures during the daylight hours for a month with the idea it will purify the soul and refocus their devotion to God.

A New South Wales police spokesman said no one was injured during the protest, but Mr Folkes claimed it was 'really ugly and almost turned into a riot'.

'[Pro-Islam protesters] attacked us and came around the corner so fast,' he said.

'We had about 10 people and they had 60 people. They stole one of the burkas, flyers and placards, and punches were thrown and it was very heated.'

Mr Folkes also claimed the pro-Islam protesters had weapons but a police spokesman said there were no reports to confirm weapons were seized.

Peter Boyle - a journalist who witnessed the clash - said: 'There was a bit of pushing and shoving, but I didn’t see anyone throw a punch let alone draw out a knife'.

Boyle said the pro-Islam protesters were there before the anti-Islam protesters arrived.

'There were about three metres between the two sides,' he said.

'There was probably half an hour of shouting at each other and people left.

'It was broken up very quickly by police...[they] didn’t even close the road.'

Boyle said the pro-Islam protesters were wearing scarves around their heads.

'I didn’t see anyone of any Middle Eastern background,' he said.

'They were sort of young inner city anarchist types.

'Some of them had things around their face so I couldn’t even see their faces, but they were white Australians.'

The police spokesman said they were called to the Woolworths in Marrickville at 11am on Saturday to a group of protesters causing a disturbance outside the supermarket.

He said no one was injured or arrested.

A Woolworths spokesman said it would continue to celebrate religious and cultural festivals.

'Woolworths is a proud Australian company and we have been so for 90 years,' he said.

'Our customers and our staff mirror the diversity of Australian society. 

'We are a strong and active part of the communities in which we operate.

'We join with our customers to celebrate not only Christmas and Easter, but also other religious and cultural festivals including Ramadan, Diwali, Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year and Passover.

'We look forward to continuing to celebrate these festivals with our customers.'
