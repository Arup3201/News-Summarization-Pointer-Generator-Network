This is the heartstopping moment a huge weightlifting bar comes crashing down on a woman’s neck, sending her careering forward during a crosslifting session. 

The dramatic video of the failed weightlifting attempt continues to fuel controversy around the Crossfit exercise movement - once used only by police and the military - that is now popular among millions of men and women around the world.

In the clip, published on LiveLeak, the woman lifts the bar but buckles under the weight as the bar slip from her hands and onto her neck. She then falls forward with her head caught beneath the bar as she hits the ground.

Heartstopping moment: As her arms give way, the bar crashes onto her neck and she topples forward to dramatic fashion

It is unknown where in the world the accident occurred or the extent of the woman’s injuries.

The CrossFit exercise phenomenon pioneered by coach Greg Glassman is a system of exercises, including Olympic-style weightlifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping, created 13 years ago and now used by thousands of gyms worldwide.

The regime has sparked outrage in recent months after Lea-Ann Ellison, a 35-year-old mother from Los Angeles, posted pictures of herself weight-lifting at eight months pregnant.

She suffered a barrage of abuse online after posting the pictures, declaring she wanted to be a ‘Hot Mom,’ exercising up until three days before the birth of her son on November 7.

While some appeared to support her decision in September - including several people who claimed to be doctors - others were horrified.

'This is actually sickening,' wrote Amanda Cinq-Mars. 'I hope pregnant [women] around the world do not do this kind of cr**.

'I am a Crossfit enthusiast but I do not recommend this at all. Doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage... Posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is okay when it's not!'

Another, Josh Giannapolous, wrote: 'Cross fit? This goes way beyond a way of life, and right into an obsession.

Extreme exercise: The Crossfit regime sparked controversy this month when Lea-Ann Ellison posted photographs of herself weighlifting eight months pregnant

'She is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements. This is not a proud picture to post.’

Four years ago Cambridgeshire fitness enthusiast Sarah-Jane Cousins hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date.

Another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model Nell McAndrew, who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant.

The popularity of Crossfit has spread through health clubs as well as online, with groups meeting in parks or 'boxes' - mirrorless, garage-like rooms filled with frighteningly large weights and very little else -  to pump iron and perform pull-ups while screaming encouragement at one another. 

Millions of devotees converge online, boasting on forums of exercise sessions that have left the muscles so sore that walking is difficult, and hands blistered and calloused thanks to steel kettle-bells swung hundreds of times. Unsurprisingly, it has been likened to a cult.
