A 999 caller delivered a terrifying running commentary to an operator as he watched a woman stab a grandmother to death in the street.

Nicholas Morris screamed, 'She's bloody killing her!' as he watched Nicola Edgington, 32, go on a violent early morning rampage near Bexleyheath high street, a court heard today.

He saw the killer first try to stab Kerry Clark, then 22, before going into a butcher's and grabbing another knife, which she used to almost decapitate 59-year-old Sally Hodkin.

Defendant: Nicola 
Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, right, to death

Mr Morris can be heard saying: 'She's bloody killing her. Oh my God, she's f***ing killed her. For God's sake!'

After giving the location to the operator he said: 'I've just witnessed a lady try to stab another lady with a knife... The girl was so lucky, the knife just missed her.'

Miss Clark managed to grab the knife from Edgington during the attack at around 8.30am on 10 October 2011 and suffered only a cut to her palm.

Mr Morris can then be heard following Edgington as she walked off up the road and entered a butcher's shop to grab another knife.

He told the operator: 'You need to get someone here. She's walked out the shop. She's walking down the road now. I'm following her down the High Street.'

Mr Morris is heard running after Edgington as she went round the corner into Albion Road near the bowling alley.

Attack: Edgington is alleged to have grabbed the knife from Meat Market in Bexleyheath

He tells the operator: 'She's attacking another woman, she's stabbing another woman with a knife.

'I can't get there... she's stabbing another woman. She's bloody killing her! Oh my God, she's f***ing killed her. For God's sake!

'She's coming towards us. She's chasing a young schoolgirl now... she's lost the knife, she's lost the knife.

'Where are the police? She's gone into the tile centre. I need some help here!'

The operator tells Mr Morris that they are on the way and shortly afterwards sirens are heard.

He then tries to run back towards Mrs Hodkin, clearly out of breath, after seeing officers arrest Edgington.

Mr Morris adds: 'The lady that's been stabbed is outside the bowling centre. You've got to get an ambulance. I can't run anymore.'

Shocking scenes: She was then seen going around the corner and almost decapitating a grandmother, the court heard

He then ends the call after seeing more officers arrive.

Edgington stabbed her mother to death in November 2005 and was detained under a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.

She was released into the community in 2009 and was staying at a flat in Greenwich, south London.

Mrs Hodkin, who was married with two grown up sons, worked for law firm Cunningham Blake in nearby Blackheath as an accounts manager and was on her way to the office when she was killed..

Edgington admits carrying out the attacks but claims she did not intend to kill Miss Clark and that her responsibility for the death of Mrs Hodkin was diminished by her mental state.

Edgington denies murder and attempted murder.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
