An Italian judge has condemned a report stating that Amanda Knox murdered British student Meredith Kercher - claiming it is more like a movie script than evidence.

The 337-page report, explaining the reasoning for Knox's reconviction, was issued by an appeals court in Florence, Italy, on Tuesday.

It accuses Knox of delivering the fatal knife blow to the 21-year-old in 2007 out of a desire to 'overpower and humiliate' her victim.

It also claims that the 26-year-old fought with Ms Kercher over rent money on the night of the murder - while her relationship with her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, was 'not idyllic'.

But now, Judge Claudio Hellmann, who threw out the murder convictions against Knox in 2011, has dismissed the document as a 'result of fantasy'.

The judge, who has now retired, told CNN: 'The Florence Appeal Court has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only considered facts and evidence.'

He said there was no evidence to condemn Knox and Sollecito, who were convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009 and sentenced to 28 and 25 years in prison respectively.

Case: Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (right) were convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009 and sentenced to 28 and 25 years in prison respectively. Left, Ms Kercher, who was found dead in 2007

But he added that he 
believed the High Court may be forced to oblige with the appeals court's ruling for fear of openly opposing their colleagues.

Ms Kercher, from 
Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the 
bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 
2, 2007.

Knox and Socellito served four years in prison for the brutal murder, before being acquitted and released in 2011.

However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and were sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively.

According to the report, known as a 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to Ms Kercher, a student at Leeds University.

The document states: 'It
 is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events 
accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by 
Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy 
Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.'

It adds that is difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying
 of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student.

It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed
 Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, 
which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder.

On Tuesday, Knox claimed the report's reasons for reinstating the conviction against her were unsupported by evidence or logic.

In a written statement, she said: 'The recent Motivation document does not -
 and cannot - change the forensic evidence: Experts agreed that my DNA 
was not found anywhere in Meredith’s room, while the DNA of the actual 
murderer, Rudy Guede, was found throughout that room and on Meredith’s 
body.

'This forensic evidence directly refutes the 
multiple-assailant theory found in the new Motivation document. This 
theory is not supported by any reliable forensic evidence. I am innocent'.

She added that she is now focusing on 'pursuing an appeal' to Italy's Supreme Court.

Ivory Coast national, Guede, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for murdering and sexually assaulting Ms Kercher.
