Grisly end: Lopez Webster, 32, was killed instantly after being run over by a freight train in Des Moines

A man was sliced in half by a passing freight train in Des Moines, Iowa, after stabbing the owner of a home he had broken into just minutes earlier.

Police say 32-year-old Lopez Christian Webster died a gruesome death Tuesday night after trying to climb between freight cars of a moving train.

Des Moines Sgt. Richard Wallace says a witness told officers the man appeared to be running to beat the Union Pacific train before it crossed the 1900 block of East Grand Avenue.

Just minutes before the train ran over Webster, someone matching his description entered a nearby home, ordered a man inside to his knees and stabbed him in the arms and neck with a small knife.

The intruder then threatened to kill the victim if he moved, snatched something from the home and fled towards the railroad crossing.

The train engineer didn't notice Webster. It wasn’t until the locomotive reached Ankeny some 12 miles away that authorities stopped it.

Karma: Tragedy struck at the East Grand Avenue railroad crossing in Des Moines just minutes after Webster stabbed a man

According to investigators, at around 9pm Tuesday, Webster, who had had several run-ins with the law in the past, barged into the home of Timothy Kingery on East Walnut Avenue and stabbed him three times before taking off.

Two other occupants of the residents told police they ran to another room and locked the door when they heard fighting, according to Des Moines Register.

College student Ivan Nery, 18, told WOI-TV that he was sitting in his car near the East Grand Avenue railroad crossing when he spotted a man running beside a Union Pacific train.

‘As soon as it gets faster, this guy suddenly jumped between two cars there,’ Nery said.

Webster crossed one set of tracks and then attempted to leap between two cars, but failed. Sgt Halifax said the 32-year-old father of two did not clear the jump and landed on the tracks under the wheels of the 75-car locomotive.

Nery witnessed the horrific aftermath, describing how Webster was sliced in half.

‘His body was torn apart,’ a visibly shaken Nery said.

Police are not sure whether Webster intended to hitch a ride aboard the train, or simply reach the other side of the tracks. 

Webster's rap sheet dates back to 2000. His latest arrest took place November 29 on a first-degree theft charge, which was later dismissed.

Kingery declined medical treatment and refused to cooperate with police. He has denied knowing his assailant, but detectives believe it is a lie.

Webster is survived by a 15-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. The teen told the station KCCI that his father was a caring parent, while the boy’s mother said that the 32-year-old had a good heart but went astray.
