If you're feeling a little over the hill these days, take some advice from Dame Joan Bakewell.

The veteran broadcaster has said the twilight years can be some of the best in your life – and at 81, she should know.

Her passionate defence of old age came during a talk at the Hay Festival to discuss the role of the elderly in society.

She said: ‘You gain many things. You give up the things that you disliked. You don't have to worry about your shape or your fashion.

‘You give up ambition – it's too late. You're never going to run the show or storm Broadway or lead an army. It’s just too late. Give up feeling competitive. Let someone else win the race. They're going to anyway.

'Time is running out but it can be a good time right until the very end.'

Dame Joan was appointed DBE in 2008 and made a Labour life peer as Baroness Bakewell in 2010, said elderly people needed to feel that they still had a role in society.

She said the worst aspect of getting older was ‘losing a sense of purpose’ after giving up work and children have ‘flown the nest’.

She called it ‘the most awful sense of deprivation’ but said pensioners needed to find new activities and interests to keep themselves busy.

The former Late Night Line-Up presenter has been a passionate campaigner on age issues and was appointed the Government’s ‘tsar’ for the elderly in 2008.

She said: ‘Old age is a different country. It feels quite different. I'm on the frontier of old age and I know it’s a different place from where I used to live.

'There's loss. I deal with loss daily. I dread opening the papers because they contain obituaries about my friends. You lose your friends. You lose your relations. My sister, six years younger, died.

‘I'm always at memorial services. They're the new party, by the way. They're very jolly events because you celebrate somebody's life.'

Joan Bakewell listens entranced to Malcolm Muggeridge, the sage of Robertsbridge

She added: 'I'm not one of them theorising about what it’s like to be old because I know.

‘I've got hearing aids, I've got glasses and I'm likely to have a hip before too long.

'I'm going through the stages that people go through when they're ageing. That's happening to me.

'There's no doubt that the apprehension felt by the young about being old is that you're nudging your way to death. And death is a terror that still haunts us.’

Dame Joan was speaking alongside economist Nicholas Stern and social policy scholar Alan Walker about how to deal with an ageing population.

Mr Walker, who has researched the topic in detail, said more needed be done to encourage people to live healthier lives so that they could keep active after retirement age.
