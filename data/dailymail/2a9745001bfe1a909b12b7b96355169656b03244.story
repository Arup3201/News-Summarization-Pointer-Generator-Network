A former British police officer who retired to the Cayman Islands after 30 years on the force has died in a scuba diving accident.

Chris Devereux, 54, moved abroad to help lead an anti-crime drive with the Royal Cayman Islands Police.

The experienced detective, who had previously served with Merseyside Police, died after getting into difficulties while diving while off-duty at a popular spot near an underwater mermaid sculpture off Sunset House, near the capital George Town.

Mr Devereux moved to the Caribbean island, a favourite with British holidaymakers, in May this year.

A police spokesman on the island, which is also a well known financial tax haven, said last night: 'The officer had been shore diving with a colleague when he got into difficulty and lost consciousness.

'His colleague brought him to the surface. Staff from Sunset House immediately assisted, brought him to shore and performed CPR.

'When the ambulance crew arrived they continued CPR while conveying the officer to the Cayman Islands Hospital in George Town.

'However, despite efforts of the dive staff and the paramedics he was pronounced dead on arrival.

'A family liaison officer has been appointed by the RCIPS and efforts are being made to contact his next of kin.'

‘He was a very dedicated officer and was involved in a lot of investigations,' said RCIPS Superintendent Kurt Walton.  

The veteran officer was assigned to the RCIPS Drugs and Serious Crime Task Force where he worked as a detective constable.

Cayman Islands, where Mr Devereux moved to help lead an anti-crime drive

  He was one of a number of UK officers that came to work in Cayman after the island police force received an additional £3million in government funding to bolster its ranks following a gang-related killing spree in September 2011.  

Mr, Devereux’s former boss and colleague, Merseyside Chief Constable Jon Murphy, praised his long-time officer last night.  

‘It was with sadness that I heard about the death of former Merseyside Police Detective Constable Chris Devereux, in the Cayman Islands yesterday.'

'Having served with him as a cadet and then at several points during his career, I would describe him as a hard working and likeable man, as well as an outstanding police officer dedicated to serving the people of Merseyside for 30 years.

‘As an experienced detective he was involved in a number of complex investigations and was a valued member of Merseyside Police.

'He will be sadly missed.’

Police Comissioner David Baines also said in a statement: ‘Although Chris had only been with the RCIPS for a matter of months he had quickly become an integral part of the Drugs and Serious Crime Task Force.

‘He was both well-liked and respected by colleagues. He will be remembered as a hard-working and committed officer who played a significant role in some of our most recent investigations.

'He will be sadly missed and our thoughts are with his family and friends back in the United Kingdom.’
