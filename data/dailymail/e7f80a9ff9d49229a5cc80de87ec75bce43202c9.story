Worry: Of concern is the HFEA's claim that the donations of eggs and sperm must be increased in order to meet the growing demand for IVF treatment (posed by model)

Women who give their eggs to help childless couples will get a £750 payment in an attempt to boost the number of donors.

Hundreds of 'fertility tourists' are driven abroad each year to seek eggs or sperm in countries which make more generous payments than allowed in Britain.

Childless couples, lesbians and single women are also using unregulated websites in desperate efforts to start a family.

Until now there has been a cap on expenses of £250 for egg and sperm donors per cycle of treatment.

But many experts claimed the payment failed to properly reward women for taking extra risks from the drugs involved.

The fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, agreed yesterday to approve a fixed sum payment for the first time to stop donors being out of pocket and deter the use of ‘rogue’ sites.

But critics said the decision was ‘disgraceful’, saying poor, vulnerable women would be tempted to risk their health for cash.

A change in UK law five years ago which requires sperm or egg donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result is also blamed by some experts for long waiting lists.

Juliet Tizzard, HFEA head of policy, said: ‘Shortage is undeniably an issue. Patients are still waiting for donor conception treatment and are increasingly going overseas.’

Payment: The £750 figure for egg donors is the same as that used in Spain, for instance, while the £35 for sperm donations matches that of Denmark

She warned about the increase of unregulated websites that claim to introduce donors to recipients.

‘Some are making private arrangements where they are organising sperm donation among themselves. We have already written to these websites to highlight our concerns about the risks that sperm donors and recipients can put themselves at.’

CURRENT SYSTEM

Women and men can claim expenses such as travel costs and loss of earnings of up to £61.28 per day. There is a cap of £250.

NEW SYSTEM

Women
 would receive a fixed sum of £750 and also be able to claim for 
excessive expenses. The figure would put the UK on a par with the 
Spanish system.

Sperm donors would receive a fixed sum of £35.

Sperm donors will in future get a fixed sum of £35 per clinic visit, which could see them netting around £525 based on a typical series of 15 visits.

The fixed sums include expenses, receipts will not have to be produced, and donors will still only be allowed to help create a maximum of ten families – a rule that is likely to limit women to a single donation of eggs in return for £750.

But some experts believe higher payments, which already exist in other European countries, may attract the wrong type of donor and breach EU guidelines that donation should be voluntary.

HFEA chairman Professor Lisa Jardine denied the payments would be an incentive to people who were ‘merely financially motivated’.

But Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said surveys showed the British public opposed cash payments and the HFEA was using a loophole by insisting they were called compensation.

He said: ‘This is a disgraceful decision which puts young women’s health at risk. By creating a financial incentive the HFEA is ensuring that the risks of egg donation are dumped on young women in financial difficulties.

‘Anyone who think £750 is not a financial incentive knows nothing about life on income support or with your students fees tripled.

‘We already know that a £750 payment, as they have in Spain, creates a financial incentive which explains the surplus of egg donors there. Why was there a massive spike in egg donor applications in Spain when the financial crisis hit in 2008?’

Cash in hand: Under the HFEA's planned scheme, egg donors would be paid up to a limit of £750 for each cycle of donation, compared with the current maximum of £250 (picture posed by models)
