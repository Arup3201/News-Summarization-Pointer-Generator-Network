Rumors have emerged that Jessa Seewald (nee Duggar) and her new husband Ben Seewald consummated their marriage mere hours after they tied the knot last week.

According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa, 21, and Ben, 19 were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in a closed room, in the act of 'lust' at the reception and in the very Arkansas church they had just been married.

'Multiple people were discussing that when Jinger opened the door to get Jess for the reception, she immediately closed the door with a look of shock on her face,' Mary B wrote on the Christian fundamentalist blog, My Life As A Stay At Home Wife And Mom.

Scandal: According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa, 21, and Ben, 19 (pictured), were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in the act of 'lust' at the church reception. Pictured, the couple in a snap posted to Instagram on Tuesday 

Whether or not 'Mary B' actually attended the wedding, or whether the blog post is a hoax is unclear, but she did mention, 'my daughter who knows the girls from Journey to the Heart' - a local religious event.

She wrote: 'I was very upset when I was told about the incident that was witnessed by [my daughters] when the door to the room [Jessa and Ben] were in was accidentally opened. 

'I am not sure why they would not wait for the evening to pray and then consummate God's marriage.'

The woman added: 'This really made me question Ben's headship and leadership skills. I pray he is not swayed to evil. I pray he acts as strong husband and worship leader to Miss Jessa.'

Holding hands: Jessa and Ben tied the knot in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Saturday 

What is certain is that Jessa and Ben waited until the reception before sharing their kiss in private. 

The couple, who have evidently been practicing since then, posted a snapshot of themselves puckering up on Tuesday, alongside the caption: 'It's great living life with your best friend!'

The new Instagram emerged alongside snapshots of the pair in their wedding finery with Jessa's modest $1598 gown from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas, seen for the first time.

The dress was described by People as 'modest' with 'a fully beaded bodice of Swarovski crystals and pearls, and had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to.'

'It was the second dress I tried on,' Jessa told the site. 'I love it.'

Tesori Bridal co-owners Lindsey Stavely and Erin Bridges added they didn't know if she would like it because it wasn't 'traditional white.' Bridges then said, 'She kept coming back to this dress and all her sisters were like, 'the second one, the second one,' so everyone agreed.' 

Jessa said 'I do' to her love in front of almost 2,000 guests (they wrote their own vows). 

According to the report, Jinger, acted as maid of honor and the elegant reception was decked out with beautiful white roses and peach flowers.

As aforementioned, the couple didn't share their first kiss at the ceremony, but rather waited till the reception.

'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,' Pastor Mike Schadt said. 'It was important to the both of them.'

Because no kiss was happening, he asked Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar to offer the crowd a kiss. 'So, now you've seen a Duggar kiss,' Pastor Schadt said. 

Another report in Us Weekly details the couple's chaste courtship which called for 'chaperoned dates, parents copied into texts and no chest-to-chest hugging. Hand holding was only allowed after Ben's proposal back in August. 

The ceremony was also modest with 'the church decorated very simply,' said a guest, with Guinn Seewald and Michelle Duggar walking down the aisle to the strains of Amazing Grace.

After posing for photos, the newlyweds then attended their reception where there was no alcohol and no dancing, in accordance to the family's beliefs, according to Us.

One thing that was missing was a wedding cake. 'I don't really like it,' the beauty told the site. The two decided to go with ice cream sundaes instead. Toppings included chocolate, caramel, candy and cookies. Jessa had chocolate while her spouse enjoyed mint chip.

They left the reception in a horse-drawn carriage as bubbles were blown into the air.
