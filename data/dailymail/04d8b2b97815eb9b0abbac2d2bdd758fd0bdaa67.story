Ditched: Mike Stuchbery, 35, has left his job at a Norfolk high school after an 'anti-banter' blog post

A supply teacher who banned the word 'banter' in his classroom because it 'encouraged bullying' has left his job - and says he feels like he was 'forced out'.

Mike Stuchbery, 35, stepped down from Lynn Grove High School in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, after claiming his teaching agency phoned him to say his services were 'no longer required'.

He was called into a meeting with the head teacher on Monday, where it was agreed he would look for work elsewhere, he said.

The teacher had sparked a national debate with his blog about 'banter' just two months after starting a career in Britain, where he emigrated after spending 12 years working in schools in Australia and Germany.

Mr Stuchbery, who was on a three-month contract he hoped would be made permanent, described how he was banning the term because he believed teenage pupils used it to evade punishment and trivialise bullying.

His blog post was shared online and published by educational supplements, sparking division among readers and - according to Mr Stuchbery - the silent treatment from colleages in the staff room.

He announced he had left his job in a follow-up blog post, writing: 'I find myself wondering sometimes whether that job should even be in the classroom. I still can’t work out whether what I said was the right thing to say.

'What I do know is that speaking up as a teacher can have a pretty hefty cost. It is up to each of us separately to decide whether it’s worth it.'

Mr Stuchbery said he had agreed to leave with immediate effect after visiting a doctor who signed him off for stress after the episode. 

'I received a called from my agency saying that things had broken down and basically my services were no longer required,' he added today.

'I then phoned the headteacher and agreed to speak with her on Monday. I think the worst thing about the whole thing is the way I have been treated.'  

Critics had slammed the teacher's blog post I'm Banning Banter!, in which he suggested pupils used the word to excuse bad behaviour.

'Banter, once a term that was used to signify "light-hearted joking, a gentle ribbing of a friend", now seems to be a catch-all term for any sort of off-colour or inappropriate behaviour,' he wrote. 

'If I catch somebody nicking someone’s pencilcase, calling another student a derogatory name or thumping them on the back, nine times out of ten I’ll be met with a "Siiiiir, it’s just bantaaaaaaaah!"'. 

After being published by the Times Educational Supplement and shared on social media websites, Mr Stuchbery attracted an onslaught of criticism for his view, with some readers labelling him 'pompous and arrogant', while others described him as 'a lefty idiot'. 

But Mr Stuchbery - who used to be an education blogger for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation - stood by his opinions today, telling MailOnline it was important to have a public debate.

Mr Stuchbery said colleagues are restricted and 'terrified of the way schools observe them'

'If you have a private conversation things just aren't going to change,' he said. 'If you throw it open to the marketplace of ideas it's going to have a much bigger impact.

'I think the fallout is a shame and it says something about the way teachers have to work.

'I know colleagues who have trained and worked here who are terrified of the way schools observe them and make them teach to a certain style.

'Everyone has a different style and if we all spent all our time looking at spreadsheets and targets the world would be a much poorer place for it'.

He is not leaving Britain, however, where he has gained citizenship due to his family's roots here.

'I love Britain,' he said. 'I'm a British citizen and I want to stick around.' 

In the aftermath of the row, Mr Stuchbery says staff at the school where he was teaching 'went quiet' and accused him of putting the school at risk of unwanted attention. 

'I made a crack about how I’d made the papers while someone else who proposed dropping English as a subject hadn’t had any response,' he wrote.

'I was given the impression that I could have brought down Ofsted on the school (they’d been there the previous week) and that the kids might think I thought they were poorly behaved – that might be why I was getting the reception I was getting.'

TV shows such as The Inbetweeners and Bad Education have popularised the use of the word 'banter', spawning catchphrases including 'Bantanamo Bay', 'Archbishop of Banterbury' and 'Bantom of the Opera'. 

At least one group of people saw the funny side - the pupils.

He wrote: 'Everywhere I went I was greeted with shouts of "BANTER!".

'I decided to laugh with them, turning around in mock horror when somebody shouted it. The tone changed from a cautious hostility to something a lot warmer.

'A couple of kids came up to me and asked why I’d made my comments. I told them that I wasn’t opposed to banter - just using it as an excuse for giving others a hard time. Once we had the conversation, the kids were fine and the majority agreed with me.'

MailOnline contacted Lynne Grove High School, but was told it was providing no comment.
