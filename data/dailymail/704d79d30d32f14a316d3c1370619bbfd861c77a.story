Labour contacted 91 of England's 151 PCTs - 56% of them reported a decrease in the number of surgeries offering extended opening hours

Nearly 500 more GP surgeries across England have closed their doors at weekends and evenings, fuelling a million extra visits to over-stretched A&E departments.

Some patients are being forced to wait up to three weeks to get a basic appointment with their GP, according to figures.

And the number of patients forced to languish in hospital corridors for four hours or more has also doubled.

There has been a 5.7 per cent drop in the number of clinics offering out-of-hours appointments in the last year.

Only 11 bodies governing GPs reported an increase in surgeries seeing patients after hours.

The figures, released by Labour’s ‘NHS Check’, were based on the responses of 91 of the 151 Primary Care Trusts and extrapolated to give an estimate for all of England.

They come a month after some GPs took industrial action over the future of their pensions.

Before the last election, David Cameron said patients should be able to get a GP appointment until 8pm, seven days a week.

But Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The Prime Minister promised patients would be able to get evening appointments with their GP, but our figures show things are heading in the opposite direction – with almost five hundred more surgeries now shutting earlier.

‘The NHS Check revealed a major fall
in the number of GPs’ surgeries offering evening and weekend 
appointments – leaving patients unable to see their GP at a convenient 
time and with some people waiting up to three weeks for an appointment.’

Mr Burnham added that the Government’s ‘calamitous’ decision to overhaul the NHS had allowed the system to drift.

Andy Burnham said Cameron broke his pre-election pledge that all patients would be able to see their local GPs until '8pm seven days a week'

The Coalition also stopped the 
national monitoring of GP surgeries’ opening hours, which critics said 
sent the wrong signal to the NHS.

The annual number of visits to A&E departments across England rose from 20.5million to 21.5million.

Desperate patients have also increasingly seen after-hours GP services outsourced to private agencies.

Last night, the Tories hit back at 
the figures, claiming Labour had inflated its numbers on corridor 
waiting times by comparing six months of last year’s emergency room 
waiting times with 12 months of this year’s.

A spokesman said: ‘It is more than a 
bit rich for the Labour Party to lecture this Government on access to 
GPs out of hours when it was their disastrous GP contract which meant 
that 90 per cent of surgeries stopped offering this service altogether.’

There are 8,228 GP practices in England, according to the latest figures.
