A little league game nearly ended in tragedy as a mother came within inches of losing her son one day before Mother’s Day when a ball struck his heart, causing it to suddenly stop.

Ian McGreevy, 8, was stealing third base during a New Jersey baseball game Saturday when the pitcher threw the ball to stop him.

Instead of making it to the baseman, the ball struck Ian directly in the chest.

‘He stood up and then his whole body just collapsed to the ground,’ Maureen Renaghan told ABC News.

Renaghan was at the game watching her son on the opposing team when she witnessed the terrifying sight.

McGreevy’s heart had stopped beating, he was on the ground in cardiac arrest. Neither of his parents was at the game because his father, on his way, had yet to arrive to the Harrington Park, New Jersey field.

But Renaghan had no way to know that, having never met the McGreevy family. All she knew is that there was a ‘beautiful child on the ground.’

‘I just ran and tried to save him,’ she said.

Thankfully, Renaghan’s CPR training, though 20 years old, immediately kicked in. While other parent’s rushed to call 911, Renaghan searched for a pulse.

Finding none, she began trying to resuscitate Ian. A minute or so later, after chest compressions and several puffs of air, a miracle happened.

‘He coughed…And I turned him over, and he was back and he was breathing and I felt his heartbeat,’ Renaghan beamed.

By then, Ian’s father Ken McGreevy had already arrived to find the children and parents sobbing, seized by fear.

‘That’s what really made me go nuts,’ McGreevy told The Record. ‘No one was telling me anything.’

Thanks to Renaghan, the feeling didn’t last long. ‘I didn’t start to feel better until I saw him open his eyes,’ he said.

Ian was flown by helicopter to Hackensack University Medical Center. The next day, the McGreevy family had two moms to be thankful for.

‘I’m forever in her debt,’ Lisa McGreevy said. ‘I thank God she was there because I don’t know what would’ve happened if she wasn’t.’

Ian remained under observation Sunday, his heart bruised but filled with the love of his family as they celebrated Mother’s Day in the hospital.

Doctors say the boy will make a full recovery, though he’ll be carrying a heart monitor around with him for a while.Meanwhile, the modest hero mom got her well-deserved gift a day early this year.

‘It was the greatest moment of my life,’ Renaghan said. ‘Knowing he’s going to be fine and that his mother is going to have him on Mother’s Day, that’s all that matters to me.’

Recovery: Ian will have to wear a heart monitor for a while. His grateful mother isn't taking any chances and says he won't be back on the diamond any time soon
