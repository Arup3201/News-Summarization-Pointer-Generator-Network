Police are investigating whether the murder of a couple shot dead in their California home on Sunday was related to complaints about their property business.

The bodies of Bradford Hans Sachs, 57, and Andra Resa Sachs, 54, were found in the bedroom of their Orange County home.

Their eight-year-old adopted son, who has not been named, was seriously injured in the attack, which happened at about 2am.

Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names.

Although they were divorced, the couple still lived together in their San Juan Capistrano mansion, which they shared with their five children.

The couple's two eldest children were away at college at the time of the murder, but their two teenage daughters, and the eight-year-old son, were at home.

Neighbors were shocked to hear that the couple had been killed, but customers who had rented property from the couple said they had experienced problems with them.

Ken Baum, who rents a commercial space from the couple, claimed that they changed their company name regularly and told him not to tell anyone who he was renting from.

'After we signed the lease, we gave them a check. They walked us outside, my son and I, and they said, "Whatever you do, don’t tell anybody you know us, you don’t know our names, you don’t know we’re here, we don’t exist",' Mr Baum told CBS Los Angeles.

His son, Bryce Baum, added: 'We were here for about a year and a half and they’ve changed business names several times. I couldn’t even tell you how people have come around looking for them, you know, due to whatever business dealings or money and something like that.'

In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax avoiders, allegedly owing $1.15 million to the state.

The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.'

Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother.

In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute.

Police have not yet released a motive or suspect for the double murder. Emergency services were called to the luxury home at about 2am, after reports of 'unknown trouble'.
