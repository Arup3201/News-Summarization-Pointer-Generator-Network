A 64-year-old man has been sentenced to one year in jail for breaking a woman's jaw with his walking stick after she ran towards him attempting to break up a fight.

William Warmisham told the Gold Coast Bulletin that he 'should have pleaded not bloody guilty' after being sentenced at the Southport District Court in Brisbane on Friday.

The court heard that the incident occurred at the car park of the Surfers Paradise Tavern beer garden, where a fight began between the group Mr Warmisham was with and a number of other patrons in September of 2011.

And while on bail for that offence the man incredibly tried to run down his former lover and her now boyfriend.

The 34-year-old woman ran towards the group in the hope of stopping the fight which had just broken out, when the 64-year-old unexpectedly lashed out at her.

It was at this point that the Crown prosecutor, Nicholas McGhee, said the accused struck her head with his walking stick.

The woman was badly injured from the blow, requiring surgery for her fractured jaw.

Despite pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, Mr Warmisham claimed he acted in self defence.

During his sentencing however, Judge Brian Devereaux rebutted his claims, stating that the woman had not been involved in the earlier dispute and was clearly attempting to prevent any further violence.

Mr Warmisham's one-year sentence is an addition to his previously acquired sentence of two years.

While on bail for assaulting the 34-year-old woman, he was sentenced to two years in prison for intentionally driving his car at his previous partner and her boyfriend.Â 

Warmisham will be released on parole on September 19.
