A man has shot his neighbor eight times - leaving her in critical condition - and taken his own life after accusing her of wiretapping his apartment in a years-long rift.

Steven Outlaw, 51, confronted his downstairs neighbor, 46-year-old Mary Pitts-Devine, in the first-floor hallway of their West Philadelphia building just before 11am on Sunday, WPVI reported.

He shot at her 10 times, hitting her with eight bullets and leaving her in critical condition.

Outlaw then went to his second-floor apartment and shot himself dead, police said.

Shot: Mary Pitts-Devine, 46, was left in critical condition after a neighbor shot her eight times on Sunday morning. She and the neighbor, who then shot himself dead, had reportedly argued for years

A resident reported hearing shots in the building and Pitts-Devine was found in the hallway. She was rushed to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where she was in critical condition on Sunday night.

Outlaw, who shot himself in the head, was pronounced dead at Presbyterian shortly after noon.

A gun was recovered at the scene. 

The shooting came after a simmering argument over whether Pitts-Devine was wiretapping the telephone lines of Outlaw's apartment, Philly.com reported. 

Outlaw had also complained about the woman making noise over a two-year period, and police found a note in his apartment listing the noise complaints, WPVI reported.

He had also written down accusations that she was spying on him with video cameras, according to the channel.

'It's a terrible situation,' Lieutenant John Walker told Philly.com. 'Instead of handling it like an adult, he takes it into his own hands.'

Grisly discovery: The woman was found injured in the hallway while Outlaw was found dead in his apartment after shooting himself in the head. Outlaw believed she was spying on him, according to reports

The duo had lived in separate apartments in the building on Spruce Street for two years. 

Pitts-Devine's social media pages show she is CEO of Prophetic Presentations, a religious production company that 'speaks to the hearts of mankind via the arts', according to its website.

The company runs speaking events and raises money for causes, such as breast cancer. Her LinkedIn page also shows she is a social worker.

Using the name 'Mary Millionaire', she also describes herself online as 'an upcoming novelist & screenplay writer'.

'Praying for you,' a friend wrote on a photo she posted to Instagram at the weekend.
