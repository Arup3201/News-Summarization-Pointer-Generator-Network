Howard Webb has retired from refereeing after 25 years officiating the beautiful game.

The Englishman heads into a new role as technical director of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL).

Webb was a highly regarded official and took charge of more than 500 Barclays Premier League and Football League matches. He also officiated in two World Cups, two European Championships and the Champions League.

However over the years Webb has been accused of being a secret Manchester United fan due to some of his decisions involving the Premier League giants. Here are some of the best virals posted after Webb’s announcement.
