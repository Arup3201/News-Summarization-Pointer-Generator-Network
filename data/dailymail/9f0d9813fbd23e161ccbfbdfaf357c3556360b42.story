Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has become the latest former Leeds United striker to put himself forward for the vacant manager’s job.

The Dutchman, who played at Elland Road between 1997 and 1999, follows Robbie Fowler in expressing an interest.

Leeds are searching for a new manager following the sacking of David Hockaday last month and Hasselbaink, speaking to talkSPORT on Wednesday, played up his credentials.

He said: ‘Leeds United is a wonderful big club where I had two great years. If they want to talk to me, of course I would talk [to them].

‘I’ve got experience, I know I could take the club forward and I know I can take the club back to where they need to go.

‘But what do Leeds United themselves want? That’s the most important question. How do they see things?

‘At the moment there are so many things going on they need to sort out first, or maybe they have already.

‘But if they want to talk to me, of course I would be interested. Who doesn’t want to manage Leeds United? It’s one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country.’

Owner Massimo Cellino returns from a trip to the United States on Thursday and will start to consider applicants.

Hasselbaink, 42, only has one season of management experience with Belgian second division club Royal Antwerp, though he did have a spell as a coach at Nottingham Forest.

He scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for the Yorkshire club during his two seasons there before moving to Atletico Madrid in Spain.

Former Leeds striker Robbie Fowler has also expressed interest in the vacancy

Fowler, who turned out for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, has been pushed forward for the vacancy by intermediaries.

The former Liverpool striker spent time as a player-coach at Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching back at Anfield with former favourites Steve McManaman and Rob Jones.

Academy manager Neil Redfearn will be in charge for Saturday’s Sky Bet Championship trip to Birmingham City and Cellino said he has ‘not heard of anyone better to look after the team.’

However, the 49-year-old, who is entering his third spell in caretaker charge at the club, is understood to have reservations about taking the job on permanently.

Cellino is keen to appoint a British coach and will be heartened that Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are among those in contention.
