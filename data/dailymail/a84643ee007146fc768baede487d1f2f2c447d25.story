Manager Manuel Pellegrini insists that Manchester City have not jeopardised their FA Cup ambitions by flying back from Abu Dhabi just 21 hours before Saturday's fourth-round clash with Middlesbrough at the Etihad. 

City delayed their return from a warm-weather training trip until Friday night but Pellegrini believes there is no danger of his players suffering jet lag from the seven-hour flight. 

They will head straight for the club’s training base to prepare for Saturday's 3pm kick-off. 

Manager Manuel Pellegrini and his players arrived back in Manchester at about 8pm on Friday night

The City manager said: ‘We have prepared for it and we will arrive back at the City Football Academy and have our prematch meeting there. 

‘We analysed this before we decided to come to Abu Dhabi. There is just four hours’ difference, which we gain, so we don’t have any jet lag. I don’t think we will have any problems. ‘We came here to have a break pellegrini and do a different kind of work. It has been very useful for the team. I hope when we return we will see the benefit.’ 

Pellegrini was furious at the way City, then FA Cup holders, went out of the competition at home to Wigan last season and has warned his players to be on their guard against their Championship opponents.

Middlesbrough are managed by Aitor Karanka, who joined Real Madrid as assistant coach following Pellegrini’s sacking at the Bernabeu in 2010. 

‘I expect a very good game,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Middlesbrough are in a very good position in the Championship and working with a very good manager. 

‘I know him well and I am sure that if we don’t play with 100 per cent intensity and concentration we are going to have problems to qualify to the next stage.’
