This is the moment helmet-clad robbers on mopeds raided one of the UK's most exclusive hotels before escaping with a six-figure haul of jewellery.

Three men are seen entering the Dorchester Hotel's revolving doors in Park Lane just after 1.30am yesterday morning, in CCTV images released by the Metropolitan Police today.

The trio used sledgehammers to smash five glass display cases, stealing high-value watches and jewellery, while three accomplices are seen on the footage waiting outside on mopeds.

In and out in a flash: A third robber follows close behind before joining the other two in smashing display cabinets and stealing jewellery and watches worth tens of thousands of pounds from the foyer

In the wake of the heist, which police 
said was well-planned and lasted just minutes, the thieves managed to 
shake off pursuing officers just over a mile away in Shaftesbury Avenue.

One of the bikes hit a 
25-year-old woman in Cambridge Circus as the gang fled, leaving her with
 leg injuries that required hospital treatment.

The glass presentation cabinets were in the main lobby, just beyond the reception and next to lifts to some of the hotel rooms.

One of them contained Brequet and Hublot watches which are worth anything between £6,500 and £31,700 a piece.

The
 gang also broke into one cabinet that contained jewellery by high-end 
American designer Harry Winston who has a flagship store on London's New
 Bond Street.

Other jewellery in several untouched cabinets were pieces made by Faberge.

Detective Constable Alex Flanagan said police are hopeful that releasing the images will help move the investigation forward.

'We are in the early stages of our investigation and I would like to hear from anyone who was on Park Lane or nearby who may have seen the robbery or the men making their escape,' said Dc Flanagan.

'Likewise I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident that took place in Cambridge Circus.

'This was a well planned and thought through robbery and there may be people who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information no matter how small to come forward and assist us with our investigation.'

A guest, who declined to be named, yesterday told how all traces of the raid had been swept out of view by the time he went for breakfast mid-morning.

He said: 'They must have dealt with it pretty swiftly to keep us all happy, it's quite a shock.

'They've usually got some very expensive jewellery and watches just 20 metres in but that's all covered at the moment.

'There are a load of cabinets draped with sheeting, but it's discrete and unless you knew what was behind there you'd walk right past it without knowing.

'If the gang managed to get away with anything they'd be laughing, there are Brequet and Hublot watches in those cabinets - and they cost thousands.'

Scene: The route the robbers took through central London before shaking off the police

The usual complement of luxury cars 
were parked outside the entrance, including an orange McLaren, a black 
Ferrari and a purple Bentley coupe glinting in the sun.

The
 hotel's security and risk manager, Andy Sloan, stood reassuringly at 
the entrance, although those arriving would be hard-pressed to spot any 
signs of the violent robbery as they walked into the cool atrium.

Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Dorchester said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at the hotel last night in which showcases were damaged.

The hotel security team were quick to respond and the matter is now in the hands of the police.

'As ever, the comfort and security of our guests and employees remains our top priority.'

This follows a number of similar robberies that have taken place in London’s West End, where thieves have arrived on bikes and tried to smash their way in to jewellery stores.

Masked raiders struck at the Dorchester in 2002 stealing £1million worth of jewellery in a similar robbery.
