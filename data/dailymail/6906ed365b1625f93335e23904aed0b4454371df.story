Rachel Merchant was just 17 when she was given the devastating news that she would never be able to have children.

Doctors told her she had suffered an early menopause which had left her infertile.

Now, nearly 20 years on, she has confounded the medical profession by giving birth to a daughter, Holly.

Specialists told Miss Merchant, now 36, that the condition must have reversed, although they cannot explain why.

‘My consultant said that in her 30 years as a gynaecologist she had never seen a natural reversal in anyone diagnosed with premature menopause as a teenager,’ Miss Merchant said.

The first signs that she might be recovering came in 2012 when she experienced some bleeding.

Early menopause is rare in younger women, affecting around one in 1,000 under 30s.

It occurs when the ovaries fail, which can be caused by genetic problems or infections such as mumps or malaria.

It can also be triggered by treatments such as chemotherapy.

Many sufferers have to rely on IVF treatment to become pregnant, almost always using a donor egg.

But younger women could start to menstruate again, even years after the diagnosis. Up to 10 per cent of women with ovarian failure can conceive on their own, usually because some healthy eggs remain in the body.

Confused by conflicting advice from doctors about whether she should stop taking HRT, which she had been prescribed aged 17, Miss Merchant decided to seek the advice of a top consultant at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

The specialist confirmed the original diagnosis and told her she should continue to take HRT. In the meantime Miss Merchant discovered she was pregnant.

‘We couldn’t believe it,’ she said. ‘It was as if the HRT had kick-started my body in some way, but there is no way of really knowing why it happened.’

According to a 2011 study, as many as one in 20 women suffers an early menopause, when they stop having periods, sometimes for no medical reason, before the age of 40. It puts them at greater risk of a heart attack, stroke and bone disease in later life which is why HRT is prescribed to replace lost oestrogen.

The drug does not prevent them getting pregnant, however, and under 50s are told to use contraception for two years after their periods have stopped.

Dr Nick Panay, patron of The Daisy Network, a support group for women having premature menopause, said: ‘Although women are informed that [the condition] is irreversible, occasionally there can be recovery of ovarian functioning due to some eggs still being present in the ovaries. This can lead to periods restarting and even pregnancy.

‘It is because of cases such as this we have recommended that the condition should be renamed Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.

‘There is some evidence that HRT might help and we offer our patients the option of short ‘hormone holidays’ as a test of whether their ovaries are showing any signs of recovery.’

Miss Merchant and fiance Jon Gatt, who live in Derby, welcomed Holly to the family in December, and are now hoping for another child. She added: ‘I still can’t believe Holly is here. It is something I never, ever expected.’
