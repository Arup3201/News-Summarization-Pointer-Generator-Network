Outspoken historian David Starkey has sparked outrage by saying Princess Anne looks like a horse after she suggested eating horse meat could be a good thing.

He went on to compare her idea to Jonathan Swift's iconic satirical essay A Modest Proposal, which said economically-troubled Irish people should sell their children as food for rich people.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions panel show, he said: 'I never thought of Princess Anne who is much given to riding around on horses - looks rather like one generally - as a satirist.

'I had never thought of her as reading Swift, for example, on what you do with the problem of Ireland,' he added, referring to the satirical piece.

He went on to mock the princess, a former eventing champion, saying: 'It is exactly the same point, as mad, as brilliant, as circular – presumably it comes from having that coronet so firmly thrust into your elaborately quaffed and lacquered hair.

'Brilliant, it's a brilliant idea… perfect.'

The academic has previously been accused of racism after describing Scotland, Wales and Ireland as ‘feeble little countries’ on the BBC1 panel programme, and blaming ‘black culture’ for the riots that swept the country.

In 2011 he was attacked for calling a child 'fat' on Jamie Oliver's show Dream School.

He has also branded the Queen a philistine who lacks an education, and told a Question Time audience we should not free oppressed countries - and shouldn't have helped to free the French.

Listeners rushed to lambast the author for his comments.

Welfare: Former eventing champion Princess Anne said selling horse meat could be an incentive for good welfare

One person wrote on Twitter: 'What right does Starkey have to insult Princess Anne with personal remarks on her looks?'

Another tweeted: 'BBC just re-broadcast David Starkey's misogyny re. Princess Anne & a horse #bbcaq Plain wrong.'

Others attacked the BBC for not condemning Starkey's comments.

One said: 'Disgraceful that David Starkey's ref to Princess Anne resembling a horse went uncontested by the Chair - patriarchal sexism in action.'

His comments follow a speech the princess made at an animal welfare conference, claiming horse owners might take better care of them if they believed they could later sell them for meat.

She was addressing warnings of a horse welfare crisis, as 7,000 horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect.

Speaking at the World Horse Welfare charity conference in London, Anne said: 'Our attitudes to the horse meat trade and the value of horse meat may have to change.'
