There are few women who have not yearned for a miracle slimming aid. From herbal remedies to acupuncture and hypnotherapy, we will try anything that promises to banish pounds without the need for willpower.

And with stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle MacPherson crediting acupuncture with their healthy physique, Sophie Dahl, Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue preaching the benefits of green tea and Simon Cowell extolling the virtues of natural diet pills, the allure of the diet aid is a powerful one.

But according to a new study, these complementary medicines could have no absolutely no effect as weight loss aids - and could in fact be causing more harm than good.

The Times reports that a study by the University of Exeter 
into natural diet aids has found that there is no evidence that natural 
diet remedies work
to help with weight loss. 

Edzard Ernst, Professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, went as far as to call them 'bogus', saying that while natural remedies have a better image than diet pills, his extensive research has found no evidence that they work.

In his latest study, published in the Journal of Dietary supplements Profesor Ernst reviewed control trials which reported a positive effect on weight loss of African Bush Mango, or Irvingia gabonensis, which is found in many natural diet products.

Although all three studies claimed the African Bush Mango was more effective than a placebo, Professor Ernst found their methodology was flawed and the supplement could not be recommended as a weight loss aid.

He said: 'Over the years we have looked into a lot of treatments and there is not a single one I recommend.'

Indeed Professor Ernst, who has previously 
been labelled as the ‘Quackbuster’ for exposing phoney claims by herbal 
and homeopathic drug companies, warns that such weight loss methods can
even be harmful.

Though 
homeopathic remedies are generally harmless, he says that some may cause headaches 
and insomnia, as well as potentially interacting with prescription 
medications.

Ernst claims that the natural diet remedy industry - worth an estimated £1 billion -  is preying on those who are desperate to lose 
weight and therefore vulnerable.

He says: ‘They are easy victims of the 
irresponsible promises that are being made on the internet and 
elsewhere.'

Ernst's own complex theory on weight loss?

'Eat less and do more exercise.'
