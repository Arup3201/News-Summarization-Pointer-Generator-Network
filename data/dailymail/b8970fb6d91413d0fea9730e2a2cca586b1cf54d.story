Dismantled: Villagers in Lower Hartshay said their Guy Fawkes night bonfire was removed and replaced with 'environmental crime scene' tape by council health and safety officials (file picture)

It has been a much-loved annual fixture of village life for decades.

Days before Bonfire Night locals would dump wood and grass cuttings on site ready to give the Guy his traditional send-off.

But this year residents of Lower Hartshay were left to celebrate around a few fireworks and sparklers after council officials swooped to dismantle the 6ft stack claiming it amounted to ‘fly-tipping’.

They said there was no licence for the event and, to emphasise the seriousness of the misdemenaour, left police-style tape marking out the ‘environmental crime scene’, along with a sign warning villagers ‘we are watching you’ and threatening a hefty fine.

The gathering has taken place on the Derbyshire village’s recreation ground for more than 20 years.

David Crowder, 50, said his children, George, 13, and Charley, 11, were left disappointed by the move.

‘This is an event that brings us together as a community. We have no church, no community centre and, consequently, everyone comes together for this event,’ he said. 

Mr Crowder said villagers had never asked the council for permission because they ‘never felt they needed to’.

He added: ‘I’ve been in the village for 29 years and every year we build a bonfire.

'It’s just garden waste and hedge-cuttings.You’ve only got to look at the ground to see there’s a scorch mark.’

Scene: Villagers in Lower Hartshay had celebrated bonfire night at their recreation ground for 20 years without incident

Safety first: A spokesperson for Amber Valley Borough council said today that the removal of the bonfire was 'standard practice as there had been no application for an event licence'

Neighbour Sandra Starkey, 53, said the bonfire was a village tradition.

Local Conservative MP Nigel Mills said the council’s reaction was ‘ludicrously heavy-handed’.

The
 Tory-controlled council insisted ‘fly-tipping’ was an offence adding:  
‘No application had been made to hold a bonfire on the site.’
