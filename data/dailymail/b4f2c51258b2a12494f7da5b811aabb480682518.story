Road to recovery: Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, said on a phone call with temporary The Last Word host Ari Melber that he has been doing physical therapy after breaking a hip in a car crash last month

After a month away in a hospital following a car accident, MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell called into his show The Last Word Wednesday to reveal that he suffered a broken hip.

O'Donnell and his brother, Michael, were traveling aboard last month they got into an accident while riding in a taxi April 15.

After flying home to the U.S., Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, has been getting treatment in New York and Michael has been hospitalized in their native Boston.

The veteran TV presenter's colleague Alex took over 'The Last Word' on Tuesdays and Ari Melber has been filing in Wednesdays and Thursdays.

On Wednesday this week, Melber got a surprise on the air when his injured co-worker called into the show to offer viewers an update on his condition.

The 3-minute exchange with Melber was punctuated with quips and sarcastic jabs, proving that while O'Donnell may have fractured his hip, his sense of humor remained intact.

‘One thing I want everybody to know is
 that Carl Rove's rumor that I’ve had brain damage… that is completely 
untrue, so make sure that goes away,’ O’Donnell told Melber, poking fun 
at the Republican strategist over his recent comments about Hillary 
Clinton’s health.

After a few seconds of friendly banter, O'Donnell promised to provide additional information on his eminent comeback next week after he meets with his surgeon.

The 62-year-old political analyst shed light on his physical state, saying that the taxi collision left him with a fractured hip and injuries to his legs that required surgery for the first time in his life.

After trading a few friendly jabs with Melber, whom O’Donnell jokingly called out for being more concerned with his vacation time than with his colleague's health, The Last Word host revealed that he is expected to be back on air in June. 

‘That would be great because then I could make vacation plans,’ Melber quipped.

‘Of course, this of course is really all about you. Never mind that I was the one who was in the car crash,’ O’Donnell retorted in jest.

O’Donnell added that now that he is feeling more energetic, he will continue calling into the show and may even join Skype so that his viewers could see him on screen.

Get well gifts: O'Donnell shared a photo of these flowers (left) sent to the hospital by the team from Morning Joe, and he joked that Bill O'Reilly's book Killing Jesus (right) is just what he needs to fall asleep 

‘And remember: I have access to the control room, so any time, when you least expect it - like right now - I could end up being your next guest,’ O’Donnell warned. 

O’Donnell finished the chat by asking viewers to stay with MSNBC ‘for more of The Last Word with the hardest working man in cable news, Ari Melber.’

‘This is so great to get back in the saddle this way,’ O’Donnell gushed about doing the tease.

While the host has been away from the small screen for the past month, he has remained active on Twitter, answering viewers’ questions about his recovery and commenting on the news of the day.

In response to a fan's query on Twitter Thursday, Mr O'Donnell said that his brother is recovering on schedule, and that he was discharged from the hospital the day before.

On May 5, he tweeted that he was learning how to walk with crutches after spending weeks getting around in a wheelchair and then with the help of a walker.

O’Donnell followed up three days later with a message thanking his 'heroic' nurses and a 'brilliant' physical therapist.

O’Donnell also revealed to his 241,000 followers that he is now sporting a full beard since he has not shaved since the accident. 

Lawrence O'Donnell has hosted the 10pm news analysis show since 2010. He is married and has a daughter.

It is unclear where the O'Donnells were when the accident took place, and the left-leaning host did not leave any clues about his trip on his Twitter feed.
