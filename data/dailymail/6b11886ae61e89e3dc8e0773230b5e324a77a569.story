Lorraine King has been told to sign on the sex offenders' register after admitting sexual offences against a 12-year-old boy

A mother-of-two who worked in a primary school will be on the sex offenders’ register for five years after admitting sexual offences against a 12-year-old boy.

Former lunchtime supervisor Lorraine King was also given a nine-month community order when she faced Winchester Crown Court for sentencing last Friday, but she escaped a jail sentence.

Adam Hiddleston, prosecuting, said King had previously admitted a charge of inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and sexual assault on a child under 13.

On July 30 last year a neighbour of King’s called the police after she had seen behaviour that caused her concern.

Mr Hiddleston said the neighbour had seen 41-year-old King in her garden on all fours with a young boy stood behind her simulating sexual intercourse with her.

He said both were fully clothed and King was laughing and saying ‘ride me baby, ride me’.

Police spoke to the boy, who also confessed that King had on previous occasions touched him around the leg and knees while he had been at her home in Fleet.

He told police she had put her hand on his right leg and moved it up towards his thigh.

Mr Hiddleston also said the boy told police King randomly spoke to him about sex until he was able to change the subject. He added police interviewed King, who denied the touching allegations.

When police told her they had interviewed the boy about the simulated sexual intercourse, she accepted it but said it only happened on one occasion.

Mr Hiddleston said King denied telling the boy to ride her and said the claim probably came from a dispute with the neighbour.

King lost her job as a lunchtime supervisor at Elvetham Heath Primary School as a result of the charges

Andrew Turton, defending, said the probation officer who had interviewed his client was concerned about King’s low intelligence.

He added King did now realise her behaviour was inappropriate and wrong.

Mr Turton said King was a single mother with two daughters, one who has Asperger syndrome. He added she has had no contact with the boy since the events last summer.

The court was told that King had suffered as a result of the charges as she has lost her job at Elvetham Heath Primary School and is now on benefits.

Judge Andrew Barnett told King: 'People who commit these sort of offences very often go straight to jail.

'Your behaviour was totally inappropriate and wrong towards that boy, pretending to engage in sexual activity.

The former lunchtime supervisor received a nine-month community order at Winchester Crown Court (pictured)

'You’re the adult and he was the child and you should not have behaved in that way.'

The judge said he had taken into account King’s early guilty plea, lack of previous convictions and the fact that she will suffer from having a criminal record and being on the sex offenders’ register.Ordering King not to have contact the boy for nine months, the judge added: 

'I hope by dealing with you in what might seem to some in this very light way that you will learn your lesson that this is not the way to behave towards children.'

Stuart Adlam, headteacher at Elvetham Heath, confirmed that King was previously employed at the school and that she has not worked there since the early part of the autumn term last year.

'I would like to stress that the offences committed do not relate in any way to her role as a lunchtime supervisor at the school nor do they relate to any pupils at the school,' he added.
