YouTube has been warned to remove 20,000 videos by artists, including Pharrell Williams and the Eagles, or face a $1 billion lawsuit, it has been reported.

Irving Azoff and his company, Global Music Rights (GMR), are behind the complaint and are said to be representing the interests of around 40 music stars.

Mr Azoff has reportedly told the video-sharing site that they do not have the performance rights for thousands of songs they offer on its streaming service.

Many of the songs, by the likes of John Lennon, Smokey Robinson, and  Chris Cornell were previously managed by ASCAP and BMI, the Hollywood Reporter says.

Mr Azoff has reportedly claimed that although YouTube may have negotiated deals with the record labels, they have not done the same with the artists.

He told the Hollywood Reporter that his clients wanted to pursue YouTube, as apposed to other sharing sites, because they have been 'least cooperative' and are 'the worst offenders.'

The website claims that YouTube has said they do have the rights for the public performances of the videos due to prior deals.

YouTube has been contacted by the MailOnline, but has not yet responded to the request for a comment. 

The news re-ignites the debate about the rights of musicians and digital access to their songs.

It also comes as Google prepares to launch its own subscription music service.
