The U.S. Navy is on a mission to save a baby girl after she fell seriously sick about 900 miles off the Mexico coast, during a round-the-world voyage.

San Diego couple Eric and Charlotte Kaufman called for help from the Coast Guard on Thursday, after their youngest daughter, Lyra, fell sick.

A team was parachuted in on Thursday to get medical help to the one-year-old, but she needs to be airlifted to hospital.

The USS Vandegrift is due to rendezvous with the family and their 36ft sailboat Rebel Heart later today, or early tomorrow. It will then whisk Lyra away for medical treatment.

The dramatic rescue comes just two weeks after the Kaufmans embarked on their attempt to circumnavigate the globe with their daughters, aged one and three.

From the start, the trip had been experiencing difficulties with choppy weather causing sea sickness, but Lyra's health soon took a turn for the worse.

When her parents called for help earlier this week, their daughter had developed a rash, was vomiting and had diarrhea.

The family had antibiotics on board their well-stocked boat, but they were not working on Lyra.

Life savers: The Air National Guardsmen and Navy are making sure the sick toddler gets the help she needs

Her condition has been stabilized, but it is thought that she had contracted salmonella, and is in need of hospital assistance, NBC 7 reported.

Four members of the Air National Guard have remained on board the Rebel Heart with the family, to monitor the little girl.

A spokesman for Moffett Federal Airfield in California, where the rescue is being coordinated, said: 'The vessel’s remote location as well as the infant’s urgent need for medical care necessitated the rescue.

'The 129th pararescuemen who saved the child’s life will remain with her until she reaches a medical facility capable of treating her conditions.'

To make matters worse, the Rebel Heart had become stranded hundreds of miles off Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, with no way to steer or communicate.

Off course: The family set sail from San Diego on March 20 but had to call for help on April 3, 900 nautical miles of Mexico

On Friday afternoon, an update was posted on the family's Facebook page saying that the rescue mission was underway.

'I just got off the phone with the Lt. Col in charge of this mission. Lyra is stable. They have got the boat running!' the post, made by a relative, read.

'They have turned around and are heading to Cabo. There is a Navy ship heading to meet them. If anything changes with Lyra they will med vac her out.'

The head of the rescue mission, Major Hank Lutz said the family had been given access to full medical back up to make sure Lyra stays healthy.

'We have a doctor, a flight surgeon, that's on call right now in Cabo San Lucas, and through their sat phone they can call her in case they need anything that's more advanced than just simple paramedic,' he told ABC News.

Giant swells in the section of ocean the family's sailboat is in has complicated the rescue mission. The Navy ship is needed to provide a more stable platform for a helicopter to airlift Lyra away.

'With the swells out there, it's moving around a lot more so it's not a stable platform to hoist off of,' helicopter instructor pilot Major Nathan Nowaski said.

Once the Rebel Heart has met the USS Vandegrift, it will take a further 14 hours for helicopters to make the round trip to collect the young patient.

The dramatic rescue is far from what the couple, who are experienced sailors, had anticipated when they decided to embark on a trip to the lush islands of the South Pacific.

On their blog - The Rebel Heart - they wrote of excitedly waiting on March 20 for the right conditions before setting sail on the well-stocked boat.

With a toddler just learning to walk,
 and a curious three-year-old on board, the couple knew their voyage 
wouldn't all be plain sailing, but they could never have predicted that 
they would be calling for help so quickly.

In
 her early blog posts about the voyage Mrs Kaufman, a teacher and owner 
of an Etsy baby boutique, wrote about trying to keep a constant watch on
 their girls, as she coped with seasickness.

Day One  I can see the magic of being out to sea, but I can’t really taste it. Our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes, gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer, and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance.

Day Two Our foresail, stay sail, and main sail, hold fast, all strong and white, like our painted wooden mast, and I can feel their excitement to be used like this again; they were made for blue-water sailing, and apparently, so were we.

Day Four Today started out sh**** too. It is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful.

Day Six I can’t possibly describe the range of emotions I have felt so far: anger, joy, sickness, exhaustion, exhilaration, wonder, awe, contentment, peace.

Day Eight I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [but] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life.

Day Eleven When I woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you can’t escape at night.

Day Thirteen Thirteen days at sea ... We are in good spirits, as good as you can be, considering. 

Three days later the family contacted the Coast Guard for help

As
 well as needing space to keep their children entertained, the couple had filled the boat with supplies of cans, dried good, diapers and 
fresh food.

But despite 
choppy conditions, the family were relishing their adventure, singing 
and laughing in the cabin, and showering on deck as their boat glided 
through the Pacific.

On the second day of their voyage, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'It is simple things that excite a crew when out to sea ... like the turtle calmly paddling in the opposite direction as us.'

She also described how she and her husband, who works for a financial services company, gave each other fist bumps when they first realized they could no longer see land in any direction.

But the exotic and remote South Pacific islands where they were headed must have seemed like a distant dream when their youngest daughter fell sick.

The romance of life at sea was replaced with a longing for modern appliances like washing machines that other families rely so heavily on.

In one blog post, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done,' as she described the difficulty of trying to hand wash poopy diapers.

The biggest trial came when Lyra suffered illness for several days, resulting in the family calling for help from the Coast Guard, the UT San Diego reported.

It is not the
 first time the couple have had to rechart their planned course across 
the South Pacific.

They have been slowly circumnavigating the world since buying their boat in 2005 and attempted a different section of the voyage when Mrs Kaufman was pregnant with their second 
child.

Back on dry land: The family are heading back to shore after suffering sickness and boat problems

However, a combination of morning sickness, sea sickness and a toddler in tow meant Mrs Kaufman returned to shore.

As she wrote about the experiences in San Diego Magazine, she mused on how pleased she was to have returned to dry land, after suffering a couple of pregnancy complications which would have been difficult to handle out to sea.

It is not clear if the family will try to embark on their South Pacific adventure again, but the lure of far-flung islands is bound to have them longing for the open ocean before long.
