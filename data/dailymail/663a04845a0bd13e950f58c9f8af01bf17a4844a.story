The woman who viciously stabbed Mary J. Blige's father with a kitchen knife after a heated domestic dispute has been sentenced to prison for the assault.

Cheryl White, 50, stabbed Thomas Blige, 63, three times, including once to the neck, on January 23, after an altercation at his home at the Arbors of Battle Creek apartment complex in Michigan.

White  was sentenced to 365 days in the Calhoun County Jail with credit for 270 days she has already served since her arrest.

According to Battle Creek police, officers had been called out several times to deal with allegations of domestic violence between White and Blige, who appeared to be in a relationship.

Detective Sgt. Jim Martens told the Battle Creek Enquirer that the incident occurred when Blige saw White letting the air out of his tires.

He reportedly confronted her and she fled, but when he caught her she stabbed him with a kitchen knife.

The detective revealed officers found blood in the snow outside before discovering the victim and attacker each in their own homes.

Blige suffered stab wounds to his neck, chest and arm and was taken to Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan to undergo surgery and remained in a critical condition for some time.

But he made a full recovery according to The Detroit Free Press. 

Police had charged White  with assault with intent to commit great bodily harm for the stabbing. 

Care: White has been ordered to pay $17,290 to Mary Jane Productions for Blige's nursing services which were paid for by his daughter, the singer, Mary J Blige, pictured here,

In September, White pleaded no contest to the charge and as part of a plea agreement prosecutors agreed she would not be sentenced to more than a year in jail.

Judge Conrad Sindt accepted the agreement but placed White on five years of probation. 

White has now been ordered to pay $17,290 to Mary Jane Productions for nursing services that his daughter paid for to care for Blige. 

During sentencing, White stood with her  attorneys, Jeffrey and Kimberly Schroder and cried quietly, but she told the judge that she had no comment.

Sindt ordered White not to have any contact with Blige during her probation and to complete all required counseling and mental health treatment.

Blige moved out of state after the incident, officials said, and was not present in Calhoun County Circuit Court when White was sentenced.

Mary, 43, has not commented on the incident.
