Crystal Palace match-winner Wilfried Zaha was all smiles as Stoke City blamed referee Andre Marriner for losing a hard contest compared to rugby Six Nations by victorious manager Alan Pardew.

Zaha, who has been ordered by manager Alan Pardew to cut out his 'little sulks' after an inconsistent season, completed Palace's first top-flight victory at Stoke since 1979 with the winner on the stroke of half-time.

It completed a comeback victory for the visitors but Stoke will felt badly let down by two key decisions having taken an early lead through  Mame Biram Diouf.

First, Asmir Begovic was harshly adjudged to have brought down Yannick Bolasie as Glenn Murray levelled from the spot after 41 minutes. Then, as Stoke chased an equaliser in the second half, Joel Ward got away with blocking Diouf's sot with his arms.

Zaha, left out of Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 squad this week, earned a standing ovation from the noisy Palace fans when he was replaced late on. They are now 11 points above the bottom three and assured of another season in the Premier League.

Pardew, whose side are now above his old club Newcastle in the table, said: 'Wilf had a hard game. The Stoke left back Erik Pieters is a player I tried to sign, he is aggressive and Wilf struggled at times. But he still managed to have his moments.

'The whole game was a physical but fair. It was almost like a Six Nations game at times in terms of its toughness.'

Stoke boss Mark Hughes was justifiably angry at the two key decisions that went against his side.

'When you see the replay for their penalty, the lad Bolasie has got his foot up high above Asmir, that is why Asmir missed the ball. But the referee deemed it a penalty. It was a key moment and Andre Marriner missed a lot of things.

'The handball (by Ward) was arguably the best save of the match, he has got two hands on it for heavens sake. How that isn't given, I don't know.'

Pardew's last visit to the Britannia in September with Newcastle United had ended in defeat and calls for his head.

He had an inauspicious start again when Charlie Adam's 14th minute free-kick ran through a disorganised Palace defence to  Diouf who scored from close range.

The Londoners have won 18 points from losing positions – a Premier League best – and they did it again.

The early signs weren't good when Zaha, ordered to smile more by Pardew, shoved Geoff Cameron after a strong challenge from the American and was booked.

But spirits changed when the equaliser arrived. Bolasie chased a long pass from James McArthur and crashed into Begovic. Stoke were furious the goalkeeper was penalised but Murray ignored the fuss by smashing the spot-kick into the roof of the net.

Improbably, Palace then went ahead when Murray flicked on Speroni's clearance and Zaha accelerated past two defenders to shoot past Begovic. His smile must have looked more than a million dollars to chairman Steve Parish as it effectively guaranteed Premier League survival.

Speroni made great saves from Diouf, with his face, and the excellent Adam as Stoke chased an equaliser. And Diouf reacted furiously when his shot was blocked illegally by Ward.
