The discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of Britain 42,000 years ago.

The researchers discovered that average summer temperatures were about ten degrees Celsius, while in winter temperatures dropped to about minus 22 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, at this time Britain was unrecognisable Arctic tundra covered with shrubs as it was too cold for trees to grow.

The discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of Britain 42,000 years ago

In total, 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw

The study was led by Professor Danielle Schreve, from Royal Holloway, who studied the rhino skeleton, along with other remains found with it, in an attempt to gather evidence on what the environment would have been like at the time.

The rhino skeleton was found in 2002 at Whitemoor Haye sand and gravel quarry in the valley of the River Tame, Staffordshire.

The bones were in excellent condition when they were found meaning that this represented the best example of a woolly rhinoceros found in Britain this century.

In total, 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw, some of the vertebrae and ribs and the major parts of the front limbs.

It is believed that the rhino must have become mired on the boggy edge of a river.

In these conditions the carcass would have frozen quickly before being buried by river sediment.

This explains why the rhino was so well preserved.

The rhino was so well preserved that specimens of its last meal remained in its teeth

Professor Schreve told phys.org: 'This is one of the most significant fossil finds in the last 100 years of a large mammal.

'It's an iconic specimen so it's important to date it, and it correlates well with other specimens from this time in mainland Europe.

â€˜As a result we can tell conditions at this time were very favourable for this species in Britain.'

She went on to explain that the remains of beetles and midges were found alongside the rhino and that this was particularly important as these animals are very sensitive to changes in climate meaning that they give a clear idea of the temperatures at the time.

The findings are published in the Journal of Quaternary Science.
