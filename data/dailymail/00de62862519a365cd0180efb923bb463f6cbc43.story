A force of up to 100 Paras is being sent to join the battle against Islamic State (IS) with authority to shoot and kill when needed.

The elite troops are the first detachment of British soldiers to go to Iraq in a fighting role since 2009.

The Paras’ job will be to protect around 350 British military instructors who are being sent out in January to train the Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga forces.

Shoot to kill: Up to 100 British Paras are being sent to Iraq to join the battle against ISIS 

Should they come under attack from IS, the Paras – expected to be drawn from the regiment’s second battalion – will be authorised to shoot and kill the jihadis.

With the Paras and other international troops providing a ring of steel around the training camps in northern Iraq, the British instructors will seek to improve the skills of the locally raised forces so they can defeat IS in a so-called ‘spring offensive’ pencilled in for April.

British and US commanders are hoping to raise a force of 20,000 Iraqis and Kurds to push back IS forces from strategically significant cities such as Mosul.

They will be backed by air strikes and also drone attacks, which are playing an increasingly critical role in the campaign.

The ramping up of Britain’s training mission in Iraq will be approved by the UK’s National Security Council next week and formally announced by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in Parliament.

Defence sources confirmed last night that the British deployment to Iraq would include a ‘force protection’ element with soldiers being sent there for up to six months.

But last night former British military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge raised concerns that the increase in UK troops would inevitably lead to casualties.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will make the formal announcement in Parliament next week

Mr Ledwidge, who served in Iraq in 2004, said: ‘The British troops will have a big red flag on them and will be a big target for IS.

‘The threat is likely to come from car bombings and suicide attacks so the force protection element of the deployment will need to be proactive.

‘They won’t just be guarding the perimeter of the camp, they’ll have to patrol and interact closely with local security forces. It will be a risky and complex job.

‘This is definitely “mission creep” and if or when UK casualties are taken next year I’d expect to see the size of the British deployment to Iraq increase.

‘Post-Afghanistan the British Army is looking for a new role in order to maintain its sense of purpose and its troop numbers because the Ministry of Defence will not be protected from the sharp cuts in public spending that are on the horizon. So the generals will be thrilled by this deployment.’

The move to increase Britain’s commitment to the war against IS follows a review by UK military advisers. Their conclusions were sent to Mr Fallon.

The Government has insisted repeatedly that the training mission will not constitute ‘boots on the ground’ and in accordance with this policy, the Paras’ role will be strictly defensive. Two months ago a team of 12 soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment were sent to northern Iraq to teach the Peshmerga how to use heavy machine guns.

A UK advisory team is also based in the Iraqi capital Baghdad while, as The Mail on Sunday has exclusively revealed, British Special Forces have conducted a series of attacks against IS and are believed to have killed hundreds of jihadis.

Last week the US announced that it was committing 1,500 troops to training Iraqi forces while up to 400 Australian soldiers and 100 German personnel will also be involved.

These international troops will be confined to training bases but their mere presence will require security procedures to be stepped up.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The Defence Secretary announced the intention to provide further training to the Iraqi military in early November.

‘No decision on troop numbers, units or locations have been made, so this is purely speculation at this stage.’
