Payout: Barclays chief Bob Diamond is set to be given a £10m bonus for his work in 2011

Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond is in line for a £10million bonus, leading to renewed anger about the excessive rewards enjoyed by bankers.

Mr Diamond, once described by Lord Mandelson as ‘the unacceptable face of banking’, is entitled to a bonus in shares of up to seven and a half times his £1.35million salary.

The payout for 2011 is likely to put him at loggerheads with Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is understood to have warned him last week that banking executives must scale back their bumper rewards.

It follows mounting pressure on bankers to assuage the growing public fury towards their industry by showing restraint in the next bonus round, which starts next month. 

Anger: Lord Oakeshott said that the gang of three running Barclays 'just don't get it', while Vince Cable is said to have spoken to Mr Diamond personally to warn him about bumper pay packages

A report published today by accountancy 
firm Ernst & Young predicts unemployment will soar to just under 
three million in the first half of 2013.

But while attention has focused on Mr Diamond, at least two top 
investment bankers at his firm were paid more than him last year and are
 likely to be rewarded again. Rich Ricci and Jerry del Messier were 
given £47million and £44million respectively last year after cashing in 
various share options.

Under tougher reporting rules, Barclays will also be forced to reveal 
how many employees not on the board took home more than £1million. In 
the previous year, there were 230 who fell into this category.

Former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Rather 
than understanding their customers’ pain they are sticking their fingers
 up at the public.’

Britain’s biggest banks are expected to unveil their bonus plans next 
month when they publish their annual results.

The U.S. reporting season 
started on Friday, with JP Morgan Chase revealing an £18.9billion pot 
for pay and bonuses.

Goldman Sachs, which is expected to post its second lowest profits for a
 decade this week, will also announce it is dishing out a bigger 
proportion to its top executives.

Barclays is expected to report profits of between £5.5billion and £6billion for 2011.
