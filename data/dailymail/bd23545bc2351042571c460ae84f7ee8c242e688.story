Novak Djokovic still looks the man to beat at Flushing Meadows after he cruised into the fourth round with a comfortable victory over American Sam Querrey.

The Serb, who won Wimbledon earlier this year, has not been tested in any of his matches so far and needed just an hour and 25 minutes to dispatch Querrey 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.

The American’s serve is his biggest asset but Djokovic was all over it, Querrey winning just 23 per cent of points on his second serve and only 57 per cent on his first.

Light work: Novak Djokovic reached the US Open fourth round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Sam Querrey

Out classed: Big hitting American Sam Querrey (right) was no match for the world No 1

Three and easy? The Serbian top seed has already won the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year

Before the tournament Djokovic, who last won the US Open in 2011, admitted he did not not know how being away from his wife Jelena, who is expecting their first child, would affect him.

However, rivals looking for a lack of focus by the Serb have so far been sorely disappointed.
