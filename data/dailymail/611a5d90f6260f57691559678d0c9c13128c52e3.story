If this is to be Mark Warburton’s final season at Griffin Park then he won’t want any off the field issues derailing their push for promotion.

Reports that Brentford are lining up a new manager for next season regardless of if they are promoted to the Premier League or still in the Championship are understood to have hurt Warburton and he is believed to be keen to stay at the club - but feels he is being forced out.

Brentford refused to deny that they had been talking to potential replacements for Warburton in a statement but said the 52-year-old remained their manager.

And if Warburton was looking for a response then he got one from his players, even if they fell to a late defeat to promotion rivals Watford.

He said: ‘I thought we showed great character and I’m really disappointed for the players to put in that kind of shift and I thought they deserved more.

‘It has been a difficult day and the players have been outstanding. I can’t speak highly enough of them. They work hard every day and they are where they are because they deserve to be there.

‘Those players deserve my focus and there is nothing else than looking after that group of players.

‘I was alerted to the story at 6am when a friend of mine told me, all I can assure everyone is that the focus remains on these players. The board made the statement and it would be disrespectful to these players to say anything else. 

Andre Gray gave Brentford the lead early in the second half after Brentford had been reduced to 10 men before half time but Watford hit back through a Odion Ighalo double.

It took Brentford less than a minute to show their intent in this game as Jonathan Douglas headed over the bar from a Jota cross as the home side went on the attack from the start.

Top scorer Gray then saw his attempt smothered by Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes.

Watford took their time to get into the game, but Troy Deeney posed a threat and had a decent effort from the edge of the box. 

Ben Watson then had an even better shot from 25 yards out but Brentford keeper David Button got down well to his right to tip the ball round the post.

Deeney then got himself in another good position in the box, but took one touch too many allowing James Tarkowski to make a vital interception.

Watford continued the pile on the pressure with Fernando Forestieri going close with a curling shot from the edge of the area.

If Brentford thought they were under pressure with 11 men then things got worse just before half time when left back Bidwell was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Miguel Layun. 

Bidwell’s challenge was late but the Mexico international seemed to make a meal of it and referee Keith Stroud was quick to dismiss the Brentford defender.

But Brentford did not let being a man down affect them as they took the lead early in the second half through Gray.

Gray met Button’s long clearance brilliantly and rifled a shot past Gomes at his near post, and if there was any doubt about how the players felt about Warburton, then they made it clear by running over to the touchline to celebrate with their manager.

Minutes later, Button maintained Brentford’s lead when he saved Deeney’s tame penalty after Jonathan Douglas’ handball.

But he could not prevent Ighalo from levelling with a close range header from Juan Carlos Paredes’ cross as Watford made the extra man count. 

It was no more than Watford deserved and they were keen to make their man advantage count in the final 20 minutes.

First Deeney’s shot was brilliantly saved by Button and then Ighalo’s effort was also kept out by the Bees keeper.

Forestieri then saw his effort come back off the post after a well worked free kick.

But eventually the pressure told as Watford snatched the winner deep into stoppage time when Ighalo turned in substitute Matej Vydra’s cross from six yards out. 

It was a blow for Warburton and Brentford but they are still in the hunt for promotion at the end of the season as are Watford who strengthened their position in the top six.

Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic said: ‘Ighalo is in very good form at the moment. He played very well and if he has the chances he normally puts them in the net.’
