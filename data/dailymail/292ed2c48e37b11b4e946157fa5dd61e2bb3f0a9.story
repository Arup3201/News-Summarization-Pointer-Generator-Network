They already have a hit reality TV show, as well as best-selling fashion, beauty and perfume lines in their hometown of America.

But clearly not content with their stateside success, the Kardashian sisters seem intent on infiltrating the British high-street with their eponymous product ranges.

Kim, Khloe and Kourtney have unveiled the first-ever Kardashian Kollection Jewellery range - for Argos.

They're taking over the world! The Kardashian sisters have unveiled their new jewellery range for Argos

Argos, the store where shoppers choose goods from a lamented catalogue and then sit and wait for them to be delivered via a conveyor belt, are the exclusive stockists of the 25-piece collection.

The range, which will be available from November 11, has apparently been designed by the Kardashian sisters to reflect a mix of their signature styles, as well as a nod to the SS14 catwalks.

Not exactly glamorous: Argos will be stocking the 25-strong collection of jewellery, which features gold chain and gun detailed designs

The collection has three themes: Sleek, Glamour and Modern '80s - and features jewel, chain and gun metal detailing.

Featuring nine necklaces, five bracelets, three rings and eight pairs of earrings, the sisters hope that this new line will be a huge hit with fans up and down the country.

Alice Rigby, Jewellery Buyer for Argos said: 'The Kardashians are famous for their style and have unparalleled knowledge of the latest trends.

Is that where Kanye got the ring from? While Kim's engagement ring is reported to have cost as much as $6m (£3.7m), her range at Argos only goes up to £35

Geometric heart charm long necklace, £24.99

Geometric double charm long necklace, £24.99

KK Sovereign charm necklace, £24.99

KK sovereign charm bracelet, £19.99

Pyramid stretch bracelet, £17.99

KK curb chain necklace, £24.99

'This collection reflects their passion for glamour and style with bold shapes and intricate detailing.

'As the only retailer to sell the entire collection in the UK, Argos is proud to be bringing the collection to UK fans.'

Keeping in line with Argos' purse-friendly price point, The Kardashian Kollection Jewellery will retail up to £35 - a far cry from the reported cost of Kim's engagement ring from Kayne West, which is rumoured to have cost as much as $6m (£3.75m).

The ambitious sisters, who reportedly raked in $250m (£154m) in clothes sales last year alone, already have plans to roll out more jewellery ranges in the store in January, March and May 2014.
