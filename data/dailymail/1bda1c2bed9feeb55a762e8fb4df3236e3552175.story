When a fine art photographer and her boyfriend realised that their beloved American Staffordshire Terrier, Mr Dukes, was in his final stages of cancer, they decided to take him to the beach.

The 11-year-old pooch loved swimming in the family pool and they didn't want him to die before he'd seen the ocean.

Owner Zhenia Bulawka documented the trip to the seaside in Assateague, Maryland, with a series of moving photographs that she posted on a blog.

Ms Bulawka described Mr Dukes (pictured) as her 'best friend and muse' who she 'could never tire of photographing'

'People watching': Ms Bulawka's post tugged on the heartstrings of hundreds who'd read it, with many posting messages of support and admiration

'Ruby was the first to be let off her leash,' wrote Ms Bulawka. 'She entered the water all on her own - proud mama moment. Except she bolted off, heading for shore upon hearing the sounds of the first crashing wave. It's okay… she got back in'

Ms Bulawka wrote that when they arrived 'clouds quickly rolled in, and it started to drizzle... Who cares though? We love the rain!'

They feature the entire family - Ms Bulawka herself, boyfriend Christian, Mr Dukes and the couple's other two dogs Ruby and Violet - and hundreds of people have commented on just how touching the images are.

Ms Bulawka wrote on her blog post: 'My boyfriend Christian, and I took our three pups on an overnight stay at the beach. We dedicated the trip to our 11-year-old American Staffordshire Terrier, Dyuki (Mr Dukes). He was in his final stages of Grade III mast cell cancer at the time. His most favorite activity was swimming in our family pool, but until then, he had never seen the ocean. It was a very special trip for us, and I'm so grateful we were able to make it happen. He passed away a month later, but he put up one hell of a fight - almost two years.'

Of that poignant day at the beach, she said: ‘We were the only ones around, so Ruby was the first to be let off her leash. She entered the water all on her own - proud mama moment. Except she bolted off, heading for shore upon hearing the sounds of the first crashing wave. It's okay… she got back in.'

Describing this photograph, Ms Bulawka wrote: 'Here's Christian sharing his yummy roast beef sandwich with Dukes - onions removed of course'

Here Ms Bulawk is wearing a bracelet she describes as her 'favorite piece of jewelry... a birthday gift from Christian, custom-made for me'. She added: 'If you look closely, you can probably make out which one is Ruby, and which is Dukes - poor Violet'

On her blog Ms Bulawka posted this description of this photograph: 'Wouldn't you know it - the sun came back out after we left. It wasn't a completely clear sky, but just enough for us to witness the most magical sunset from our hotel balcony'

Bed alert: 'Ruby... always the first to fall asleep,' Ms Bulawka wrote on her blog, which has been read hundreds of times

... And Violet is 'always the first one awake'

Companionship: 'Back in time to catch some "funnies" on TV before calling it a night'

The photographs include shots of Mr Dukes eyeing a beef sandwich, Ruby running out of the sea and Ms Bulawka and her three dogs ‘people watching’. 

She continued: 'Dukes was my best friend. He was also my muse, as his passion for life served as a constant source of inspiration to me. I could never tire of photographing him. Since his passing, I've been told numerous times "how lucky Dukes was to have me." But in fact, it was me who was so lucky to have him. He was the smartest, funniest, most loyal, incredibly strong, yet equally sensitive dog - all wrapped into one perfect pittie package.'

Ms Bulawka's post tugged on the heartstrings of hundreds who'd read it, with many posting messages of support and admiration. 

Jennifer SkarLett Brown wrote: 'This is an amazing and beautiful story. I definitely understand. Animals are such an inspiration and very therapeutic.'

Another animal lover, Letisia Lopez, wrote: 'It was a wonderful thing that you did for your pet,'

Alafair Lee Robicheaux was also touched, writing: 'I am bawling, what a beautiful story, what a great vacation for a dying boy.'

Ms Bulawka added: 'Mr Dukes changed my life and I will miss him forever.'
