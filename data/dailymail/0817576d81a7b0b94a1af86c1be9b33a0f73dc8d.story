A British magazine has apologised and pulled their February issue after seemingly copying a distinctive front page tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings.

The cover of Bath Magazine’s February issue features dozens of running shoes arranged in a heart shape to promote the Somerset city’s upcoming half marathon.

But the design is nearly identical to one used by the Boston Magazine to honor the three people killed and more than 250 injured when the U.S. race was targeted by terrorists.

Insensitive: The Bath Magazine has provoked outrage with a front cover that copies the design of a tribute issue by Boston magazine commemorating those killed in 2013's terrorist atrocity

The cover - which featured real trainers used by runners in the doomed race - raised more than $125,000 for those injured by the atrocity last year.

Boston Magazine editor Carly Carioli is now demanding its Bath counterpart make a ‘significant donation’ to the fund.

In a scathing web message posted on its website addressed to The Bath Magazine he said: ‘Last spring, as we tried to figure out how best to honor the resilience of our city in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, we asked runners to lend us the shoes they wore in the race.

‘In turn, their shoes, and the cover we produced, helped us to raise over $125,000 for the One Fund, the charity established here to benefit those affected by the bombing.

‘You liked the shoes cover so much that you borrowed (others have used less charitable phrases) the concept for your February issue on the half marathon in Bath.

‘We can’t speak for the dozens of runners who donated their shoes to us for that image.

‘We can’t speak for the runners who are preparing to run this April.

‘But we hope that if you were so bold as to borrow our idea, you will also borrow the spirit of that cover - and make a significant donation to the One Fund in the name of those who were unable to finish the race.’

At first the Bath Magazine tweeted an apology - but did not say whether it would make a donation to the fund.

A message sent on Tuesday said: ‘We would like to make an unreserved apology for any upset or offence caused by our latest cover. This was clearly not our intention.

‘We are truly sorry and embarrassed for what has happened. We shall be looking into this immediately and post a full apology in due course.’

Americans took to Twitter to slam the stunt.

Sarah Dugan from Massachusetts said: ‘What an amazingly insensitive "apology" I hope Mitch Feinberg [the photographer] holds you accountable for copyright infringement.’

S.I. Rosenbaum from Boston tweeted the Bath organisers and said: ‘Hey Bath, who died in your marathon?’

Responding to the online backlash, the magazine tweeted added: ‘We don’t mean to bring up bad memories, just supporting our runners in Bath.’

But it only served to provoke outrage from one Boston resident who said: ‘Boston Marathon killed three people and injured at least 264. "Bad memories"? Are you KIDDING ME?’

Si Rosenbaum replied: ‘By ripping off a cover we made to honor the victims of the marathon bombing? Nice one.’

Condemnation was echoed on this side of the Atlantic by John Maggs, from Bristol, who said: ‘It’s inappropriate to copy a tribute to people who have died to advertise tourism.’

Gus Hoyt from Bristol added: ‘Will the Bath Magazine now face a boycott similar to Liverpool’s boycott of The Sun? For a cover and ‘justification’ like that, it’s due.’

The Bath Magazine eventually published an open letter of apology from publisher Steve Miklos to the Boston magazine on its website.

It said: 'Late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the Boston magazine cover, and while we were inspired by it, we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the States.

'Our intention was to create a front cover that reflected the twin themes of the inclusive nature of the Bath Half marathon and Valentine, this being our February issue. So we had the idea to feature a heart on the cover but with a running theme coupled with the message on loving the Bath Half. We started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries, then we decided to create our own.'

The letter stated that the magazine would be making a contribution to the Boston One Fund and asked the city to 'accept our apology from one community to another'.

However, some considered this second apology offensive, too.

Manda Raper wrote: 'I'm from Boston and honestly I don't believe this is a sincere apology. You're like a child who got got caught taking a cookie from the sweets jar. I know it's a business but next time be more considerate.'

A final tweet on Wednesday afternoon from the magazine said that they would be pulling the edition and reprinting it with a different image on the front.

'Open letter to the Boston Magazine:

The Bath Magazine publisher Steve Miklos would like to offer his sincere apologies to anyone who found the similarity between our image and the Boston Magazine cover in any way upsetting, as clearly we did not wish to cause any offence.

We are proud to be supporters of the Bath Half marathon, and indeed members of our staff are running in this year’s race. Our intention was to create a front cover that reflected the twin themes of the inclusive nature of the Bath Half marathon and Valentine, this being our February issue. So we had the idea to feature a heart on the cover but with a running theme coupled with the message on loving the Bath Half. We started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries, then we decided to create our own.

We invited runners to lend their trainers for our photograph and interviewed them about their motives for running the half marathon. You can read some of these moving and inspirational tales inside the magazine.

Mr Miklos said: 'Late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the Boston Magazine cover, and while we were inspired by it, we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the States.'

'On a personal note, I ran the half marathon last year during which time I met many runners, each with their own battle to fight and individually determined to finish. Some had suffered personal tragedies and were doing what they could to raise money and beat their own demons.

'I am running the Bath Half on March 2nd and as well as supporting many of our local charities, the magazine will be making a contribution to the Boston One Fund.'

Please accept our apology from one community to another and accept that our intentions were well meant.'
