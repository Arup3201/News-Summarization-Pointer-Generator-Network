George Osborne is banking on the British public maxing out credit cards in a £360billion spending spree to make his figures add up.

By the end of the decade, official forecasts expect us to have run up almost £800billion in unsecured loans, overdrafts and credit cards, up from just £430billion today.

The huge increase in household debt is required to fuel the economic growth which the Chancellor hopes will help to balance the books by 2018.

By 2020, unsecured household debt is expected to reach almost £800billion, up from just £430billion this year

It means that families’ unsecured loans will account for 55 per cent of total household incomes by 2020.

The Office for Budget Responsibility this week said it expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year, then 2.4 per cent in 2015, 2.2 per cent in 2016, then 2.4 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent in subsequent years.

Getting more people into work and improving productivity will help boost tax revenues and cut borrowing, but up to £30billion of savings will need to be found to eradicate the deficit as planned.

Now it has emerged that part of the growth will be fuelled by a boom in personal debt over the next five years.

If the spending fails to materialise, it means growth could come in lower.

The OBR now expects an extra £360billion in unsecured loans by 2020, which is £41billion higher than its forecast in March this year.

It means families’ unsecured loans will account for 55 per cent of total household incomes by 2020.

Even before the financial crash the peak was only 44 per cent.

Chancellor George Osborne is hoping a boom in mortgages and personal debt will fuel growth

The OBR also forecasts a sharp increase in the value of secured loans, such as mortgages, by 2020

Matthew Whittaker, of the Resolution Foundation think-tank said: ‘The idea that households are either willing or able to take on so much new debt at such a rapid pace is questionable at best and highlights significant imbalances in the shape of the economic recovery.

‘The apparent reliance of economic growth in the coming years on another surge in private debt should worry economists and politicians alike,’ he told The Independent.

The warning came as Mr Osborne was told he will have to impose spending cuts ‘on a colossal scale’ to meet his targets.

The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor would have to slash welfare or put up taxes by £21billion just to keep cuts down to the same level as Britain has seen in the past five years.

Without this, £55billion in cuts will be needed after next May’s election if the Tories win, compared with the £35billion made since the Coalition came to power in 2010.

The respected think-tank suggested cuts on this scale would mean a ‘fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state’.

It urged Mr Osborne to spell out before the election what the cuts would mean for public services such as transport, policing and defence.

IFS director Paul Johnson said: ‘It is surely incumbent upon anyone set on taking the size of the state to its smallest in many generations to tell us what that means. 

'How will these cuts be implemented? What will local government, the defence force, the transport system look like in this world? 

‘One thing is for sure. If we move in anything like this direction, whilst continuing to protect health and pensions, the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond all recognition.’
