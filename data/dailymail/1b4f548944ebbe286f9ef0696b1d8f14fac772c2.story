The sound of the trumpet can be a love hate thing and for Bandit the dog it's certainly the latter.

His owner filmed him as she played a song on her brass instrument at home in Minnesota. 

Immediately as she starts sounding notes, Bandit cocks his head to one side before getting up and scampering away.

At one point he goes up to the trumpet and gives it a sniff.

But he quickly decides it's not something he wants to be close to. 

YouTube user ponygirl5100 says after she filmed Bandit in action she put her trumpet away and reassured him that it was okay.

Bandit is a Belgian Shepherd Dog just over one year old. 

Other videos show him up to various antics including learning how to swim and 'having fun' in his water dish.
