A bride-to-be was killed in an horrific road smash as she begged a deranged drunk driver to stop chasing a gang of racists at speeds of up to 90mph.

Neringa Kairyte, 27, was a front seat passenger when Lithuanian national Gytis Masiulis, 35, snapped and began pursing another car after the occupants hurled racial abuse at him.

As Masiulis drove 'like an idiot' after the other car, Miss Kairyte, her fiance and a third passenger urged him to stop with one holding his head in his hands in despair.

Tragedy struck when he lost control of his Opel Vectra car and ploughed into a wall ended up on its side in a garden.

Warehouse packer Miss Kairyte, from Deeside in Flintshire, North Wales who had been planning her wedding and was described as a 'shy, loving person' with a 'wonderful personality' suffered multiple injuries after being thrown from the vehicle.

She was declared dead at the scene whilst her fiancee suffered leg injuries in the accident. He now faces the heartbreak of taking her ashes back to her parents in her native Lithuania.

Details of the tragedy which happened on the B5441 near Connahâ€™s Key on last month emerged as chicken factory worker Masiulis was jailed for five and a half years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

He was also banned from the roads for six years.

In a statement Miss Kairyte's fiance Audrius Ubartas said he 'lost the love of his life.' and told how they were planning to wed next year and start a family.

The couple met her over the internet when he was living in Lithuania and she was already settled in the UK. They began a relationship when he came over to Britain to surprise her, they fell in love and lived together for six months.

He said: 'We were saving for a car and starting to save for a wedding next year because we wanted to start a family together. She would constantly talk about how she wanted to be a mum and how she dreamed of having a family.

'She was such a warm person and her death has turned my life upside down and caused me great grief. I still feel empty and lonely without her.'

He said her parents were struggling to come to terms with her loss and he felt guilty he could not have done more to save her.

They were moving from the house which they shared because of all the memories and he said he could not forgive Masiulis because of the pain and suffering he and her family had been caused.

Mold Crown Court was told the accident happened on June 8 after Masiulis had spent the afternoon drinking at a barbecue.

He went an Asda store with Miss Kairyte, Mr Ubartas and another friend to get more drink only to find the store was shut at 11pm.

An unidentified car was seen to leave at the same time and at the red traffic lights it was claimed the occupants shouted racist remarks.

Masiulus was said to have become aggressive and pursued the other car - ignoring warnings to slow down.

The couple and two other passengers were thrown around in their seats as they went around bends at high speed and they feared an accident was 'inevitable.'

He lost control of the car on a right hand bend, the car left the road and hit a brick pillar, fencing and a wall, before overturning and coming to rest on its side in a garden. Masiulis was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital with minor injuries.

Tests carried out three hours after the crash showed Masiulus had 100 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood. The legal limit is 80mg.

In interview he denied chasing the other car, and blamed a rock or a pothole for the accident. But Judge Niclas Parry told him: 'Having been goaded by nothing more than verbal abuse, you decided that you would give chase.

'You ignored sensible advice of those in the car with you that you should simply leave it and you quite deliberately decided to embark upon aggressive driving at high speed.

'The occupants of the car were terrified. They were begging you to stop. Your driving was described as idiotic, crazy and horrible.'

After the case Ch Insp Darren Wareing of North Wales Police said: 'Driving in such a dangerous and irresponsible manner resulted in the death of an innocent young woman. Justice has been done and the sentence reflects the seriousness of this offence.'
