A Houston man who was scheduled to fly on the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is alive and accounted for after deciding to cancel his trip to Beijing at the last minute.

Malaysia Airlines flight 370 had 239 people on board when it vanished off radar screens early Saturday morning, leaving no clue as to where it crashed or even landed.

Greg Candelaria, 57, got a text message alert about the missing plane while out to dinner with his wife Brooke and quickly realized he had a boarding pass for that exact flight.

'We freaked out,' Candelaria told the Houston Chronicle. 'Brooke lost all the color in her face, and a waiter who knows us well came over and said, "Are you all right?"'

The IBM employee was scheduled to speak at a company sales conference in Beijing, but cancelled the trip a few weeks ago because it would involve a 45-hour travel schedule.

Cancelling the trip was no easy decision for Candelaria, who missed out on a chance to see his new granddaughter for the first time.

One of his three adult daughters is currently in China finalizing an adoption.

'I would have got to meet my brand new granddaughter this week in Beijing,' he said. 'That tells you how tired I was.'

Candelaria told KTRK that after flying 4million miles in the past 30 years, he's experienced emergency landings, bomb scares, and 13 missed approaches - none of which compare to this 'freaky' brush with death.

He credits his survival to the 'providence of God'.

'The very grace of God and nothing more,' Candelaria said. 'It wasn't a conincidence it was by design.'

But one of Candelaria's co-workers wasn't so lucky. Fellow IBM employee Philip Wood, 50, was one of three Americans on the flight.

Wood's girlfriend Sarah Bajc, 48, sent a car to the Beijing airport to pick him up but he never arrived. 

'I'm
 personally not willing to give up hope that there's a chance we'll find
 survivors, that we'll find the plane,' an optimistic Bacj told CBS News. 'There just has to be a chance.'

Candelaria's wife Brooke still shudders at the thought she could have lost her husband.

She told Click 2 Houston she feels 'incredibly blessed and relieved' and is looking forward to their next anniversary.

The couple have an upcoming business trip to Brazil and say they won't be deterred from flying.
