Oscar Pistorius is embroiled in fresh controversy with prosecution claims that testosterone was found alongside needles in his bedroom.

Although his defence denied it and the claim pales into insignificance beside his murder charge, accusations of cheating would further diminish his standing.

His lawyer Barry Roux said the substance was actually a herbal remedy, Testocompasutium co-enzyme, and was not on any banned lists.

Confirmation is awaited on precisely what the substance is.

Back in court: Oscar Pistorius on second day of bail hearing

However, testosterone is banned in 
sport because it boosts strength and increases muscle mass and gives 
athletes faster recovery times.

In its various anabolic steroid forms
- which can be administered orally, via injection or in a cream - it is
outlawed globally by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

A spokeswoman for UK Anti-Doping, 
responsible for protecting UK sport from doping, said it was a violation
to be found in possession, using, trafficking or administering 
performance-enhancing substances.

If any evidence emerged that the 
defendant, dubbed Blade Runner because of his prosthetic carbon fibre 
legs, did possess testosterone and was using it for some time he would 
face an investigation and the possible stripping of his 2012 Paralympic 
medals.

The International Paralympic 
Committee tested Pistorius during the Paralympics and found no drugs in 
his system, it was reported.

Meanwhile, his bail hearing was told today that 'non-stop shouting' was heard coming from Pistorius' home before his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead.

Model Miss Steenkamp, aged 29, was shot three times in her arm, hip and head.

The details were revealed as the second day of the 26-year-old athlete's bail hearing began at Pretoria Magistrates' Court.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the 
prosecution team had a witness who heard shouting coming from the 
property at the exclusive Silver Lakes Golf Estate between 2am and 3am.

Shortly afterwards Miss Steenkamp lay
bleeding to death in Pistorius's bathroom hit by three bullets, one in 
the head, the hip and arm, Pretoria Magistrates' Court heard.

Pistorius
has admitted shooting her with a 9mm pistol but said he thought a 
burglar or burglars were in the bathroom and he did not intend to shoot 
the model.

The athlete has 
said he believed intruders were in his house so he fired through the 
bathroom door in the dark as he was too scared to turn the light on.

Discovering his mistake, he broke the door down with a cricket bat and carried her downstairs, he has said.

But today, the second day of his bail 
application, investigating officer Hilton Botha said the prosecution 
also have a witness who said the lights were on after hearing gunshots.

Lawyers and police studied plans of the bedroom and bathroom.

A projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see.

Mr Botha said there was 'no way' he believed Pistorius's version of events.

The runner has said he shot through the door while on his stumps but the
court heard the bullets' trajectory was through the top of the door.

Mr Botha said he believed the bullets were fired down, suggesting that 
Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were 
discharged.

He said: 'I believe he knew she was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door.'

The court heard that two mobile phones were seized at the property and neither had been used to call the police or paramedics.

The court also heard today that two boxes of testosterone and needles were found in Pistorius's bedroom.

And details were released of a row he allegedly had with a man over a 
girl at Kyalami racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to 'f*** 
up' the rival.

It was also claimed he was involved in another shooting at a restaurant 
in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take 
responsibility for the incident.

Mr Botha said he wanted Pistorius charged additionally with a weapons 
violation after unlicensed .38 calibre ammunition was found at the 
house.

The athlete - who was sobbing this morning in court - made notes with a silver pen as the case progressed.

He told officials he had been a victim of crime and received death 
threats, but today the court heard there were no records of this.

In an affidavit, Pistorius has denied murdering the law graduate at his home in the early hours of Thursday.

He has said they were in love and he thought Miss Steenkamp was in bed when he got up in the dark and blasted through the door.

Pistorius's lawyer Barry Roux said it was not testosterone but a herbal remedy discovered in his client's bedroom.

Cross-examining Mr Botha, Mr Roux said a post-mortem examination showed Miss Steenkamp's bladder was empty.

He said that was consistent with her getting up at 3am to go to the toilet.

Mr Roux asked repeatedly why the police did not make simple checks - over the lighting and whether Pistorius had other phones.

The lawyer said Pistorius phoned the housing complex manager for help at 3.19am then Netcare hospital a minute later.

Mr Roux said the police discarded anything that might have been consistent with a defence.
Officers found the victim covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top.

Prosecutors believe Pistorius, who won two gold medals and a silver at 
London's 2012 Paralympic Games, is a flight risk and oppose bail.

Mr Botha said Pistorius, who had below-the-knee amputations when 
he was 11 months old, has offshore accounts and a property in Italy.

One witness said he heard a shot, followed 17 minutes later by more shots, Mr Botha said.'One of our witnesses heard a fight, two people talking loudly at each other ... from two in the morning to three,' he said, adding that the witness was about 1,000ft away.

Members of the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress protested outside the red-brick court, waving placards saying 'No Bail for Pistorius' and 'Rot in jail'.

The case has stunned sports fans worldwide.

But it has been felt most acutely in South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a hero who transcended racial divides that persist nearly 20 years after the end of apartheid.

He carried South Africa's flag at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and American magazine Sports Illustrated named him as one of the most inspiring figures of the year.

The sprinter's endorsements and sponsorships included Nike, telecoms firm BT, sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler and were thought to be worth as much as two million US dollars (£1.3 million) a year.

Nike and Mugler both said they have dropped Pistorius from advertising campaigns, and Clarins cosmetics firm said it was recalling its A Man perfume range out of 'respect and compassion towards the families involved'.

The hearing was adjourned to tomorrow morning when a decision over bail might be made.

The court will resume at 11am in Pretoria (9am GMT).
