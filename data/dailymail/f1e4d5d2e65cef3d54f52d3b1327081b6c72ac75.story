The parents of a five-year-old girl who was snatched from her bed in the night faced down the man who tried to kidnap her in court on Tuesday. 

Suspect Troy Morley appeared in court for the first time in Salt Lake City, Utah, where his lawyer said he would seek an exam to determine his client's competency for trial.

Morley, 48, stood before the judge dressed in a yellow jumpsuit with his hands shackled behind him. He appeared calm and acknowledged in a level voice that he understood the charges against him.

'He's doing better today than he was last week, I can tell you that,' Kraft said. 'As far as I know, to this point, he's been a pretty good citizen until this case.'

Police said the girl's stepfather foiled the attempted kidnapping when he awoke and confronted Morley.

Parents Stephanie and Aaron Edson attended Tuesday's hearing but they did not take questions from reporters.

Prosecutor Nathan Evershed said the couple wanted to see the court process unfold. The girl is recovering, he added. 

'We've spoken with the parents, and she's doing fine,' Evershed said. 'They're very happy that the defendant has a pretty good-sized bail, and they're happy that he's in custody, and they're just trying to heal.'

Police said Morley came into the house through an unlocked door and snatched the girl early on November 7. 

The sound woke the couple, who confronted the intruder. Morley handed her back without a fight, and he was caught a few blocks away in Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City, authorities said. 

Morley is charged with felony child kidnapping, which has a maximum possible sentence of life in prison

He is charged with felony child kidnapping, which has a maximum possible sentence of life in prison. Morley also faces charges of burglary, criminal trespassing and interfering with an officer.

Utah court records show a pair of divorces and DUI charges in Morley's past. His neighbors in the northern Utah town of Roy said he had been caught sneaking into back yards, and they had bizarre and inappropriate encounters with him.

Morley is being held on $2 million bail.

Judge Bruce Lubeck set a new hearing in the case for December 2.
