Almost 50 people were rescued this afternoon after a birdwatching boat hit a rock off the Pembrokeshire coast and began to sink.

The Lady Helen sent out a mayday call just before 1pm saying it had run aground at Little Sound, part of Skomer Island and was taking on water.

A massive rescue operation was launched by coastguards with five smaller vessels - including its sister boat the Dale Princess - also joining in.

began to sink

The stricken vessel was pulled from the rocks by one of the boats and towed into safe water before the passengers - including children and elderly people - were taken off.

About 40 of the passengers - who were given lifejackets - were transported onto the small boats.

Speaking to The Sun, rescued birdwatcher Robert Watson, 48, 
said: 'It was a bit frightening, we heard a sort of crunching noise and 
the boat came to a stop, although the engine was still running.

'The crew were very professional - they kept everyone calm and we didnâ€™t
have to wait more than a few minutes before we could see the first of 
the rescue boats.

'But everyone was asking how we managed to hit the rocks - the boat has 
been back and forth from the mainland thousands of times.'

Pembrokeshire GP Dr Pauline Smith told the BBC she picked up passengers on her friend's boat. They were on their way out to go scuba diving when they heard the mayday call.

She said: 'We had quite a few children and elderly ladies on our boat.

'The children were initially a bit scared. They said the boat had been listing.

'But once we gave them a Twix each they were fine.'

Local lifeboats, a police boat and
an RAF rescue helicopter from north Devon all attended.

All the 48 passengers and crew were rescued safely by other vessels .

Rob James, watch officer with Milford Haven coastguard, said: 'It was a big rescue operation.

'It had the potential to have a very nasty outcome if the rescuers did not act as they did.

There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew, a Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said.

Thousands of people take day trips to Skomer every year, including many birdwatchers.
