A teenager has filmed the dramatic moment a stray firework exploded on the road in front of him and almost knocked him off his motorcycle.

Joe Furness was showered with sparks and his bike was left with burn marks when the explosive went off unexpectedly.

The explosion was captured on a helmet camera worn by the 18-year-old - the first time he had ever used the technology after borrowing it from a friend.

Dramatic: Joe Furness filmed video of a stray firework exploding in the road in Manchester

Danger: Sparks flew and burned the teenager's motorbike, but luckily no one was seriously hurt in the incident

The gap-year student was travelling through Manchester from a friend's house when the firework shot out from a restaurant where some people were celebrating a wedding.

It exploded under a bus on the opposite side of the road to Joe, and nearly sent him off his silver Yamaha scooter.

The vehicle was left with burn marks on its paintwork and tyres - but the teenager says he is lucky he was not badly injured.

Joe, who is due to study law and criminology at Manchester University, had been for a curry with a friend in the Cheetham Hill area and was returning to his home in Mossley.

Lucky: Joe had never worn a helmet camera before capturing video of the exciting explosion

The firework which disrupted his journey was apparently not fired deliberately, but was let off from a restaurant on the route.

On the video it can be seen arching across the road and landing under a bus travelling in the opposite direction before exploding under the vehicle's engine.

A shower of sparks then fall over Joe and his scooter.

'I had just turned left onto Cheetham Hill Road when I heard a wooshing noise and saw the firework,' he said.

'I looked round then looked right and it exploded under the bus. I had a helmet on but was only wearing a t-shirt on so could feel the sparks burning on my skin.

'Unfortunately it's left burn marks on my scooter but I am just glad I wasn't a second ahead or it could have gone right into me.

'It was the first time I'd borrowed a helmet cam though and to catch that on it is quite cool.

'It all happened so quickly but when I watched it back later I was shocked.'
