Accused: Eric Joyce was allegedly involved in a confrontation with police and airport staff after leaving his mobile phone on a plane

Disgraced MP Eric Joyce has been arrested after allegedly pushing a police officer at Edinburgh Airport in a row over his mobile.

Joyce, 52, had apparently left his mobile on an aeroplane after arriving on a flight from London and is said to have become abusive when he was not allowed to retrieve it immediately.

Airport staff called in police and the MP allegedly ended up on the floor in the ensuing scuffle before being arrested.

An eyewitness claimed seeing a passenger 'shouting and swearing' at officers after the plane arrived on Sunday.

The former Labour MP is facing charges of breaching the peace following the alleged incident.

He is currently serving as an independent after resigning from his party in disgrace.

Joyce was previously arrested in March this year after allegedly being involved in a fracas in the Houses of Parliament.

The MP was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers and loaded into a police van, and was banned from buying alcohol within the premises. However, he was later told he would face no charges over the incident.

A source today told the Edinburgh Evening News: 'The handling agents called the police after a passenger became abusive towards them.

'When the police arrived the passenger seemed to push one of the officers. The officers attempted to calm him down but he became more and more aggressive.

'The officers then pushed him up against the desk and down on to the floor, where he was handcuffed. A policeman was on top of him, with his knee at the back of his neck.'

A tweet posted on Sunday night by Mr 
Joyce, part of a conversation the MP was having with two other users, 
reads: 'A’ve goat te get (insert glottal stop) oan this plane. As you 
plucky westerners like to say.'

Disgrace: Former Labour MP Eric Joyce is now sitting in the House of Commons as an independent

Today an airport spokesman said: 'We can confirm that an incident did occur on Sunday evening and an individual was arrested for being abusive and confrontational towards airport staff and police.

'Behaviour of this nature is something we have zero tolerance for at Edinburgh Airport and police officers will act accordingly if the safety of our passengers and employees is put at risk.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'A 52-year-old man has been reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with an alleged breach of the peace, which happened at Edinburgh Airport on Sunday May 19.'

Joyce was first elected as MP for Falkirk in 2000, the year after he resigned his post as a major in the Army, after publicly insinuating that the armed forces were racist, sexist and discriminatory.

He regularly topped the MPs’ expenses table from 2005-6 until last year and in 2009-10 became the first MP to claim over £200,000.

In 2010 he resigned as Shadow Northern Ireland Minister after being banned from the roads for a year for drink-driving.

He admitted refusing to take a breathalyser after an unexplained accident near a petrochemical plant in Grangemouth.

Labour are in the process of selecting a new candidate to stand for Mr Joyce's seat at the next election after he resigned from the party.

However, the party suspended the process following concerns about 'membership recruitment' earlier this month.

The move follows reports that the Unite trade union had recruited dozens of new members in Falkirk, potentially giving it the chance to influence the choice of parliamentary candidate.

Eric Joyce has not responded to requests to comment about his arrest.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
