Eight women who went missing in Cabo San Lucas in the aftermath of the disastrous Hurricane Odile, finally made contact with their family Wednesday night after flying to San Diego. 

The group traveled to Mexico last Thursday from Fresno to celebrate a bachelorette party, and arrived at the Villa Del Arco hotel just three days before Odile struck.

'They didn't know how bad it was going to be, and by the time they got there, it got worse,' Shaun Sumpter, whose wife Crystal was on the trip, told NBC News.

Their families have spent the past two days frantically trying to track them down, calling Red Cross, American consulate and State Department to no avail.

They were finally able to breathe a sign of relief when Wednesday night, the group called to say they were safely back in the U.S. and had landed in San San Diego. 

The group were among the 30,000 foreign tourists left stranded after the Category 3 hurricane hit the resort state and left many without power and clean drinking water. 

And now Baja California Sur is bracing for yet another hurricane. On Wednesday night, Tropical Storm Polo was upgraded to a hurricane, and is expected to pass by the southern tip of the Western Mexican state on Saturday. 

Thankfully, meteorologists predict that the hurricane will remain off shore, travelling in a northwest route parallel to the peninsula. 

Locals in the area are still struggling to put their city back together. 

Residents continue to struggle with a lack of power and drinking water and formed long lines for emergency supplies. There were several scattered reports of looting.

Huge waves follow Hurricane Odile. Locals in the area are still struggling to put their city back together as residents continue to struggle with a lack of power and drinking water and formed long lines for emergency supplies. There were several scattered reports of looting.

Tourists, meanwhile, were ferried on military and commercial planes through the Los Cabos international airport, which remained closed to commercial flights due to damage suffered when Odile tore through the area late on Sunday and Monday.

Travelers have been flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights. Some 685 U.S. tourists arriving in Tijuana were taken to the border late Tuesday to return home. 

Carla Tapia of Mexicali, Mexico, said her family was given priority at the airport because they have two young children. Still, the wait was about six hours to get out.

'The destruction carried on for hours,' she said of the hurricane. 'It's really a mess now.'

Fatai Oshi-Ojuri, a tourist from Oakland, California, who came to Mexico with his girlfriend to celebrate his 30th birthday, was among the first to get out on a Federal Police jet.

It now heads for the Sea of Cortes in Mexican state of Sonora. About 26,000 tourists were affected by Odile

He said the airport in Los Cabos was a mess with roof panels and electrical wiring down, and signs and windows shattered. 

'That was like a scene from 'The Walking Dead,'' he said by phone from Mazatlan, where he was waiting for an Alaska Airlines flight to Los Angeles.

On Tuesday, officials estimated it would take two days to ferry out the 30,000 tourists who were being put up in temporary refuges or hotel areas converted to shelters. Some 26,000 of those were foreigners, primarily from the United States, Canada and Great Britain.

A boat was on its way with humanitarian aid for thousands in the state of Baja California Sur without services, and authorities were working to restore utilities.

Emergency officials in Baja California reported that 135 people were treated for minor injuries. But surprisingly for a hurricane of this intensity there were no reports so far of fatalities directly related to Odile.
