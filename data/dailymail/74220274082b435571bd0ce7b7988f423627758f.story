Care worker Melissa Swift admitted trying to kill three of her colleagues by poisoning them with bleach

A care home worker could be jailed for life after admitting trying to kill three of her colleagues by poisoning them with bleach.

Melissa Swift pleaded guilty to attempting to murder her co-workers at Goldfield Court in West Bromwich in July and August last year.

The 23-year-old was arrested after 32 people showed signs of food poisoning at the home which provides care for the elderly. 

She had tried to spread a 'bleach-type oxidant' in her colleagues' drinks, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

The fridge was in a communal area which may have been accessed by residents at the home. 

Swift - a former police special constable - also admitted to sending two letters threatening to kill the recipients, of which one was sent to her sister, Lulla Swift.

Swift admitted three counts of attempted murder - which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison - and two counts of threatening to kill at Birmingham Crown Court today. 

The court heard how Swift was attempting to kill three colleagues - Amy Garbett, Billy McCann, and Sharon Moss - by poisoning them when dozens took ill at the home in August.

Adrian Keeling, prosecuting, said: 'It's the case she intended to poison three of her colleagues at Goldfield Court, and made threats to kill on two other individuals.'

She was arrested in August after 32 people suffered headaches, nausea and diarrhoea at the home. 

Police searched the home and seized 400 drinks and food items from fridges in communal and private areas.

Among those who took ill was a resident in her 90s. Four people were hospitalised as a result of the incident though all made a good recovery. 

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Michaela Kerr, who led the investigation, said Swift's offending against 'vulnerable people in a care home setting' was 'particularly heinous'. 

Officers launched an inquiry when they had a tip-off regarding Swift about 'a change in her behaviour'.

DCI Kerr said: 'She told someone things like 'I feel like I'm going to hurt somebody', and 'I'm going to hurt people'.'

It also emerged that Swift had been a special constable with West Midlands Police until the month prior to her arrest, when she resigned. 

DCI Kerr added that Swift 'deceived her colleagues and hatched a plan to cause ill to those she worked with as a result of some malice, for which we have never truly discovered the cause'. 

She said: 'She not only thought out a way of poisoning her workmates but also followed the plan through and administered bleach to their drinks, leaving them in the usual staff fridge where she knew they would go.

'The plan was dangerous, reckless and hugely alarming. We do know that the poisons were administered into drinks that everybody in that care home had access to.' 

'There is nothing to have stopped anyone from consuming the drinks she tampered with and, given the nature of her profession and workplace as a care provider, she went against everything her dedicated colleagues worked for.

'Thankfully, no one was seriously injured as a result of what she did, but the story could so easily have been different.'

Care home resident Brenda Stephenson, 89, a grandmother-of-four who has lived at the home for two and a half years, said: 'She was always really nice and polite and seemed to enjoy her job as far as I could see.

'But you never know how people really feel on the inside and she was very quiet. Nobody could believe it when she was arrested, it shocked everybody here.

'If you can't trust carers, who can you trust? She deserved everything she gets.

'We had police here going through all our fridges at the time, it was very surreal and extremely concerning. You expect carers to care for you, not to try and kill you.'

Another resident Michael Peach, 72, who has lived at the care home for two years, added: 'Police emptied our fridges and they just left my loaf of bread.

'They even took my jellied eels. I am really shocked by it all.' 

Goldfield Court is described as 'extra care housing' for older people. There are 93 flats at the site, run by Housing & Care 21.

The development includes lounges, a restaurant, a hair salon, a guest suite, an activity room and gardens for residents.

Flats can be rented rented or purchased under a shared ownership scheme and start at more than £33,000 for a quarter share and £107,000 for a 75 per cent share.

In its most recent inspection of the sheltered housing complex, independent regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the site was meeting all standards.

A routine inspection carried out in October last year concluded the measures in place 'protected people who lived there from the risk of harm and abuse'. 

Swift, who was remanded in custody, will be sentenced in April.
