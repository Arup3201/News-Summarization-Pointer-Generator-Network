For 50 years the Hartland carnival march has been accompanied by the sprightly sound of the town’s brass band.

But this year, for the very first time, the band will not be marching. They have been stopped in their tracks by potholes.

Concentrating on their instruments and reading music means they will not be able to pay attention to dodging holes in the road.

Concern: The musicians say they could trip over the potholes while playing their instruments 

The town is already known by locals as a dangerous place to walk or cycle, but the musicians are even more concerned because they are unable to watch the road while reading music.  

The band's chairman Charlie Jeffrey has written to Devon County Council, saying that the roads are so bad they are pulling out of the Hartland Carnival scheduled for August 9.  

'Hartland Town Band is one of the many organisations in this rural community which provides the glue which holds the community together,' he wrote.  

'This year is a centenary of the Hartland Carnival and the condition of the roads in the village itself has become too dangerous for our own visiting bands to be able to march safely.'  

The band was originally founded before the First World War, and has marched in the parade every year since 1961.  

There are 25 members of the ensemble, many of them in their 70s and one as old as 89.

Action: The council has so far failed to fill in the potholes because it does not have enough money 

Flugelhorn player Rosalind Toase, who has played with the band for 20 years, said the group had no choice but to cancel their plans.  

'Some of these potholes are so big you can see right through the tarmac to the earth below,' she said.  

'The problem is that we're looking at our music the whole time so we can't see where we're going. We're not aware at all of what our feet are stepping on.  

'If one of us was to put a foot in a hole we would probably end up losing a tooth and having our instrument damaged beyond repair.  

'We've got people in their 70s marching - it wouldn't be very pretty to see them take a tumble.  

'Hopefully the council will do something about it before August and we can perform.' 

Film: The band's troubles resemble the plot of the 1996 hit Brassed Off, pictured

Brass bands first emerged in Britain in the 19th century, and were originally associated with working-class industrial communities.

Many of the bands had their origins in workplaces - above all coal mines and factories - while others were linked to anti-alcohol temperance movements.  

The Salvation Army is also known for its brass bands, which play public concerts to raise money for charitable causes.  

Some bands compete in contests, with regional competitions which eventually produce a national champion.  

The standard brass band feature a mixture of cornets, horns, trombones, euphoniums and tubas, as well as drummers.  

They tend to play a mixture of music composed specifically for brass and classical or pop tunes which have been adapted to the band's capacity.

The band's plight bears some resemblance to 1996 film Brassed Off starring Ewan McGregor, which features a colliery band whose future is threatened by the closure of the coal mines.

District councillor Brian Redwood said he was shocked by the news, and urged local authorities to repair the road as quickly as possible.  

'To think that Hartland Town Band may not be in this year's procession is unbelievable,' he said.  

'It will be a huge shame if the band does not perform and are obstructed by the plague of potholes in this area.'  

Devon County Council admitted that it did not have the resources to deal with the state of the town's roads.  

'More than 12,000 potholes have been reported by the public or found by highway inspectors so far this year,' a spokesman said.  

'In response the council has tripled the number of pothole repair teams working across the county.  

'It's a harsh reality that the council simply does not have the funds to carry out all the works we would wish.'
