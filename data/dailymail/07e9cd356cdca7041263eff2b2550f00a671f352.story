Three people charged with killing at least two women, eating parts of their bodies and using their flesh to make and sell stuffed pastries have gone on trial in Brazil.

Jorge Beltrao Negromonte da Silveira, his wife Isabel Cristina Pires and mistress Bruna Cristina Oliveira da Silva were arrested in April 2012 in the city of Garanhuns.

They allegedly confessed to luring women to their house between 2008 and 2012 by promising them a job as a nanny.

But in chilling echoes of the story of Sweeney Todd, the fictional Victorian barber whose killing spree was most recently told in the 2007 film starring Johnny Depp, they killed them and stuffed their flesh into meat pies which they sold to neighbours, schools and hospitals claiming they contained tuna or chicken.

Police found the remains of two women in the back yard of the suspects' house.

At the time of their arrest they told police they belonged to a sect that preached 'the purification of the world and the reduction of its population'. 

In chilling echoes of the film Sweeney Todd, authorities said the trio made thick empada pastries with the flesh of their victims, which the three and a young child who lived with the man and wife ate. 

They also sold some of the pastries to some neighbours as well as to schools and hospitals claiming they contained tuna and chicken.

Shortly after their arrest, police found a 50-page book titled Revelations Of A Schizophrenic, written by Silveira. In it, he said he heard voices and was obsessed with killing women

Shortly after their arrest, police found a 50-page book titled Revelations Of A Schizophrenic, written by Silveira. In it, he said he heard voices and was obsessed with killing women.

The G1 news site quoted Silveira as saying during the trial's opening: 'I committed a horrible, monstrous mistake. It was a moment of extreme weakness and brutality that I regret.'

Their victims, believed to have been killed between 2008 and 2012, include Alexandra Falcao, 20, police said.

Silviera also described the death of Jessica Camila da Silva Pereira, a 17-year-old murdered in 2008.

Police were alerted to the murders when the trio attempted to use a credit card of one of their alleged victims. The trio now face up to 30 years in prison.

Their trial, which started on Thursday, continues.
