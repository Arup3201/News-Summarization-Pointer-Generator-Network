An air hostess was left paralysed by a rare medical condition after dismissing a symptom of sore feet as being caused by the six-inch high heel shoes she wore on a night out.

Gemma Flanagan woke up with pins and needles in her feet after partying in Las Vegas during a stop over, but ignored the pain and worked on the flight home.

But days later she was dragging herself along the street when she collapsed outside her home and was soon frozen in her own body - unable to move, speak or even swallow.

Symptoms: Gemma Flanagan thought the pain in her feet was caused by her six-inch high heel shoes

Recovery: Miss Flanagan was paralysed and had gruelling physiotherapy to learn to walk again

Jet-setter: The air hostess had been on a stop over in Las Vegas when she first noticed symptoms

Remarkable: Miss Flanagan has been going from strength to strength since returning to Liverpool

Rare: Guillain-Barre Syndrome simulates a nerve cell, causing the body to attack its own nervous system

The 29-year-old was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK.

She is continuing to make a remarkable recovery, having gone through gruelling physiotherapy to learn how to walk again.

Miss Flanagan, originally from Liverpool, said: 'When I woke up after the night out in Vegas I was really achy and had pins and needles in my feet.

'I'm a really girly girl, and love wearing heels so I'm used to getting sore feet after a night out.

'I didn't think anything of it - I even worked on the flight home. I never in a million years thought I'd end up paralysed. It's a miracle that I've come so far.'

Miss Flanagan had been back in Britain just a few says when she set off from her house in Surrey, for work at Heathrow Airport.

'Girly girl': Miss Flanagan said she loves wearing heels and is used to getting sore feet after a night out

Rare condition: Miss Flanagan was left unable to walk by the rare condition, Guillain Barre Syndrome

'I left my house in Stanwell where I 
was living at the time and made it onto the street, but I got as far as 
crossing the road and I just collapsed,' she said.

'I was so embarrassed because I was 
in my full cabin crew uniform and I couldn't get myself up - I had to 
literally drag myself across the floor.'

Guillain-Barre Syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the UK.

Symptoms, including pain, tingling and numbness, begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs.

It can also cause muscle weakness, co-ordination problems, paralysis and even death.

The exact cause is not known, but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection.

It attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, used by the brain to control muscles.

Around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome.

Â 

Within two days of noticing the first symptoms, which included a numbing sensation in the arms and legs, Miss Flanagan was admitted to St. Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey.

But
 doctors were baffled by her symptoms and it was not until she was given
 a lumbar puncture - an injection in the base of her spine - that things
 become clear.

'When they did the injection, I was warned it would be painful but I couldn't feel a thing. I think everyone knew there and then that something bad was going on,' she said.

Three days after Miss Flanagan returned from Las Vegas she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

Guillain-Barre syndrome simulates a nerve cell, causing the body to attack its own nervous system as it fights the infection and can cause paralysis and even death.

Miss Flanagan said: 'To be honest I had no idea what it was - I couldn't even pronounce it. But I wasn't too worried. Doctors told me it was a mild case and I'd be home in three days.'

Unfortunately for the 29-year-old, her condition began to deteriorate. She added: 'It was weird. I felt fine, but my body just wasn't working.

'Then my friend came to visit me and she asked me what was wrong with my face. I looked in the mirror and when I tried to smile, my mouth just wouldn't move.

'I was devastated. I suddenly realised how serious it all was.'

That night Miss Flanagan
 was transferred to the high dependency unit. She said: 'It was scary 
because everyone else there was full of tubes and wires but I didn't 
feel ill at all.'

But again, Miss Flanagan began to deteriorate and after loosing her ability to speak or swallow, was transferred to intensive care.

'When
 they moved me to intensive care, I was warned that I might not be able 
to breathe for myself, and I'd need a tube fitted to feed me.

'They even mentioned the possibility that I could die. A week before I'd been having the time of my life'

'They even mentioned the possibility that I could die. I just couldn't believe it - a week before I'd been having the time of my life in Vegas.'

But miraculously, after ten days in intensive care, Miss Flanagan responded to treatment and her condition stabilised.

A month later, she was allowed to move to Aintree Hospital Liverpool, to be nearer her family.

Miss Flanagan
 said: 'Back in Liverpool I really started to feel better and was told I
 could start rehabilitation. I was warned recovery would be a long and 
slow process but by this point I could eat and speak again, so I was 
starting to feel like myself again.'

Miss Flanagan spent five gruelling months of physiotherapy at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, where she had to learn to walk again.

'It was a tough time but every little
 thing was a big achievement. I'd get so happy if I could just wiggle my
 toes or hold a pen.

Inspiration: The air hostess is a Guillain-Barre Support Group volunteer and hopes her story inspires others

'It 
was hard being in rehab, but the staff were amazing. They encouraged me 
to do normal things and did stuff like paint my nails for me.

'I couldn't have got through everything without the support of my friends, family and boyfriend'

'They
 even helped me get dressed for a date and let my friends come in to do 
my hair and tan - it's thanks to them I'm now with my amazing boyfriend 
Neil.'

Miss Flanagan finally returned home and has since been going from strength to strength. She said 'Leaving rehab was surreal, but it was amazing - it feels like I finally have my life back.'

She has even started modelling for Models of Diversity, an agency that campaigns for diversity in models.

'I was browsing the Internet for some customized crutches on a site called Glamsticks, and on their website I came across Models of Diversity.

'I got in touch straight away, and I've just had some test shots done - I can't believe it.

'I just want people to know that just because someone is disabled, or in a wheelchair or on crutches, it doesn't mean they're not like everybody else.

'I couldn't have got through everything without the support of my friends, family and boyfriend, but I hope my story will inspire people, and change how disability is thought of.'
