A mother has told of how she opened a tin of tomatoes when she was making a family meal and found a maggot floating on top.

Sarah Millman, 27, was preparing to cook a spaghetti bolognese at home after buying the £1.50 tin at a Tesco supermarket.

But when she went to add the tinned tomatoes, she spotted the larva just before she poured them in. She said it was 'absolutely disgusting'.

The mother-of-two said she normally doesn't check the tin contents before making bolognese but she did on this occasion.

Mrs Millman, from Hambledon near Waterlooville, Hampshire, said: 'We were at home and I was opening the tin of tomatoes to make a spaghetti bolognese for my family.

'Usually I would just tip in the contents and not even look but fortunately I did this time - and then I saw something in the tin.

'I wondered what it was and looked a bit closer and realised what it was. It was absolutely disgusting.

'The tomatoes would have been fresh when they went in the can but it made me think the food must be dirty.

'My eight year old daughter Bobbie was absolutely mortified. She was really funny about what she was eating afterwards.

'At first I didn't know if I was overreacting or not but everyone I've spoken to about it has been horrified. I'll be double checking all my tins and cans from now on.'

Now Mrs Millman, a hairdresser, has been left disappointed by Tesco's response after she complained about her discovery.

She called the supermarket chain and took the larva to Tesco in Havant, Hampshire, where she bought the offending tin.

There, she reluctantly took a £1.50 refund from the customer services and was told someone would be in touch.

She said: 'I was not out to make money from this, but an apology would have been nice. I asked if I took the £1.50 would it affect anything I could receive as an apology and they said no.

'I was expecting a call but I got a letter in the post on Thursday saying ‘there appeared to be a maggot' in the can and here is a 10 pounds voucher.

'There was no customer service or customer care in their response. A phone call would have been lovely, just to say sorry.

'I know you have to apologise to someone properly if you treat them like this. It was the sort of letter where all they do is fill in the details that are personal to me.

'When I told family and friends about it they were disgusted.'

A spokeswoman for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell. We have apologised to Miss Millman and given her a gesture of goodwill.

'Once we have conducted a full investigation our customer service team will update her with our findings.'
