A high-flying City banker, who has become the highest-graded female karate expert in the world, has given up her career to focus on the discipline.

Linda Marchant, who devoted 37 years of her life to the study of karate, has become the world's highest ranked female expert in the martial art made famous by 'The Karate Kid'.

Linda, 49, from Tooting, South London, is now the only woman in the world to reach 7th Dan Black Belt in Okinawan Goju-Ryu, which is Japanese for 'hard-soft style' and one of the main traditional styles of karate.

Real-life karate kid: Linda Marchant has become the highest-graded female karate expert in the world and given up her banking career to focus on her favourite sport

She achieved her new rank during a trip to the International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate Federation in Japan where she was analysed by the world's top karate experts.

Linda has now given up her high-flying career as a director at one of the world's top banks to dedicate herself to karate full-time and run the Tooting Karate Club.

She said: 'I have had to battle throughout my career with men who have doubted my abilities.

'But the teachers that matter most have always believed in me and I am glad to have repaid their faith in me.

Passion: Linda has devoted the last 37 years of her life to the study of Okinawan Karate - an internationally recognised form of the martial art made famous in the Karate Kid films

'I hope my success paves the way and inspires other women and shows that Okinawan Goju-Ryu is available to all. If you train hard, you will get there.'

Traditional Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate is one of four main styles of the martial art and was made famous by the Karate Kid. The 1984 American martial arts film tells the story of bullied Daniel LaRusso, who is taught the ancient art of self defence by an eccentric 
Okinawan immigrant named Kesuke Miyagi.

Linda, who has previously worked in managerial positions at Llloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, says: 'It's been a lifelong journey. It is very much an acknowledgement of all the training that I've done over the last 37 years.

'The actual test itself was an intense scrutiny of both kata and bunkai, the fundamentals of Okinawan Goju-Ryu. There was no room for error.'

Life change: Linda gave up her high-flying banking career in the City last year to dedicate herself to karate full-time, and now runs the Tooting Karate Club
