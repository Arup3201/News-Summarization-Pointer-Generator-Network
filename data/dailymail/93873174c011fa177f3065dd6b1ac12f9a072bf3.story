Andrew 
Flintoff played his first competitive cricket on Saturday since the last
 day of the final Test of England’s triumphant 2009 Ashes series - and 
was immediately among the wickets, albeit in lowlier surroundings.

After
 five long, painful years in which the 36-year-old former England 
all-rounder thought he would never play again, he went back to the small
 club where his career began, St Annes near Blackpool, for a warm-up 
ahead of his professional return this week.

He is expected to make a 
big-stage comeback for Lancashire in Friday’s T20Blast fixture against 
Yorkshire and the early signs are he still has something to offer.

Flintoff
 took three wickets for St Annes, one of them a spectacular caught and 
bowled, as they played a lowly Northern Premier League match against 
Penrith. He bowled 12 overs, with five maidens and a tally of three for 
26.

Steaming in: Andrew Flintoff stepped up his comeback for St Annes on Saturday afternoon against Penrith

Eyes on the prize: The former England all-rounder looked lean as he turned out for his hometown club

With
 the bat he had a shorter contribution, making two runs in his first two
 balls and then getting caught on the boundary at long off as his lofted 
drive headed for what otherwise would have been a six.

Any
 talk of a guarantee of success for ‘Freddie’ in his pro return needs to
 come with a whopping caveat: this was leisurely stuff, played out on a 
glorious late Spring afternoon in front of a crowd of around 250 people,
 or five times the typical size at Vernon Road.

But
 the most important aspect of his performance was his body withstanding 
the day’s action. He retired after those Ashes five summers ago with a 
severe knee injury after chronic problems. In total he has had 12 
operations on his ankle and knee.

Flintoff’s
 first over on Saturday, in the ninth of the match as Penrith batted 
first, began at 1.26pm. He moved gingerly at first, taking time to warm 
up, but by the time of his sixth over and first wicket, he was stomping 
something like old.

Prior
 to this game, his last ball in anger was at The Oval on 23 August 2009,
 a day remembered for a Fifth Test and series win illuminated by 
Flintoff taking Ricky Ponting’s wicket with a direct hit from his 
fielding position at mid-off.

His first wicket here was a lesser scalp, that of Penrith’s 18-year-old Greg 
Hall, caught behind. ‘When I found out Freddie was playing, I looked 
forward to facing him,’ said Hall. ‘He was not too quick, he was 
alright. He just pushed it through off the pitch, not as quick as we 
have all seen him bowl before but you’d expect that as he is just coming
 back.’

Flintoff’s
 second wicket was a peach, taking Penrith’s pro Paul Hindmarch, caught 
and bowled. Hindmarch had hammered his shot but Flintoff plucked it 
cleanly from the air with his right hand.

Watching
 from the pavilion was the St Annes president, Brian Standing, 76, who 
has known the Flintoff family for decades and recalls with wonder a 
14-year-old Flintoff hitting double centuries for the juniors and 
playing for the first team at the same age.

Shortlived: Freddie's stay in the middle didn't last as he was caught in the deep for two off three balls

‘Good catch that,’ he deadpanned as HIndmarch went. ‘But then Freddie has got hands like buckets.’

‘Sitting
 nearby was Flintoff’s mum, Susan, who said only that she found her 
son’s return ‘nerve-wracking.’ Dad Colin added: ‘It’s been great to see 
him bowl again, and out on the field.

I
 wanted him to do well not just because we like watching him but I want 
him to do well … To be honest I wasn’t expecting as many as 12 overs. 
Eight maybe, but then he’s always pushed himself.’

Susan’s
 father, Flintoff’s granddad Harry Hargreaves, 85, was more loquacious. 
‘It’s brilliant to see him playing out there today,’ he said. ‘He loves 
playing. He’s really missed playing.’

Relaxed: The 36-year-old was decked out in his Lancashire attire as the team had a briefing beforehand

The
 man himself said: ‘I always remember my days at St Annes. They have 
good coaches and the current skipper Andy Kellett played in the same 
side as me.

‘This is no stroll [today] … it’s the start I need, competitiveness.’

Brian
 Standing was a proud man at close of play. ‘I knew Andrew as a 
14-year-old lad when he first started here. He was a cheeky little 
bugger but he was a good lad and you could tell he had potential, he was
 going to go all the way.’

‘Andrew
 got in at 14 and he didn’t look out of  place. His grandfather comes 
along every week, his father used to be cricket chairman here … It has 
been good for St Annes to have someone of his calibre back here’.
