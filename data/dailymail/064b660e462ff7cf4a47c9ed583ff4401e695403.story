'Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster),' a monumental silkscreen by Andy Warhol, is heading to a New York City auction where it could fetch more than $60 million.

The piece belongs to Warhol's Death and Disaster series and captures the immediate aftermath of a car crashing into a tree.

It measures 8 feet by 13 feet and was painted in 1963. Sotheby's is offering Warhol's silkscreen on Nov. 13.

The auction house says it is one of only four 'Car Crash' works of that scale and the only one remaining in private hands.

Sotheby's says the work has been in the same collection since 1988 and it has only been seen once in public in the past 26 years.

'With Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) Warhol consciously created work of such scale and ambition that it takes its place alongside paintings such as Pablo Picasso's Guernica and Theodore Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa as one of the definitive masterpieces of history painting', Worldwide head of Contemporary Art at Sotheby's, Tobias Meyer The Economic Times.

The Death of Disaster series was one of Warhol's most significant achievements over his career and was one of the most provocative projects of artists in the 1960s.

The other three paintings from his Death and Disaster series are in museums in New York, Switzerland and Vienna.

Warhol's Eight Elvises silkscreen, also 
from 1963, sold for a whopping $100 million in 2008 and 'Green Car 
Crash' sold for $71.7 million in 2007 at Christie's.

Warhol's works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold.
