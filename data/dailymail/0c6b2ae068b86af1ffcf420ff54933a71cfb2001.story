Ed Miliband is under pressure to use his conference next week to present Labour as a credible alternative government

Ed Miliband is today warned by a string of senior Labour figures that he needs to up his game and spell out why and how he thinks he can be Prime Minister.

Ahead of his party’s annual conference this weekend, Mr Miliband is also warned that London Mayor Boris Johnson could be his rival as Tory leader by 2015.

There is growing unease that after two years in charge, the Labour leader has failed to present his party as a credible government in waiting.

Alan Johnson, who Mr Miliband chose as shadow chancellor, today bluntly warns Mr Miliband has not done enough to prove he is up to the job.

‘Whilst I personally don't believe that a prime minister who is more popular than his party can deliver an election victory, it does suggest that Ed Miliband has to do more to demonstrate that he is a leader,’ Mr Johnson wrote in The Guardian.

In part due this is due to the ‘age-old problem of opposition parties who struggle to make the news and a leader who has never been tested in the difficult job he aspires to’, Mr Johnson added/

Meanwhile Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, admitted Labour are still the ‘underdogs of British politics’ despite being ahead in the polls.

Mr Alexander, who ran David Miliband’s leadership campaign, said the party needed to wake up to the threat posed by Boris Johnson.

‘I think it’s time that we take Boris seriously,’ he told the New Statesman.

Mr Alexander added: ‘It is not yet a probability but it is a possibility that [Boris] will lead the Conservative Party into the next general election.

‘He’s managed to put a smile on voters’ faces quite regularly. People feel he doesn’t play by the rules and doesn’t conform to type.’

In a survey this month, Mr Johnson was named Britain’s most respected politician with a ‘net respect’ rating of +25 points.

Ed Miliband was on -29, well below David Cameron’s -18 points.

In what has been seen as a challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, Harriet Harman told the Spectator that she wants to be the second most powerful figure in a Labour government.

The deputy leader told The Spectator: ‘It is my ambition to be deputy prime minister when we are next in government. Unfinished business.’

Mr Miliband’s relationship with the unions will also be thrown into the spotlight next week, when the party conference is urged to condemn the public sector pay freeze which the leadership has said it supports.

The Tories have identified Labour reliance on union funding as a key weakness of Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, was heckled at this month’s TUC Congress when he said that pay was not the first priority when jobs were being lost under the Government's spending cuts.

Unison has submitted a motion to Labour's annual gathering in Manchester which attacks the public sector pay freeze and complains that a £250 increase for lower paid workers, announced by Chancellor George Osborne, had only been paid to a minority of employees.

It reads: ‘Conference condemns the prolonged pay freezes that mean public sector workers have had their real terms pay cut dramatically and notes that most of the lowest paid have not received the £250 rise that Osborne promised.

‘Conference believes that depressing workers' living standards in a recession is self-defeating and contributes to economic stagnation.’
