Thousands of children are committing acts of sexual abuse against other young people every year, the NSPCC has warned.

The charity found there were more than 5,000 cases of abuse by under 18s reported to the police in the last three years.

In some instances acts of sexual abuse were committed by children as young as five or six.

At least 5000 cases of sexual abuse of children by other under 18s have been reported in three years. 98 per cent of them were committed by boys

The NSPCC have blamed the number on the rise of harcore porn that is readily available online.

This comes after a 15-year-old boy was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl after watching sadistic porn last week.

The girl was gagged, bound and beaten up as he attempted to re-enact scenes he had seen on the internet.

The boy's father condemned ministers for not protecting children from adult, especially violent,  material online.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning for an automatic block on all adult material online as part of its Block Online Porn campaign.

The NSPCC has blamed the rise in sadistic, easy-to-access adult porn on the internet. They say this has influenced young children

Nearly all - 98 per cent - of the 4,562 young offenders were boys and where the relationship was recorded, at least three out of five of the victims knew their abuser.

More than a third of the offences were said to have been committed by a family friend or acquaintance, and one in five by family members.

The NSPCC obtained the statistics through Freedom of Information requests to each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales.

Only 34 forces supplied figures - revealing a total of 5,028 offences - so the true number of offences is likely to be higher, the NSPCC said.

The findings follow a report by probation inspectors last month which found that police, social workers and teachers were missing the warning signs that a child may sexually offend.

The NSPCC warned that easy access to indecent material could be leading to an increase in the number of children needing help.

The charity has found that more children were carrying out online grooming and harassment.

Claire Lilley, policy adviser at the NSPCC, said she hoped the findings would ring 'alarm bells' with authorities that the problem required urgent action.

'In some cases older children are attacking younger ones and in other cases it’s sexual violence within a teenage relationship,' she said.

'While more research needs to be done on this problem, we know that technology and easy access to sexual material is warping young people’s views of what is ‘normal’ or acceptable behaviour.

'We are treating an increasing number of children who have carried out online grooming, harassment in chatrooms and "sexting".

'Children who are sexually abusive 
have often been victims of abuse, harm and trauma themselves. Exposure 
to this can make them think abusing someone or being sexually violent is
 ok.

'But evidence shows 
that most young people who receive behaviour changing treatment early 
on, such as that offered by the NSPCC, will not continue to sexually 
abuse others or grow into adult offenders.

'If
 we are to tackle this growing problem and protect young victims, more 
needs to be done to identify and treat children at risk of sexually 
offending. And we must do more to shield young people from an 
increasingly sexualised society.'

A government spokesman said: 'The number of young people cautioned or convicted for sexual offences has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past five years.

'However, these young people remain some of the most challenging in society and most have extremely complex issues and needs.

'We are driving up the skills and experience of social workers so they are better able to identify the warning signs much more quickly as well as strengthening guidance on child protection.'
