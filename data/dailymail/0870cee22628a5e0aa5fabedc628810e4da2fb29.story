It was a big shock in The X Factor with show favourites The Risk and Johnny Robinson being voted off in a double elimination.

Flamboyant Robinson was voted off after going head-to-head in a sing-off with fellow Over-25s act Kitty Brucknell.

And surprisingly, Brighton wildboy Frankie Cocozza managed to stay another week, despite his panned performance on Saturday night.

Farewell: Johnny Robinson puts on a brave face with his former mentor Louis Walsh

Game over: Charlie Healy and Derry Mensah of The Risk leave the X Factor studios for the final time

His mentor Louis was forced to choose between Robinson and Brucknell, admitting he thought the blonde singer was more likely to get a recording act.

After it was announced that Robinson was going home, both Walsh and Gary Barlow shed a tear for the popular finalist.

Choosing between his acts, Walsh said: 'They've 
been incredible to work with. They were both incredible in the sing-off.
I have to pick the person who I think in the real world who would get a
recording act and the act I'm gonna have to send home is Johnny.'

Shock factor: The Risk (L-R) Charlie Healy, Andrew Merry, Ashford Campbell and Derry Mensah were the first to leave

Joining Robinson on stage, who appeared to accept his fate with good humour, Walsh added: 'This guy is a brilliant singer, he's a great character, he's gonna have a great career. I hate to see him go home.'

Robinson said: 'I wanna thank everyone who have got behind me. All the judges, everyone out there in the UK who accepted me for just being me.'

Unemployed Robinson, 45, sang The Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody, while Brucknell, 26, sang Kelly Clarkson's Beautiful Disaster.

Our acts have gone: Both mentors Louis Walsh and Tulisa Contostavlos were visibly upset

Farewell: Brucknell embraces Robinson after finding out he's going home

After the sing-off Tulisa said: 'I 
get along with both of you really well. I've got to go with the act that
I look forward to watching perform each week so the act I'm sending 
home this week is Johnny.'

Kelly lamented: 'The act that I'm looking to that is gonna provide us with something more in the competition is Johnny.'

Although
Rowland's decision cemented Robinson's departure, Barlow added: 'Johnny
is one of the nicest people in this competition.'

Tough decision: Kelly Rowland chose Johnny, but Gary Barlow got emotional when he praised the singer's lovely character

While the pair fought for survival in a sing-off, boy band The Risk were eliminated straightaway after receiving lowest vote.

The Risk's exit came as a shock as only a week ago they were second favourite to win the show by the bookies.

But perhaps their recent change of line-up after Ashford Campbell, 16, replaced Ashley Baptiste may have affected their chances.

Clarkson's Beautiful Disaster while Robinson belted out The Righteous 
Brothers' Unchained Melody

Craig Colton: 7/2

Misha B: 9/2

Little Mix: 7/1

Kitty Brucknell: 40/1

Frankie Cocozza: 50/1

When
asked how they felt by Dermot O'Leary, The Risk singer Derry Mensah 
said: 'I dunno what is it. I'm just happy we're here together.'

Charlie
Healy added: 'We're The Risk, we're just gonna carry on,' while 
bandmate Andrew Merry said: 'It's been a honour to sing with these 
guys.'

Tulisa's girl band 
Little Mix were the first to find out they were through until next week,
followed by the new bookies favourite Marcus Collins.

Despite landing in the bottom two last week, Manchester singer Misha B was thrilled to find out she was safe for another week.

There was shock when Cocozza got through, with the singer evidently surprised he had managed to survive another week after his performance of The Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling the previous night.

Surviving another week: Frankie Cocozza - the bookies' favourite to leave the show this weekend - amazingly stayed

Meanwhile,
X Factor alumni JLS and Florence And The Machines performed their 
latest singles Take A Chance and No Light, No Light.

The results show comes after X Factor managed to beat Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings war on Saturday night.

A peak of 11million tuned in to watch the Club Classics-themed week on X Factor, compared to 10.5million with Strictly on BBC.

And then there was one: Tulisa's sole remaining act Little Mix were first to find out they were through to next week
