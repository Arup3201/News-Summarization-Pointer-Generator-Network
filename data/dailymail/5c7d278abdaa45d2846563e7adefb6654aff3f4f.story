Being the Premier League’s most expensive player can feel like a curse - just ask Robinho, Andriy Shevchenko and Fernando Torres.

But for Manchester United’s record £60million buy Angel di Maria, signed from Real Madrid in the summer, there have been few teething problems so far in adjusting to life at Old Trafford - apart from the language.

Despite already scoring wonderful goals against Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City, Di Maria’s stick-thin frame has led to concerns he won’t be able to deal with the rough stuff Premier League defenders occasionally dish out to skilled opponents.

Angel di Maria has made an electric start to his Manchester United career following his summer move

The 5ft 11in Argentine was listed on the Real Madrid website as weighing 11st and his former team-mate Mesut Ozil, who made the journey from the Bernabeu to Arsenal 12 months earlier, struggled with the physicality of English football during his first season.

Ahead of Sunday’s midday showdown with Everton, in which he will be regarded as United’s main threat particularly following Wayne Rooney’s suspension, di Maria has assured the club’s fans he won’t be cowed by the combative nature of English football.

‘I have already noticed it is a more physical, aggressive style of football here than in La Liga,’ said Di Maria, who averaged only 1.3 tackles per game in Spain.

‘Players here are more powerful and show their strength a lot more. It’s all about settling in as quickly as possible in another league so I’ve just got to do that and make things work.

‘I think there have been other players of a similar build and stature to me - slim if you like. They have come to England and shown a physical resilience and I hope to do the same as well.

‘The main thing is I’m really, really happy. It’s a league I’ve always wanted to play in and I’m overjoyed now I’ve come here.’

Di Maria will take encouragement from the success that lightweights like David Silva and Eden Hazard have enjoyed in England. A free-kick belted past QPR goalkeeper Rob Green on his United home debut has helped, too.

‘I’m very happy with the start I’ve made,’ added the 26-year-old. ‘It’s not easy settling into a new type of football when you go somewhere for the first time but I’ve settled in quickly with my team-mates and the club.

‘I believe there are special players here. Even when I was starting out in Argentina, I was aware of names like Robin Van Persie and Wayne Rooney. Now I have a chance to line up with them and I am pleased with how our understanding has started off. It is about converting that understanding into chances and goals. I’ve got used to the style of play and my team-mates but what has got to come now with that is a series of good results.’

United fans will agree with that last sentiment. Despite the goal-scoring threat posed by di Maria, Rooney, Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Juan Mata, the team have been a defensive shambles, shipping five goals at Leicester and four at League One MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

And manager Louis van Gaal has already made it clear to his attacking superstars that he expects them to help contribute to the defensive organisation.

There is no doubt that United fans should see the peak of Di Maria. At 26, he has enjoyed a spectacular last 12 months, regarded as the man of the match when Real Madrid won their 10th Champions League in May and then starring for Argentina in the World Cup.

The 26-year-old was denied the opportunity to star for his country in the World Cup final due to a thigh injury

Many back home believe if Di Maria hadn’t suffered a thigh strain that forced him to miss the final against Germany, Argentina would be world champions.

His biggest challenge may be learning fluent English. Van Gaal has ordered a host of his Spanish-speaking stars - including Antonio Valencia and David de Gea who have played here for a while - to take twice-weekly language lessons.

Di Maria acknowledges he is doing his best but also lets slip a trade secret, that Van Gaal does use the Spanish he acquired from his time at Barcelona to aid communication. The record signing admits: ‘Learning English is not easy. I have a teacher and started taking classes, trying to speak a bit of English with him.

‘It’s going quite well but it’s not going to happen overnight, its going to take time. But it’s something I have to do to settle in as quickly as possible.

‘It really helps that the manager speaks Spanish and one or two of the backroom staff speak good Spanish too.

‘There are Spanish-speaking players as well and it means between all of them, messages get across and at least I have someone to speak to as well!’
