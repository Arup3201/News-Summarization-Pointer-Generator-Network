With Thibaut Courtois establishing himself as Jose Mourinho's No 1 at Chelsea, Petr Cech has had a bit more time on his hands recently.

And the Czech Republic stopper seems to be using his spare hours to practice drumming along to his favourite bands.

Cech, who has shown off his talent on the drums in the past, posted a video of himself playing along to the Foo Fighters 'Walk' to YouTube.

Cech posted the video to his YouTube channel, playing along to a song by his favourite band the Foo Fighters 

The Chelsea keeper is yet to start a Premier League games this season, after the arrival of Thibaut Courtois

Cech wrote: 'Drum cover of my favourite band ... it is not perfect but i wanted to do it in one take without correcting it.'  

The 32-year-old keeper, who played in a Czech music festival last summer, has said he would consider taking up music professionally when he retires from football.

And, if this video is anything to go by, the Chelsea stopper has a real chance of making it once he decides to hang up his gloves. 

Cech has been limited to appearances in the Capital One Cup as Courtois has become Jose Mourinho's No 1

Cech goes in bravely to deny James Collins in the Capital One Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town last week
