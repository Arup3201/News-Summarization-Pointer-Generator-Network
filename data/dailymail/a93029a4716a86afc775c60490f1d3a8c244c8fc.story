A woman who fell 12 metres at The Rocks while trying to retrieve what is believed to be a packet of cigarettes remains in intensive care at St Vincent's Hospital.

The 29-year-old, from the inner city, is suffering a collapsed lung, laceration to her liver and fractures to her back.

'She's stable, in intensive care' a St Vincent's spokesman told MailOnline.

Life-threatening: A woman, 29, was stretchered into an ambulance after she fell 12 metres in The Rocks, in Sydney's CBD, early Sunday morning

The life-threatening accident occurred at 12.20am on Sunday as the woman was sitting on some steps on George Street, near the intersection with Hickson Road.

It's believed she had just left Bar 100 when she reportedly dropped an item through a balcony railing, down a gap behind the stairs, and then tried to retrieve it, The Daily Telegraph reports.

The Rocks is a popular tourist location in Sydney's CBD, steeped in history, where many late night revellers go at weekends.

Witnesses saw her climb over the railing and she appeared to then slip or step off, falling between 10 and 12 metres to the ground below.

'Perhaps in the next few days she will be able to tell us just what happened,' a police spokesman told the paper.

Police Inspector Sean Heaney told the ABC the woman is lucky to be alive.

'She's been seen to climb over the stairs and it appears she may have slipped or stepped off the side of the railing, not realising there was a vacant drop rather than a solid landing,' he said.

'She's fallen about 10 to 12 metres down the side wall of the building.'

Emergency services attended with police from Sydney City Local Area Command and Ambulance Paramedics assisting the woman.

She was treated at the scene and rushed to St Vincentâ€™s Hospital.

Police are now investigating the incident.
