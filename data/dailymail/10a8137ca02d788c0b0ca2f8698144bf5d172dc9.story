I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here contestants Joey Essex and Matthew Wright tucked into pig's brain, camel toe and even an ostrich penis during the dreaded Bushtucker Trial last night.

But while most of us watch, cringing, from between our fingers, while they scoff the jungle delicacies, one London restaurant believes people will actually pay to experience it themselves.

Gilgamesh, a pan-Asian haunt frequented by the likes of Girls Aloud and Frank Bruno, has unveiled a menu packed with creepy crawlies and gory pig's brain in honour of the show's Bushtucker Trial.

The Asian-inspired Bushtucker Trial Menu serves up scorpion and ant tempura served with Amarillo chilli dressing (£15), fish eye maki sushi rolls (£9) and ginseng Chinese fish head and eyeball soup (£14) - and that's just for starters.

Tuck in! Joey Essex (R) and Matthew Wright (L) battled it out on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here by eating ostrich testicles and creepy crawlies - and now you can do the same

For the more daring foodie there's the £14 bull and duck tongue stir fry mixed with Ho Fun noodles, choy sum and peashoots or the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £12.

If that wasn't enough to whet your appetite, there's an £8 selection of Asian vomit fruit sorbets including durian fruit - which a writer on travel blog gadling.com described as 'smelling like road kill wrapped in sweaty socks and having the texture of rotten bananas' - for dessert.

Does it look appetizing? Gilgamesh, a high-end pan Asian, are offering a selection of gruesome meals such as fish eye maki sushi rolls (£9)

On a plus note, Gilgamesh claim that those brave enough to take on the challenge are in for a health boost.

They say crickets, which are one of the more common insects eaten (or at least tried) in the West, are a rich source of protein and high in calcium, while bull tongue is apparently high in protein and vitamin B-12, which boosts the production of red blood cells.

The durian vomit fruit apparently has euphoric effect when eaten as a dessert and is packed full of oestrogen which is thought to make women more fertile.

Not your average Big Mac: Diners can sample the meaty pig brain served in a bun with tomato relish and salad garnish for £12

Sign away: Diners have to sign a disclaimer before they tuck into the culinary delights, such as these battered scorpions and ants

Devilish diners can sample the menu only after signing a disclaimer agreeing that they are happy to do so.

The disclaimer will state that Gilgamesh cannot be held responsible for any consequences diners may suffer during or after eating the dishes.

The dishes can be ordered separately or as a three-course set menu priced at £32.50.

Those that manage to munch their way through the entire set menu won’t pay a penny and will receive a certificate for their daredevil efforts.

Shona Wilkinson at The Nutri Centre said: 'Eating insects is certainly popular in countries such as Thailand where you can buy them from supermarkets and pick them up from road-side stalls. 

'They are a great source of protein and naturally low in fat, as well as essential vitamins such as B1 and B2. And while it's not something I could ever eat, they are thought to soon become the new super trendy food due to their nutrient value. There are certainly worse, more unhealthy things you could eat.'

Ready to give Joey Essex a run for his money?

Can you stomach it? Last night saw Mark Wright tuck into half a pork chow - a pig's brain - in order to win one meal for camp
