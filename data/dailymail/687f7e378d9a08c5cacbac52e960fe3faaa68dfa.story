Despite being told that it would be illegal for him to ever own dogs again, Grant went ahead regardless

This Pit Bull was used in a dog fighting ring and and has suffered scars and bruising as a result

The dogs were kept in a property that would not have attracted much attention as they were kept behind 6-foot-tall wooden privacy fence and overgrown trees.

The building used to be a bar but it shut some time ago. Most of the windows are broken or boarded up.

Deputies said they found blood on walls and carpets and there were even piece of equipment used to train the dogs for fights including a treadmill to improve dogs' endurance and a pit bull that had severe wounds to its face and head from a recent fight.

A number of dogs at the former bar and also at Grant's house were chained with heavy logging chains.

In total, deputies found 69 dogs, many with scars and some with recent fighting wounds, along with evidence of dog fighting

The practice helps to strengthen the animals' necks for fighting. 

The sixty or so remaining dogs were in wooden kennels and crates in filthy and dirty conditions.

Jail records show that Grant has been accused of mistreating animals in the past.

He was arrested in 2006 after finding 139 dogs, 123 of them pit bulls, at his home near Mulberry.

All of them had to be euthanized.  

A year later he was found guilty of 80 counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and sentenced to 364 days in county jail.

These pens use to house pit bull dogs in the most appalling conditions. Most of them will have to be put down

This isn't the first time Grant has been accused of mistreating animals. In 2006 he was arrested  after police found 139 dogs at his home. A year later, he was found guilty of 80 counts of animal cruelty and jailed for a year

Seven dogs at the former bar and four at Grant's house were chained with heavy logging chains — a common practice used to strengthen the animals' necks for fighting

Despite being told that it would be illegal for him to ever own dogs again, Grant went ahead regardless. 

In a bizarre twist of events, Grant launched an appear which found the search of his property was illegal (despite have well over a hundred dogs on the premises). 

He then even filed against the Sheriff's Office seeking more than $10 million in damages.

The suit was dismissed two months later.

Much like the dogs found in 2006, Martin said, the fate of the 69 found Wednesday does not look good and most of them will h ave to be euthanized because of their exceptionally aggressive behavior.  

'We like to think we rescued these dogs, but the reality of it is, this guy created dogs that are really dangerous,' police said.

'So our hands are kind of tied because these dogs are so dangerous they're not dogs that people will want to take home. We don't want to put these dogs down, but obviously that's going to happen to some of them and we don't have a choice.' 

Deputies learned of the suspected dog fighting and animal cruelty after receiving a tip from Crime Stoppers as many of the dogs were stored in this home which looks entirely unsuspecting

The Pit Bulls were conditioned to be aggressive and only had a very small space in which to live
