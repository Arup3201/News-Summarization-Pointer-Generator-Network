Four children are among a dozen British tourists injured after their open top safari tour Jeep was 'forced off the road' by another car in Turkey.

The group were flung from the vehicle when it struck a lamp post in the popular holiday resort of Fethiye.

According to Turkish media the jeep was returning from a sightseeing tour when it was forced off the road by another car.

Disaster: The British tourists were enjoying a sightseeing trip around the popular holiday resort of Fethiye in Turkey when the crash happened

The lamp post snapped and crashed onto a bakery - but no-one was inside at the time.

The British tourists were ferried to three hospitals in the resort in a convoy of ambulances.

A spokeswoman for the Letoon Hospital confirmed: 'We have treated three of the injured. They underwent surgery for various injuries but all are now stable.'

Six-year-old Georgia Aitcheson and her father Christopher, 37, were treated at the town's Esnaf hospital for minor injuries and released.

The hospital also treated 11-year-old Jack Holt and his mum Lyndsey, 39.

A spokesman for the Esnaf hospital said: 'We treated four of the injured passengers from the jeep for minor injuries. They have all now been released.'

Concern: The idyllic white sandy beaches and warm sea around Fethiye, Turkey, is a major draw for British holidaymakers, but the area has seen a number of tragic road accidents involving tourists over recent years

According to local reports the others injured in the crash on Tuesday were named as Ryan and Dawn Janes, 39, Harrison Janes, 12, Matthew Charril, 38, Mason Charril, 10, Jolie-Ann Whitaker, 55, and Paul Whitaker, 56.

Jeep safaris are a popular excursion for tourists - giving them a chance to see a bit more of Turkey and still catch the sun in the open top vehicles.

However, many safaris include water fights between the convoy of jeeps to keep customers cool in the searing heat. Unfortunately there have been many accidents as a consequence.

Just four years ago a family holiday ended in tragedy when a father and daughter were killed in an horrific Jeep safari accident.

Little Charley Pearce, eight, died at the scene after the open top Jeep she was traveling in crashed into a tractor laden with bricks. Her dad Jonathan, 40, died later in hospital.

It was later revealed that the driver lost control after he was squirted in the face from a water pistol.
