A 17-year-old boy with a provisional driver's license was behind the wheel when a converted semitrailer crashed on a Kansas highway, killing five members of his Minnesota family who were on vacation to see a motocross race.

According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Adam Kerber's license includes several restrictions, including that all occupants of the vehicle wear seatbelts when available. 

Only two of the 18 people aboard were belted in, but it wasn't clear if belts were available for those passengers riding in the trailer.

Horror: Melissa Kerber, 24, and Tom Kerber, 25, of New Prague were among the dead

The Freightliner truck broke through a guardrail and went into a ravine Sunday morning near Williamsburg, about 70 miles southwest of Kansas City, Mo. The 13 people who survived were injured, and at least two remained in critical condition Monday.

The patrol identified the dead as Melissa Kerber, 24, and Tom Kerber, 25, of New Prague, and Jessica Kerber, 10, Joy Kerber, 14, and James Kerber, 12, of Jordan.

Pauline Kerber, 46, of Jordan, a widowed mother of 12, was in critical but stable condition Monday morning. Her 17-year-old son Adam Kerber, who was driving the vehicle, was in critical condition.

Overland Park Regional Medical Center, where Pauline and Adam Kerber are hospitalised, released a statement Sunday night on behalf of the family thanking the public for the ‘outpouring of love and support’.

‘We appreciate the prayers of so many, and appreciate you respecting our privacy as we mourn our deep loss’, said the statement from the hospital, which also treated a critically injured 8-year-old boy before transferring him to a children's hospital.

Friends of the people involved in the crash told the Staff Tribune are members of the large extended Kerber family from Jordan, Minnesota, who run an auto shop.

Lapic is a friend of the Kerber family which included Pauline Kerber, a
widow, and 12 children ranging in age from five to young adults.

motorcycle races as one of the teenage boys, Adam, was pursuing a 
professional racing career.

'He had a lot of trophies. They would travel frequently out of state.' she told the Tribune.
