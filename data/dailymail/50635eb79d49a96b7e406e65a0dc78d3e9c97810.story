Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s whizzkid younger brother has received a huge City bonus of about £4.5 million.

Andrew Balls, a senior executive at bond traders Pimco, is being feted as one of the City’s fastest-rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month.

And the latest published figures reveal the scale of his rewards. While his combined annual salary and bonus generally tops £1 million, Andrew was one of seven Pimco directors to share a bonus pot of £57 million in 2012.

The Shadow Chancellor's brother Andrew Balls, a senior executive at bond traders Pimco, is being feted as one of the City’s fastest-rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month.

The Shadow Chancellor – whose leader Ed Miliband has been highly critical of bankers’ bonuses – will cost his brother dear if Labour win the next Election.

His soak-the-rich plan to raise the top rate of tax  from 45p to 50p would cost Andrew at least an extra £45,000 on his average annual earnings – and £225,000 more on the windfall.

He would have paid around £2 million on his bonus under the current Conservative regime. But under his big brother’s proposal, he would have to pay about £2.25 million.

Andrew, who at 40 is six years  Ed’s junior, enjoys a lifestyle to go with his earnings: he takes holidays in the fashionable Hamptons outside New York, has rented a home from Hollywood star Ewan McGregor and recently bought a £6.5 million ‘Grand Designs’ property in London’s Little Venice.

To add insult to injury, Andrew is also said to be a better football player than his brother (above)

By contrast, big brother Ed has  to make do with his £65,000 MP’s salary and lives in a terrace house  in Hackney, East London, with his wife and fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Yvette Cooper.

Just to rub it in, one friend of both brothers observed that Andrew is also ‘a better footballer’ than his brother – or at least ‘carries a bit less weight on the pitch’. And he added pointedly: ‘Andrew is also a really nice bloke.’

The income gulf has, according to one of Andrew’s friends, led him  to quip that he should be classified as ‘the UK’s largest political donor’ because of how much he is forced to ‘help [his] brother out’.

The gulf has not always been so wide. The Balls brothers initially followed very similar paths. Both were privately educated in Nottingham, went on to become academic stars at Oxford and Harvard, and then worked as economics writers at the Financial Times.

Andrew Gowers, the former editor of the Financial Times, who worked with both brothers, has said: ‘More than once I heard [Andrew] referred to as Ed’s clever brother.

'He’s a modest, cerebral guy, without the pointy elbows of his brother.’ Mr Gowers added that Andrew ‘always had a modest way of putting his views across’ and was ‘more interested in finding the truth about economics and markets’.

Ed switched to politics in the mid-1990s and Andrew went on to become one of the top earners now being targeted by the Shadow Chancellor.

Andrew’s rising profile in the City has caused political embarrassment for Ed. In May 2010, while Ed was in the Cabinet, Pimco declared it had begun selling off UK Government debt – effectively a vote of no confidence in the Government’s economic policies. Andrew was the company’s head of European investment.

One mutual friend said of the earnings gap last night: ‘It’s a bit galling for Ed. Both are clever boys, and you could argue Ed has more power, but no one likes to be outstripped by their younger siblings.’
