He's spent more than £70,000 on 100 different procedures to transform himself into a real life Ken doll. And despite the cost and pain of going under the knife, Justin Jedlica said he has no plans to stop yet.

The 32 year old appeared on today's This Morning to share his story and told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he doesn't consider himself addicted to surgery. Rather, he believes he is being 'artistic' by 'modifying' his looks.

When asked if he would ever stop having cosmetic surgery, he replied: 'It's creative, would you ask Picasso not to paint? Why is it any more offensive because I choose to be creative through surgery?'

Living doll: Justin Jedlica said he has modelled himself on Ken because the toy figure is the 'epitome of the optimal male aesthetic'

Justin's 'creativity' has led him to have 14 operations and dozens of other procedures including filler injections. He's had five nose jobs, cranial brow bone shaping, augmentations to his cheeks, lips, and chin as well as pec, bicep, tricep and shoulder silicone implants.

He said he has used a Ken doll as his inspiration because he is the 'epitome of the optimal male aesthetic' thanks to his 'swimmer's build - not too big, not too small', with 'exquisite features' that are 'not to linear'.

Artist: The New Yorker told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he considers his cosmetic enhancements a creative process

Justin, from New York, explained how he saved up to have his first nose job at the age of 17 after being inspired by stars such as Michael Jackson who made surgery seem like 'a luxury item'.

'I was from a low income family and it was something that seem unobtainable for me to be like one of those people,' he explained.

He said he was not motivated by unhappiness with his own appearance.

'I always thought I was a handsome individual so had a great base to work from,' he said. 'I am happy but I enjoy the constant state of change like having a tattoo or body piercing.'

'Short term pain, long term gain': Justin said sculpting his body through surgery is cheaper than joining a gym

When Ruth asked him why he had chosen to pay for surgery to 'modify' his body, instead of working out, Justin said he didn't believe it would have been cheaper to go to the gym in the long run.

'By the time you pay for gym membership and time you spend not at work in the gym, it's not cheaper,' he said.

He added that working out is 'long term pain for long term gain' whereas surgery is 'short term pain for long term gain'.

The MailOnline reported a fortnight ago how a match made in childhood heaven was attempted by introducing Justin to 'real life Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova, 23. But the pair won't be running off to Barbie's Malibu dream house together any time soon - as they reportedly 'hated the sight' of one another.
