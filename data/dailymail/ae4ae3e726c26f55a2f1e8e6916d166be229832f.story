Two of the U.S.’s biggest denim brands are claiming that yoga pants are encroaching on their territory – and affecting their sales as a result.

GAP’s CEO Glenn Murphy and Levi’s President and CEO Chip Bergh have both made comments about how the leggings’ popularization as an everyday item has lessened consumers’ demand for jeans.

‘We’re actually losing consumption to yoga pants,’ Mr Bergh told Yahoo! last week, adding: ‘What used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable to be a yoga pants occasion, and shame on us as a category leaders for letting that happen.’

Taking over: CEOs for both Levi's and Gap have commented that they are losing sales to yoga pants, and the style's affiliated lifestyle continues to gain popularity

The brand’s numbers tell that exact story. Levi’s has experienced a near $3billion fall in revenues since 1995, which have now stalled at $4.6billion.

Mr Bergh’s comments were echoed in those made by Mr Murphy during GAP's fourth quarter earnings call in February, reports the Business of Fashion.

“As more and more trends start to push women, in particular, towards street attire, we start looking at the balance between the athletic part of our business and the going-out part of the business and… [activewear] is the new denim,’ Mr Murphy said on the call of how GAP plans to integrate a stronger athletic focus into its business.

Specifically, the company (which also operates Old Navy and Banana Republic) is rolling out a massive expansion of Athleta, its activewear brand which has grown from one store in 2011 to 65 stores in 2013. According to Business of Fashion, GAP plans to open 100 more Athleta locations by the end of this year.

The brand’s merchandise echoes the polished, slightly upscale feel that one might find at Lululemon, with $50 sports bras and $100 microfiber leggings.

The popularity of Athleta, as well as Lululemon and smaller activewear companies like Sweaty Betty make it clear that when working out, a tattered T-shirt and shorts will no longer suffice.

Left behind: Levi's (whose factory is shown here) has lost nearly $3billion in profits in the last decade - partially due to the rise of yoga pants

New focus: Levi's CEO says that the company is now focusing on innovation as a way to draw back consumers, and offers its best-selling 'commuter pant' (pictured) which boasts odor and water resistant fabric, as proof that these efforts are working

Adding to the fire are how brands like
 Juicy Couture and Urban Outfitters have just rolled out their own 
athletic offerings – both indicative of their labels’ mantras with neon 
florals for the former and batik prints for the latter.

Cumulatively, these brands show how the modern gym experience somewhat replicates today’s ongoing health food boom; which has taken the earthy-crunchy vibe out of nutrition and reproduced its principles with a slick package of $12 juices and $20 kale salads at Jean Georges restaurants and the like.

Bottom line: It is now cool to be healthy, and those who gladly shill out on health foods are begging for a wardrobe to match.

It represents a new aspirational lifestyle full of $200 private yoga sessions, $100 leggings, and $75-dollar-a-day cleanses, leaving little time or budget for jeans.

The denim industry may have initially responded to the trend early-on with the rise of the jegging in 2009, but those styles have since fallen out of favorability following multiple spoofs by everyone from College Humor to American Eagle Outfitters.

Permanent fixture: Many occasions in which women once preferred to wear jeans are now solely dedicated to yoga pants, with many wearing the leggings outside the gym

The demand for yoga pants during the work day has become so intensified that in January, Betabrand released a stretchy dress pant that could be worn at a desk or on the floor of an asana room.

But what does this all of this mean for denim? According to Mr Bergh, innovation is the way to return to the forefront of consumers’ minds – and cut through the yoga pant clutter. ‘It’s our job to get them back,’ he said of shoppers.

The CEO is so insistent on technological advancement, that he has taken a page from Google’s book by opening an innovation lab within Levi’s San Francisco headquarters.

Offering proof of its accomplishments, Mr Bergh says one of Levi’s current best-sellers is its ‘commuter’ pants, which were designed for urban cyclists and boast water-repellent, odor-preventing fabric, as well as reflective tape.

The brand is about to flood its stores with a new design that utilizes super-soft stretchy jeans as well.

Will they make a steadfast appearance at Sunday brunches nationwide? That is yet to be seen.
