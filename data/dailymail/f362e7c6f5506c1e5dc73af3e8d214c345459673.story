A baboon was shot dead today when it escaped from a zoo during a fight with other males who were trying to abduct its mate.

The baboon was killed after it managed to climb over the perimeter fence at Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside.

The adult male was forced out of its enclosure by a group of other males as it tried to protect its mate.

The animal was shot by a game keeper for safety reasons following a two-hour search around the estate in Prescot.

The park was due to open to visitors at 10am, with fathers being offered free entry to mark Father's Day.

A spokesman for the park said: 'At 8.20am on Sunday morning, the animal emergency procedure was activated after an adult male baboon was chased out of the enclosure by more than 20 other males.

'The baboon tried to protect his only female from being abducted by antagonist males - a common occurrence in baboon society.

'Cornered, he saw the outside of the enclosure as his safe way out and decided to face the electric fence to protect himself.

'The emergency procedures were immediately instigated, aiming to retrieve the baboon to a safe area.

'The police and the game keeper of the estate were contacted to assist.

Staff at the Merseyside safari park spent two hours tracking the baboon

'The baboon was located just outside the perimeter fence of the park. Sadly, in this situation, the safety measurement requires the animal to be shot.

'The estate's game keeper took the appropriate action.

'It's very sad when something like this happens, but the police, game keeper and animal management team did everything they could to resolve the situation quickly, safely and humanely.'
