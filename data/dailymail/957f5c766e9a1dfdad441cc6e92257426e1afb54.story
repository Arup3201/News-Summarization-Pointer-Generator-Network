The FBI today released dramatic footage of the Times Square bomber, who used a bicycle to flee the scene after targeting a military recruiting center.

Ten minutes of footage, showing the suspected bomber cycling away after leaving a device more powerful than both bombs used at the Boston Marathon, have been released.

The early morning blast on March 6, 2008, is being linked to two earlier attacks at foreign embassies also in New York, with the belief the suspect is a serial bomber

'Someone, somewhere, knows something 
about a bomber who's still on the run,' FBI Assistant 
Director-in-Charge George Venizelos, said.

A reward for $65,000 is being offered for the first time, as the FBI confirmed it believes the attack on the Armed Forces Career Center could be linked to attacks on the UK Embassy in 2005 and the Mexico Embassy in 2007.

Ten minutes of previously unreleased surveillance footage show the bomb detonating in Times Square and the suspected bomber cycling through the streets of New York on a blue Ross bicycle.

The footage and photos of the attack are being put up on billboards in Times Square and across the northeast.

'Today we're asking for the public's 
assistance in finding those responsible and encouraging the public to 
look closely at these photos and video, which could be the key to 
breaking the case,' Mr Venizelos told ABC.

It is possible the bomber was not working alone, the FBI said. Three figures are seen walking towards the recruiting center as the device is lit, and then walking off, seemingly with the bomber, according to the New York Times.

'Although the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five other individuals in Times Square at the time of the attack,' the FBI said.

The force of the blast, at 3.40am, shattered the front of the recruiting center, and was heard by nearby hotel guests and subway passengers.

It is not known if the suspect is a man or woman, or what age, race and height they are.

Shortly after the 2008 attack, New York City Police Department Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly told San Francisco Gate: 'Although it was cold, it was not cold enough to require an individual to have everything covered. His whole face was pretty much covered.'

The Times Square device was created from an ammunition tin packed with gunpowder. It was detonated in Times Square at 3:45am, damaging the iconic military recruiting station and blocking traffic for more than two hours.

People who were already working in offices close to the explosion were not allowed to go home, and those arriving for work were turned away.

'The bomber narrowly missed killing or injuring passers-by who can be seen clearly in the vicinity, moments before the blast,' Mr Kelly said.

'The distance between polemics by bombing and the murdering of innocents is short.'

The blue bike the bomber used to make a getaway was later found in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street by workers, about three hours after the attack, according to Fox News.

Bashir Saleh had been setting up his coffee stall near the recruiting center when the device was detonated.

'I heard a very loud explosion. It was the first time I ever heard such a thing. I thought it was some problem with the cart. I got a gas tank here. I thought it might have exploded, that’s how loud it was,' he told the New York Times shortly after the attack.

'I ran out towards the source of the noise. I saw a cloud of smoke, then I saw the police rushing towards it. In a matter of minutes there were 10 to 15 police cars. It was a scary experience for me.'

The effects of the blast were felt by guests staying at the New York Marriott Marquis.

'I felt the building shaking, and then a second after, I heard the explosion,' Mercy Sepulveda, from Fort Lauderdale, Forida, said. 'It sounded like a gas tank exploding.'

The recruiting center for all branches of the military, which had a $1 million redesign in 1999, had been a regular focal point for protests about the war in Iraq.

The device and timing of the attack there was similar to explosions in New York at the UK Embassy in 2005 and the Mexico Embassy in 2007.

In the British Embassy attack, two 
devices packed with gunpowder were left in plant pots outside the 
building on the day of the UK's general election.

The building also served as offices for a company that had attracted protests after it supplied bulldozers to Israel.

In 2007, two more hand-made devices were set off at the Mexico Embassy. Although people were in the building at the time, no injuries were reported.

Like the Times Square bomb, the devices were detonated by hand between 3am and 3.45am, and witnesses reported seeing a person riding away on a bicycle.

Anyone with information on any of the bombings should call the FBI at (212) 384-1000.
