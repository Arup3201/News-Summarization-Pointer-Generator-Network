This incredible street performer has been dubbed the real life Lord Of The Rings thanks to his amazing skills with a steel hoop.

Acrobat Isaac Hou has been filmed rolling around the streets of Taiwan in a gravity-defying routine inside a Cyr wheel.

The footage, which was shot using a GoPro camera, shows the viewpoint of an onlooker, as well as Mr Hou's point of view from within the wheel.

The video, created by Utah company Kuma Films, even comes with a warning that it may make viewers feel sick.

A spokesperson from Kuma Films said they used a GoPro camera because 'we can stick them in places that would be more difficult for other cameras and end up with really unique shots'.

The spokesperson added: 'The first thing we thought when we saw the footage back for the first time was ''hell yeah, it worked''.

'We have had two common responses to the video - people either say this is awesome, orthat made me feel sick.'Â
