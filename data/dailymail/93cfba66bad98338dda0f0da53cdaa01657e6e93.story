A single mother and her two children will be turfed out on the street if they don’t pay a four year backlog of council rates in Queensland.

Lorraine McElligott, who admits she has been living on’ Struggle Street’, has just 30 days to pay more than $11,000 in unpaid rates or her home will be put up for auction in November by the Sunshine Coast Council.

‘We have been living on a knife’s edge for a long time,’ an emotional Ms McElligott said as a failed business has left her broke and battling to keep food on the table to her two children.

Ms McElligott owes $9,367.00 plus $2,500 in interest on unpaid rates over the past four years

Ms McElligott says she is now able to start paying off her debts but the council has taken a stand.

‘We weren’t in a position to pay it but we are now on top of all of our other bills,’ she said. 

‘I offered to pay i$177 a fortnight in three years – even offered to pay $1,000 but they wouldn’t even entertain it at all.’

Thousands of properties Australia-wide are threatened with forced options of unpaid rates each year but most escape the hammer the owners have until the auction begins to find the outstanding cash.

Sunshine Coast Council sent 292 forced auction notices since June – but wouldn’t confirm how many actually go to sale.

The council released a statement saying auctioning properties is last resort used only after council had used all avenues to allow property owners to pay

‘Despite eight rate notices, eight reminder letters, numerous phone and other correspondence Ms McElligott has paid zero rates on her property for more than four years,’ it stated.

Sunshine Coast Council stated that it was left with no choice but to send an auction notice

But Ms McElligott plans to fight back and is rallying fellow rate defaulters to unite to get council to overturn the decision to sell their homes.

‘This is our home we have to fight we have no other options,’ she said. 

‘There are some people who are really doing it tough like me – there’s a few of us around and I wold like to get a group together to work with the council.’

Red Tape Busters managing director Shane Bowering said homeowners should stand up and demand that council listen to them.

‘I don’t understand why they are not working with this resident and working out a payment plan so the money can be paid back and the person gets to keep their home,’ he said.

‘They are not looking at the collateral damage that’s going to happen to this family who’s going to be out on the street,’ Mr Bowering said.

‘And who’s going to be picking up the tab for them - Department of Housing? That’s going to be a cost as well.'

He advised home owners to take action quickly if they fell behind in their payments.

Council needs to be thinking with more empathy and looking at how they can work with their ratepayers rather than turfing them out

Ms McElligott just asked for a bit of a break.

‘This sort of thing I hate to say it can happen to anybody sometimes there are times when you are down,’ she said. 

‘Sometimes you just need a wee bit of help and a bit of space,’ she said. ‘We are praying for a fair go – it’s about all we’ve got left.’
