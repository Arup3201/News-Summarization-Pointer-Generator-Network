On trial: Renata Sode, 26, is accused of shaking a three-month-old baby so hard it became brain damaged - then delayed getting medical help

A Lithuanian woman shook a three month-old boy so hard he suffered brain damage and then waited 12 hours before calling an ambulance, a court has heard.

Renata Sode, 26, also carried out internet searches for 'baby in coma' and 'baby having difficulty breathing' after attacking the child in September 2012, a jury was told.

Doctors at  Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, first believed the baby, who cannot be named, might be suffering from a viral infection before becoming suspicious at his injuries, it is alleged.

The little boy was described as 'grunting' as he tried to fill its lungs. 

His fontanelle, the soft area of a baby's skull, was raised and swollen, indicating bleeding of the brain, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told.

His condition was so serious that he was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at King's College Hospital, London.

Further tests revealed he had very little brain activity and was likely to have suffered brain damage. 

The boy also had extensive bleeding in his eyes and  bruising on his abdomen, the court heard.

Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said: 'What caused [the baby] to become so very unwell? The crown say that the subdural bleeding was the result of traumatic injury caused by being shaken or a mechanism involving some kind of shaking.

'The prosecution say it was deliberate injury caused by shaking. The defence say some other medical condition can't be ruled out.'

Miss Howes continued: 'Who caused these injuries? It's the crown's case that they were caused by Renata Sode and, knowing and appreciating what she had done, she didn't contact emergency services for the best part of 12 hours.

'Having watched what she had done to him she watched him deteriorate - she finally called for an ambulance.'

Her partner, Mindaugas Sodys, 31, is also accused of failing to provide medical assistance when the baby fell ill.

The Lithuanian couple told doctors they had given mouth to mouth to the baby when it stopped breathing a few hours before the emergency call.

Sode said she hadn't called an ambulance sooner because his condition had seemed to be improving.

Shocking: Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that the little boy had bleeding on the brain and was brain damaged

An analysis of Sode's phone showed that she had searched terms including 'baby in coma', 'baby is pale', 'baby having difficulty breathing' and 'London Ambulance Service' several hours before raising the alarm, the court heard.

Sode, of Rainham, Essex, denies one counts of cruelty to a person under 16, one count of GBH, two counts of assault occasioning ABH and one count of causing or allowing a child to suffer physical harm.

Sodys, of the same address, denies one count of cruelty to a person under 16 and one could of causing or allowing a child to suffer physical harm.

The trial continues.
