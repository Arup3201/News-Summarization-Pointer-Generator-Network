Beloved actor Tom Hanks’ aspiring hip-hop star son faced a barrage of ridicule this week for his use of rapper slang.

Chet Haze AKA Chester Hanks got into a Twitter brawl with a former rapper named Jensen Karp starting on Sunday.

The hilarious exchange between actor scion and quick-witted rapper had no official winner, but it highlighted the rift between Haze’s gangster online persona and affluent upbringing.

Fishwrapper.com points out that it all started because of a tweet that Haze, whose mother is actress Rita Wilson, wrote on November 26 about an open mic he planned to attend near LA’s Fairfax High School.

‘ima be there blessing the mic with spoken word,’ @CHETHAZE wrote.

By Sunday, Karp had noticed Haze’s tweet and the comedic white former rapper aimed his sharp tongue at the music industry hopeful.

‘Your dad was in Castaway,’ joked Karp, whose Twitter handle is @JensenClan88.

Roots? The feud began over this tweet that Chester, AKA Chet HAze, sent out in November about an open mic night

Blowing his top: Karp decided to remind Hanks of where he comes from and the aspiring hip-hop singer son of the Joe vs the Volcano star was none too happy

Haze was not amused. He demanded to know what his Oscar winning father had to do with anything.

The Twitter war quickly heated up with Karp hitting Haze where it hurts with hilarious references to his well-off childhood in the hallowed corners of Hollywood.

‘U went to private school & talk like you're French Montana. Even saying "swagger" should be illegal for a kid raised in Brentwood,’ Karp wrote.

Haze fought back, but his continued use of slang wasn’t helping his case.

Hanks is a theater student at the prestigious Northwestern University

‘Difference btwn me & these clowns is I will beat your a** if I see u in person. y'all are all #soft,’ Haze wrote at one point.

Haze became angry enough by Monday to lash out at Karp with a cavalcade of tweets.

‘My whole life I been getting s--- from jealous nerds like you simply because I love Rap. It's f---ing hilarious.

‘My passion has nothing to do with your petty existence, so don't f---in get them twisted. Difference between me and these clowns is I actually will beat your ass if I see u in person whereas y'all are all #soft. Y'all just use the same jokes over and over again. Forrest Gump, Capt Phillips ha ha ha.

Funny guy: Karp, right, had a brief rapping career that ended when he departed Interscope records in 2007. His never-released album featured appearances by Kanye West, Redman, and Maya. He now runs an LA art gallery

‘Say something original at least. I'm outta here doe. Just wanted to keep it real on these twitter nerds for once...’

More than just a ‘Twitter nerd,’ Karp is an accomplished rapper under the name Hot Karl. He was once signed to Interscope Records and according to Complex.com his never-released album featured artists Kanye West, Fabolous, Mya, Redman, and others.

'Born CRAZY RICH': Karp unleashed a barrage of jokes on Haze and questioning the authenticity of the way he speaks

He now runs a Los Angeles art gallery, manages a rapper named Nova Rockefeller, and hosts a successful podcast.

According to Haze’s Facebook page biography, Chester Marlon Hanks:

‘is a multitalented singer, songwriter and actor who feels most at home when he’s performing. Born in 1990 to actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Chet was practically raised to be in the spotlight— something he thanks God for everyday.’

He is a theater major at prestigious Northwestern University.
