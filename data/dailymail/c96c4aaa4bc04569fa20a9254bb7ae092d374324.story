David Beckham has a whole host of celebrity friends and it appears he's added tennis superstar Rafael Nadal to the ever growing list.

The former footballer was out celebrating fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's birthday and posed for a snap with the Spaniard.

Beckham is currently out in United States discussing plans for his proposed MLS franchise, while Nadal is in preparing to play in the Miami Open with the first round getting underway on Thursday.

The ex-England captain revealed plans to launch a new $25 million MLS franchise after exercising an option tied into the lucrative contract he signed after making a potentially risky move from Madrid to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.

But the development of a new stadium has hit a snag, with an adequate location yet to be approved; team management, name and kit colours have also yet to be finalised by Beckham and his fellow investors.

In March, a Beckham source told The Guardian: ‘Things are progressing in Miami, and we are very much on track in our plans.

‘David Beckham is very positive about the future of the club and he continues to enjoy incredible support from the people in Miami.

‘Right now, our focus is on identifying the location for a purpose-built stadium that will be the team’s permanent home.’ 

Nadal had an injury scare during a hitting session with Grigor Dimitrov on Monday morning.

After appearing to role his ankle, the No 2 seed limped off before being seen moving a lot more freely as he returned to his car - much to the relief of the competition organisers.
