Child stars of the West End hit Matilda are earning just £250 a week - nearly £1,000 less than their American counterparts will be paid when the musical opens in Broadway next year.

The girls who play the starring role in The Royal Shakespeare Company stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic are paid £60 a performance or £30 for being on standby.

They usually appear on stage twice a week and their weekly income rises to around £250 with rehearsal fees.

But the youngsters chosen to tread the boards at New York's Shubert Theatre in the Spring can expect to earn £1,095.

The London show plays to sell out crowds at the Cambridge Theatre - telling the tale of a little girl's rebellion against a money obsessed world.

But with the show able to generate an estimated £7,000 a performance, the producers have been accused of taking advantage of an ambitious young cast.

Lara Wollington, nine, Chloe Hawthorn, 10, Lucy-Mae Beacock, 10, and Hayley Canham, 10, share the role of Matilda but must give up the part when they reach 4ft 5in.

They appear on stage for much of the show, which is nearly three hours long.

Sylvia Young, who runs the acclaimed 
Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, stressed there are high 
expectations of the girls.

She told The Sunday Times: 'The work they do within the show is enormous, as much or more than the adults. Kids are not paid as well as they should be there is no question about that.

'By the times the parents have paid the expense to and from the theatre, that's the fee eaten up. It would be nice if they found a little more for the children on big hit shows.'

A spokesperson for the show said 'contractually' they cannot discuss any fees or salaries paid to cast members.

But they added: 'We are content that the young actresses who play Matilda are paid fees that are appropriately above the Equity recommendations.

'Each actress typically performs in two shows a week and is on standby for another two.'

The producers also pay for chaperones for the children and meet some meal and travel costs.

Equity's minimum fee per performance is just under £38 but the union's head of live performance, Hilary Hadley, said: 'A figure of about £60 is disappointingly low for a child that is basically a lead role in a show.'
