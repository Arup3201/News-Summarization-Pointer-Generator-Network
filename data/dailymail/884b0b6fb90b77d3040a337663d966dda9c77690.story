A father who suffered a horrific car accident while working for multinational company Kellogg’s has revealed how they terminated his employment via email when he wasn't well enough  to get back to his job soon enough.

Scott McAtamney, from Rockhampton, had been working as a sales rep for the food company in Queensland for seven years and was on his way to set up a sales display when his car was reportedly hit by another driver in January 2013.

‘For a company as big as Kellogg’s, I carried my name on their shirt for seven years and they gave me the least amount of money they possibly could,’ Mr McAtamney told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I just couldn’t fathom what I’ve done for them to sack me by email,’ he added.

‘What really hurt me is I left work for something that wasn’t my fault.’

Scott McAtamney suffered over 10 broken bones and brain damage during a car accident in January 2013

The father of two has now been fired from his job as a sales rep at Kellogg's 

During the accident, his white Ford Mondeo smashed into a tree as it flew off the road and left Scott with life threatening injuries.

The 41-year-old suffered brain damage, a collapsed lung, and a broken back, along with a broken shoulder bone, wrist, ankles and five smashed ribs.

Since the devastating crash he has developed post-traumatic stress disorder and has seen the return of his epilepsy, triggered by the brain damage.

‘The pain is ongoing but at the end of the day I am lucky to be sitting here now. I’m scared about what it’s going to be like later on in life… I’ve got two beautiful kids so I look at them to be OK,’ he said while describing his agonising pain.

The driver who clipped him didn’t stop and was never identified. The father-of-two explained that he found out too late past the legal claims period that he could have claimed compensation from third party insurance.

Mr McAtamney’s wife is also an on the road sales rep and he now worries for her own safety every time she leaves for work.

‘I give her a kiss and hope she drives safely. I just think every day “what if she doesn’t come home” though,’ he explained.

The sacked salesmen tried to go back to work - despite doctor’s advice that it was too soon - and felt panicked on the roads every time a car came past.

He’s been seeing a psychiatrist and a neurologist over the past 12 months but ‘doesn’t even like driving to the corner shop’ now.

‘I went back to work before I should have because I needed the company car. It was six months after the crash and I was doing restricted hours… but the doctors said it was doing more harm than good for my post-traumatic stress,’ Mr McAtamney said.

Mr McAtamney says looking at his children has helped him to stay positive

Mr McAtamney's wife is also a sales rep and has to drive a lot for her job, which worries him 

The dad can no longer afford to send his daughter to day care and looks after her at home

It was then that Kellogg’s said they would ‘probably have to’ let him go. 

Mr McAtamney admits that Kellogg’s haven’t done anything wrong legally but he is angry about how they handled his termination.

‘At this stage I’m just that angry and my heads screwed up… there are days when I won’t even answer my phone to my mates.

‘I’m not trying to play the violin and get people to feel sorry for me… I’m angry that I gave them 110 per cent for seven years and they go on about “K Values” but I was treated like this,’ he said.

Mr McAtamney received four weeks’ pay from Kellogg’s and 'any remaining annual leave entitlements' when his employment was terminated by email on October 8.

His white Ford Mondeo was destroyed during the accident 

The 41-year-old's lung collapsed during the accident and he was forced to a have blood transfusion 

Mr McAtamney received an email from Kellogg's on October 2 informing him that he would be losing his job

In the email, seen by Daily Mail Australia, Kellogg's says: 'This letter confirms your employment has been terminated effective on 8 October 2014 on medical grounds.'

It goes on to say that Kellogg's does not 'agree' with his views 'regarding the company's responsibility arising from the car accident'.

Mr McAtamney said with a $300,000 mortgage to pay, he has been forced to pull his daughter out of childcare.

Meanwhile, WorkCover Queensland are covering 75 per cent of his former wage until he can find a new job if and when he is fit enough to work again.

A Kellogg spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'This was a complicated issue as a valued staff member had suffered terrible injuries in a car accident almost 18 months ago.' 

'The company has been working with Scott in this period and we believe we have taken a reasonable and considered approach.

'Over the past 18 months, Kellogg had facilitated Scott’s return to his role with reduced responsibilities and working hours. As soon as Scott was able to drive again, a replacement vehicle was provided to him. 

'In the interim, Kellogg had organised a hire car for his use. Due to his health, Scott was unable to continue work, and it’s highly unlikely he’ll be able to return to work anytime soon. 

'With this in mind, Kellogg had made the difficult decision to end Scott’s employment. WorkCover is continuing to provide Scott with support, which includes medical and financial support, as well as re-training options,' the spokesperson explained. 

Kellogg's paid Mr McAtamney full time workers compensation following the accident and when he returned to work in a reduced capacity, he was paid a salary as well as his workers compensation payment.
