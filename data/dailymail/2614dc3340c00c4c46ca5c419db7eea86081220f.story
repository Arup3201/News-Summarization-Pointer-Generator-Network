A 24-year-old North Carolina woman is accused of smuggling marijuana inside a prison in her 4-year-old son's pants.

Mother Jenifer Lynn Patterson of Fairmont was charged this week with providing drugs to an inmate, the Fayetteville Observer reported.

Patterson provided the marijuana to her 24-year-old boyfriend Cody Lambert, the Columbus County Sheriff's Office told the newspaper.

Lambert was in jail serving a nearly three-year sentence for being a felon in possession of a gun, Detective Kevin Norris told the Fayetteville Observer.

Lambert has been charged with being an inmate in possession of marijuana, Norris said.

Norris also told the news outlet that two children that were with Patterson when she went to the prison Sunday have been handed over to the Department of Social Services. 

'It was caught on video,' he told the Fayetteville Observer of the smuggling.

The alleged smuggling took place at Columbus Correctional Institution, sheriff's office spokesman Chief Deputy Bobby Worley said.

Worley confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Lambert was tipped off by Patterson as to the marijuana's location - and that she left the room and escorted one of her children to the restroom.

Worley confirmed that Lambert gave the 4-year-old boy a hug and got the marijuana out of his pocket in that timeframe.

It was not clear if Patterson had a lawyer.
