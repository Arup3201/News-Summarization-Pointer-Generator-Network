A heartwarming photo of three young girls from Oklahoma who are fighting cancer has inspired thousands of people after it went viral online.

The picture, showing Rylie, 3, Rheann, 6, and Ainsley, 4, was taken by Lora Scantling to raise awareness of childhood cancer.

It shows the girls, who had never met before the photo shoot, hugging as they unite in their battle to beat the disease.

The owner of Scantling Photography in Bethany rallied the support of two children's clothing boutiques and Goodger Photography to provide everything she needed for the photo shoot.

She said: 'I wanted to capture something that would speak a million words in a single portrait. Bringing awareness to childhood cancer holds a special place in my heart.'

The cause is particular 
poignant for Ms Scantling, whose stepfather Larry is fighting off stage 4 lung
 cancer. Her close friend also lost her one-year-old to leukemia.Â 

The photographer has certainly achieved her aim, with the beautifully shot image under the banner 'Sometimes strength comes in knowing you are not alone'.

Ms Scantling told Mail Online: 'When we took these photos I knew they would be a big hit because of what they represented but never in a million years would I have imagined all this.

'I am so deeply honored that so many around the world have wanted to share their story and that it is touching so many lives.'

She added: 'I can't tell you how many emails and messages I have received over the last few days just telling me how much the photo meant to them.

'It's a dream come true to have my photo be such an inspiration and to be reaching people all around the globe.'

The young girls who posed for the photo had never met before but Ms Scantling said they quickly became good friends.

On the Scantling Photography Facebook page she wrote: 'I have never met 3 more beautiful little girls in my life - full of spirit and so happy and strong.'

The youngest of the girls, Rylie, has just beaten kidney cancer; Rheann is still battling the rare form of brain cancer she was diagnosed with; and Ainsley is in remission from leukemia.

Their families love the photos and have been overwhelmed by the reaction to them on social media.

Rylie's mother, Bridget Hughes, told News 9: 'When you think of cancer, you typically think of adults of having cancer. I'm glad that people are seeing that there are a lot of kids out there struggling and fighting.'

With the first set of picture being such a success Ms Scantling plans to use her talent to continue to raise awareness, and told Mail Online she can't wait to start her next project.
