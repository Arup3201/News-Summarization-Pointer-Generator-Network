A noisy group of Wall Street protestors gathered near Michael Bloomberg's home to show their displeasure with the New York mayor's decision to evict the Occupy Wall Street movement from Zuccatti Park.

Banging drums and blaring musical instruments the protestors got about half a block away from Mayor Bloomberg's east-side New York townhouse near Central Park Sunday.

A live-streaming video from one of the protestors shows about a dozen people gathered on a street reveling and dancing. Some held signs others waved American flags.

Noisy: Protestors showed their anger at Mayor Michael Bloomberg by staging a drum circle near his New York townhouse

Uniformed New York police officers stood by, watching them from barricades they had erected.

It was unknown whether Mayor Bloomberg was home at the time.

Meanwhile, cops arrested five people at Zuccatti park over the weekend, including a man who had a handgun and a protestor who tried to pack in sleeping gear.

Cops said Joshua Fellows, 32, faces criminal possession of a weapon after they found a .45-caliber handgun and 32 rounds of ammunition in a truck he rented in North Carolina.

Officers originally arrested Fellows Thursday after seeing about 40 people jumping in and out of a Budget rental truck.

When they searched the vehicle Saturday, they found the gun and tracked Fellows down to the same area, where they arrested him again.

Another man, Zach Breur, 22, was also arrested Saturday after he allegedly groped the breasts and buttocks of a 22-year-old woman. He was charged with two counts of forcible touching.

Michael Doe, who cops said was homeless, was arrested Saturday evening and charged with criminal mischief after officers saw him tampering with Christmas lights at the park.

Another homeless man was arrested at the park after he thew an unknown liquid in a police officer's face.

Finally, Star Bun, a 24-year-old Brooklyn woman, was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest when she tried to pack sleeping gear into Zuccatti park.

District of Columbia 
police on Saturday evening arrested 11 protesters and planned to charge 
them with unlawful entry after officers entered and cleared an abandoned
city-owned building that had been occupied by a group inspired by 
Occupy D.C.

Supporters of the protesters 
cheered as officers led demonstrators from the downtown Washington 
building in handcuffs and into two police vans.

The
group Free Franklin began occupying the four-story Franklin School on 
Saturday, protesting the lack of housing for homeless people. The 
historic building served as a homeless shelter until 2008.

Participants
with handkerchiefs over their faces lowered a banner from the roof that
said "Public Property under Community Control." More than 60 supporters
gathered in a park near the red-brick building and cheered the 
protesters. The building is two blocks from Occupy D.C.'s encampment.

Marching on: Protestors planned to drum outside the mayor's townhouse for 24 hours because they are angry he decided to evict them from Zuccatti Park

Group spokeswoman Abigail DeRoberts said earlier Saturday that protesters plan to remain in the building indefinitely.

Police watched as protesters hung the banner and later called firefighters and more officers to the scene.

Protesters
said police and firefighters then entered the building with crow bars 
and other instruments. Supporters blocked alleys around the building 
and chanted, "We are the 99 percent."

Demonstrators
blocked alleys next to the building even after police officers went 
inside. By early evening, the banner had come down.

Busted: Several people were arrested at Zuccatti Park this weekend, including this man, who tried to pack a sleeping bag in so he could camp out

A
spokesperson for Mayor Vincent Gray told ABC7 in Washington that the 
protesters in the building at 13th and K Street, NW "will be removed and
arrested."

Louis Cannon, chief of the D.C. 
Protective Services Police, told The Associated Press that 11 protesters
were arrested inside the building, including eight men and three women.
Each will be charged with unlawful entry and could face up to a year in
jail and a fine if convicted of the misdemeanor charge. He said none 
put up any resistance when they were arrested.

"We
did a sweep of the building and they were all on the roof," said 
Cannon, whose agency protects D.C. government-owned, -leased and 
-managed facilities and property.

The chief said the building is now boarded-up and welded shut, and police are investigating how the protesters gained entry.

He
said the building has been vacant since 2008. Cannon said his agency 
was called to the scene at about 3 p.m. and had cleared the building by 7
p.m., with help from dozens of officers from the Metropolitan Police 
and U.S. Park Police

Following the arrests, 
more than 50 protesters remained in the middle of 13th Street, NW, which
was blocked off by dozens of police cars. Some chanted, "Our children's
future is not for sale." More officers arrived at the scene, but the 
crowd began to break up after the building had been cleared and the 
arrested protesters taken away.
