The transgender teen from Huntington Beach, California, whose birth name is Lance, has been living as a woman for the past three years.

Last week she made history at Marina High School, when she was selected as one of the top 10 finalists for homecoming queen.

Ms Campbell said the nomination was more about her fight for acceptance as a transgender than the title of homecoming queen.

‘Gay people have been brought into the limelight and it’s a very touched on subject,’ she told KTLA5. ‘It’s much more talked about than transgender is.’

Ms Campbell has gained a large following on her YouTube channel where she has posted video clips to show her transformation from a boy to a girl.

Some of her videos have garnered more than 500,000 views.

Controversial: California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law which allows transgender students in public schools to 'participate in sex-segregated programs'

She said she has always felt trapped in the wrong body, even as a child, according to  KTLA5.

She said her openness about her sexuality had come at a price and that bullying was nothing new to her, including at school.

‘Sometimes they’ll say f***** when I’m walking by or they’ll call me names,’ Ms Campbell said.

The issue of transgender expression within the public school system has recently reached national attention.

California Governor Jerry Brown signed a controversial bill into law which allows transgender students in public schools to ‘participate in sex-segregated programs, activities, and facilities’ in line with their birth gender and self-perception.

Ms Campbell’s mother, Christine Campbell, said she is happy her daughter is expressing herself.

‘I’m so glad that so many people have walked this path before her and have laid the groundwork,’ she said.

Ms Campbell will find out on September 20 whether she is crowned queen.

In a separate case this week, a Pennsylvania school board agreed to review a request by a biologically female student who was denied the opportunity to appear on the ballot for homecoming king.

Kasey Caron, 17, was assigned as female at birth, but identifies and presents as male.

He was born with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that leads to a hormone imbalance where the ovaries make more androgens – sometimes called male hormones – than normal and has had to field the question ‘Are you a boy or a girl?’ throughout his childhood.

For the bulk of his four years at Richland High School in Johnstown, Caron's teachers and classmates have recognised him as male.

The school board agreed discussed the issue at a meeting on Monday night, but ultimately no final decision was taken.
