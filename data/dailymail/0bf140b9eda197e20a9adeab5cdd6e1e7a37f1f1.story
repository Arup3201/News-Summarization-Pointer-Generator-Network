An unemployed woman made no effort to find a job because she was waiting for the inheritance from her mother’s will, a judge was told.

Benefits dependent Christine Watts, 47, became unemployed in 2005, but expected to be rescued by a share of her mother’s £200,000 estate, the High Court heard.

However, Miss Watts was left with nothing after her mother, Valerie, changed her will on her deathbed, leaving everything to son Gary.

Christine Watts (left), who has been claiming benefits for years, has launched a legal battle to get the £200,000 inheritance she thought would afford her the 'easy life' after her mother died, a court has heard

She is now challenging the validity of the will, arguing that it must have been forged or was not properly executed.

Miss Watts and her brother are fighting  over their mother’s home in Dartford, Kent, and the savings that she left Gary, 44, when she died aged 71 after signing her will in  hospital in January 2011 during her final illness.

Gary says he deserves every penny of his inheritance for the years he spent caring for his mother, but his sister is fighting to convince Judge Catherine Newman QC that she is due a share.

‘I need money for living expenses,’ she told the judge.

The court heard Miss Watts, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was adopted by Valerie and her then husband Leonard in 1967 from a children’s home when she was just ten months old. Her brother was taken in three years later when less than a year old.

Her counsel, Jordan Holland, told the court she has back problems and psychological issues which make it impossible for her to work. He argued that made her ‘dependent’ on her late mother, despite being an adult.

But Neil McLarnon, for Gary Watts, accused her of making no effort to find work while she waited for her mother to die.

Christine Watts, 47, has 'done nothing to get a job' since she became unemployed in 2005, because she expected to be rescued by a share of her mother's estate, the High Court heard

However Miss Watts, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was left without a penny when her mother, Valerie, changed her will on her deathbed. Instead left her house (pictured) in Dartford, Kent, and all her savings to her son Gary, 44

The barrister said: ‘You are trying 
to give the impression that you have severe medical problems in the hope
 of securing some sort of compensation from your mother’s estate.’

Miss
 Watts, who used to work as an underwriter, replied: ‘I feel that, if I 
take a job, I would not be able to commit to it because of taking time 
off sick and it wouldn’t be fair.’

She added that she has debts that she
 considers large, but denied that she had been waiting for her mother’s 
death to save her from financial dire straits. Explaining why Mrs Watts 
had cut her daughter out of her will, Gary said: ‘She was disappointed 
with her not showing any concern for her, not coming up and visiting 
her.’

He said his mother first talked of cutting her out of the will in 2006, but he persuaded her not to.

He
 added: ‘I didn’t dissuade her in 2011 because it was mum’s last wish, 
that she wanted to make known, and I would not go against mum’s last 
wish.’

Judge Newman has reserved  her decision on the case until a later date.
