Asiana Airlines has confirmed it is taking legal action against the TV station which used false and racist names for four pilots on board the fatal plane crash.

The embattled airline claims its reputation has been 'badly damaged' after San Francisco's KTVU broadcast fake and insulting names, such as 'Captain Sum Ting Wong', with a graphic of the phony titles.

Also in the airline's sights is the National Transportation Safety Board whose summer intern erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on Asiana flight 214 when it crashed at San Francisco International Airport earlier this month.

In poor taste: KTVU News read these names live on television today stating that the National Transportation Safety Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214

Asiana is suing KTVU-TV to 'strongly respond to its racially discriminatory report', Asiana spokeswoman Lee Hyomin said.

She said the airline will likely file suit in U.S. courts. KTVU-TV did not immediately reply to emails sent by The Associated Press seeking comment.

The station was quick to correct the gaffe after an ad break following the humiliating broadcast, clarifying the names were clearly wrong and blaming the NTSB for the incorrect information.

The NTSB also apologized, releasing a statement admitting a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names.Â 

'The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6,' the NTSB said.

'Earlier today, in response to an 
inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of 
his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew
on the aircraft.'

However neither the station nor the NTSB commented on where the names originated.

The four pilots, who underwent questioning by a U.S. and South Korean joint investigation team while in the U.S., returned to South Korea on Saturday

South Korean officials plan to conduct separate interviews with them, according to South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
