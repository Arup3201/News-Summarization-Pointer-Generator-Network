Five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather claims his fight with Amir Khan can still happen and dismissed claims that Manny Pacquiao would provide the British boxer with a sterner test.

The proposed fight between Khan and Mayweather is yet to materialise, despite it being touted consistently by both camps, and the 37-year-old American reiterated his desire to see it happen. 

'He (Amir Khan) knows that the fight between us can still happen,' Mayweather said.

Fight: Mayweather was bullish in response to Khan's claims that Pacquiao would prove a tougher opponent

'He is an exciting young fighter - but I don't just fight anybody - they have to prove themselves. 

'If you ask me will the fight happen - then I would say yes. I hope next year - but these fights are always about timing.

'I saw the comments where he thought Manny would give him a tougher fight than me. I have no response to that. I will just remind him of those comments after I have beaten him.'

Discussions: Talks have begun over the possibility of Khan fighting Kell Brook next year at Wembley

Meanwhile, talks have begun to ensure a fight between Khan and newly-crowned IBF welterweight world champion Kell Brook next year at Wembley.

Brook's manager Eddie Hearn opened discussions after the Sheffield-born boxer's win over Shawn Porter in California.

If Khan beat Brook then many believe 27-year-old could finally set up a match with Mayweather
