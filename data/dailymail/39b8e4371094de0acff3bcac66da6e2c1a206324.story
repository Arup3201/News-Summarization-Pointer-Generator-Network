Police found the body of an eight-months-pregnant teen dead in the back of her suspected killer's car, after the man committed suicide at the end of a high-speed chase Thursday night.

The body of 18-year-old Brooke Slocum, who was carrying unborn daughter Audi Lynn, was discovered just one day after cops found her 25-year-old boyfriend Charlie Oppenneer murdered in a Wyoming, Michigan park.

On Friday, Wyoming Police Chief James Carmody identified the dead suspect as Brady Oestrike, 31, also of Wyoming and said he connected with Slocum on Craigslist.

Suspect dead: Slocum's body was found in the trunk of suspected killer Brady Oestrike's (pictured) car. He led police on a high-speed chase Thursday night before crashing the car and then allegedly shooting himself dead

Police were keeping watch at Oestrike's home Thursday night, waiting on a warrant to search the house, when they saw him drive away at around 9:15pm.

A SWAT team had been called in to aid in the search sine they suspected Oestrike had 'assault-style' weapons on the premises.

Oestrike then led police on a high-speed chase through the town.

At one point he briefly pulled over, but then fled again and eventually crashed his car near the entrance ramp for US-131.

When police went up to the car to make an arrest, they found Oestrike dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

They found Slocum's body in the back of the crashed car, just one day after her boyfriend was discovered murdered.

Police say Slocum met Oestrike on Craigslist the previous weekend. Pictured above, Oestrike's crashed car

Police found Oppenneer's body in a wooded area in south Wyoming around noon on Wednesday.

Slocum was reported missing after Oppenneer's body was discovered, since she was the last person believed to have contact with him.

Friends and family said they hadn't heard from Slocum since Saturday night.

At the press conference on Friday, police revealed that Slocum met her suspected killer online.

Oestrike and Slocum had contact on Craigslist Saturday night going into early Sunday, around the time friends last heard from her.

However, police have not announced a motive in the crime and will not say how either Slocum or her boyfriend Oppenneer died.

The investigation is ongoing.Â
