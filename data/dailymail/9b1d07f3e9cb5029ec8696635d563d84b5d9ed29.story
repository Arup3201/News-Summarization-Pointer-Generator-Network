A group of travellers have set up camp around a war memorial, with children reportedly seen clambering up the structure and a poppy wreath cast aside.

A local Royal British Legion branch member hit out at the travellers near the Cenotaph in the Low Moor area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, saying he was ‘very disappointed’ at them.

Despite initially agreeing to move on after claiming not to realise they were on a war memorial site, the travellers could still be seen on the site yesterday.

Jeffrey Long, a member of the Bradford Central branch of the British Legion, said: ‘One cannot describe the feeling, really. What words can you say?

‘I am very disappointed, after they apologised and said they would move. The word is gutted - I really am gutted. I was so relieved they apologised.  I just have no time for them now.’

The travellers arrived on the site on Tuesday, when four caravans suddenly appeared. A man among the group, who would not give his name, said they had not known the significance of the memorial.

He added: ‘When we were told what it was, we apologised. If we did know what it was we wouldn't have gone on there. We didn't know what it was.’

The man claimed that none of the travellers could read or write, but insisted they would clean up any rubbish on the site before they left tonight.

He said: ‘We were speaking to the cops and we apologised. We do have a bit of respect. We are keeping the kids away from it and we are going later on. We are keeping it quiet and clean.’

But Labour councillor David Warburton condemned the travellers, calling the move ‘disgusting’.

He said: ‘I think it is absolutely 
disgraceful. It is bad enough they go on council land, but council land 
that is a memorial to the dead, people who have fought for this country,
 it is absolutely disgusting.

‘Clearly they have no morals, and no understanding and no care for people of this country or this area… It is a public nuisance. It is something we do not tolerate.

‘We thought it would have been a site that would have been safe. We have done lots of protection round local sites such as village greens - but we thought this would have been safe.’

Because of the traveller’s actions, locally-based Clayton Primary School and Nursery has been forced to postpone its summer fete, which was due to be held yesterday.

Headteacher Joanna Kurasinski said: ‘The school and the Parents, Teacher and Friends Association have taken the joint decision to postpone our summer fete until September 13.

'When we were told what it was, we apologised. If we did know what it was we wouldn't have gone on there. We didn't know what it was'

‘The decision has not been taken lightly but we consider it to be in the best interests of the school community to ensure we have a successful event. We are continuing to work closely with the local authority to resolve the current situation as soon as possible.’

John Major, Bradford Council's assistant director for environmental health and regulatory services, said: ‘We are aware of these sites and will be visiting them.

‘If they are on council-owned land we will be starting the court process as quickly as possible to obtain a possession order to remove those camped on it.’

A council spokesman warned the court process could take up to ten days.
