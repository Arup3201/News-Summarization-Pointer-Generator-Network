A mother today told how she fears for her two-year-old daughter's safety after her garden became overrun by Britain's most dangerous spider.

Nicole Whelan, 21, has had to kill up to 23 of the venomous false widow spiders in a single day as the infestation reached plague proportions.

She has already been bitten by one of the beasts and has resorted to killing them with Flash bathroom spray cleaner to prevent the tiny arachnids from getting in to her home in Swindon.

Infestation: Nicole Whelan, 21, was horrified to discover Britain's most dangerous spider has overrun her garden in Swindon

Zapped: Ms Whelan is fighting back against the false widow spiders which have started to appear in numbers in her garden

Ms Whelan has 
now banned her daughter from playing outside amid fears she could suffer
 a potentially-fatal bite.

She
 said: 'The number of spiders in the garden has increased so rapidly in 
the last 10 days I dread to think what's going to happen in the future.

'I'm worried that as it is getting colder they are wanting to come inside.

Venomous: Ms Whenlan has been overrun with the false widow spiders - a few of which are pictured - and has killed up to 23 of them in a single day

'Last night we had a couple of the 
spiders on the patio door - if the door would have been left open they 
would have been in the house.'

The single mother first saw the spiders shortly before she was admitted to hospital for an operation.

After
 returning home ten days later she discovered the number of arachnids in
 her garden had increased dramatically, some the size of a 50p coin.

Nicole has already been bitten on the forearm and has puncture wounds in her skin.

Menace: Dozens of the tiny by dangerous spiders have spun webs all over Nicole Whelan's garden in Swindon

She said: 'My daughter is not allowed to play outside, where she has a wendy house full of toys, because I'm worried that the spiders may be hidden in there.

'I've already been bitten by one of the spiders and I worry if the same was to happen to her it could potentially be deadly - as young people are affected more severely by the bites.

'I know some people are saying they are completely harmless but actually experts say that being bitten by the spider is similar to being stung by a bee - and no responsible parent would let their children play by a bee's nest.'

Nicole has been following the advice issued by experts and killing the spiders wherever possible.

She blasts them with bathroom cleaner but says the big ones then take up to 30 minutes to die.

'I killed 23 spiders just last night by spraying them with bathroom cleaner - it's all I've got that will rid of them.

'The problem is they jump at you, I'm not being a big scaredy cat

'The biggest one I've seen so far has been about the size of a 50p coin, excluding the legs.'

The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, pictured right, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.

This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

The key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs.

Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight.

If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
