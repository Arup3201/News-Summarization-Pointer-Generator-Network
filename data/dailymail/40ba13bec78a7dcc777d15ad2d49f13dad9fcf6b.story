Do you live in a corrupt state on don't realize it?

A new study claims to have determined the most unscrupulous states in the USA, based on research of more than 25,000 convictions of public officials for violation of federal corruption laws between 1976 and 2008.

A joint venture between the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University, the study also looked at patterns in state spending to develop a corruption index, in order to estimate the most and least corrupt states in the union.

According to business magazine Fortune, the findings put Mississippi as the most corrupt state in America.

Named: The 10 most-corrupt states in the USA have need revealed in a joint study by the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University, with the list lead by Mississippi

Mississippi is almost the poorest state in the corrupt, Yahoo's Main Street reported.

Interestingly, the data collected for the study goes beyond what is reported in the media, with many of the cases being small.

The results may therefore surprise people, with some of the states listed not necessarily having a reputation for being crooked.

It also means states that do have a reputation for highly-publicized corruption, such as New Jersey and New York, do not make the list.

1. Mississippi

2. Louisiana

3. Tennessee

4. Illinois

5. Pennsylvania

6. Alabama

7. Alaska

8. South Dakota

9. Kentucky

10. Florida

The report said that: 'States with higher levels of corruption are likely to favor construction, salaries, borrowing, correction, and police protection at the expense of social sectors such as education, health and hospitals.'

The researchers - Cheol Liu and John L. Mikesell - believe the need for correctional officers is greater in corrupt places because 'the overall extent of corruption will be higher in states with higher numbers of convictions of public officials'.

Additionally, the study also revealed the country's lease corrupt states.

2.) Washington

3.) Minnesota
