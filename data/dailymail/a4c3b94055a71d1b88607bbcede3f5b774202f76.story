The president's job approval rating in a Gallup poll briefly crested at an unenviable 47 per cent December 18–21, after a jovial Barack Obama showed up Friday to answer largely softball questions from nine women in the White House press corps.

That measure was a fluke, however: After two days at what was his highest rating of the year, he tumbled back down to 44 per cent.

Even a much-discused December 8 appearance on The Colbert Report, where the president jostled, joked and showed his personable side, didn't help buoy Americans' view of him.

Gallup and Rasmussen Reports, the other major poll that measures presidential job approval on a daily basis, both reported a job-approval decline – not a positive 'bounce' – beginning the day after the late-night broadcast.

WHO'S GOT A PROBLEM? Obama's job approval ratings have never recovered since they began tanking in the scandal-filled spring of 2013

Rasmussen saw Obama's approval numbers drop from 49 per cent to 47 per cent in the two days following his Colbert appearance. Gallup's numbers told a similar tale, with that measurement slipping from 44 per cent to 42 per cent over the same period.

Americans polled by Rasmussen were less generous about Obama's final press conference of the year, however, boosting his approval rating by just a single point.

That, like his Gallup bounce, has now settled back to where it was.

Despite a booming stock market and low gas prices, Obama's domestic and foreign policy troubles have kept his job approval rating low.

Real Clear Politics averages the 13 published presidential approval polls, giving greater weight to the polls that record opinions of more Americans.

Overall, that measure stands at 42.7 per cent approval and 52.5 per cent disapproval.

The most dismal news in the bunch came from a Reuters/Ipsos poll last conducted Dec. 10–14, when just 37 percent of Americans said Obama was doing a good job in the Oval Office.

That poll has the most robust sample size of all the U.S. presidential polls, sampling the opinions of more than 2,000 Americans.

The president's public-perception crisis began in earnest in late May 2013 as a trio of damaging scandals dogged his White House.

While accusations flew that the president's Justice Department was tapping reporters' phone lines and his IRS was targeting conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive screening, the National Security Agency was raked daily over hot coals for its phone call data-collection dragnet, exposed by leaker Edwad Snowden.

That period marked the beginning of the end for Obama's net-positive presidency: By the 1st of June, more Americans gave him a failing grade than those who liked his job performance.

The gap between the yeas and nays grew for the rest of the year, according to the Real Clear Politics average, cresting at more than 16 per cent as the Obamacare website's woes became a daily front-page flogging in November.

The administration has never recovered its once buoyant, glittering mystique. 

Shortly after his inauguration, Obama's polling average had him on the positive side of the ledger with more than 65 per cent of Americans giving him a hopeful nod.

But now he is flirting with becoming the worst-performing two-term president in modern memory as he enters his final two years in office.

In the middle of his sixth December in the Oval Office tenure, Bill Clinton's approval in the Gallup poll stood at 67 per cent – and that ringing endorsement came just a week before House Republicans voted to impeach him.

Dwight D. Eisenhower's rating was 57 per cent in December 1958, during a year when he sent American military forces to occupy parts of Lebanon.

About 48 per cent of Americans approved of Ronald Reagan in December 1986, despite the pall of the Iran-Contra scandal hanging over the White House. 

Gallup's poll numbers over the years show that President Obama could be one scandal away from dipping into George W. Bush's job-approval  territory

An average of Obama's poll numbers shows his approval ratings have been 'under water' since June 2013

Only George W. Bush has fared worse than Obama, according to Gallup, rating just 37 per cent approval at the same point in his presidency where Obama finds himself now.

Americans had a deep sense of Iraq War 'fatigue' in December 2006, and Democrats had just taken control of both houses of Congress in a decisive midterm election.

Those circumstances mirror Obama's. 

The self-proclaimed Islamic State continues to threaten American interests in Iraq and Syria, and Republicans are preparing to take the reins on both ends of the U.S. Capitol for the first time since Bush faced the same lame-duck status eight years ago.

Other presidents going back to the mid-1950s – John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush – served less than eight years in the White House.
