Ian Rush's wife has demanded a divorce after she discovered the former football star had been having a three-year affair with a model more than 20 years younger than him, it was claimed today.

The former Liverpool striker, 51, has allegedly been seeing Irish singer and model Carol Anthony, 30, since they met in Portugal in 2010, where he has a holiday home.

Earlier this month they were pictured together walking through Dublin and their affair was reportedly exposed when wife of 26 years Tracy Rush found an explicit text from Miss Anthony on her husband's mobile phone.

Yesterday Miss Anthony tweeted: 'I apologise for any hurt caused but I'll be making statement soon to set the record straight!'.

Mrs Rush demanded a divorce this week following the former striker's return from a romantic break in Malta with Miss Anthony.

It is believed she first suspected her millionaire husband was having an affair last September.

A friend of Ian Rush told The Sun: 'Tracy
is devastated. 

'She felt she had given up her whole life for him and 
maybe he never really loved her.'

Ian Rush collected his MBE at Buckingham Palace with his wife Tracy and sons Jonathan and David in 1996

The couple married in 1987 and have two sons Jonathan, 23, and David, 20, and Mr Rush had called her the 'backbone of the family'.

Mrs Rush told the paper: 'I haven't filed for divorce.

'We aren’t separated, he is still living in the family home.

'You will have to speak to Ian, I just want to maintain my dignity.'

The newspaper said that Mr Rush and Miss Anthony plan to set up home together once the divorce is finalised.

Rush holds the goal-scoring records for Liverpool and Wales, netting 346 for club and 28 for country.

He was made an MBE in 1996 and inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

He spent a season managing Chester City and now acts as a global ambassador for Liverpool FC.

The alleged couple were spotted in the street following a lunch in Dublin last month

Miss Anthony, from County Cork, performs dance music under the alias Havana. Last year she appeared on Irish reality show Celebrity Salon.

She and Rush are said to have conducted liaisons in Dubai, Malta, Portugal, Ireland and Britain.

Yesterday, she told her 192,000 Twitter followers: 'Please dont listen to false rumours!!! to all my peeps xx'

She later added in response to a supportive fan: 'Thank you! I apologise for any hurt caused but I'll be making statement soon to set the record straight! xx'

Her spokesman said: 'Carol and Ian are very good friends, they have met several times over the years and have recently been filming the tv pilot 'living with legends' which Carol and Ian are both involved in.'

MailOnline has approached representatives of Ian Rush for comment.
