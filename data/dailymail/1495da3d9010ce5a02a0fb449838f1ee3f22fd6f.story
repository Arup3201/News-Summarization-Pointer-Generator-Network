The couple who bought the houseboat used for the exterior shots of Sam Baldwin's home in Sleepless in Seattle have opened up their home and revealed the twist of fate that brought them to the iconic property.

Loretta, 71, and her then-boyfriend Jim Healy were living in Princeton, New Jersey when they made an historic date night deal.

'I told him that I had gone to see 
Silence of the Lambs with him, and he'd have to go see Sleepless in 
Seattle with me,' she tells the National Enquirer (not online). 'As we were watching the film,
I poked him and said "I want to live in that houseboat".'

Still Sleepless: Loretta and Jim Healy bought the four-bedroom floating home in 1993 and say that they have been happy there for the past 20 years

At the time, Loretta didn't take her dream seriously because at that time, they had no plans to relocate to Seattle.

But she admits that she already fallen in love with the unique four bedroom, 2,100 square foot property that Tom Hanks's character called home. Then, out of the blue, Jim got a job interview in the Emerald City.

When they visited the city in the summer of 1993, Loretta scoped out the houseboat and noticed a 'For Sale' sign.

'I thought "This is where I'm going to live",' she says. Soon afterward, Jim got a nearby offer, and the couple took the house.

Present day: The iconic houseboat 20 years later

Looking back: The house as it appeared in the 1993 hit movie Sleepless in Seattle

They had their wedding there six months later, and claim that they have lived happily ever after since then.

'I love the place,' Loretta says. 'It's really magical.'

The unique property is one of the largest floating homes in Seattle, and features floating gardens and killer views.

Jim even jokes that he doesn't mind being mistaken for Tom Hanks, who played widower Sam Baldwin in the film.

The film has been lucky for the neighborhood as well.

Experts say that the houseboat changed the market in Seattle's South Lake Union, where 20 years later tourists still drive by and take pictures.

In
2008, the couple put the floating home on the market for $2.5 million 
because they were considering a permanent move to the East coastÂ  - but in
the end decided that they couldn't part with it.

Now they have two homes: One in New York City, and the other in Seattle. For the couple, it's the ideal happy ending.
