Mini toiletries bottles and free teabags may be considered fair game.

But some hotel guests have a hard time resisting the urge to pilfer anything they can get their hands on, with robes, coat hangers, slippers and sheets being common temptations.

So an intuitive hotel in Australia has employed the art of reverse psychology, listing the most coveted items on a menu, complete with prices.

Warning: Before you run off with that robe, remember it will end up on your bill - at a cost of over £90

The QT hotel group came up with a menu of 14 items, which included coffee mugs, shoe horns, coat hangers, eye masks, a cocktail shaker and bathroom glasses.

The menu, entitled DESIRE, was placed in all of their suites, to remind guests that any stolen items would be appearing on their bill. Prices range from nine Australian Dollars (almost £5) for an eye mask to 175 Australian Dollars (around £96).

A spokesman for the group said the menus are becoming  'increasingly becoming more and more popular'.

According to a survey by Novotel Hotels

A recent survey by Just the Flight found that nearly half (43 per cent) of British holidaymakers admit to thieving from their rooms, with 60 per cent of those people not considering it to be stealing, according to a survey.

Twelve per cent said they took items because they felt that the hotel wasn't offering them value for money.

And 15 per cent admitted to pinching things because they didn't think they'd get caught. 

Guests who confessed to stealing items from hotel rooms most frequently said they did so because they believed it was expected of them, the survey of 1,000 people revealed.

But the largest group prepared to admit their pilfering ways were young people, with 47 per cent of 18-34-year-olds saying they stole from hotels, compared to 45 per cent of 35-54-year-olds and 37 per cent of those aged over 55.
