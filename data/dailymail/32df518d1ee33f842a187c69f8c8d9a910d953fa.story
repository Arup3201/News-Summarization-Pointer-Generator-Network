Plea: Miss G wants to 'live in peace' without the intrusion of social workers from Redbridge council, but a court has blocked her from speaking out

A frail pensioner of 94 is being barred from speaking to the Press in a draconian ruling by the Court  of Protection.

The former NHS midwife has been gagged after staging a street protest  and lodging a petition at Parliament, complaining about her treatment by social workers.

She was silenced this week, despite begging the judge at a Court of Protection hearing to stop social workers from Redbridge, North-East London, meddling in her life.

Standing up from her wheelchair, the pensioner, who can be described only as Miss G, bravely told Mr Justice Cobb at the hearing in London: ‘I am quite capable of speaking for myself. I know what I want and what I need. I am in my right senses.

‘I don’t what them (social workers) to cross my gates or come to my house. I want to be left alone by these people.’

The controversial gag, which could last her lifetime, flies in the face of demands by the top family court judge Sir James Munby for more openness in the shadowy Court of Protection, allowing those appearing there to speak out and complain about their experiences. His comments marked a victory for the Mail, which has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts.

Miss G is stopped by a judge’s ruling at an earlier hearing from naming herself publicly and if she breaches that order or the one that now stops her speaking to the Press, the sanctions include the prospect of a prison sentence or the seizure of her assets.

The gag on her freedom of speech will last until a psychiatrist, selected by Redbridge Council, assesses her mental capacity to give Press interviews and supplies his evidence at a hearing this summer. The hearings involving Miss G have been brought by social workers who believe her decisions are unduly influenced by her two private carers who came to live at her £350,000 house in outer London two years ago.

The court has already ruled that Miss G does not have the mental capacity to decide on her living arrangements and financial affairs.

Redbridge want her to pay for care from their social workers and hope to remove the couple, known as Mrs C and Mr F, from her house.

But before the extraordinary court gag was imposed on Wednesday, Miss G told the Mail: ‘I do not want the council people back in my life. In the past, when they provided carers from an agency, they did not look after me.

‘I was left in a dirty house alone for hours at a time when they cut short their twice-a-day visits.

‘They did not shower me often enough and there were foxes in the garden, and insects in my bed.

‘When the carers came they put plastic covers over their shoes to protect them because they had left the carpets so filthy. It was only when I cancelled the council care plan, which I paid for, that Redbridge began to persecute me and the private carers I chose instead. I want to live in peace. I know my own mind and I want to be listened to.

‘I would like to take legal action for compensation from Redbridge Council. I think they failed to look after me properly.’

During previous hearings, the court was told that Redbridge social workers, accompanied by police, turned up at Miss G’s house 12 times in nine months after Mrs C and Mr F moved in.

Miss G has complained to the Mail of the ‘frightening’ visits and the invasion of her privacy. And she says her private carers, who come from the same area of the Caribbean as Miss G, are ‘my family and look after me perfectly’.

At the beginning of current hearings, she handed a signed statement to the judge begging for the names of herself and Redbridge Council to be made public.

It added: ‘It is my express wish to remain in my own home, with my current 24-hours carers, and without social services intrusion.’

Redbridge – which the court has allowed to be named following a request from the  Mail – has refused to comment on details of the case.
