Sheryl Sandberg is a crusader for female empowerment in the workplace – but that doesn’t mean women are in charge.

Speaking with CBS News' '60 Minutes' on the eve of 
the release of her controversial new book, ‘Lean In: Women, Work and the
Will to Lead,’ Sandberg said: ‘The very blunt truth is that men still 
run the world.’

When asked if she intends to start a revolution, the millionaire and Facebook COO replied: ‘Yes, I think so.’

Lean in: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said that men still dominate the workforce and things need to change

Publicity tour: Sandberg has been in New York City to promote her new book, and took time to grab a slice

Author: Sheryl Sandberg's new book Lean In will be out on bookstore shelves on March 11

In a lengthy interview with CBS’ ’60 
Minutes,’ Sandberg, 43, spoke with Norah O’Donnell over the challenges 
that modern women face, and said that they are stalled in their rise to 
power.

Herself a Harvard graduate with a very impressive resume, she currently works as Facebook’s number two in command – right next to its founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

But what’s been getting the most attention is her crusade to bring awareness to workplace inequality, and the strains put upon working women who also want to have families.

Sandberg has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self-impose limits.

The title of her book is derived from a 2010 TED talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back.

‘They say, I’m busy or I want to have a child one day, I couldn’t possibly take on any more.

'Or I’m still learning my current job. I’ve never heard a man say that to me,’ Sandberg said.

Sandberg herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook’s award after she was voted ‘Most Likely to Succeed.’

‘I was embarrassed,’ the mother of two said. ‘My entire life I have been told…or I have felt that I should hold back on being too successful, too smart, too – you know – lots of things.’

But the COO made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce.

A woman on the move: Sandberg, 43, is launching her book today, and is featured on the cover of this week's Time magazine

‘There’s an awful lot we don’t 
control. I’m saying that there’s an awful lot we can control and we can 
do for ourselves to sit at more tables, raise more hands.’

She
also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person
can make in their lives, choosing a spouse has extreme implications in 
the workplace too. ‘Partner with the right person because you cannot 
have a full career and a full life at home with the children if you are 
also doing all the housework and childcare.’

Sandberg
has most recently been in New York City to promote her book. In a 
whirlwind of publicity, she has also been featured in Vanity Fair and 
appears on the March 18 cover of Time magazine.

Controversy: Sandberg has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said: 'The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn't raise her hand anymore'

Speaking out: Facebook chief operating officer Cheryl Sandberg, who has a personal fortune of $500million, says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back

The
Facebook guru, who was ranked by Forbes as the tenth most powerful 
woman in the U.S., has been criticized for being out-of-touch with the 
modern working woman because of her extreme wealth.

According
to Forbes, Sandberg made nearly $31million in 2011, including her base 
salary for Facebook and around $30million in stock options.

Sandberg
told O’Donnell in the interview: 'I am not saying everyone has the 
resources or opportunities I have. I am not saying every husband is 
going to wake up tomorrow, read a book and do his share. I'm saying that
women need to own the power that they have, negotiate for raises.'

Counterpoint: Anne-Marie Slaughter's buzzworthy Atlantic cover story from last June argued against Sandberg's speeches

Sandberg’s
book tour touches on a hot-button topic, and comes to a vastly 
different conclusion than Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former director of 
policy planning for the U.S. State Department and author of last year's 
zeitgeist piece, 'Why Women Still Can't Have It All.'

Writing
in The Atlantic, Slaughter argued that it was difficult to be away from
her son when he needed her, and impossible to find a good role model of
a successful, happy, well-rested woman who ‘had it all’ and 
deconstructed much of what Sandberg said in her 2011 commencement speech
at Barnard and her TED talk the year before.

In
the book Sandberg writes that the the feminist revolution has 'stalled'
and that women earn 20 per cent less than men over their lifetime if 
they decide to have children.

She also uses vivid analogies to describe what it is like to be a woman at work.

She
writes: ‘Imagine that a career is like a marathon ... a marathon where 
both men and women arrive at the starting line equally fit and trained. 
The gun goes off. The men and women run side-by-side. The male 
marathoners are routinely cheered on: 'Looking strong! On your way!'

For women however, the shouts are: 'You know you don't have to do this!'
