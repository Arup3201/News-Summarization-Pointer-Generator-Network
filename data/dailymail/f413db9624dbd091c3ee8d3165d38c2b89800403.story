A new Trulia reports shows that owning a home is increasingly hard to do for most middle class families, listing the best cities to buy a house.

The site defines an affordable city as one in which the 'total monthly payment, including mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, is less than 31 per cent of the metro area's median household income.'

The two cities where a middle class income is most likely to find you a home are Dayton, Ohio, followed by Rochestor, New York.

Ohio was the state with the most affordable cities in the top ten with three cities listed. 

Meanwhile, the majority of most affordable cities are around the Great Lakes.

The least affordable cities tend to be on the coasts, with six on that list being in California. 

The Huffington Post notes that the site's map is broken down with bubbles representing each area's housing market.

59 per cent of all homes for sale are considered affordable for the middle class, which is a drop of 62 per cent from one year ago. 

Trulia economist Jed Kolko said the data showed the dream of owning a home falling out of reach.

'Homeownership is getting less affordable for the middle class,' he said. 'Unless incomes increase substantially, homeownership will slip further beyond the reach of many households.'
