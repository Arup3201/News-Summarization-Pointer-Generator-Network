FIFA faced another crisis today after allegations the winning bid team for the 2022 World Cup finals secretly offered $1million (£630,000) to the son of one of its executive committee members.

The successful Qatar bid team entered into talks with Samson Adamu, 26, the son of the executive committee (exco) member Amos Adamu for a sponsorship deal months before his father was due to vote on the bid, according to documents obtained by the Sunday Times. 

It is believed that the cash was to be used to fund a lavish
gala dinner just before the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, despite the
event costing a fraction of the sum.

'Sponsorship': Qatar 2022 bid deputy chief Ali Al-Thawadi is accused of paying $1m to the son of a FIFA executive committee member in exchange for a vote in favour of his bid

Ali al-Thawadi, the deputy chief executive of the Qatar bid, reportedly brokered a proposed deal just six months before his country won the race to host the 2022 finals. However, the proposals did not go ahead.

World Cup bidders are banned from offering any incentives to the 24 exco members or their relatives.

FIFA - football's world governing body - said it would 'immediately' ask its chief ethics investigator Michael Garcia to investigate the reports.

Entrepreneur Samson Adamu spoke at the June 2010 dinner in Johannesburg, assuring a star-studded crowd of African football legends, that his companies had 'no commercial affiliates.'

His father Amos was among 300 eminent guests at the free event, who enjoyed a three-course dinner and traditional African music 'to celebrate the achievement of our past football heroes.'

It took place on the eve of the 2010 World Cup finals, the first to be held in Africa.

However, the Sunday Times claimed to have unearthed documents which suggest that al-Thawadi offered to pay Samson a seven-figure sum to host the dinner and a workshop.

It is believed the events cost no more than $220,000 (£138,000).

It came at a critical stage of the bidding process for the 2022 finals, in which the Arab state faced tough competition from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia.

In a statement, the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee confirmed that there were discussions and an  agreement drafted but they did not pursue involvement in the ‘African Legends Dinner' and no agreement was signed or payments made.

They stated: 'Upon due consideration being given to all the circumstances of this particular case - and especially to the relevant FIFA rules relating to the obligations of bid committees - a decision was taken by the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee not to pursue any involvement in the African Legends Dinner.'

They add that no member of the Bid Committee attended the dinner.

In December 2010, Qatar was surprisingly named as the host for the finals, despite their national team's poor record in international football and concerns that matches would be played in temperatures approaching 50C.

Fourteen of the exco members voted for the tiny country in spite of these fears, though the bid has been dogged by allegations of bribery ever since.

The Qatar bid committee spent considerably more than the other candidates and FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke admitted in a leaked email that Qatar had 'bought the WC [World Cup]'.

He later explained his comments by saying he was referring to the amount of money spent on marketing the bid.

Amos Adamu was also secretly filmed in September 2010 offering to sell his vote for the 2018 World Cup, which went to Russia, for an £800,000 payment into a personal bank account.

He claimed he would use it to build football pitches in his native Nigeria.

Adamu was also filmed saying that his bid for the 2022 finals was not for sale because it was going to Qatar.

As a result, he was sacked from the executive committee, stripped of his World Cup vote and banned from football for three years.

Samson Adamu and al-Thawadi first met at the Confederation of African Football (CAF) congress in the Angolan capital of Luanda in January 2010, which was sponsored by Qatar.

Five days later, al-Thawadi emailed Adamu asking him for the name of his 'personal company' in order to send him a 'contract and scope of work'.

Shortly afterwards, al-Thawadi sent him a draft agreement for the 'Legends of African Football - Gala Dinner - Sponsorship.'

The document states that Qatar would pay Samson's company $1million for 'sponsorship rights' to the dinner and a workshop for African journalists.

The draft agreement is between Kinetic Sports Association, a Swiss company that Adamu planned to create, and a 'private institution' in Qatar.

It goes on to say this 'institution' was 'bidding to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup... and wishes to acquire certain exclusive rights in connection with the events in order to promote its bid to host the competition.'

One of the proposed signatories on this agreement was Qatar bid chief Sheikh bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.

After securing the blessing of CAF, Adamu was advised by his Swiss lawyer Daniel Magerle to channel the money through a Swiss bank account to 'add a lot of additional credibility' to the event.

However, attempts to create a secretive bank account in the Kinetic name were scuppered by bank UBS, who were wary of the plans.

Magerle claimed the deal had fallen through and a planned meeting in London to finalise the agreement had never happened.

Adamu sub-contracted the organising of the party to a South African events company called Champions Tours.

They were reportedly angered by his complete lack of organisation, with running orders and table plans not confirmed until the last minute.

It was attended by six FIFA exco members, CAF executive committee members, the president of UEFA, the European governing body, Lennart Johansson, and David Dein, the former Arsenal chairman.

On the original plans for the July 8 dinner, a table had been reserved for the Qatar 2022 bid team, but they didn't show up.

FIFA said the documents would be passed on to its top investigator before they decide what action, if any, to take against the Qatar bid.

A FIFA spokesman said: 'After receiving these documents, FIFA has immediately forwarded them to Michael J Garcia, Independent ethics committee chairman of the investigatory branch.

'It will be for Michael Garcia to analyse the documents and decide on any potential next steps.'
