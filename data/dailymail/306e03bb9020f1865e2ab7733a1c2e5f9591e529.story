A couple 'traded in' their daughter for a used car to a family who used her as a domestic slave for three years, a court in France was told.

The 23-year-old woman was sold in £600 'part-exchange' for a second-hand hatchback - then subjected to daily sexual and physical abuse at a travellers' camp outside Paris.

The daughter - named only as Sabrina - was then forced to live in a squalid shed owned by Franck Franoux, 58, and his partner Florence Carrasco, 56, in the suburb of Melun.

Squalid: The shed on a site outside Paris where the girl known as Sabrina was kept as a sex slave

She was burned with an iron and cigarette ends, made to look after their seven children, beaten with iron bars and sticks and hired out for sex to other men.

When she finally fell critically ill in 2006, she was dumped outside a Paris hospital, with no teeth left and weighting less than six stone, the court heard.

The woman's father was sentenced to 20 years in prison and her mother to eight years for human trafficking in an initial trial two years ago.

Franoux and Carrasco were both sentenced to 30 years on charges of rape, kidnapping, torture and forced slavery.

All four are now appealing their sentences at a court in Bobigny, near Paris.

Police told the first trial: 'The girl's parents handed their daughter over to another couple in part exchange for a used car, with her value being estimated at around £600.

The victim, known as Sabrina, was sold to work as a domestic slave and taken to Melun, site of a traveller camp outside Paris, where she was sexually abused

'She was treated worse than an animal, with beatings, sexual abuse and scraps of food being tossed on the ground for her to eat.

'Her identity papers were stolen while her captors illegally claimed her unemployment benefit, and she was chained up at night to prevent her escaping.

'She was in a deplorable physical and psychological state.

'She needed reconstructive operations on her nose and ears, which had been mutilated.

'It took her a year to recover from her ordeal and she will bear the physical and mental scars all her life.'

A verdict in the ongoing appeal trial is expected on September 14.
