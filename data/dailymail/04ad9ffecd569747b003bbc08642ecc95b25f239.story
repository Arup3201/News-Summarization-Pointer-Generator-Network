Randy Allen Taylor, 48, who has been charged in connection with missing teen Alexis Murphy, may have links with Samantha Clarke, 19, who is also missing

The cell phone of a Virginia teenager who has been missing for more than a month has been found by the FBI.

The agency said today that it has been able to positively identify one of the phones recovered in an investigation as belonging to 17-year-old Alexis Murphy.

Officials did not provide any other details about when or where the phone was found.

Murphy was last seen on August 3 by her family. Her car was found in the parking lot of a multiplex in Charlottesville three days later.

Randy Allen Taylor, 48, has been held without bond since his August 11 arrest in Murphy's disappearance.

He has maintained his innocence.

A grand jury is set to meet on September 24 to decide whether to indict Taylor.

The 48-year-old has also been linked to the disappearance of another teenage girl, it emerged last week.

Samantha Clarke, 19, has been missing from her home in neighboring Orange County for three years.

Orange County commonwealth's attorney Diane Wheeler said Taylor was the last person known to have had contact with Miss Clarke before she disappeared on September 13, 2010.

A graduate of Orange County High School, Miss Clarke had told her brother she was going out for the evening but never returned.

Ms Wheeler told the Huffington Post: 'He was the person who last had contact with her...He had multiple contacts with her in the days immediately preceding her disappearance.

'The investigation is still continuing and he remains a person of interest to us.'

Unlike Miss Clarke, Alexis is not thought to have known Taylor.

Her
last Twitter entry at 6.40pm on August 3 read: 'I actually look cute 
right now', and she was later picked up by the gas station CCTV camera 
at 7.15pm.

Three days later police found Miss Aleixs' abandoned Nissan in Charlottesville, 39 miles from the gas station.

They are also looking at footage said to show Taylor in Ultimate Bliss, an adult store two miles from where the Nissan was found, on the day Alexis went missing.

One man has told how he saw Taylor sitting in his vehicle in the Lovingston Food Lion parking lot, opposite the gas station where Alexis was seen.

Bruce Johnson told a reporter he had seen the suspect watching people from inside his suburban.

He told NBC29.com: 'He was just sitting in that parking lot watching and that kind of was strange to me...

'A suburban with antennas on it, camouflage down the side of it - that's kind of suspicious because I've never seen that vehicle around here before.'

Taylor is next due in court in January for a preliminary hearing.
