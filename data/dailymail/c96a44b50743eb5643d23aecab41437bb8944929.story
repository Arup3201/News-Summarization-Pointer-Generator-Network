The human face has been officially classed as an organ, paving the way for a future where Americans give permission to allow theirs to be donated to a complete stranger.

The agencies which regulate America's transplant system, The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network and the United Network for Organ Sharing, announced the changes in July, bureaucratically streamlining the previously difficult application process.

Inarguably the most visible and personal of organs now on the transplant list, the news that facial transplants have become nationalized will invariably raise concerns about the limits of state control over the most emotive body-part of all of its citizens.

On July 3, less than a decade after the first facial transplant was conducted in France, an American's face is now classified as an 'organ' for the purposes of transplantation.

However, unlike the liver, heart, lungs or kidneys, which for all intents and purposes are invisible, the face is not considered under the new law to be an organ until it is harvested.

The face is now technically referred to as a VCA organ, or a vascularized composite allografts', which means three years on from the nation's first transplant, a whole raft of legal guidelines now exist for state transfer of one deceased citizens face to another living person according to medical blog Somatosphere.

Also joining the list are hands, which also previously fell under the 
control of the FDA and were only transplanted in experimental surgeries,
 like faces.

The reason why faces and hands have been classified slightly differently to other body parts is to reflect the sensitivities of the public, uneasy that faces and other personal organs like hands, can be transplanted.

With only 21 face transplants ever conducted worldwide, the FDA had classed the surgery experimental.

Now, reflecting the growing abilities of medical bio-science, the change in status of the face allows doctors transplanting it access to the global and national network of associations dedicated to transporting the body part efficiently.

'There’s this whole machinery that’s highly efficient and very well trained to do organ transplants, but as it stood with a face transplant...it was like a mom and pop operation,' says Sue McDiarmid, a transplant surgeon at UCLA and chair of the committee with the United Network for Organ Sharing to the Boston Globe.

However, McDiarmid is keen to allay fears from the public about their faces now being potential state property.

Richard Norris, 38, blew his face-off with a shotgun blast in front of his mother in 1997, while drunk. The blast took off half of his face and Norris was left contemplating suicide during his recovery. In 2012, the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore performed the ground-breaking surgery. Incredibly, in 2014, Norris and his new face found themselves on the cover of August's GQ Magazine, reflecting his incredible recovery.

Charla Nash was viciously attacked by her friend's chimpanzee, Travis, in 2009. In 2011, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston performed the surgery to repair the damage.  Nash, who was left permanently blind, and lost her nose, eyes and lips in the attack, received a ground-breaking face transplant in May, 2011. A team of more than 30 surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, led by Dr Bohdan Pomanhac, painstakingly rebuilt her face. They took the donor's skin, underlying muscle, nerves and upper palate and transplanted the whole face on to Ms Nash's skull.

Dallas Wiens became the first American to have a full face transplant in March, 20011 at Brigham and Women's in Boston. The surgery was paid for by the Department of Defense, which gave the hospital a $3.4million research grant for five transplants. Mr Wiens was the third person in the US to receive a face transplant - after James Maki, at the same hospital in 2009 and Connie Culp at the Cleveland Clinic in 2008. A team of more than 30 doctors, nurses and  anaesthesiologists work for 15 hours to replace his face. He suffered life threatening burns after losing control of a lift platform he had been on to repair a church window two-and-a-half years ago. After toppling over his head had slammed into a live power cable that seared off his face.

'We don’t think the general public is at a point now where we can rip off somebody’s face just because they signed a state registry....The policy is you have to have separate, explicit consent from the family for hands and face,' she said to the Boston Globe.

Indeed, McDiarmid acknowledges the wildly different psychological process involved with a facial transplant.

'The thought of transplanting such a highly visible personal part of somebody is a very different concept than thinking of putting someone’s kidney in you,' said McDiarmid to the Boston Globe.

For most, the idea that their loved ones heart can save anothers life is presently more acceptable than their face being appropriated.

Experts responding to the news note that from birth we are hard-wired to respond and react to people's faces in a symbolic manner.

However, the new classification will allow for far easier transplants of those injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even open up the field for more organs.

'There have been transplants of the larynx, of a whole vascularized knee joint,' said McDiarmid to the Boston Globe.

'There’s been some very few uterus transplants, even some thoughts of penile transplants....It’s a very wide open field.'
