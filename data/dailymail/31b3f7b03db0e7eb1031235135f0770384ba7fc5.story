This is the moment an Argentinian polo player broke the royal protocol by placing a hand on the Queen’s back as she presented a winner’s trophy at the Cartier Polo Cup.

Sportsman Facundo Pieres placed a tender hand on the top of the Queen’s back and again on her shoulder as Her Majesty presented him with the 'most valuable player' award at Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park, Berskhire.

The 28-year-old, who is a professional polo player from Buenos Aires, seemed unfazed by his faux pas which came after his team Zacara won the Queen’s Cup at the prestigious event.

The Argentine, who was born into a family of polo players, is ranked number two in the world in his sport and became the youngest player ever to hold a 10-goal handicap at just 19.

It is not believed to have been the first time the sportsman has met the Queen. Last year, after again receiving the ‘most valuable player’ award at the same event, he would’ve come face-to-face with England’s monarch.

Dressed in royal blue Angela Kelly, the Queen seemed in good spirits at today’s event - which she attended with the Duke of Edinburgh just a day after celebrating her official birthday.

Her Majesty smiled to spectators and staff as she toured the ground before watching play get underway at the annual prestigious event, which attracts leading polo players from around the world.

The royal historically attends Finals Day to present the cup to the winning patron, and it was during today’s ceremony the player broke the protocol.

With the team name Zacara emblazoned on the back of his shirt, Mr Pieres put his arm around Her Majesty as they posed for photographs.

According to centuries-old protocol, the Queen should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake.

Last
 year shop manager Kerry Bickerstaff appeared to touch the Queen as she 
escorted her inside West Quay Fisheries in Newhaven, East Sussex.

And a furore broke out in 1992 when 
Paul Keating, the former Australian Prime Minister, touched the Queen’s 
back during a visit to Canberra.

The Queen’s appearance at the Cartier Polo Cup today, comes ahead of a busy week which includes five scheduled appearances at Royal Ascot next week.

A keen racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her father George VI.

Since then, her horses have since 
triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, 
with the exception of the Epsom Derby, although she has managed a second
 place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton 
House.

While the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, Royal Ascot was the scene of another triumph for the Queen, after her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup - much to the obvious delight of the monarch.

Her appearance at next week's Royal Ascot will be the latest in a series of engagements, which began two weeks ago with the State Opening of Parliament and a state visit to France for the D-Day celebrations, before visits to a school and Trooping the Colour this week.
