ISIS positions in and around Kobane felt the full force of American airpower last night, as sustained bombing raids resulted in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town.

The radical Islamic group has been dramatically pushed back from the town, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it.

As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies. 

Pyrotechnic tracer ammunition could be seen marking out ISIS targets in the town as the U.S. bombers flew overhead.

The move came as Turkey announced that it will finally open its border to allow hundreds of Kurdish fighters into Kobane to join the fight against ISIS.

Officials in the area hope that a final push will finally rid Kobane of ISIS, who were reported to have been reduced to just two strongholds at the weekend after being driven back by resurgent Kurdish fighters backed by US airpower.

US Secretary of State John Kerry declared the besieged Syrian settlement was at a 'crisis moment', with huge numbers of ISIS militants flooding into the line of Western fire.  

During the evening of sustained airstrikes on ISIS targets, C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and medical equipment.

Mr Kerry said the decision to carry out the airdrops was made because it would be 'irresponsible' and 'morally very difficult' not to support the Kurdish fighters. 

The move, on the same day as Turkey's opening of its borders, raised the question of whether the weapon drops were strategically timed to arm the new influx of soldiers.

In a statement released last night, US Central Command said C-130 cargo planes made drops of arms and medical supplies which had been provided by Kurdish authorities in neighbouring Iraq.

Mr Kerry said: 'ISIL is presenting itself in major numbers in this place called Kobane'

The airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to ISIS as the Islamist extremist group attempts to gain control of Kobane.

Speaking in Indonesia today, Mr Kerry told reporters that the administration understood ally Turkey's concerns about supplying the Kurds, who are linked to a Kurdish group that Ankara fiercely opposes.

But he said the situation is such in the besieged town of Kobane that the resupplies were deemed absolutely necessary in a 'crisis moment'.

'Let me say very respectfully to our allies the Turks that we understand fully the fundamentals of their opposition and ours to any kind of terrorist group and particularly obviously the challenges they face with respect to the PKK,' Mr Kerry said.

'But we have undertaken a coalition effort to degrade and destroy ISIL and ISIL is presenting itself in major numbers in this place called Kobane,' he added using an alternative acronym for the terrorists.

Turkey's foreign minister said his country is now helping Iraqi Kurdish forces cross into the Syrian border town of Kobane 'to give support' to fellow Kurdish fighters there.

But Mevlüt Cavusoglu did not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear whether Turkey was actually allowing Kurdish fighters across the border into Syria yet after blocking them for so long.

'Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government announced that they are in cooperation with Turkey and the U.S.,' Mr Cavusoglu said. 

'Actually, we are helping peshmerga forces to enter into Kobane to give support. Turkey has no wish see Kobane fall.'

Hit: In a written statement, U.S. Central Command said its forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against ISIS in Kobane

The unexpected development suggests Turkey may be softening its stance on the issue of helping the Syrian Kurds. 

It also raises the question of whether the American airdrops were coordinated to help arm what may turn out to be hundreds of additional Kurdish fighters flocking to help defeat ISIS in Kobane.

Barack Obama called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday to discuss the situation in Syria and notify him of the plan to make airdrops, one U.S. administration official told reporters.

He would not describe Erdogan's reaction but said U.S. officials are clear about Turkey's opposition to any moves that help Kurdish forces, whom Turkey views as an enemy.

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the 'large amount of weapons and ammunition' airdropped by U.S. planes has reached the main Kurdish militia in Kobane.

The Kurdish fighters in Kobane have been picking up and moving the weapons since they were airdropped around dawn, said the Observatory, which has a network of activists on the ground.

In recent days, much of the coalition strikes have focused around Kobane, which Islamic State group militants have been trying to seize since mid-September. 

Turkey has so far provided sanctuary to an estimated 200,000 Syrians fleeing from Kobane and dozens of nearby villages that were captured by the IS group.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. 

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. 

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. 

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.  

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'
