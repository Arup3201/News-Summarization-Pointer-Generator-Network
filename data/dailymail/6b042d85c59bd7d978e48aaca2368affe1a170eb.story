A baby who is overcoming a one-in-a-million form of cancer and has no immune system, is forced to live in darkness.

Two-year-old Leighton Brownrigg from Stourport-on-Severn, in Worcestershire has been diagnosed with photosensitivity; the abnormal reaction of skin to light and sunlight.

The condition means he is not allowed to go outside and has to cover his body and wear high strength sun-cream when in the house.

Leighton's condition means he is not allowed to go outside and has to cover his body and wear high strength sun-cream when in the house

The toddler is recovering from an extremely rare form of leukaemia called Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML), which affects just one-in-a-million children worldwide.

Since having a bone marrow transplant, Leighton has been left with no immune system, which doctors believe could have caused his photosensitivity.

The recent sunny weather has caused the toddler's skin to severely crack and split, leaving him with agonising blisters.

His mother Zoe, 22, said: 'He is not allowed outside at all. He can only travel early in the morning or a night time but only in a car with tinted windows and air con.

'I have to keep the curtains at home closed and the blinds shut...and cover him up as much as possible because it is so hot.

'I cover him in factor 50 plus sun cream even when he is indoors - he is living in darkness.'

His mother applies sun cream to Leighton six times daily and baths him twice a day to prevent his skin from flaring up.

But the toddler's symptoms have persisted and he regularly has painful, itchy rashes and sores all over his body.

'His skin will change colour from white to red. He is constantly scratching or picking his skin,' his mother said.

Leighton is shown here after his transplant in October 2012, when he was then diagnosed with chronic graft versus host disease. The symptoms have persisted and he suffers from painful rashes and sores where his skin turns red

'It is painful for him and he gets very agitated. He looks out the window and wants to play outside. He gets upset when he sees other people outside and he is locked up indoors.

'How do you explain to a two-year-old they can’t go outside - it is heartbreaking. I get really upset.

She said: 'I can’t take him out to keep him entertained. It is really hard. I have to rely on other people to get me a loaf of bread and things like that as I need to keep him indoors 24/7. The only time I leave him is when I go to work.'

His mother said the skin condition (pictured right) is painful for the toddler, who gets very 
agitated.  Leighton is pictured (left) when he was readmitted to hospital for chronic graft versus host disease, which opened him up to infections

Leighton is undergoing daily tests at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment for his leukaemia.

He also has to go to Rotherham General Hospital every two weeks for two days for specialist treatment using ultraviolet light, called Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP), which could make make his Photosensitivty even worse and leave him needing special sunglasses.

Leighton was diagnosed with JMML in February last year and after waiting six months underwent a bone marrow transplant in July 2012.

His mother Zoe, from Stourport-on-Severn
in Worcester, had rushed him to hospital the previous November after a 
meningitis-type rash appeared on his body.

Since the transplant, he has been plagued with health problems, including chronic Graft Versus Host disease, a complication which is associated with bone marrow transplants that has left him dependent on steroids.

Leighton's spleen and liver also ballooned to 15cm - triple the normal size - leaving the toddler  unable to crawl or roll over when he was younger.

His mother, a carer for dementia 
sufferers said: 'Leighton has no immune system. He has had 17 chest 
infections since the transplant.

'It
feels like everything is getting worse at the moment. Everything that 
can go wrong has gone wrong but we have to just get on with it.

'It is only me and Leighton. You just have to carry on. I don’t believe in crying. I get angry with myself when I get upset.'

Zoe is now fundraising so she can buy
a new car that has tinted windows and air conditioning so she can 
transport Leighton to and from the hospital without his skin flaring up.

She has set-up a Facebook page called Leighton’s Fight.

Talking about her son, she said: 'He has always been really sociable and is so laid back. His bravery amazes me.'

Dr Mark Velangi, Consultant Oncologist 
at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, said: 'About one to two percent of 
children with leukaemia have juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML).

'JMML mainly affects children younger than four years old, with the average age being two years old.

'It is a difficult cancer to treat. It is often resistant to chemotherapy, so bone marrow transplantation is currently the best therapy available.

'Leighton has had a bone marrow 
transplant, which went well and his leukaemia is in remission. He now 
has graft vs host disease of his skin, which is a recognised consequence
of the transplant.

'This results in red, itchy and flaky skin which has been sensitive to the sunlight.

This has not been responsive to standard treatments and he is about to commence a new treatment called ECP (extra corporeal photophoresis) in a hospital in Rotherham.

'Despite this, his leukaemia remains in remission and overall we’re very pleased with his general progress.'

Leighton's bravery has been recognised by the hospital, who has made the toddler one of the faces of its £4 million Children’s Cancer Campaign Appeal.
