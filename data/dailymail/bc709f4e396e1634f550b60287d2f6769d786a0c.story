Two bungling thieves were caught after leaving a receipt for the tools they used during the break-in at the crime scene.

Matthew Cummins, 25, and Joseph Vandersteen, 24, bought a screwdriver to force  locks and bin bags to collect stolen goods.

But after breaking into two businesses in Manchester city centre during the Easter holidays the burglars left behind the receipt in one of the premises.

The bungling thieves were caught after  staff at Carver Warehouse in Manchester tidied  up in the aftermath of the raids and found this receipt (copy). The men bought a screwdriver and bin bags from a Clas Ohlson store

Cummins from Pendleton, Salford, pleaded guilty at  Manchester Crown Court Crown earlier today.

He has been jailed for two years.

Vandersteen, of no fixed abode, was jailed for 27 months at Bolton Crown Court on July 18.

The pair stole two iMac Apple computers, a mountain bike, mobile phone and two HP laptops.

But when staff at one of the offices at the Carver Warehouse in Dale Street, Manchester, began to tidy up the aftermath of the raids in April this year, they found the receipt. 

Detectives checked CCTV footage which showed Cummins and Vandersteen forcing open the doors to Carver Warehouse in Manchester

Detectives used the footage from Carver Warehouse to trace the two thieves. Staff at the Manchester business found the receipt when they were tidying up after the burglary 

The receipt was dated Friday April 18 and showed that a screwdriver and bin bags had been bought from a Clas Ohlson hardware store.

CCTV was checked by police and showed both Cummins and Vandersteen forcing open the doors to Carver Warehouse and getting inside.

It later showed them leaving with the stolen goods.

After speaking with staff at Clas Ohlson, it was found both men had been at the store on the day and time printed on the receipt.

Detectives found that Cummins and Vandersteen had tried to break into a company in Barton Arcade in the city centre on the same day as the burglary at Carver Warehouse.

A screwdriver was used to try and force the office door but they were unsuccessful.

Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw said: 'CCTV was instrumental in identifying Vandersteen and Cummins for these crimes. Once again, this case has highlighted it is essential businesses have quality CCTV covering their property so if they are a victim of crime, it can help police identify who is responsible.

'Forensic testing showed that Cummins fingerprint was on the receipt and that, along with the conclusive evidence caught on camera of the pair, was enough to send both behind bars.'
