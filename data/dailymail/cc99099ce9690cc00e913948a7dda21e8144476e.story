The princess of pop is set to live like a queen.

Kylie Minogue has leased a stunning beach-side residence in Sydney for the next few months.

The usually UK-based singer has rented a luxurious three-storey pad in the Sydney suburb of Coogee while she's back in her home country as a coach on The Voice Australia.

She should be so lucky! Kylie Minogue has leased a stunning beach-side residence to call home while she's based in Sydney for The Voice Australia

The sprawling home - which was last sold in February for just under $7 million - is located at the southern end of Coogee beach in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs and offers incredible views of the ocean.

Viewers of Geordie Shore will recognise the house as where the cast members lived when the show filmed a season Down Under.

It has also played host to Australian X Factor judge Natalie Bassingthwaighte.

As well as six bedroroms, five bathrooms and several open plan living areas, the property also features a lavish outdoor space which includes a large entertaining area and a pool.

The master bedroom where Kylie will no doubt reside has a connected dressing room, walk-in wardrobe and ensuite.

The property also features a gym, garage, and a studio.

Coogee locals will no doubt be hoping to catch a glimpse of the Australian star around the neighbourhood when she's not on set at The Voice.

It seems the pint-sized 45-year-old has made a good impression on her The Voice co-stars Joel Madden, Ricky Martin and Will.i.am.

Ricky Martin and the Black Eyed Peas singer gushed about the blonde performer taking performers under her wing ahead of the show's premiere on Sunday.

'When you talk about Kylie you talk charm and charisma,' Ricky, 42, told Nine's Mornings program.

'You can't go wrong with Kylie. She embraces you as an artist and it's important to feel the warmth from the coach.

She's a hugger. She starts talking to you and you feel the warmth - that's Kylie Minogue.'

Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am recently came off a successful stint on The Voice UK with the Spinning Around singer, and was just as positive.

'What better person to have but Kylie Minogue as a coach, as a mentor, and as a person guiding you through?' he said.

The show airs Sunday night, May 4 on Nine.
