Spotting a cat dart headlong under a car, he decided to give hot pursuit.

But the heat of the chase soon turned into burning embarrassment for this little dog, as he became stuck in the car’s engine.

Woody the Bedlington terrier was only discovered when his owner’s neighbour opened the bonnet of his Vauxhall Corsa to find a white furry face looking out from beside the engine.

They were eventually forced to call the Plymouth fire brigade to release the three-year-old dog – who was covered in oil but otherwise unhurt after his ordeal last week.

His master Mike Tracey, 52, said: ‘My neighbour opened up the bonnet of his car Woody was just sat there looking at me. It was almost like he was saying, “I’m stuck dad”.’

After trying to free him, with the help of fellow residents in Crownhill, Plymouth, the 52-year-old owner was forced to call the fire service for assistance.

Mr Tracey added: ‘We thought about using a jack to try and get him out but we were worried about something going wrong.

‘I didn’t really want to call the fire brigade and be one of those ‘cat stuck in a tree kind of people’ but they turned up and were absolutely brilliant.’

A crew from Crownhill fire station attended and helped free a bashful Woody by removing one of the leads within the engine, to allow him to be pried out of the top.

The three-year-old dog was covered in oil but didn’t sustain any injuries during his mini-ordeal and was right as rain after a good bath.

But Woody may need a bit longer to deal with the embarrassment after his unique ordeal.

Mr Tracey, who works for an employment centre, added: ‘I think he was feeling a bit sheepish as there was a bit of a crowd to watch the firefighters get him out.

‘Even the firemen said ‘well, this is a new one’ when they turned-up.

‘I plan to go up to the station and say thank you to them because they didn’t take the mick at all and were really good about the whole thing.

‘Woody does seems a bit sulky but I suppose he has been through a lot.’
