One of the teenagers who was captured on video as she violently beat up a fellow classmate at a Brooklyn McDonald's has been arrested.

Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, is one of six that were involved in attacking the other girl, who received no help from any of the other teenagers nearby, and is now being charged as an adult for her role in the incident, in which she also stole the victim's purse and cell phone.

Her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face. 

Now authorities are trying to identify the other five girls, despite the fact that no witnesses or even the victim herself will give them any information about the incident.

The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her.

Arrested: Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, was held for the McDonald's attack

Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon

The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and mock the media response to the fight

According to the New York Daily News, the 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like Im Famous Now.' 

The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon.

The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students.

As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked.

The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence.

The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue.

Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra.

Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table.

Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off.

Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.'

The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench

A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. 

NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn’t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News.

Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 

'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said.

Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.
