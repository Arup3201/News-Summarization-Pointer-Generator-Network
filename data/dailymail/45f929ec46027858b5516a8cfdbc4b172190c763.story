Maria Sharapova opened her 2015 season by winning nine straight games in a 6-0, 6-1 win over Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan on Tuesday in the second round of the Brisbane International.

The top-seeded Sharapova wrapped up the first set in 23 minutes and led 3-0 in the second before Shvedova held serve, raising her arm in mock triumph.Â 

Shvedova had a break-point opportunity in the next game, but couldn't put away an overhead and Sharapova responded with a backhand winner down the line.

At the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, Venus Williams made short work of her first match of the new year by sweeping past Jana Cepelova of Slovakia 6-4, 6-0 in 52 minutes.

Williams, seeded third behind Caroline Wozniacki and Sara Errani, appeared fit and served 10 aces.

The seven-time major winner reached the final of the Auckland hard-court tournament last year.

'It was very nice,' Williams said. 'I was welcomed when I came on the court and I felt like I left off right from last year. I felt comfortable right away.'

The top-seeded Wozniacki had to work hard to subdue qualifier Julia Glushko of Israel 6-3, 6-2.

Urzula Radwanska beat former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-4, 7-5 and another qualifier, Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic, toppled fifth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4.
