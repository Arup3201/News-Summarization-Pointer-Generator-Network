Joan Lunden bravely appeared bald on this week's cover of People magazine, and now she's revealed why she decided to make her battle with breast cancer public.

'Sometimes, you just want to give voice to other people,' she told Today's Hoda Kotb and Matt Lauer Tuesday morning.

The former Good Morning America host, 64, has undergone chemotherapy and a lumpectomy since her diagnosis with triple negative breast cancer in June.

Brave: Joan Lunden appeared on the Today show Tuesday morning to discuss her public battle with breast cancer

'You want to put a face that says "All right, I'm going through this, but I'm still me." And I think women are incredibly tied up in their hair,' she said.

She continued: 'Twenty years ago, women didn't talk about this. In fact, women wouldn't go and get a breast exam because they were so afraid of losing their hair or losing their breast. And that's still going on today. But what's the alternative? It's losing your life.'

She also said she feels a responsibility to encourage other women to have regular breast exams.

New outlook: 'It's a shame you have to go through something that almost takes life away to appreciate it more,' Ms Lunden said during an interview at her home

'By assuming this role and trying to be a voice for women and trying to make a difference, and to try to get women out there to realize that early detection is everything ... Don't think that it's okay to wait another year for the mammogram, and don't wait till you're 40 - if you have a lot [of breast cancer] in your family, maybe you need to get it earlier - because that is going to depend on your survival. And in a way, it makes the whole fight better because it turns it into something very meaningful.'

Ms Lunden said that the 'very complicated battle' with the disease has given her a new outlook.

'It's a shame you have to go through something that almost takes life away to appreciate it more. But it certainly does do it to you,' she told Ms Kotb in an interview at her Connecticut home last week that aired today.

Bold move: Ms Lunden discussed her decision to shave off all her hair in a recent interview with People 

The veteran journalist publicly announced her diagnosis to fellow cancer survivor Robin Roberts on GMA in July.

'Robin told me waiting for your hair to fall out is excruciating, so I didn't want to wait,' she told People of her decision to shave off her hair one week after finishing her first chemotherapy treatment.

She added: 'You know it's going to happen one of these days and you are wondering how and when, so I just owned it.'
