A video has been released which appears to show Wayne Rooney being knocked out cold by former Manchester United team-mate Phil Bardsley.

The Old Trafford captain and the Stoke defender pulled on gloves during a night-in at Rooney's Cheshire mansion last month - but Bardsley's wife Tanya dismissed the incident as a joke.

With only a small space in which to work in Rooney's lounge, the pair trade light blows for just under a minute before Bardsley sends Rooney reeling.

The England striker lies motionless under a chair for several seconds before the video, obtained by The Sun, cuts out.

Phil Bardsley's wife Tanya  moved to defuse the furore by claiming the video had been a joke

'Wayne had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that,' a source told the newspaper. 'He made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed, not moving.

'People were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage.

'Everyone realised it was a stupid thing to do, but they just got carried away.'

Bardsley's wife Tanya later hit back at the furore caused by the release of the video. She tweeted: 'Seen the sun, 2 mates havin a laugh video doesn't show Wayne jumping straight up and laughing with Phil #cleveredit.'

The video is believed to have been filmed on February 22, the day after United lost 2-1 at Swansea.

Rooney is wearing a pair of white Adidas gloves while Bardsley pulls on a pink pair. They appear to be sparring gloves rather than the smaller, less padded sets worn in professional fights. 

Neither man has a headguard on and while Bardsley is wearing shoes, Rooney is in his socks.

After touching gloves, they circle each other before Bardsley throws a left hand. Rooney paws back without connecting.

Bardsley is the more aggressive throughout, and tries to go for Rooney's body, pushing him back. The pair separate but again Bardsley comes on strongly, landing a right uppercut.

Rooney tries to respond but misses wildly before his former team-mate bides his time and throws the shot that sends Rooney backwards, narrowly avoiding a chair as he hits the deck. 

The incident could leave Rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from United chiefs over his choice of extra-curricular activities. 

Given he skipper's United, the forward is a regular for Louis van Gaal's men. 

And the United manager is unlikely to be impressed with Rooney for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training. 

Rooney returned to action six days later, scoring a double against Sunderland.

VIDEO Van Gaal refuses to discuss 'ridiculous' Rooney story 

Former Birmingham and Sheffield United midfielder Curtis Woodhouse - who swapped football for boxing and became the British super-lightweight champion - saw the funny side of it, posting on Twitter beside two pictures of himself boxing and playing football: 'Some can, some think they can?? Rooney... not everybody can do it!!! it's not as easy as I made it look.'

When asked by one Twitter user whether he would consider fighting Rooney for charity, Woodhouse replied: 'When he wakes up maybe'.

Rooney comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high-profile bouts.

Speaking seven years ago, Rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career.

'I think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer, especially breaking through to the Premier League at such a young age,' he said.

'I needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me. It made it easier to play than it might have been and it's helped me with the way my game is now.

'All through my life - from the ages of six, seven and eight - when big fights were on television, I used to stay up with my dad to watch them.

'I've always loved watching boxing and I went boxing training for about three or four years when I was younger. It's a sport I've always been involved in.

'I was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when I was about 15. But Everton who I was with at the time, said I had to concentrate on one of them and I opted for football.'
