It's not quite now or never for Danny Welbeck, but there's no escaping Monday's move to Arsenal is a watershed moment for the forward.

So often on the peripheries at Manchester United, he will now be thrust into the spotlight at the Emirates Stadium.

He was desperate for a chance to prove he is good enough to play regularly as a central striker at Old Trafford, but he was more often than deployed out wide.

Arsenal have several options over who to play as their central striker... but each player comes with a problem: 

Olivier Giroud - Frenchman is proven striker but is out injured until the New Year

Danny Welbeck - £16 new signing is welcome boost but remains unfulfilled talent

Alexis Sanchez - £35m summer buy is top-class but is he really a centre forward? 

Yaya Sanogo - Young Frenchman is powerful but is raw and has failed to score for the club

Theo Walcott - England star has pace to burn and great talent, but is preferred out wide 

Lukas Podolski - A German World Cup winner but was set to be sold as out of favour

So, here's his chance. He must grasp it.

Olivier Giroud's lay-off with an ankle injury means Welbeck will be asked to fill Arsenal's vacant central-striker role - at least until the France international is available in four months.

It's the opportunity he's always wanted. At United there were too many obstacles - Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie to name but two.

But, for the next four months, there's nothing preventing Welbeck from dismantling the belief that he isn't equipped to be the main man at a top-four club.

The first person he has to prove that to is his new manager.

Arsene Wenger is a long-term Welbeck admirer, but luring him away from United always seemed more like a pipe dream than a reality. So when news emerged last month that the England international was available, Wenger was immediately on the case.

Arsenal's original decision to sell Lukas Podolski in the transfer window was made, in part, with Welbeck in mind. The original plan was to replace the Germany international with Welbeck.

Like Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Roy Hodgson before him, Wenger has always viewed Welbeck - like he does Podolski - as a wide player capable of cutting in from the flank to provide a goal threat.

But Giroud's injury has resulted in a change of tact from the Gunners.

The Frenchman's broken ankle saw Arsenal postpone their plan to sell Podolski, meaning the move for Welbeck was put on the back burner as the club focused on signing a new out-and-out striker.

They tried and failed to sign Loic Remy from Queens Park Rangers. They tried and failed to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco.

So, when Wenger gave the green light to a move for Welbeck on Saturday morning, he did so having changed his mind about the forward. He had now earmarked the United man as his new central striker.

Yes, it's clear Welbeck was not the club's first-choice, but it is now down to the forward to prove Arsenal were right to take the gamble. 

Because, essentially, that's what it is: a gamble. A gamble on a player who has not played as the No 1 striker for a top club yet.

He is certainly equipped to prove his point. Powerful, quick and with an eye for goal - at Arsenal he has a midfield that will create chances galore for him.

The fact thousands of United fans have voiced their discontent at the club's decision to let Welbeck leave tells its own story.

It's not merely the fact that he is a United academy graduate (the decision to offload Tom Cleverley doesn't seem to have been met with the same discontent).

But it's the realisation that Welbeck's move could easily backfire on United that has United fans on edge
