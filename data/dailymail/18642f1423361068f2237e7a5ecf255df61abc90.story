Ed Miliband was accused of being out of touch yesterday after he was stumped by basic questions about his household budget. 

The Labour leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council.

His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’.

Ed Miliband suffered a disastrous interview on 'Good Morning Britain' this morning, which he followed up with a car crash performance on local radio

The Labour leader appeared tired during his 7.24am appearance as the 
grueling campaign for this week's European elections appeared to have 
taken its toll

The interviews made for a day of woe 
for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for 
European and local council elections.

He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years.

His misery began with an apparently simple question about how much his family spends on groceries a week.

Looking
 tired and drawn, he flailed, before telling the Good Morning Britain 
presenters the budget for him, his wife  and their two children was 
between £70 and £80.

Susanna
 Reid then pointed out to him a family of four typically spent more than
 £100 and suggested he would be spending ‘significantly’ more than 
that. 

The ITV1 
presenter added: ‘People would say one of the problems with politicians 
is that they are actually talking  about something but are out of touch 
with the reality.’ 

Next Mr Miliband said he was  ‘relatively comfortably off’ – a claim that sparked derision. 

‘Sure,
 lots of people are facing real struggles and I’m relatively comfortably
 off but what l know is that  there are deep issues that need to be 
tackled and we’re determined to tackle them,’ he said.

Mr
 Miliband earns some £140,000 a year as leader of the opposition and 
lives in a £2.5million house in one of the most affluent parts of north
 London and the mortgage is a relatively modest £400,000. 

His wife is believed to earn as much as £200,000 a year as an  environmental lawyer.

Labour has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery, ordinary people are not feeling better off.

Following
 that interview, Mr Miliband attempted to correct his blunder, saying 
his overall shopping bill would  be ‘slightly higher’ than he  
suggested.

The correction backfired because he implied that the  £70 or 
£80 was for ‘basic fruit and vegetables’. 

Speaking
 on BBC Radio Oxford, he said: ‘Well, I said this morning  it was on the
 basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about £70 or £80 – the
 total shopping  bill was slightly higher than that, obviously.’

Mr
 Miliband’s day then got worse during an interview on BBC Radio 
Wiltshire in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians. 

Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was.

Mr
 Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no 
idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ 
him. 

In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council.  Mr
 Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of
 Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by 
Conservatives.

Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’ 

Tory
 MP Julian Smith said: ‘Ed Miliband has sealed his credentials as an out
 of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard-working people 
live.

'The Labour 
leader is the man without a plan, stumbling from opportunist gimmick to 
gimmick, with policies unravelling by  the day. Even his own MPs don’t 
trust him.’

The groceries blunder is the latest embarrassment for Labour in its cost of living campaign.

The party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a VAT rise to 20 per cent had added £450 to the average bill.

But it showed pictures of fruit and vegetables, which are not covered by VAT.

Last
 night Labour said Mr Miliband was visiting ten different places today 
on the final day of campaigning for the European and local elections. 

Aides said the visits would largely be ‘private’.
