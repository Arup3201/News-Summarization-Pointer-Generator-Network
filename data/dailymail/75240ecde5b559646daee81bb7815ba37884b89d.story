Scotland's Charlie Flynn fought back from a bad first round to edge past Welshman Joe Cordina and book a lightweight final against Joe Fitzpatrick of Northern Ireland.

Flynn's controlled aggression proved enough to beat Cordina in a fast-paced and all-action affair, and Flynn believes home support for his final in the Hydro on Saturday will make a big difference.

'You feed off the crowd and the adrenaline really helps lift you,' Flynn said.

'Sometimes when you get sluggish they give you the sting in your shots. The crowd has been unbelievable and I have really been feeding off it.'

Powerful Preston welterweight Scott Fitzgerald also booked his place in the final after a commanding display against Tulani Mbenge of South Africa.

Fitzgerald, who will face Mandeep Jangra of India for gold, said: 'I have only been on the Great Britain squad since January and this is my first real competition, so just being here is unreal - never mind being in the final.'
