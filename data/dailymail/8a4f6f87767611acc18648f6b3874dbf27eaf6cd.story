Ashley Cole announced his international retirement on Sunday night after manager Roy Hodgson picked Luke Shaw instead for his 23-man England World Cup squad.

Shaw, the 18-year-old Southampton left back, will be one of at least eight players under the age of 24 — including Everton playmaker Ross Barkley, 20 — named by Hodgson at 2pm on Monday.

Cole revealed the news on Twitter on Sunday night, posting a series of emotional messages after being told by Hodgson he would not be going to Brazil.

The Chelsea defender said: ‘I got the
 call from Roy and agree the England team should be about the young 
players. I think it best I retire from the England team now.

‘We have a great manager and team and I wish them only success. I will be supporting them like a true fan. Thanks to everyone for everything.

‘Baines and Shaw are great players, proved this season, and are the future  of this country. It was a pleasure to get 107 caps.

‘Like me or not, trust me it’s hurt me to stop playing for my country.’

It is understood that Cole refused to go on Hodgson’s World Cup squad standby list, believing that at the age of 33 and with a long England career behind him, he has nothing more to prove.

Liverpool’s Jon Flanagan will be named on the reserve list to provide cover for Leighton Baines and Shaw.

Hodgson said: ‘This has been one of the hardest decisions of my career. The most important factor was speaking to Ashley prior to the announcement. He deserved to hear it directly from me and he took the news with huge grace. 

Give youth a chance: Carroll is said to have missed a call from England manager Roy Hodgson

Named: Everton youngster Ross Barkely is also in the squad

Facing the axe: Manchester United pair Michael Carrick (left) and Ashley Young are expected to miss out

‘I must respect his decision to retire. He has been one of England’s finest players, but I want to look to the future.’

Along with Shaw and Barkley,  Phil 
Jones (22), Jordan Henderson (23), Jack Wilshere (22), Raheem Sterling 
(19), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (20) and Danny Welbeck (23) will be named 
in the travelling party.

Shaw
 has enjoyed an impressive season at St Mary’s and was on Sunday night 
reported to be the subject of a £27million bid from Manchester United.

His
 chances of being named in the squad were given a massive lift when 
Hodgson decided not to attend Cole’s comeback match for Chelsea in the 
Champions League semi-final first leg last month.

Barkley,
 who has come to prominence again after his special strike against 
Manchester City on May 3, has made three appearances for his country.

He
 was rested from Everton’s 2-0 victory at Hull’s KC Stadium on Sunday but his emergence is likely to signal the end of Michael Carrick’s 
international career after a difficult season with Manchester United.

Risky: Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (above) and Jack Wilshere (below) will both be included despite their injury concerns

Although
 Carrick was named United’s player of the year in their last 
title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson, he has never established 
himself as a regular international under Hodgson.

His
 United team-mate Ashley Young, who hasn’t played for England since a 
qualifier against Ukraine in September, is also facing the axe.

Although
 Hodgson insisted this month he is under no pressure from FA chairman 
Greg Dyke to pick young players, he will take at least eight with fewer 
than 10 caps each.

England’s
 Under 21 coach Gareth Southgate hinted last week that the full squad, 
who report for a World Cup training camp on May 19, will have a younger 
feel to it.

Southgate, who names his squad for the Under 20 tournament in Toulon on Tuesday, met Hodgson last week to discuss his selections.

Hodgson
 claims he made his choices several weeks ago and has been unmoved by 
the form of a number of players.  He will include Arsenal duo 
Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere despite their injury problems.

Oxlade-Chamberlain
 returns to training this week and is in contention for a place in the 
FA Cup final against Hull at Wembley on Saturday.

Keeping his place: Phil Jones has overcome his shoulder problem to make the 23

Fire power: Hodgson will stand by Rickie Lambert, who was a vital part of the qualifying campaign

Arsenal
 manager Arsene Wenger said: ‘The news is good — he should re-integrate 
into our squad for normal training. He is available to Roy and I 
wouldn’t be surprised if he is picked.’

Wilshere
 played 27 minutes at Norwich yesterday in his first appearance since 
hobbling off with a fractured foot during England’s friendly against  
Denmark on March 5. Wenger added: ‘The World Cup is one month away, 
that’s plenty of time. It just shows you he has no problem to be 
available.’

Hodgson’s 
striking options were restricted last month when Southampton’s Jay 
Rodriguez ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in a Premier League 
game at Manchester City.

His absence means clubmate Rickie Lambert, who scored against United yesterday, is likely to keep his place in the 23.

Jermain Defoe, who moved to MLS side Toronto in January, may have to make do with a place on stand-by.

Norwich keeper John Ruddy, who hasn’t played for England since the friendly against Italy in August 2012, will miss out.
