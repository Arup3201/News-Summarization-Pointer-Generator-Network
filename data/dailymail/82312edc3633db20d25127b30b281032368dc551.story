Starry-eyed couples embrace against a suitably sparkling backdrop in these breathtaking engagement shots.

California-based wedding photographers Robert Paetz and Felicia Wong use long-exposure photography to sharply capture thousands of stars twinkling in the vast desert skies above their subjects' heads.

The husband and wife team take their clients at least 100 miles away from the nearest urban centre in order to avoid light pollution and achieve the most awe-inspiring results for newly engaged couples celebrating their impending nuptials.

Star-crossed lovers: This couple marked their engagement with a stunning picture captured against a night sky studded with thousands of stars

Awe-inspiring: This couple appear in silhouette as tiny figures among the outlines of trees beneath a vast inky sky lit up by countless stars

Dubbed 'astro wedding photography', the method sees many couples travelling to remote desert locations with the California-based photographers.

Paetz and Wong say they keep a 'hawk-like' watch on the phases of the moon and the weather forecast in order to achieve the most striking results, according to a report on designtaxi.com.

Many couples opt for the stark scenery of Death Valley National Park for their romantic engagement pictures, embracing beneath the night time skies blanketed with stars.
