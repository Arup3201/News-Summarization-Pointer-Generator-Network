Mother knows best: Georgina Clark whose daughter did not 'run off' with the former deputy headmaster at her school

It is a sex scandal that has rocked one of the country’s leading private girls’ schools and resulted in the resignation of the deputy headmaster accused of having an affair with a former pupil.

But now the mother of the girl at the centre of the storm has denied any affair took place and accused The Godolphin and Latymer School of ‘hanging my daughter out to dry’.

Speaking for the first time, Georgina Clark told The Mail on Sunday that her 19-year-old daughter Helena Skelly had not had a sexual relationship with married teacher Phil Culling, and said that the teenager had been wrongly portrayed as a Lolita.

Mr Culling, 41, was forced to step down last week because of his alleged romance with aspiring singer Helena, who left the school last summer.

But her mother insisted that Ruth Mercer, the headmistress of the £17,000-a-year school in Hammersmith, west London, had taken the action because she and the governors were ‘paranoid’ about its image.

Parents received an email from Mrs Mercer informing them Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect’ because his role had become ‘untenable’.

Mrs Mercer had reportedly confronted her deputy about the relationship after being told the pair had moved in together.

But Mrs Clark, 52, speaking at her home  in Tadworth, Surrey, denied that there was a relationship, saying: ‘Is my daughter close to Phil Culling? Yes. Has she had a sexual or physical relationship with him? No.

‘The school has hung my daughter out to dry and she has become the centrepiece of all this but there’s no substance to it.

‘It was a parent who rang the school – I don’t know who. But my daughter is innocent and now she is being made out to be some sort of Lolita.

Helena Skelly is a talented musician and has aspirations of becoming a singer-songwriter

Helena Skelly was a former pupil at The Godolphin and Latymer School where Phil Culling was the deputy headmaster. The school motto is an ancient Cornish phrase, Francha Leale Toge, which translates as 'free and loyal art thou'

‘I utterly believe my daughter when she says that there is nothing going on between her and Mr Culling. She’s devastated by all this.

‘She’s my child and I just want to protect her – we are very close. Helena would have come to me first, without question, if there was anything going on. It’s an extraordinarily expensive school, and I think the school is so paranoid about profile that it cannot afford a scandal.’

In a further twist, Helena’s former boyfriend said last night he had been told two years ago she had fallen in love with an older man.

Lifeguard Josh Rosario, 19, from Hampton, Middlesex, revealed: ‘We dated briefly two years ago for about a month. Things didn’t work out and afterwards a friend told me she had fallen in love with an older man.’

Talented: Helene Skelly left school last summer and has ambitions to become a singer-songwriter

Mr Culling was head of music and became close to Helena after helping her with her goal of becoming  a singer-songwriter.

But Mrs Clark insisted that her daughter and Mr Culling had done nothing improper, saying: ‘There has been no inappropriate behaviour between my daughter and Mr Culling in my view.

‘Yes, he was supportive to her at school. Yes, he plays the piano with her when she performs. But he’s not sharing a flat with her, he’s not sleeping with her and I have no idea why he has left his wife now. My little girl is a consenting adult but she has not had an affair with that man.’

Mr Culling is thought to have moved out of the £600,000 four-bedroom home he shared with his wife Rebecca in Isleworth, Middlesex.

It is understood that the school decided not to involve the police because the romantic side of the relationship is believed to have taken place after Helena left the school.

The headmistress declined to comment last night, but the school has previously confirmed that a teacher had resigned after failing to maintain standards of behaviour expected  of staff.
