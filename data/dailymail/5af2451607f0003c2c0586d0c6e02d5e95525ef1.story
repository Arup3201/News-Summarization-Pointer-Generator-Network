A Missouri man is dead after a fatal shooting involving a police officer on Saturday.   

This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 

Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m.

Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop

While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off.

The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. 

Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck.  

The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home.

Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died.

The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting

The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. 

The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident.   

The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead.

Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times.

Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. 

A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. 

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. 

In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA.

While two police detain his female friend, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!'

Five gun shots are then fired and the man lies lifeless, face down.
