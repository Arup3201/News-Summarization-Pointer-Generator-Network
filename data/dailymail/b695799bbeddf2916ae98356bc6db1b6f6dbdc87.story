Arsene Wenger is not given to tub-thumping, so when he steps out of character, we do well to listen. ‘When you look at the top-quality players that come into the Premier League, we have all the best attacking players in Europe here,’ he said last week. ‘The big clubs here have huge financial potential and offensive power. All the best players play here.’

As the point sinks in, you find yourself ticking lists: Manchester United have signed Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to play alongside Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Chelsea have bought the prolific Diego Costa, Liverpool secured the tempestuous Mario Balotelli to contest his place with Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert, Arsenal have signed Alexis Sanchez, while Manchester City gladly settled for Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero, who may just be the best of the lot.

The presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar  in Barcelona, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo in Madrid, tends to mock Wenger’s boast that ‘all the best players play here’.

Chelsea's Diego Costa is one of the many top-class strikers plying their trade in the Premier League 

But Vincent Kompany aside, there are barely any world-class centre backs currently playing  in England 

No matter, that collection of strikers is probably as good as it gets. Yet while it is relatively easy to reel off the names of genuinely gifted goalscorers in the Premier League, the list of similarly accomplished central defenders may be scribbled on the back of a stamp.

There is Vincent Kompany at City and, potentially, Dejan Lovren, Liverpool’s signing from Southampton. United and Arsenal have nobody of real note, while Chelsea’s most plausible candidate is the battle-worn John Terry.

The fact that Terry is still England’s most formidable centre-half says everything about the current state of English central defenders.

Yet this is a nation which down the decades has produced more than its share of gifted defenders.

A top-of-the-head trawl turns up Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Tony Adams, Mark Wright, Brian Clough’s sublime alliance of Roy McFarland and Colin Todd, all the way back to the blessed Bobby Moore, who virtually invented the art.

The days have gone when our senior division can offer hugely accomplished Scots and Irish defenders, after the fashion of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, while United would gladly hurl scores of their untold millions at a young Nemanja Vidic. But they are not to be had, neither for love nor for money, at home or abroad. The recent World Cup demonstrated just how bare is football’s cupboard.

The fact that 33-year-old John Terry is still far and away England's best defender shows there isn't much talent coming through

On the flight home from Brazil, I met a Premier League manager, a man who is a considerable authority on the world game. I asked him what he had made of the tournament.

‘Nobody knows how to defend,’ he said. ‘The best players in the world and you can’t see a defender. They don’t exist, it seems.’ So how had such a situation developed?

An eloquent shrug. ‘You tell me,’ he said. ‘Cos I don’t have a clue.’

His honesty was commendable, his conclusion depressing. Because the game’s inability to produce distinguished defenders is more than a mere quirk. It produces a distorted sense of the game’s values.

The best strikers are football’s Flash Harrys; hugely paid and greatly feted. They are the darlings of the television directors, the names the crowds sing, the idols of starry-eyed children who dream of the glory which accompanies the goals. But if those goals arrive too easily, then it follows that the attackers’ qualities are marginally invalidated. And the signs suggest that the inadequacy of defenders is now an accepted fact.

Consider the following statistic: in  2013-14, after five Premier League games, a total of 107 goals had been scored. This year, after five games, the total stands at 143.

Arsene Wenger said there are many strars in the Premier League, but almost none of them are defenders

Now some will see this as a cause for celebration; the TV directors I mentioned and the people charged with negotiating the next Premier League television contract. But the game’s essential balance has been disturbed. Just as there is more to cricket than a series of sixes, more to golf than the ability to blast a drive for 300 yards, then there is much more to football than a furious flood of cheap goals.

But that flood will not be stemmed until the game rediscovers the art of competent defending.

Wenger’s instincts are admirable. The attackers he cited are faithful symbols of his philosophy. On those days when the passing game flows and the chances are generated in thrilling profusion, Arsenal are probably the most attractive team in all of England.

But offer him a Vidic, a Hansen, another Adams, and he would sell the grandstand for his signature. Because then he would discover, beyond doubt or question, the true worth of the best attacking players in Europe.

Ham acting like this is Frankly just laughable

Frank Lampard wore the look of a man who had just done something unforgivable. His beaming colleagues came bouncing to his side but he responded with firmly polite rejection.

At such a moment he needed time to be alone, time to come to terms with his shame. It was the stuff of Victorian melodrama. Indeed, you would have needed a heart of stone to keep from laughing out loud.

For Lampard was observing the most fatuous convention in modern football. He was ostentatiously refusing to celebrate the goal he had just scored, on the grounds that he had scored it against his former club.

Frank Lampard's non-celebration when he scored for Manchester City against Chelsea was nauseating 

The entire exercise reeked of calculation, as it always does. The City fans would be so cheered by the goal that they would overlook the absence of celebration.

The Chelsea fans would see the stricken face of their old favourite and tell themselves: ‘Dear old Frank’s still one of us’.

Yet the fact is that Lampard is now employed by Manchester City. They pay his wages. He joined them because Chelsea decided that they no longer needed him. That’s how professional football works, as Lampard knows full well.

Nobody was expecting extravagant, knee-sliding glee last weekend, just a simple recognition that he had done his job.

The counterfeit remorse convinced nobody but the terminally gullible. A yellow card for simulation should greet the next player to pull the stunt. Ham acting deserves no less.

Insipid Geoff Thompson rewarded by Sepp Blatter 

FIFA have rejected calls to publish their own report into alleged corruption in the bidding for the World Cups of 2018 and 2022. Having commissioned the report, Sepp Blatter has discovered it was telling uncomfortable truths.

Enforced silence was his predictable response. In a busy week, it offered a brief distraction from his efforts to organise his fifth term as FIFA president. Yet there was one matter which almost sneaked past the public gaze. FIFA decided to ban the third-party ownership of players.

Former FA chairman Geoff Thompson endorsed Sepp Blatter for his current presidential term 

So they set up a working party. And who is to be chair? I give you Mr Geoff Thompson, former chairman of our own FA. In nine years as FA chairman, he never cast a shadow. Indeed, there were those who seriously doubted his very existence.

But he did sign a letter endorsing Blatter for his current presidential term and, in Sepp’s world, no sycophantic deed goes unrewarded. So Thompson heads working parties, where he will rock no boats, drop no bricks and say nothing because he has nothing to say. In short, he is innocuous, insipid and practically invisible; Inaction Man to the life.

Mark my words, our Geoff could go a long way in FIFA. 

P.S. 

A reporter from The Independent newspaper met the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley outside a London pub. Ashley offered this assessment of Alan Pardew’s career prospects: ‘Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that’s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it has cost me a lot. I won’t put up with it any more.’

Later, Ashley’s lawyers ‘interpreted’ the remarks. They used the term ‘tongue in cheek’. They explained that Ashley was ‘humouring’ the reporter. You will form your own conclusion. I know which version I believe.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley denied he was being serious in saying manager Alan Pardew could lose his job
