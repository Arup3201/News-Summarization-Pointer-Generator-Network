She's known and loved in the fashion industry for her quirky, urban style and if there's one girl who pioneered the sportsluxe street trend, it's undoubtedly Cara Delevingne.

So when the supermodel announced she was working on a range for DKNY fashion fans couldn't wait.

And now the model-turned-actress' range has finally dropped her fans, who call themselves Delevingners, will be pleased to hear that it does indeed mirror her cool, London style.

Here it is! Cara Delevingne has unveiled her debut fashion range for DKNY

Cara first started to work with DKNY almost two years ago as a model. Talking about the design collaboration she explains that the brand has have always encouraged her input, personal style and ideas from the very beginning of the working relationship. 

Speaking about the new drop, the 22-year-old said: 'It was an organic process and it made sense. DKNY is urban and edgy but most of all, it’s individual. They truly embrace the weirdness in all of us, so you can really be yourself. 

'I can’t believe that some random, rough ideas have finally turned into my own collection! Designs with my own name on them and in collaboration with the iconic DKNY brand. 

'It is so wild to realise that it has been an entire year since we began planning this project together and it goes to show that time does fly when you’re having fun.'

Cara's range, which lands  on October 15 at DKNY stores, DKNY.com, Net-a-porter, Selfridges, Harrods and Harvey Nichols, consists of 15 pieces to be layered 'every which way', according to the young fashion star.

The collection includes crop tops, which she cites as wardrobe essentials, jumpsuits, hoodies and a 'to die for' leather bomber jacket.

One of Cara's favourite pieces from the range, which starts at £65, is the pantsuit, because, she says, you can boy it up, split it up or suit it up, when needed.

Cara added: 'When I first came to NYC when I was 15 years old and saw the DKNY mural on Houston Street, I was wowed. To me, DKNY captured the essence of New York and set trends for young people everywhere. 

'For Donna to trust my creative vision and give me freedom to design pieces I love is such a privilege. I’m thrilled to share it - and can’t wait to see how you make it yours.'

Aside from her design duties, Cara has been busy walking the runway at Paris fashion week - including closing for Chanel - and filming for her upcoming movies. At least she'll have plenty of new clothes to wear.
