A former glamour girl who was girl forced to undergo a breast reduction for health reasons has found new success as a designer of bras for women who have had mastectomies.

Elle Terry-Dawson, 27, has seen her design, christened the Hospital Bra, win praise from mastectomy patients and breast cancer support groups.

The idea came to her while she was in agony following breast reduction surgery. Elle had the surgery because her size 32HH breasts had lead to of chronic back pain and neck ache. She reduced them to a size 32F in March 2012.

She is now in talks with NHS Trusts about providing the £45 bras on mastectomy recovery wards in hospitals.

Speaking about recovering from her own surgery, Elle said: 'I couldn't move without being in terrible pain. The bra the hospital gave me to wear while I recovered was so uncomfortable.

'I had no idea women were having to make do with such uncomfortable bras after surgery. I realised I needed to come up with a new design.'

In her former career, Elle modelled lingerie and swimwear for magazines including FHM.

Her hostessing work saw her attending celebrity parties, but she decided the perks were not enough to offset the constant physical pain.

Explaining, Elle said: 'I developed quickly and by the time I was in my late teens, life with my breasts was a nightmare.

'In school, I was badly bullied. The girls suggested I was padding my bra, while boys just didn't leave me alone.

'Worst of all was the agonising pain. My breasts were just far too big for my frame, leading to chronic back and neck ache.'

She was eventually approved for NHS surgery in March 2012 to reduce her breasts from size 32HH to 32F.

She said: 'Lying in my hospital bed, I struggled with the post-operation pain. I was in agony. My chest was unbearably sore and tender.

'What made matters worse was that the standard recovery bras I was advised to wear by the hospital were incredibly uncomfortable.

'The bras available were very difficult to put on, weren't easily adjustable and quite inaccessible for medical staff when it came to changing dressings and aftercare.

'I realised my uncomfortable bra was the last thing I should be worrying about. So I took out my notebook and designed a completely new bra.'

Elle, who had a benign growth removed from her breast following a cancer scare when she was 19, has found loyal customers for the £45 bra among women who have had treatment for breast cancer, including those who have had mastectomies.

She said: 'The first run of 100 bras sold out very quickly. In June I took delivery of my first main batch of 2,500 bras.

'I've visited very poorly women in their homes for fittings, and I'm honoured to serve them.

'I understand something of the emotional turmoil women go through when they deal with cancer. If the bra I've designed can do anything to help them, then I consider myself very lucky.

'Helping those women has been the most rewarding experience of my life. I'm hoping to open up a sanctuary for women to have a place where they can have wigs altered, have recovery bras fitted and get nipple and eyebrow tattoos, all under one roof.

'I've met some amazing ladies and learned a lot. Many of them have become great friends.'

Elle, who owns Gorgeous lingerie boutique in her hometown of Tring, Hertfordshire, is currently in talks with NHS Trusts about introducing the Hospital Bra to recovery wards.

The bra is already in use in private surgeries, and has been recommended by Bosom Buddy therapy groups.

Tracey Norris, 56, leader the Tring Bosom Buddy cancer support group said: 'Elle has done a brilliant job listening to the difficulties women experience with post-surgery bras.

'What you get in an NHS hospital is often not very good, but Elle's bra is so comfortable it can be worn even after you leave hospital.

'Approximately 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in this country, and they deserve access to meaningful, personalised service during and after their treatment. This is exactly what Elle provides.'
