Emotional notes written by British troops in Afghanistan reveal the true heartache they felt while serving on the front line.

Artist Derek Eland, 53, formerly of the Parachute Regiment, was embedded with the military and travelled to remote checkpoints and patrol bases to collect stories. 

He asked soldiers and civilians to write down their innermost thoughts on cards he gave  - or materials they could find lying around.

Collection: The letters have been published alongside photographs and personal stories in Eland's book, Diary Rooms: Being Human on the Front Line in Afghanistan, which is on sale now

Eland asked them to 'write down what it's like to be here - could be feelings, memories, emotions, experiences'.

The soldiers' uncensored notes - written on food packets, medical forms and cardboard boxes -  show the sadness, boredom and fear they experienced on the front line.

It also captures the moments of exhilaration and laughter that brought them together.

One touching note, written by Corporal Gav Martin talks about the sadness he felt leaving his newborn son. 

It reads: 'The hardest thing for me was not fixing bayonet's but leaving my son who I only got to see for one week'.

A message written by soldier Colum McGeown describes the need to 'stay strong' and 'keep fighting'.

He wrote in bold capital letters: 'Gotta stay strong, focused, switched on.

'Skills and drills got to be perfect, keep fighting, out-tank them, out-smart them, out-work them... My love I will see you at Brize in 2 1/2 weeks.'

But just three days later he had both legs blown off when he stood on an improvised explosive device.

Lasting impact: Colum McGeown (pictured) wrote his note for Eland just three days before his leg was blown off by an IED. His is just one of the moving stories told in the artist's book

Determined: In his note (pictured) McGeown talks about the need to 'stay strong' and 'switched on'

Mature: This 20-year-old soldier writes about how the time has aged him 'increasing the wrinkles and creases in his head'. He adds that it has made him appreciate the 'little things' like driving his car or going shopping

Connection: The notes are published alongside photographs that document the daily lives of the troops

Photographs of the soldiers writing the notes accompany 100 stories have been published in Eland's book Diary Rooms: Being Human on the Front Line in Afghanistan.

Mr Eland, from Cumbria, said: 'I wasn't a slightly aloof, pretentious artist turning up with a paintbrush.

'Because I took the same risks that the soldiers took to get them, they were willing to give me their stories.'

'Some people were actively against it - they thought it would lead to mutinous comments and reduce morale.

'But the soldiers at the sharp end of the front line absolutely got it. They were willing to write their hearts out.The soldiers wrote with the same intensity that they fought.'

Many of the notes were written in dangerous forward operating bases on Helmand's front line.

Ranger Curley, of the Royal Irish Regiment, used a green biro to describe how seeing a father and son working in an Afghan field reminded him of making a living with his dad. 

He wrote 'the only battle we had was the one my mother had to fight off cancer and the only soldier we had in our safe environment in the west of Ireland was my mam'.

Doc Richards wrote: 'My abiding memory of Afghanistan?...

'It will be a humble local farmer who one day took me by surprise by asking after my family. "You are far from home. You must miss your family. We are very grateful.'

For the family of David Dalzell, the note represents some of the final words he ever wrote. He died just a few days after he met Mr Eland when his friend's rifle accidentally discharged and shot him.

His message said that the tour - his first in Afghanistan - has been 'tough', and shares his thoughts about the 'long days and nights'.

His mother, Susan, and father, Gordon, watched footage Eland had taken of the two friends together on patrol in Helmand.

'For that we are extremely grateful,' Mrs Dalzell wrote in the foreword to Diary Rooms.

'Reading the messages on the postcards, you get a snapshot into the lives of the soldiers on the frontline and we feel privileged to read their thoughts, some very funny and others so heartfelt, moving and so profoundly sad,' she wrote. 

The notes also reveal the hidden mental turmoil faced by those on the front line.

Touching: One soldier wrote this moving poem that captures the pride he feels while serving on the front line

Eland said: 'The soldiers wrote the things that they were carrying around in their heads all the time, which they've never had a chance to express.

'They can't tell their friends how they feel because it might show a sign of weakness and they can't tell their families at home because they would scare them.

The project collated notes written by British soldiers, Afghan troops and interpreters, a BBC journalist, American Special Forces, as well as Australians and Canadians.

The diary notes were first displayed in the Ministry of Defence - 'because my army sponsor wanted people in Whitehall who had never been in war to understand it'.

They were on show at the Imperial War Museum North and are now at Middlesbrough Institute for Modern Art, part of Tate network.
