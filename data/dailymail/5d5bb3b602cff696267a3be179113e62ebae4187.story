An archive of images showing the fascinating history of the traditional Easter egg has emerged.

To celebrate 100 years since the first 
Nestle Easter eggs, the confectionary giant released these vintage 
images of how the chocolate delicacy used to be.

In the early 1900s the only chocolate spring-time treat that could be bought were in the shape of shoes, chicken, and fish.

They were seen as religious symbols that embodied important aspects of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus.

'When we started making novelty chocolates in the shape of Easter things we had shoes, chickens, and fish, and no eggs at all,' explains Alex Hutchinson, an archivist at Nestle.

'This
 is because in the story Jesus tells one of his disciples that a 
cockerel would crow after he betrayed him, which it does after he denies
 knowing Jesus to soldiers.

'And after his crucifixion and resurrection Jesus ate a meal consisting of fish with his disciples.'

Chocolate delights: Confectionary company Rowntrees made the oval shaped chocolates, left, but it's very different from the modern creations we enjoy today, such as this Chococo egg, right

An assortment of eggs: Rowntress began making oval shaped chocolate when Christian and Pagan traditions merged and signified new beginnings. The first Easter egg was launched in 1914

Eventually the treats were made from chocolate moulds and they soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s.

There were no eggs made throughout the 1940s because of the Second World War and shortages on ingredients like sugar went on into the 1950s.

In 1954 Rowntrees were able to release one single type of Easter treat, a Dairy Box egg, and the novelty chocolates soared in popularity throughout the 1960s to present day.

Hutchinson said: 'Easter itself is a pagan festival which is all about celebrating spring and why a lot of the symbols are of hares and nature.

Something fishy: The first Easter egg was actually made out of cardboard but contained chocolates inside. Then the design progressed to all chocolate, but in the shape of fish, chicken and shoes to symbolise the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus

Over hare: Easter eggs soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s. There were no eggs made throughout the 1940s because of the Second World War

Pieces of history: Alex Hutchinson, an archivist at Nestle, said: 'The early church fathers mixed the Christian celebrations with the pagan traditions and these symbols were carried over'

The 
Christian festival gradually merged with Pagan traditions also held at 
the same time of the year that celebrated new beginnings.

Hatching eggs became a way of symbolising this and confectionary company Rowntrees began making the oval shaped chocolates.

One
 of the first Easter eggs was launched in 1914 and was actually made of 
cardboard, but contained a selection of chocolates inside.

Traditional eggs: These shapes were seen as religious symbols that embodied the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus

'The early church fathers mixed the Christian celebrations with the pagan traditions and these symbols were carried over.

'Eggs began to make an appearance because they symbolised spring, hope, and new beginnings.

'As time went on England was becoming a secular country and chocolate eggs were more popular than the traditional gifts and they were also a lot easier to make.

'They would have been very expensive and not something that every day people could afford, especially in some of the ornate boxes they came in.

'They were not branded until the '960s when we started bringing out specific varieties like Aero and Smarties themed Easter eggs.'
