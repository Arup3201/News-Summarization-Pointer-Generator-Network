He's played for club and country, scored wonder goals and become one of the world's most famous footballers. But despite rising to sporting stardom, David Beckham has revealed that he once wasn't even the best player at his school.

He said: 'I used to practise football on the field.
 We had a few good young players in the school so I don't think I was 
the best player in the class. For some reason I always remember being 
picked last in the school games at break time.'

The father-of-four recently returned to Chase Lane Primary School, in East London, in his role as an ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids scheme.

Back to school: David Beckham surprises pupils at an assembly at his former primary, Chase Lane

His former school is one of the many across the country who have benefitted from collecting the supermarket vouchers to exchange for sporting equipment.

The excited pupils screamed in delight as he surprised them by joining their morning assembly and lunch break.

The former Manchester United player revealed the school set him up well for his time at the prestigious club.

He said: 'We had one teacher called Mr Magee who 
really scared me but it was lucky as he prepared me for Sir Alex 
Ferguson who was also scary!'

School dinners have improved! The footballer joined pupils for lunch

It's been 30 years since David last walked through the school gates and he explains in the video below how it bought back fond memories.

He said: 'I remember being happy when I came to 
school. I never missed a day unless I was sick. I was never one of the 
top pupils but I always worked hard.

'It's gone very quickly but it's great to be back. A lot has changed here. School dinners are a lot healthier than they were back in the day.'

He added after his tour of the grounds: 'All the memories of my favourite classes 
and kicking about in the playground have come flooding back. I'm proud 
to see Chase Lane is so involved in Active Kids and encourage other 
schools and clubs to take advantage of it.

'It's great to talk to the teachers and 
children about the importance of leading a healthier lifestyle no matter
 what age you are.'

It seems football prowess continues at the school as the U11 team will play at Wembley on 25 May in the Year Six National Final.

David wished them the best of luck and advised them to savour the moment of playing in the historic ground.

Talent blossomed: He became an England star but the footballer admitted he once wasn't even the best in his class at primary school

Keep fit: David is an ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids scheme and he's glad his former primary school have been among the many to benefit from it

'I'm jealous, I'll never play there again,' he admitted.

The star was in good humour as the children asked him questions and clamored to shake his hand. One cheeky little boy asked if he had played alongside Sir Bobby Charlton while at Manchester United.

'No, that was quite a few years before I started playing! He was actually my Dad's favourite player,' he diplomatically replied.

The visit had an uplifting effect on the children who said meeting the star had inspired them to do well in school.

'We can believe that we can make our dreams come true like he did,' one pupil said.
