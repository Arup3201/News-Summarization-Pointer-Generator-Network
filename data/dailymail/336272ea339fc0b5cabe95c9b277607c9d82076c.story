It seems even keeping her clothes on is not always enough to spare the Duchess of Cambridge’s blushes.

After weeks of discussion about what Kate chose not to wear on holiday in France, another controversy has erupted over an item of clothing that she did put on in the Solomon Islands.

At an official dinner to celebrate the nation’s culture, she wore a pretty sundress which she believed to be by a local designer – but which was actually made more than 3,000 miles away in the Cook Islands.

The gaffe has caused an almighty row 
in the Solomon Islands, where the government yesterday placed the blame 
on Kethie Saunders, a local resident chosen as part of the welcoming 
committee because of her knowledge about the intricacies of the nation’s
culture.

In a fiercely-worded statement, the 
government said it had been agreed in advance with the royal guests that
they would wear ‘something that would connect easily with the ordinary 
Solomon Islands’.

Organisers arranged for William to be 
provided with a green ‘island shirt’ featuring a map of the islands and 
coconut trees, while Kate was to bring a summer dress of her own.  

However, ahead of the royal couple’s 
arrival on the first stop of their recent tour, Mrs Saunders was let 
into their hotel room to leave gifts of flowers, chocolate and soap on 
behalf of the organising committee.

Unfortunately, according to the 
government statement, she also ‘smuggled in’ two items of clothing made 
by a designer from the Cook Islands – a garish blue shirt for William 
and the Duchess’s bandeau dress, which were laid on the couple’s bed.

When the royal party arrived, a week 
ago last Sunday, a member of their staff noticed the shirt left for the 
Duke was blue rather than green and checked with the government’s head 
of protocol – who assured them that the clothes were, indeed, official 
ones.

But to add to the comedy of errors, it
seems that the Duke’s real shirt (as well as a dress for Kate, just in 
case) had been hidden by their bags.

Delighted by the gift, Kate ditched 
her original outfit to wear it, and the fashion world was quick to 
proclaim that it highlighted the talent of young designers in the 
emerging Third World nation.

But then, of course, its true origin 
emerged. A government spokesman said: ‘The Duchess wore the dress 
because she believed it to be from the Solomon Islands government and 
thought it would be an appropriate gesture. Had she known it were from 
the Cook Islands it would not have been worn and she feels bad about the
confusion.

‘We are incredibly frustrated that this situation has come about and see Kethie as entirely to blame.’

Mrs Saunders, who is understood to be 
an existing client of the Cook Islands designer, said it was an 
‘unfortunate incident’ and that she had no intention of embarrassing the
couple or the local government.

A St James’s Palace spokesman said 
last night: ‘The situation arose through no fault of Solomon Islands 
government or the royal household.’
