Rats as big as cats have been scouring the streets of Birmingham, breaking holes in walls and ravaging bins, reports claim.

Pest control has gone into overdrive to tackle more than 5,100 sightings of the enormous animals in the city just one year.

Colin Watts, managing the crackdown, said he saw a two-foot rodent as 'wide as a brick'.

Outbreak: Pest control has been sent into overdrive to find and catch two-foot rats swarming Birmingham

Giant holes have been made into homes, and calls to pest control were up by 300 on the year before in 2013

He said: 'One of the biggest I've seen must have been 14 or 15 inches long.

'That was just the body, without the tail.

'With its tail it would have been over 2ft. It was like a small cat.'

One professor blames the obesity epidemic and households' unhealthy diets for fuelling the pests' appetite and eating habits.

Dr Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University, said: 'Humans have got bigger with nutrition and it's a quite likely explanation for rats as well.'

Colin Watts, who has been dealing with the outbreak, says they weigh the same as two bags of sugar

Mr Watts added that some rats felt as heavy as two bags of sugar.

'They're unbelievably big and heavy when you pick them up,' he said.

'It's because of all the food around for them in bags.

'They are definitely getting bigger.'

Earlier this month, councillors objected to plans to privatise Birmingham's pest control service, which they claim would make the essential service too expensive for residents.

The service must become self-sufficient within two years so Â£600,000 can be cut from the budget.

Mr Watts is urging families to lay poison and warning rats reproduce at an alarming scale. One professor at Warwick University blames households' increasingly large eating habits for fuelling the rodents' diets

Officers had suggested outsourcing the service and increasing charges.

Young rats can fit into a hole the width of a large pen as their spines were like 'jelly'.

Sexually active and reproducing at just six weeks of age, rats have up to 12 babies at a time.

In a lifetime of around 18 months, they can have approximately 200 offspring.

Mr Watts said: 'Imagine the knock-on effect, it's incredible.

'So it's imperative we keep putting poisons down in Birmingham.'

Ratzilla: Rats in Papua New Guinea can reach the size of a large tom cat, such as this one pictured in 2007

There are several species of rat classed as 'giants' - most of them from South America and Indonesia.

The coypu - a large rodent which grew up to 2ft long and weighed 20lbs - is found in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. It is similar to a beaver and lives in water and in burrows on river banks.

It was believed to have been made extinct in the UK in 1989 after it became a pest and caused damage to river banks and irrigation systems.

Several species of giant rat bigger than some cats were discovered in 2007 in remote jungle areas on Papua New Guinea.

The largest, known as woolly rats, can reach 3ft long.

In South America, there are two types of giant rat from the Kunisia genus. They grow to more than 1.5ft and feed on insects and other mammals.

The news Birmingham comes just days after a 16in 'ratzilla' was found in a flat in Sweden, which sparked a frenzy on Twitter.

The
 picture of the enormous rodent, which had been caught in a rat trap, 
broke into the kitchen by gnawing its way through cement and wood.

Meanwhile, in Germany, residents of Halle were this week terrified by the discovery of 'demon' rats with fangs in their central river.

In the UK, pest control officers were forced to hunt down a swarm of two-foot rats in Bradford in 2010.

And last
 year, exterminators were baffled by rats who chewed through heavy duty, highly-protected wires in Southampton - sparking a massive 
blaze that caused thousands of pounds of damage at a coach company.

The fire destroyed three coaches and three minibuses at the firm's headquarters.
