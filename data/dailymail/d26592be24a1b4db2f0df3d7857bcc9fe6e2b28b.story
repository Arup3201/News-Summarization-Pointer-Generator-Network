A painting of Britain's fattest ever cow which gained celebrity status during the 19th century is expected to fetch £6,000 at auction.

The Craven Heifer became a national phenomenon and toured the country after being deliberately fattened up by her vicar owner.

The Reverend William Carr fed her 
relentlessly for five years until she weighted 312
 stone and 11ft 4ins in length and over 7ft in height.

Her record for the heaviest cow in Britain still stands 200 years later.

Giant: The 1811 portrait of the 312 stone Craven Heifer is expected to sell for £6,000 at auction

The painting he commissioned in 1811 by an unknown artist has been owned by a private collector for the past 25 years and is now being sold by auctioneers Bonhams.

Alistair Laird, director of paintings and prints department, said: 'The Craven Heifer was so big that a 
special door twice the width of the other cows had to be built to get 
her in and out of the cow shed.

'It was quite common for farmers to commission paintings of over-sized animals to advertise advances in breeding techniques.

'A huge number of prints were made from the original painting of the Craven Heifer, which led to her to became very famous.'

The cow was sold to wealthy landowner John Watkinson for the equivalent sum of £10,000.

He took her on a tour of towns and cities in England and thousands of people came to see her.

Mr Laird said: 'In the 19th century agriculture played a much larger role in the economy than it does now.

'Farm
 animals, especially cattle and pigs, were just fed and fed until they 
got bigger and bigger and some of them reached huge proportions.

Celebrity: Such was the fame of the Craven Heifer that a number of pubs were named after her

Prince Charles even supped a pint during a visit to the Craven Heifer Hotel in Stainforth in 2001

'After being sold for 200 pounds, an incredibly large fee for the time, she went on a tour around the country and people were charged to look at her.

'This was in the days before the RSPCA and TV and if there was an enormous animal coming to town then people would come and see it.'

The heifer was born in 1807 in Bolton Abbey, in Craven, North Yorkshire, and lived for five years.

Such was the cow's fame that pubs across England were named after her.

At least three still exist today in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and Colne and Rossendale, in Lancashire.

A second similar oil painting showing an over-sized pig is also being sold at the same auction on January 29.

The creature was painted by E.S England after it won a 'fat stock' show in Leeds in 1906.
