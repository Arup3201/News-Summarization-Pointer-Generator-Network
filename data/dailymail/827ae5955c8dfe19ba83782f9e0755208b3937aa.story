Hero: Lt Cdr Molyneux was rushing to tackle the gunman when he was shot

A Royal Navy officer tried to tackle a junior rating who went on a murderous rampage onboard a nuclear-powered submarine before he was shot, an inquest heard today.

Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux bravely rushed to tackle Able Seaman Ryan Donovan as he wielded the gun onboard HMS Astute while it was docked at Southampton, Hampshire, on April 8 2011.

The inquest, at Southampton, was told father-of-four Lt Cdr Molyneux , known as Molly, heard the shots before rushing towards Donovan.

Witnesses heard Lt Cdr Molyneux, 36, say to Donovan 'What have you done?', seconds before he was shot.

The inquest was told Lt Cdr Molyneux would have fallen unconscious immediately.

Donovan, 23, was jailed for life after pleading guilty to murder at Winchester Crown Court.

The navigator yeoman also pleaded guilty 
to attempting to murder Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, 45, who 
he shot in the stomach.

Donovan's real targets, who he admitted 
attempting to murder, were Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, and 
Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37.

His attack was only stopped when the leader of Southampton City Council, 
Royston Smith, and its chief executive, Alistair Neill, heroically 
wrestled the weapon from him.

The inquest which resumed at 
Southampton's Civic Centre today heard that Lt Cdr Molyneux suffered a single 
gunshot wound to the top of his head, six inches above his right 
earhole.

Home Office 
pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said the position Lt Cdr Molyneux was found lying suggested he was rushing forward to tackle the gunman.

He
added that, at 6ft 2in, Lt Cdr Molyneux was a tall man and would have 
had to lower his head forward in order to suffer the injury to the top 
of his head.

He said: 'It's not an unreasonable 
presumption that he's throwing himself, rushing forwards, moving towards
him with his head down.'

Dr Purdue added: 'It would have caused instantaneous 
unconsciousness followed very, very shortly by death.

'The lieutenant commander would have known nothing about it.'

The inquest heard that Lt Cdr Molyneux
was heard to be breathing, making a 'snoring' sound, as he lay on the 
floor after being shot.

Dr 
Purdue said: 'It's upsetting and emotionally distressing that someone 
horribly injured is still breathing but they are beyond help at that 
stage.

'As soon as he received that wound, he would have been out of it completely.'

Mark Mastaglio, a forensic firearms 
expert, said the weapon used was a SA80 military high velocity rifle which fires
rounds at 940 metres per second and when in automatic mode can fire 800
rounds a minute.

A total of seven shots were fired during the incident, the inquest heard.

Lt Cdr Molyneux's widow Gillian, who attended today's 
hearing, has said previously that nothing could ever replace her 
soulmate and father of Jamie, Arron, Bethany and Charlie and 'the 
heartbreaking sadness for the loss of Ian'.

Donovan had been drinking while ashore 
and had volunteered for guard duty when onboard, because he admitted he 
was intent on killing the two petty officers who had reported him for 
disobeying a direct order to clean a part of the sub.

Donovan was angry because he had been told he would not be 
leaving the sub for an attachment on another vessel because of his 
behaviour.

The amateur rapper, who called himself Reggie Moondog, was given the weapon and 30 rounds by PO Brown.

He turned the gun on him and CPO McCoy but the men dived for cover or fled.

The
crown court heard that Donovan then shot Lt Cdr Molyneux before moving into HMS Astute's control 
room, which was full of local dignitaries visiting the vessel on a 
five-day goodwill visit to Southampton's Eastern Docks.

Horrified onlookers saw Donovan come with the gun at waist height and shoot Lt Cdr Hodge with a 'wild' expression on his face.

Donovan
was then wrestled to the ground by Mr Smith and Mr Neill and the gun 
went off harmlessly for the seventh time during the struggle.

When questioned by detectives, Donovan said: 'I just felt that everyone was out to get me.'

In mitigation, Christopher Parker QC said that Donovan, from Dartford, Kent, was immature and not mentally ill but he could not handle stress.

Sentencing, Mr Justice Field called the shootings a 'murderous onslaught'.

The inquest, which has been held at the discretion of coroner Keith Wiseman so the full facts of Lt Cdr Molyneux's death could be heard, was adjourned until tomorrow.
