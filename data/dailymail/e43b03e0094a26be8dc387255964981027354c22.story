Alejandro Sabella has emerged as a shock contender to become the new manager at Leeds.

Sabella, who quit as Argentina manager following their defeat by Germany in this summer’s World Cup Final, is on Elland Road owner Massimo Cellino’s wishlist after caretaker Neil Redfearn was ruled out of the running to replace the sacked Dave Hockaday.

Sabella, 59, is considering a return to Elland Road 33 years after ending a nightmare 19-month spell with them as a player.

He made just 23 appearances for Leeds after joining as a £400,000 signing from Sheffield United in 1980 before being sold on to Estudiantes.

Argentina media spoke to Sabella last night and he said: 'The Leeds situation is intriguing, and I feel I have unfinished business with that club.'

Cellino initially said he would prefer a British coach and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is among those to have expressed an interest, however, persuading Sabella would represent a major coup for the club.

Sabella claims he has unfinished business at Elland Road following a 19-month playing spell in the early 1980s where he failed to sparkle following a £400,000 move from Sheffield United

Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Cellino said: 'Neil Redfearn`s very busy with the academy and I need him in that job.

'He`s an outstanding coach, a guy who knows how good teams should play, but it would do too much damage to the academy if he stays as (head) coach.

'He`ll be coach at Bournemouth, 100 per cent, and maybe on Saturday as well. But I`ve got ideas about what I`ll do. I`m thinking about a foreign coach, an international coach who I can work with. We need to meet and talk but I think he could be good for us.'
