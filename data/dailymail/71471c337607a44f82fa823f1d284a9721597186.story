A mom in Denver, Colorado shot her three young children, killing two, before turning the gun on herself following a fight with her husband.

Police responding to a 911 call just before 7am on Wednesday morning found the bodies of Mayra Nunez, 23, her son Eric, who was almost two years old and his 6-year-old sister Neveah.

Another girl, 3-year-old Isabelle, was taken to Denver Health Medical Center and immediately underwent surgery. She remains in a critical condition.

The shootings occurred at a home in an industrial neighborhood of northeast Denver just before 7am on Wednesday morning

Tony Nunez, Mayra's older brother told 9NEWS that he had spoken to his sister on Tuesday night while she arguing with her husband Ricky, a construction worker.

He says he told his sister that he would come get her, but was told everything was fine and that it was ‘just a married couple thing.'

Tony also said his brother-in-law called and said he was staying at a friend's place on Tuesday night.

'Maybe I should have [come to get her] maybe I would have changed things,' Tony told 9NEWS.

It's unclear where Ricky Perez was at the time of the shooting, he is the father of Eric and Isabel, while Nivek's surname is Morales.

The family moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas two years ago for better work opportunities. Mayra was a stay at home mom, said her brother and the family was known to keep a gun in the house.

Police investigate the scene of a shootings in the Globeville neighborhood in Denver on Wednesday morning

The shootings occurred at a home in the 4900 block of North Pearl Street in northeast Denver.

The neighborhood is in an industrial 
area, surrounded by warehouses and a trucking terminal, near the 
National Western Stock Show complex.

Neighbor Debbie Martinez said the house was recently remodeled, and she saw a family of five - two adults and three children - move in about six months ago.

‘They seem like outgoing people. They didn't bother anybody,’ she said.

On a corner about a block from the scene, members of nearby Providence Bible Church gathered in a circle to prayer.

‘Basically, we pray for the community,’ said Jose Rojas, pastor of the church.

‘This is the horror of the whole country. There are all these shootings,’ he said. ‘I think it's too much, too much to see innocent people being killed.’

The deaths came as the Colorado Legislature considered stricter gun laws and President Barack Obama tried to rally national support for a ban on assault weapons.
