A British tourist savaged by a Barbary ape while on holiday in Gibraltar required 40 stitches in his arm after nurses described the attack as the worst they'd ever seen.

Stuart Gravenell, 53, and his 22-year-old son Bradley were walking through a nature reserve in the Mediterranean British territory when a pack of apes came charging towards them.

The largest male ape in the group, which stood more than three feet tall, then jumped on to Mr Gravenell, sinking it's teeth into his arm and shaking its head in an act that left the retired IT worker in so much pain that he passed out.

After being bitten by the large ape, Mr Gravenell was rushed to hospital, where nurses said they were treating at least two ape-inflicted injuries a week - with his the worst they had seen so far.

He was given 20 numbing injections and 40 stitches to inch-deep wounds so bad that nurses told him they would have led to an arm amputation in a child.

Mr Gravenell was forced to spend three nights in hospital after his wounds became infected, while the rest of his family struggled on trying to enjoy the holiday.

On his return to the UK, Mr Gravenell went straight to A&E where he doctors told him he had extensive nerve damage in his forearm, leaving him with a pronounced loss of feeling.

Aggressive: Gibraltar's Barbary macaques are made up of five troops which occupy the Upper Rock area of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve. They are the only wild ape population in Europe

Describing the ordeal, the said: 'You just wouldn't believe how traumatic it was. It was a very very upsetting experience. It was supposed to be a nice family holiday and it was totally ruined.'

'I have no recollection of the actual incident - I think I must have blocked it out. But Bradley said it just ran up and stopped dead in its tracks and jumped on me - half on my back and half of my shoulder.

'He [Bradley] said it grabbed my arm - I've got claw marks - and it bit into me arm and just shook. It was so aggressive. It savagely bit my arm, tearing it open,' he added.  

 'It jumped off and was just sat on the wall looking at me. Blood was pouring and spurting everywhere - it was like a tap,' Mr Gravenell went on to say.

The attack came after Mr Gravenell drove to Casares del Sol in Spain from his home in Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, for a three-week break with wife Diane, 55, and Bradley.

* Gibraltar's ape population is made up of five troops which occupy the Upper Rock area of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve.

* They are descended from North African apes and are thought to have been brought to the area by The Moors between 711 and 1492 who kept them as pets.

* They are regarded as a tourist attraction and often climb on visitors who pose for pictures.

* In recent years the regular contact with people was blamed for a breakdown of the animals' social groups which made them more dependent on people and more likely to cause damage. Now anyone caught feeding them is fined £500.

* The apes are currently managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society and earlier this month 30 of the most disruptive were exported to Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling in Scotland.

The keen walker and his son took a day trip to nearby Gibraltar and paid 50p each to enter the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on September 24.

They were warned not to feed the apes who live on the top of the Rock and decided to skip the 'Ape Den' where tourists pose with the animals.

Instead, they headed for the Charles V wall, part of the historic fortifications, and began their descent from the upper reaches of the 1,400ft Rock.

As they started down the steps a group of apes bounded along the narrow wall next to them, chased by a larger primate.

Mr Gravenell and his son, who had no food with them, froze while the animals fought and watched in terror when they turned back towards them.

Without warning the ape jumped back onto the wall before leaping on to Stuart's back as it ran passed him, sinking its teeth into his arm.

It furiously shook its head before letting go and then proceeded to sit and watch as the two bites started bleeding profusely.

Recovery: Doctors said the inch-deep wounds were so bad they would have led to an arm amputation in a child

Getting better: A spokesman for the Government of Gibraltar said the attack on Stuart was the most 'severe' he had ever seen but said there was little more local authorities could do to protect tourists

Mr Gravenell was helped to a nearby sitting area by shocked fellow tourists where he fainted in pain before being taken to the nearby St Bernards Hospital.

He called on the Gibraltar government to do more to warn about the dangers of the 300-strong ape population on the British colony.

He said: 'Everyone I was speaking to out there said the apes are getting out of control... I'm scared they are going to wait until there is a fatality to take action.

'My GP said if the same had happened to a child or an elderly person the sheer trauma may have killed them or they could have lost an arm.

'And to think this happened in a public place where tourists are actually encouraged to go - it's frightening.'

A spokesman for the Government of Gibraltar said the attack on Stuart was the most 'severe' he had ever seen.

Albert Poggio, the UK-based representative for the colony, said: 'It is very very sad but what can one say?' 'These monkeys are wild. We do give as much notice all over the place. It is very unfortunate.'
