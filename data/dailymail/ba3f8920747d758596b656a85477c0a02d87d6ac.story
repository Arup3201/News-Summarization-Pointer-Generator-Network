Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon will discover on Tuesday if his decade-long battle against extradition to the U.S. is over.

Home Secretary Theresa May will tell MPs whether there are sufficient medical grounds to halt his removal on charges of hacking into computers at the Pentagon and Nasa.

Medical experts have warned the 46-year-old will take his own life if placed on a plane to America.

The decision will be based on a psychiatric report prepared for Mrs May by professors Declan Murphy and Thomas Fahy.

Mr McKinnon’s legal team say the report confirms that there is a ‘significant’ risk of suicide which will increase if he is extradited.

The report adds: ‘If he is transferred to a US prison without provision for his particular mental health... then this risk would very significantly increase.’

Mr McKinnon’s removal is being pursued under the Extradition Act, which critics say is biased in favour of the US and gives the Home Secretary little discretion over when an extradition can be halted on medical grounds.

Mr McKinnon’s mother, Janis Sharp, has called on government figures to honour their promises to save her son.

David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Attorney General Dominic Grieve have all supported this paper’s Affront to British Justice campaign calling for Mr McKinnon to face trial in the UK.

A study, carried out by ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell, has called for major changes to the UK/US extradition treaty.

Crucially, Sir Menzies says it must be re-worded so British citizens are afforded the same legal protection as their US counterparts.

The report, commissioned by Nick Clegg, directly contradicts the findings of the ‘whitewash’ Sir Scott Baker review into the extradition deal signed by Labour with the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11.

Sir Scott’s study for the Home Office concluded that the Extradition Act was not biased, even though nine times as many Britons have been extradited as Americans.

At the moment, ‘probable cause’ has to be shown before a UK request for extradition of an American citizen will be granted - with US citizens having the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them.

But the US must show only that there is ‘reasonable suspicion’ that a person being demanded from Britain has committed an offence.

The American authorities need only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought.

Sir Menzies, who is a QC, says he ‘respectfully disagrees’ with the findings of the Baker review, which Home Secretary Theresa May is currently considering.

He said: ‘To put the matter as simply as I can, one may have a ‘suspicion’ that someone has committed a crime, but that is a different and lower standard than being satisfied that it is ‘probable’ that a crime was committed by that person.

‘The proper course should be to raise the British standard to the American one, so that UK citizens do not suffer a disadvantage compared to their US equivalents.’
