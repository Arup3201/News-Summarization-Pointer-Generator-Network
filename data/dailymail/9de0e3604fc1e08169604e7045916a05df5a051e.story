Divock Origi will not be recalled by Liverpool this January, according to Lille manager Rene Girard.

The Reds are struggling for goals with the absence of Daniel Sturridge and the departure of Luis Suarez in the summer, and currently sit seventh in the Premier League.

Origi, on loan at the Ligue 1 side until the end of the season, has four goals for Lille this term and one for his native Belgium.

He signed for £10million in the summer from Lille, but the 19-year-old was immediately sent back on loan to continue his progress.

But rumours that Liverpool would recall the striker have been denied by Girard.

He said: 'It’s just a rumour. There is not truth to my knowledge. It was agreed that Divock would stay the year with us.

'There is no reason he would leave midway through the championship. They have failed to score at Liverpool? Us too. We need him a lot.'

Liverpool have scored just 13 times this season, joint-worst with any top-half side, with £14million summer signing Mario Balotelli yet to net in the top flight.

Origi has scored four goals this season for Lille and once for the Belgian national team
