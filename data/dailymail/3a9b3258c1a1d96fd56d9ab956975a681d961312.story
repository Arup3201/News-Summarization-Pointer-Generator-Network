Pets doing silly things and even Taylor Swift's latest video may generate millions of views, but it's a video that shows a woman removing toys out of packaged that is the internet's top earner.  

According to a video analytics platform called OpenSlate, the highest YouTube earner of 2014 made nearly $5 million just by opening Disney toy packages.

The DC Toys Collector YouTube channel features a woman removing the toys and then putting them together. 

Like christmas every day: Mysterious toy-unboxer DC Toys Collector was the most popular YouTube channel in October with 400m views a month

Another gift: The channel features a young woman in intricately painted nails removing the toys from their packaging and then assembling them

The channel features over 1,600 videos and gets 380 million views a month.

Its most-played video is Play-Doh Sparkle Disney Princesses. The video has been viewed more than 172 million times since it was posted in July. 

Unboxing is a relatively new genre of YouTube videos, and DC Toys Collector  struck while the iron was hot. 

Unboxing videos show off the features of a product, most often a piece of technology.

Essentially the videos are a virtual tour of a product in which you're interested.

Here, the user unboxes everything from Disney princesses, to tubs of Play-Doh, to Lego sets.  

Toy unboxing usually shows the narrator assembling a toy for the viewer. 

Playtime: The channel has about one new video a day. DC Collector is part of a new, highly lucrative genre of online videos called 'unboxing'

Unreal: The one-woman toy-reviewing YouTuber called DC Toys Collector is making more money than most CEOs

Only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen.

Despite the channel's massive, sweeping, and somewhat perplexing popularity, no one — neither the toddlers who watch it along with their parents, nor executives at YouTube seem to know who is behind it.

Children love the videos. One uploaded to DC Toys Collector's channel on Friday called Teletubbies Stacking Cups Surprise Eggs Play-Doh already has 200,000 views.

All her videos start the same way with the toy being introduced. The woman then goes on to open and 'play' with the children's toy pointing out various 'adorable' features.

Dane Golden, who works in the YouTube channel ecosystem as the VP of marketing at Octoly has followed Disney Collector for some time.

'What I believe to be true is that kids are loving this because the woman never shows her face,' Golden said to BuzzFeed.

 'You never see anything but her well-manicured hands. She has a very comforting voice. It's just like playing with other kids playing toys. I think she disappears in the mind of the children.'

So simple: The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses, to tubs of Play-Doh, to Lego sets

Colorful character: Unboxing YouTubers don't typically have sponsorship connections to the brands of products they're unwrapping
