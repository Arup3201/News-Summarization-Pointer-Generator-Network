A man wanted over the Sydney police pursuit, which led to the death of a 17-month-old girl, has been formally charged.

The 22-year-old had been on the run since he allegedly crashed a stolen Audi through the fence of a Constitution Hill property into a backyard where kids were playing last Thursday night.

The toddler was playing on the other side of the fence and sustained fatal injuries.

A man has been charged with the manslaughter of a 17-month-old toddler who was run over at Constitution Hill - Sydney's west 

The 22-year-old will appear at Wyong court on Thursday and will also face charges of aggravated dangerous driving causing death, police pursuit [Skye's Law], and use offensive weapon to avoid apprehension

The man spent the night behind bars at Wyong Police Station and will face Wyong court on Thursday, police said.

He has been charged with manslaughter and a raft of other offences, and is from Waterloo - in Sydney's inner-city.

He was arrested at a home in Gorokan, on the Central Coast on Wednesday afternoon.

Shortly after arriving at Wyong Police Station the man claimed he had a medical issue and was taken to hospital. 

A 23-year-old woman who was a passenger in the stolen Audi appeared in court on Wednesday on drug charges

He was later return to the police station where he was formally charged on Thursday morning.

The charges laid against him include manslaughter, aggravated dangerous driving causing death, police pursuit [Skye's Law], and use offensive weapon to avoid apprehension. 

A critical incident investigation will look at which car involved in the pursuit caused 17-month-old's injuries.

It comes after Katie Tutie, 23, who watched all the tragic drama of the high-speed pursuit unfold from the passenger seat appeared in court on Wednesday.

Tuite was not charged over the chase  but she faced court on a raft of unrelated offences.

Whilst the 22-year-old man remained on the run, Tuite was arrested on the day of the toddler's tragic death.

She was remanded in Darlinghurst, in possession of drugs methamphetamine (ice) and buprenorphine, near where the Audi had been dumped.

Magistrate Les Mabbutt refused her bail application after hearing of Tuite's own reign of terror.

Police prosecutors detailed her own personal crime spree over the past 18 months, including offences ranging from aggravated robbery, serious assault, stealing, possession of housebreaking equipment and providing police with more than 20 false names and information. 

Detectives working on the Constitution Hill case had been pursuing the 22-year-old suspect for a week and arrested him yesterday

Her distraught family have reached out to Tuite, assuring her they still love her and are devastated by the problems that drugs have allegedly brought into her life.

‘I love her so much,' her mother cried in an interview with 9News.

'Katie, don’t ever think I don’t love you,’ her mother pleaded in tears.

Katie’s sister-in-law Samantha said they know there was still a chance the 23-year-old could turn her life around.

'We didn’t want it to be like this, we want her to change her life and start doing good,' she told 9News.

'We all know that she’s got the potential to do it.'

Tuite's mother also cried when explaining how devastated she feels after the tragic death of toddler.

‘I’m so sorry… I wake up in the morning and see those baby’s eyes in my eyes,' she said.

On Wednesday, Tuite, sporting tattoos on her arms and prison greens, appeared by video link at Central Local Court from inside Silverwater Jail, where she will remain until her next court appearance, set down for January 29.

Lawyers for Tuite applied for bail but police prosecutors claimed 'the defendant's record extends over the last 18 months from August 29 last year and since there have been continuous offences. [She] continues to make choices with further undesirable people'.

Magistrate Mabbutt said: 'The range of the offences [she has been charged with] are grave matters, the accused has a length history and has outstanding matters, the offences overall have to be considered serious.

'The accused has a history of violence,' he stated, adding that the offences would most likely lead to 'full-time custody' if she was found guilty.

Magistrate Mabbutt went on to deny Tuite's bail application.
