The Australian Government is set to close the digital divide between the city and the bush by launching rockets and satellites into space to speed up internet connection speeds.

In a first for Australia, the National Broadband Network has announced work is complete on all ten of its ground stations and the the first rocket will be launched in the next few months.  

The first satellite, which is the size of a large four-wheel-drive, will be shot into space from Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, in South America, by Arianespace.

The Australian Government is set to close the digital divide between the city and the bush by launching rockets and satellites into space to speed up the internet connection

The news comes after Australia was recently ranked 44th on a global chart of internet speed in an Akamai report, suggesting schools business and homes in remote areas are falling behind.  

The satellites should ensure internet services to  400,000 Australian homes and 1,600 public buildings including 1,400 schools will be vastly improved.

NBN Co's Satellite Architect, Julia Dickinson told Daily Mail Australia only a handful of these type of satellites have been launched into orbit, and they have all returned excellent results.

The satellites will appear stationary to anyone looking at them from earth, however they will be orbiting about 36,000 kilometres above the equator.

The main body of the satellites is about the size of a small bus or a large four-wheel-drive and the solar panels that extend from then measure about 26 metres - the length of a cricket pitch.

They will provide broadband to about three per cent of Australians, who will have a small dish or antenna on the roof of their home of office.  

'Most of the satellites now are for broadcast activities so these satellites are specifically purpose built for broadband,' Ms Dickinson said. 

'They've all been very successful in the past.' 

The satellites are set to cover the whole of Australia but NBN is targeting the people who live in remote areas.

'We’re expecting to get 100 times faster speed than what people in regional areas are currently experiencing,' she said.

'We’ll ensure these people get access where they haven’t before.'

The rockets took six months to build but the massive satellites, which are some of the largest communication satellites ever built, took over three years to complete. 

Ms Dickinson said the three year process is a lengthy one, which takes a lot of planning and designing.

'They've completed build and they've almost finished their testing and then we have to wait for a launch vehicle availability,' she said. 

'The satellite testing has been really good the we're very happy with the results.'

The team will monitor the whole process from the ground stations located at Bourke, Wolumla, Broken Hill, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Waroona, Roma, Geeveston and Ceduna

The satellites go through a rigorous testing process. They are shaken, vibrated, put in a vacuum, heated and cooled in a simulated environment to see how they will cope in space.

'It survived that really well and the second satellite is testing just as well,' Ms Dickinson said. 

These satellites will be the first launched in the five-year history of NBN.

The company will monitor the satellites from ground stations at Bourke, Wolumla, Broken Hill, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Waroona, Roma, Geeveston and Ceduna.

'Those of us who work in the satellite area have launched satellites before and been involved in satellite builds before,' Ms Dickinson said. 

'It’s obviously very exciting and this project is really interesting because the satellites are specifically built for this and because we know it’s going to make such a difference to people’s lives.'

The next step for NBN is to wait for a launch date, which Ms Dickinson says is very hard to predict due to a number of factors. However, she confirmed that the first satellite is ready to go and it will happen in 2015

NBN Co launched the 'Shoot for the Stars' competition to give Aussie school kids aged 5-12 the opportunity to decorate the nose cone of the rocket which will launch the first satellite into space.

In addition, the grand prize winner and their school will have the opportunity to name the satellite, etching their place in history.
