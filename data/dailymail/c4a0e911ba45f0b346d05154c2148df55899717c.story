A boy with leukaemia has received hundreds of postcards from around the world, after his family had to cancel their holiday plans so he could have chemotherapy.

The family's plea for postcards for Josh Johns went viral and he has been inundated with post from strangers who were touched by his story.

The seven-year-old from Hixon, Staffordshire, was crushed when he found out his summer holiday abroad had been cancelled so he could undergo chemotherapy.

Josh Johns (pictured) has leukaemia and has received hundreds of postcards from around the world, after his family had to cancel their holiday plans so that he could have chemotherapy

In a bid to cheer him up, his father Jason, 43, asked Josh’s uncle, Matthew, to send his son a postcard from his next business trip to America.

Matthew left a post on Facebook asking all his friends to send a postcard to Josh too and this family set up a Facebook page encouraging strangers to send cards too.

Their plea went viral and so far Josh has received almost 700 postcards in just over a week.

He has been sent postcards from six different continents, in dozens of languages and the campaign has even been supported by actors, David Tennant and Robert Downey Jr.

‘We’ve been blown away by the response - Josh is getting more than 50 postcards a day delivered,’ Mr Johns said. ‘Luckily, we have a very understanding postman.

Jason said:'Josh's community nurse said she hasn't seen him so bouncy for a long time. It's definitely helping. Children as young as four have sent him cards, which is lovely.

Lymphoblastic leukaemia is a cancer of the lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cells that fight viral infections.

Symptoms show themselves slowly and become more severe as the number of immature white blood cells in the blood increases.

They include: pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness, having repeated infections over a short space of time and unusual and frequent bleeding.

The disease means that a person’s bone marrow releases large number of immature white blood cells known as blast cells, which rapidly disrupt the normal balance of cells in the blood.

This means that the body does not have enough red blood cells or platelet cells and its white cells are less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses.

Around 650 people in the UK have lymphoblastic leukaemia.

While it is uncommon overall, it's the most common type of cancer to affect children.

Approximately 1 in every 2,000 children will develop it and 85% will be cured.

‘When the first few arrived, we made a little map, and Josh was going to put a sticker on the map where each card came from.

‘But two days later, there were far too many stickers - we’ve just had to put a sticker on each country.

‘Josh’s mother Nikki and I have been completely blown away by how thoughtful people have been.

‘We wanted to take Josh’s mind off his chemo, as it’s fairly nasty, and he has thrown himself into this.’

Josh was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia in March and doctors warned he faced more than three years of treatment to rid his body of the cancer.

‘Since March, Josh has been treated with seven different types of chemotherapy and has spent time in hospital on four different occasions with suspected infections,' his father said.

The programme of intense chemotherapy, which lasts for six months, has left Josh very weak and struggling to walk or write.

Because of ‘particularly intensive block of treatment, we are unable to take him away on holiday,' Ms Johns wrote on the Josh's Facebook page.

'His latest blood test has shown that he is now neutropenic and has no immune system. This means we now have to keep him away from any possible infections...Chances are we will now spend the rest of the summer holidays at home'

To pass the time, Josh reads the messages sent to him from as far away as New Zealand, Australia, America and Japan.

'Josh’s community nurse said she hasn’t seen him so bouncy for a long time. It’s definitely helping,' he continued.

‘Children
 as young as four have sent him cards, which is lovely and a woman in 
America sent him some Dr Seuss books too, which he loved.

'Josh is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world,' his father said. Here he takes delivery of more postcards from the postman

Josh's father hoped that the postcards would take his son's mind of the 'nasty' course of chemotherapy and at first they marked where all the postcards were sent from on a map (pictured left) before more arrived (right)

‘Josh is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world.

‘The way it has taken off has really restored our faith in humanity. When Josh was first diagnosed, we were all devastated. It’s lovely that something like this can come out of something so horrible.

‘He’s had postcards from Leukaemia survivors across the world telling him to keep fighting - it’s been tremendously encouraging.

‘He and his sister Freya, six, are looking forward to taking the postcard collection into school to show their teachers in September - although they’ve had a couple of postcards from members of staff at the school already.’
