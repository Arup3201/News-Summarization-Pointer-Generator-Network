It was a scout at Derby County and a former tennis coach who were among the first people to notice Jonathan Joseph’s dazzling footwork.

His dribbling skills and his speed between the tramlines suggested the new prince of Twickenham could have been equally at home at Wembley or Wimbledon.

‘So long as there was light, Jonathan would be out in the garden with a rugby ball, tennis ball or a football,’ said his father Ivan, who played at outside centre for Northampton between 1982 and 1986. ‘He was one of those kids who could turn his hand to any sport, although there were a few broken windows along the way!’

As a schoolboy in Derbyshire, Joseph’s first passion was tennis. He was offered funding to join the national futures scheme and his mentor, Ashley Broomhead, spotted footwork he believes was superior to a young Andy Murray.

‘Jon would be running lengths of a hard court and he had the ability to slide like Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer,’ said Broomhead. ‘I knew Andy Murray when he was 12 and Jon was the better athlete of the two.’

Joseph’s introduction to rugby came when his father went to pick up his car from Derby Rugby Club on a Sunday morning and discovered an Under 9s team. They went along to training the following week and Ivan began to coach alongside Roxy Fearon and Frank Toman, who was also in charge of Allestree Juniors football club.

‘He took to rugby like a duck to water,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘He was a winger in football on Saturdays and fly-half in rugby on Sundays. With football, Frank always said JJ played better when I was on the touchline. There were occasions when he was a bit lazy unless I gave him a verbal kick up the backside.’

In his early teens, Joseph was offered a place at the Pride Park academy before the family relocated from Derby to Newbury for his father’s work commitments. His younger sister, Hannah, played age-group netball for England, while Jonathan eventually joined the London Irish development team.

Football and rugby took a back seat while Joseph completed GCSEs at Park House School, where the mother of England’s Tom Croft taught IT. He also studied dance, becoming a grade A student.

‘The dance helped him with his rugby,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘Even though he managed to get it all choreographed by a friend who became a professional performer!’

A lack of confidence spotted by both Broomhead and Joseph Snr prompted the family to decide that a private sixth-form education at Millfield School would be best for his sporting talents.

He continued to work closely with London Irish youth coach Justin Bishop amid the realisation that if he was not offered an academy contract he would need a full-time job or to go to university.

‘To start with he wasn’t mentally tough,’ said Bishop. ‘He wasn’t the guy who put his head where it hurts when it was cold or raining. If the lads didn’t perform they would empty the kit out of the freight container, clean it with a toothbrush, and then load it back up. JJ was quite scrawny with a swagger and arrogance that I quite liked.

‘Himself, Marland Yarde and the Watson brothers (Marcus and Anthony) would turn up with their baseball caps on back to front.’

Joseph shared an academy house with Marcus Watson and they were subjected to military-style inspections to ensure cleanliness and discipline. Strict rules were in place after Delon Armitage, a previous academy member, set fire to his billets.

‘We eventually had to split Marcus and JJ up,’ said Bishop. ‘They were good friends but they were both quite laid-back and it was always a case of, “We’ll be there in five minutes, don’t worry”. We had to sit him down and say, “What do you want to do, JJ? Do you want to excel?” We were quite strict with the houses, especially after the incident with Delon!

‘They left some fat in the frying pan and, at training, Delon looked up and said, “That’s our house — it’s on fire!” ’

Joseph eventually settled down and, as well as England age-group honours, went on to break into the senior set-up with London Irish. The footwork spotted by dance teachers began to catch the eye again.

‘If you had to single out one outstanding attribute it was his feet,’ said Bishop. ‘He could double step you and you wouldn’t know which way he was going to go. He also had enormous fingers — we used to call him ET Hands because he could grip the ball in one hand.’

He won six England caps in 2012 and 2013 before he was lured to Bath but his progress slowed and he had to wait almost 20 months before he was recalled for this year’s RBS 6 Nations.

‘Parts of his first season at Bath were mediocre,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘I said, “It looks like six caps are your lot, then?” He said to me, “Dad, it’s all about timing”. With a World Cup coming up maybe he knew what he was talking about.’
