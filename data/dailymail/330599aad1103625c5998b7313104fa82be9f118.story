He follows in the rather large footsteps of notable Defence Ministers of yesteryear, notably James Killen, Kim Beazley, Robert Hill, Robert Ray and Stephen Smith... so just who is Senator David Johnston?

He has had the Defence portfolio for a year now but not much is known about him except, according to his web page, that he's 58, was born in Western Australia, lives in Perth with his wife Toni and three adult children.

Most recently, however, he's been dragged into the debate over whether Australia would deploy troops to Iraq, clearly at odds with the Prime Minister. Tony Abbott will not rule the possibility out, a stance which has irked his Defence Minister.

Name the politicians. Most would be able to name Julie Bishop (Australia's Foreign Minister, second from left) and John Kerry (US Secretary of State, second from right) but who are the other two? Far left is Australia's Defence Minister, David Johnston and far right, US Defence Secretary, Chuck Hagel.

Senator Johnston lists his interests as being cycling, sailing on the Swan River and that he is 'an avid West Coast Eagles supporter' but he also tops a list of little-known or anonymous ministers in the Abbott Government.

There are more than 2 million businesses registered in Australia, Bruce Billson is the Minister for Small Business. He has just over 4000 followers to his Twitter account.

If you think that is a low count for a government minister, then Warren Truss is the Deputy Prime Minister and just 3,500 bother to read his tweets.

Guess who? From left to right: Bruce Billson (Minister for Small Business), Senator Michael Ronaldson (Minister for Veterans Affairs) and Senator Marise Payne (Human Services Minister)

Curiously, the Deputy PM shares the name of a famous type of bridge, the 'Warren Truss' was patented in 1848, it consists of longitudinal and angled cross-members.

Perhaps his greatest claim to fame though is how he came to, bizarrely, rate a mention in the popular TV series 'Lost', a few years back.

In one episode one of the main characters, Sawyer, is challenged over the apparent headbutting of the 'honourable Warren Truss, Minister for Agriculture'.

His Labor counterpart, Anthony Albanese put it bluntly.

'No one knows who Warren Truss is, that's because he's not doing anything,' Mr Albanese said.

He's not the only one suffering from an identity crisis with voters.

Queensland MP Peter Dutton is a former police officer who scored the plum dual roles of Minister for Health and Minister for Sport. He did make a name for himself four years ago though, when he refused to attend parliament for the official apology to the 'Stolen Generation' by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

Belgium-born Senator Mathias Cormann may be well thought of within Coalition ranks but is hardly a household name as Minister for Finance. He visited Perth in 1994 after learning English during a one-year exchange program in England, migrating to WA a short time after.

Little-known Finance Minister Mathias Cormann did come to some prominence when he shared a cigar with Treasurer Joe Hockey after the budget

'Given Joe Hockey's performance this past week, if he's the best they've got it's in the government's interest for people not to know who the ministers are,' Mr Albanese added.

'Perhaps on the other hand, the government should promote some of these no-name ministers,Â  they'd have to be able to do a better job than Joe Hockey, Tony Abbott and the other so-called big names.'

Victorian Senator Michael Ronaldson, 60, is also on the list. He worked as a barrister and solicitor in Ballarat before choosing a political career. He's now the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

Labor MP Anthony Albanese did not mince words, suggesting the 'no-name ministers' should be given a chance to enhance their public credentials because 'they'd do a better job than Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott'

On paper they are three government ministers of note (left to right) Warren Truss (Deputy PM), Peter Dutton (Health Minister) and Mathias Cormann (Finance Minister)

Ben Chifley (1931-32)

Robert Menzies (1939-41)

John Curtin (1941-45)

Malcolm Fraser (1969-71)

James Killen (1975-82)

Kim Beazley (1984-90)

Robert Ray (1990-96)

Robert Hill (2001-06)

Stephen Smith (2010-13)

We know that Marise Payne, who has the Human Services portfolio, has just moved into a newly built home in Mulgoa and 'cooks for therapy'.

David Johnston graduated with a law degree from the University of Western Australia in 1979.

At the same time James Killen was midway through his tenure as one of the longest serving Defence Ministers in Australia's history.

Johnston entered politics as a member of the Senate in 2002 after a career as a barrister.

He had earlier made an unsuccessful bid to enter the House of Representatives during the 1987 election, when the lost Kalgoorlie race to Graeme Campbell.

Johnston had served in the shadow defence role under Malcolm and Tony Abbott from 2010, taking over the ministry when the Coalition won power last year.

Other prominent ministers to have occupied the portfolio include former Labor leader Kim Beazley (1984-1990) and Stephen Smith (2010-2013).
