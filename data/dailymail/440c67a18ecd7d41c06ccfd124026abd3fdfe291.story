Lifetime ban: Gloria Dwomoh, 32, poured liquefied meals down the throat of 10-month-old Diamond

A hospital nurse who force-fed her baby daughter to death is facing a lifetime ban from the profession today

Gloria Dwomoh, 32, poured liquefied meals down the throat of 10-month-old Diamond, despite being warned the practice was dangerous.

The infant contracted pneumonia caused by having food repeatedly forced into her lungs.

Dwomoh was jailed for three years last November after a jury convicted her of causing or allowing Diamond’s death following a three-week trial at the Old Bailey.

The Ghanian national remains a serving prisoner, and is not attending a separate central London hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

At the time of Diamond’s death, Dwomoh had been working for St Thomas’ Hospital, Lambeth, and was later sacked after being convicted in the criminal case.

Nabeel Osman, for the NMC, told a three-member panel Dwomoh deserved to be struck off for her actions.

‘Irrespective of this course of conduct occurring in a domestic environment, this is conduct fundamentally incompatible with being a registered nurse,’ he said.

‘The fact this related to Ms Dwomoh’s own child is an aggravating feature.

‘She ignored proper, considered medical advice and opinion, and continued with her feeding methods despite criticism. That proved to be fatal ten months into Diamond’s short life.

‘It is conduct which doesn’t just fall short of what would have been appropriate in the circumstances, it is in direct contradiction to what would have been expected.

‘There can be no other finding other than one of current impairment [to practice as a nurse], especially in light of the level of criminality that this conduct involved.’

During her original trial, jurors were told Dwomoh fed Diamond from a porcelain jug, a method she insisted was common in her home country.

The baby girl died in hospital at 4.40am on March 3, 2010, after her father noticed she was struggling to breathe.

A post-mortem report revealed tiny pieces of food in her lungs, as well as evidence that she had previously breathed in food and vomit on other occasions.

It emerged that a string of doctors and social workers had previously warned Dwomoh of the dangers of feeding Diamond using the jug.

She came to the UK on a student visa in 2000 and intended to study fashion.

But she qualified as a nurse five years later and has indefinite leave to remain in the country.

Dwomoh, formerly of Walthamstow, east London, has not made any formal submissions to the panel that will decide her fate.

If ruled unfit to practice, she could be struck off.

The hearing continues.
