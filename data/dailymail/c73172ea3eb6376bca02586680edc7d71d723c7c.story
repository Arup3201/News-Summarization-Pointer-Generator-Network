Mario Balotelli didn't have the best of World Cups but he is back in AC Milan colours and took a stroll around New York.

The controversial striker had his trademark blonde mohawk in tact, but taking centre stage were his bright red Puma trainers.

Milan are in the Big Apple for their North American tour, which kicks off in Toronto against Olympicaos.

English eyes will be on their second match on Sunday, which pits them up against Premier League champions Manchester City.

New Rossoneri boss Pippo Inzaghi insists Balotelli will be given a chance to prove himself despite his reputation.

The 40-year-old said: 'Balotelli is a very important player and belongs to Milan. I'll interact with him in the way I do with other players.

'I'll forget everything I've heard about him either in a good or a bad way because I want to get to know people to get the best out of them.'

Inzaghi recently replaced former teammate Clarence Seedorf in charge of Milan but he already has a clear idea of how Balotelli fits in to his plans.

He said: 'The club make the decisions but, for me, Mario is a talented guy who plays for Milan and the national team.

'He should be a second striker because he is the first reference point along with Pazzini. I think we'll stay that way.'
