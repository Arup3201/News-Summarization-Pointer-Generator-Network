Disgraced former Army General David Petraeus reportedly tried to stop a heroic soldier from receiving the Medal of Honor after he fought off 60 Taliban fighters almost single-handedly for seven hours.

Retired Captain William Swenson was awarded the nation's highest honor in October for the 2009 action, but it has now been revealed that Petraeus made calls to have his award downgraded.

A new Pentagon investigation revealed that before his extra marital affair and ensuing resignation, Petraeus suggested that Swenson receive the Distinguished Service Cross rather than the Medal of Honor- effectively bumping his award down to the most prestigious to the second highest award.

Retired Captain William Swenson has spoken of his anger that repeated requests for backup during his seven hour ordeal were ignored by his commanders back at base

McClatchy reports that the inquiry does not specifically name Petraeus but it refers to the 'former commander, USFOR-A,' which was his title at the time in question.

Another murky finding is that Swenson's file that was submitted to the President as part of the Medal of Honor confirmation process was not his original file.

For some unknown reason, Swenson's original file had been swiped clean and the one that was submitted to the President was a duplicate file.

It is believed that Petraeus pushed to have Swenson's award downgraded came after he made repeated complaints to military-higher ups because his calls for back up when a group of Taliban soldiers cornered his group went unanswered for seven hours.

As a result of Swenson's complaints, two Army officers were reprimanded for being 'inadequate and ineffective'.

Swenson believed the judgment of the officers who denied his calls for fire support had been clouded by pressure from headquarters in Kabul, at the time headed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, to restrict the use of artillery in an effort to reduce civilian casualties.

Now Swenson thinks that the military has failed him once more by not specifically naming an individual who has to take responsibility for the botched four-year nomination process.

'An institution can’t heal itself unless it can identify what its weaknesses are, and its weaknesses in this case is an individual,' Swenson told McClatchy.

'The investigation failed to meet the standard of a military investigation in which individuals are identified.

'Behind every single institutional failure, there’s a name.'

After the incident, Swenson decided to leave the Army in February 2011 but has now said he may be considering rejoining.

The attack that earned Swenson, 34, his medal took place in Afghanistan's Ganjgal Valley when he took control when his 
superior officer was injured. He ran through gun fire to rescue his 
injured colleagues out in the exposed open - returning twice more to 
what the military dubs the 'kill zone' to recover the wounded and the 
dead.

According to the official 
military records of the attack, as mortar and AK-47 fire reigned down, 
the roughly 106 men attached to Captain Swenson's group scattered as 
they were ambushed from all sides and surrounded.

The
 column consisted of 106 personnel, which included 60 Afghan National 
Army (ANA), 14 ANA mentors, 30 Afghan Border Police members, and U.S. 
Army Soldiers Capt. William Swenson and Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth 
Westbrook.

'Swenson
 observed enemy fighters to his east, swarming out from the high ground,
 attempting to flank his position. He immediately returned fire, and 
directed and coordinated the response of the ABP and ANA soldiers,' said
 the official narrative from the Department of Defense.

As
 the fierce firefight between the Coalitin forces and the Taliban raged,
 the calls of the wounded began to be heard as it became evident they 
were surrounded.

It
 was during the confused first hours of the battle that Swenson learned 
that his partner Sgt First Class Westbrook had been shot in the upper 
chest and was lying exposed under attack from the Taliban.

Rushing
 to aid his comrade without a second thought and coming under direct 
enemy fire, Swenson fired back and managed to fight his way to his 
friend who was lying near to an abandoned house.
