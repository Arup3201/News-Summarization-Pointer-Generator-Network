A pair of Los Angeles-area men who've claimed to be gang members now fighting in Syria were actually deported to that country because of their criminal background, U.S. authorities have learned.

The men are Nercis Kilajian, was deported to Syria in 2012, and Sarou Madarin, deported to Syria in 2010, according to records provided to reporters by Sgt. Tom Lorenz of the Glendale Police Department.

The pair are both Syrian nationals of Armenian descent, CNN reports.

Gang members: Two men from Los Angeles gangs - 
'Creeper' (left) from the Surenos and 'Wino' (right) from the 
Westside Armenian Power gang - have surfaced in Syria to fight along 
Assad, according to a video online

Bragging: Creeper shows off tattoos showing his allegiance to his gang and greets other gang members

The men are fighting alongside forces loyal to President Bashar Assad, according to reports.

In
 a video posted online, KilajianÂ identifies himself as 'Wino' from the 
Westside Armenian Power gang - found in areas of Los Angeles County 
including Hollywood Boulevard - and Madarian calls himself 'Creeper' from the Sur-13 or Surenos
 - a Hispanic gang with loose links to the Mexican mafia.

Over
 the two-minute clip, the men reveal their gang tattoos and greet fellow
 gang members before grabbing guns and firing at desolate land beneath 
them, claiming they are shooting 'enemigos'.

Throughout the video, they boast that
 they are on the front lines - without revealing much about exactly what
 they are doing or why they are fighting for Assad.

'It's Syria, homie, we're in Syria, homie,' Wino says.

'Still
 puro Surenos putting it down, homie,' Creeper adds. 'In Middle East, 
homie, in Syria, still gangbanging, not giving a f***, homie.'

The men, who are dressed in military gear, then grab machine guns and open fire on the land below.

The video, which contains strong language, was made available on the website of the Middle East Media Research Institute, which is based in Washington.

The Institute identified Wino as Nerses Kilajyan, who poses with various firearms while wearing a military uniform in images on his Facebook page. It indicates he has been in Syria since December 2012. He is also pictured with Creeper and members of the Shiite Hezbollah militia.

'I DO ANYTHINK TO PORTECT MY PPL ONLY MY PPL ALL ARMENIANS AND READY TO DIE FOR MY PPL,' Wino writes on his Facebook.

One researcher at the Middle East Media Research Institute told FoxNews.com that the men are likely receiving money for taking 
part and that they appear to share beliefs with Assad and his fighters.

'He
 seems to be anti-American and pro-Assad,' Green said of Wino. 'He 
probably sees Obama as an enemy, accusing him rightfully or wrongfully 
of arming the rebels.'

Green
 suggested said the MEMRI believes the clip is genuine and that the men are indeed in Syria.

'It seems as authentic as it gets,' Green said, citing the Hezbollah uniform and the weapons in the Facebook profile.

Green added that it is unlikely that 
the men are American citizens; instead the men may have some familial 
ties to Syria or could just be among the Arabs, Europeans and Sunni 
Muslims heading there.

No
 reports have so far confirmed Americans volunteering to fight in Syria 
for Assad; around 50 citizens are believed to have gone to fight 
alongside the rebels.
