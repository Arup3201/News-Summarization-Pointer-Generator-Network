Arsenal forward Theo Walcott believes it is like having new signings at the club as the Gunners continue to welcome first-team stars back from injury.

Walcott scored after just two minutes as Arsenal defeated Brighton 3-2 on Sunday in only his second start following a year on the sidelines with a cruciate ligament injury.

With midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Ozil - who also found the back of the net - also returning to the Gunners first-team in recent weeks after lengthy spells out injured, Walcott believes Arsenal's squad is getting back to it's best.

'To be honest, it's like having new signings,' the 25-year-old told BT Sport after Arsenal secured their passage to the FA Cup fifth round at the Amex Stadium.

'Mesut got his goal and the sharpness will come with games. We have a great squad when everyone is fit. 

Having reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and with Monaco to face in the last 16 of the Champions League, Walcott is confident Arsenal will challenge for trophies. 

'We can compete for anything this year,' said Walcott. 'There is a competition for places and it will be a headache for the manager to pick his best 11.'

After Chelsea, Tottenham and Man City were all knocked out of the FA Cup on Saturday, many believe Arsenal's chances of another Wembley victory have increased.

Should the Gunners go all the way in the competition, Arsene Wenger would become the first manager in the modern era to win the trophy six times.

Asked if it is a personal landmark he is striving for, the Frenchman smiled: 'Well I would love to (win the FA Cup). Let's wait for the draw and go from the next round.'

Meanwhile, Wenger confirmed Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista's switch to the Emirates is expected to be completed on Monday.

Asked of the reports claiming Paulista's deal is all but done, Wenger replied: 'They (reports) are accurate. It is very, very close and it should be done tomorrow.'
