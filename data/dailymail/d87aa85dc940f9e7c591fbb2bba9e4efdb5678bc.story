Everton striker Romelu Lukaku has hit back at Jose Mourinho after the Chelsea manager claimed he wasn't prepared to fight for a first-team spot.

The 21-year-old joined Roberto Martinez's side for a club-record £28million last week when he opted to leave Stamford Bridge  after starting just one Premier League game in a three-year spell.

Mourinho has since gone on record questioning Lukaku's commitment to Chelsea, with the Belgium striker hitting back at the Special One for his comments.

He told the Daily Star: 'I want to develop and become one of the best and the manager wants to make our team one of the best teams in England.

'So to me it was a great challenge to play under him. I need to play at a high level and play in a good team. I'm not saying Chelsea are not a good team but I needed to be in a place where it felt right.

'I have the trust of the supporters. I can grow. I can develop. It almost feels that I belong here. That's why I came back.'

With Mourinho bringing back veteran 
striker Didier Drogba to the club on a one-year deal as well as spending
 £32million on Diego Costa, Lukaku's days at Chelsea looked to be 
numbered with Everton pouncing as a result.

Following successful loan spells at Goodison Park and West Brom over the last couple of years Lukaku will now be hoping this move helps him become one of the leading forwards in the world. 

He added: 'I have a very good relationship with the players and the staff. Everybody who is involved at this football club. So for me this is the place where I belong.

'Expectations for myself are very high and here it is a good environment to develop as a young player. We have a lot of young players in the team who want to work hard and a manger who is ambitious.

'For me it's easy. I just want to improve and get better year after year. Our ambition is to become one of the best in the country. To challenge to be fourth.'
