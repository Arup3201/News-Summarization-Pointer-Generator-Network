Ivory poachers have killed one of Africa’s most iconic and well-loved tusker elephants.

Satao, whose tusks were so long they trailed the ground, was discovered with his face hacked off at Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park.

The behemoth animal had roamed the park for at least 45 years. It is believed he was killed with a single poisoned arrow.

The Tsavo Trust had been monitoring the elephant's movements using aerial reconnaissance for the last 18 months, and thanks to his enormous tucks the beast was ‘easily identifiable’ from the air.

But the technology was not enough to save the iconic beast from the hands of the poachers.

A spokesman said: 'With great sadness, we report the death of Satao, one of Tsavo’s most iconic and well-loved tuskers.

'This magnificent elephant was widely known in Tsavo East National Park, where he was observed with awe by many thousands of Tsavo’s visitors over the years.

'No longer will Tsavo and Kenya benefit from his mighty presence.'

 added: 'The arrow had entered his left flank and he stood no chance of 
survival. We spotted his carcass on 2nd June but to avoid any potential 
false alarms, we first took pains to verify the carcass really was his.

'Today it is with enormous regret that we confirm there is no doubt that Satao is dead, killed by an ivory poacher’s poisoned arrow to feed the seemingly insatiable demand for ivory in far off countries.

'A great life lost so that someone far away can have a trinket on their mantelpiece.'

It comes after authorities announced that  one of Africa's oldest national parks is under attack 'from all fronts,' after 68 elephants have been slaughtered in two months by poachers, some of whom shot them from helicopters.

Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is under constant assault by renegade Congolese soldiers, gunmen from South Sudan and others.

International wildlife regulators say 20,000 elephants were killed in Africa alone in 2013.

The Johannesburg-based African Parks group, which manages Garamba, said since mid-April, the 5,000-square kilometer (1,900-square mile) park has faced an onslaught from several bands of poachers who have already killed 4 percent of its elephants.

About 28 percent of Africa's elephants are in eastern Africa, but most of them - close to 55 percent - are in southern Africa. Some populations of elephants continue to face an immediate threat of local extinction.
