Had this been the Premier League, everyone would have packed up at 0-0 with Tim Howard deservedly hailed a hero.

But the American’s impassable effort had merely granted his Belgian opponents an additional 30 minutes to breach his target – and that they did, twice.

Howard, though, was above criticism, and his numbers told their own story.

For in making 15 saves, the Everton man had set a new World Cup record since such statistics were first collected in 1966. Peru's Ramon Quiroga held the previous best with 13 against Holland in 1978.

It was the best performance from an American goalkeeper since Sylvester Stallone’s exploits in the 1981 film Escape to Victory.

And Howard’s display belonged on the big screen. Only there was to be no fairytale ending, Belgium emerging 2-1 victors after another pulsating affair at these finals. But it mattered not, the 35-year-old had etched his name in the history books.

Seventeen of Belgium’s 39 shots had found the target, only the extra-time efforts of Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku managing to evade Howard; by this juncture, however, his rearguard had tired and the netminder was exposed.

Divock Origi had been thwarted three times, Eden Hazard twice, even defender Jan Vertonghen had been denied on a couple of occasions. He had improvised to use his feet, chest and knees.

Howard’s heat map serves to highlight his red-hot display. He even swept up on the edge of his penalty area – Manuel Neuer style – when called upon.

Ultimately, the only thing Howard couldn't save was the day.
