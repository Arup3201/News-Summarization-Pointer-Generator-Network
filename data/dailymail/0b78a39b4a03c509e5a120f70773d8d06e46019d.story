Three years ago Rachael Johnston was given just 48 hours to live after a four-year battle with anorexia left her weighing a mere 4½ stone.

Her shocking decline was fuelled by an obsession with photo- graphs of super-slim celebrities in glossy magazines.

Now aged 20 and a healthy size eight, she is determined others should not go through her ordeal and is demanding a ban on airbrushed images in magazines and adverts that are aimed at children.

Recovering: Rachel Johnson was put on a drip in hospital after her weight plummeted, left, but having now recovered, right, the 20-year-old is campaigning to have images of super-skinny celebrities banned

An e-petition, launched with her 
mother Lynne, urges the Government to bring in a ban or, failing that, 
they want health warnings on airbrushed photos, similar to those that 
appear on cigarette packets.

Miss Johnston’s descent into anorexia began when, at 13, she started to idolise celebrities and obsess over their figures.

She stuck magazine cuttings inside her
 school locker and compiled motivational scrapbooks which she would pore
 over to prevent herself from eating when she felt hungry.

Desperate to 
achieve a ‘celebrity figure’, she would survive on half an apple every 
two days, and once went without food or water for ten days. 

Miss Johnston of Warrington, Cheshire,
 said: ‘Although airbrushed images didn’t actually cause my eating 
disorder, once I was unwell I would obsess over them.

'It wasn’t until 
later that I realised what an effect these images can have and how they 
affected the things I did or how I felt.

‘Although these glossy magazines 
aren’t actually aimed at under 16s, they still read them. If an image 
has been airbrushed it should say so and which parts of the body have 
been altered.

‘People should be comfortable with who they are and not be ashamed to go out in public no matter how they look.’

Obsession: Rachel started to idolise slim stars when she was younger, including Victoria Beckham, left, and Nicole Richie, right, and began to starve herself in order the get the 'celebrity figure'

Aged 13 in January 2005, Miss Johnston
 was a healthy size 10-12, weighing eight stone, but she made a New 
Year’s resolution to lose weight.

By February 2006, her weight had 
plummeted. She would restrict her food intake at school and on returning
 home, tell her parents she had already eaten. 

The death of her grandmother 
aggravated the illness. She switched to a vegetarian diet and secretly 
did 1,000 sit-ups every morning and evening. She started making herself 
sick after eating and disguised her shrinking frame with baggy clothes.

The first of eight hospital admissions
 over the course of her illness happened in March 2007 when she 
collapsed at home. Speaking of her state of mind at the time, she said: 
‘I was cutting out pictures of models and celebrities and filling 
scrapbooks with them. My obsession at the time was Victoria Beckham. I 
would cut out images of her body and stick my face on the top.

‘I would write underneath, “This is what you have to be – she’s perfect”.

Campaign: Rachael and mother Lynn have started a campaign to get airbrushing banned or at least captioned in magazine images

‘I had them pinned up everywhere. I even took it in the hospital with me and stuck it in the wardrobe.

‘The longest I ever went without food and water was ten days. I don’t know how my body got through it.’

She was re-admitted to hospital for 
five months in February 2009 after her weight plunged to 4½ stone and 
she could only fit into children’s age 9-10 clothing.

Three years on Miss Johnston is 5ft 
4in and a healthy size eight, although she has been left with 
osteoporosis as a result of malnutrition.

Miss Johnston said: ‘I’m still in 
recovery, I have medication for depression and I have a very low immune 
system. I do have osteoporosis in my back and knees, but it’s just a 
case of getting on with it.’

Support: Rachael and mother Lynn need 100,000 signatures on their e-petition in order to get the Government to debate banning airbrushed images or at least having a health warning displayed on them

During her recovery she worked with Beat, an eating disorder charity, and still gives talks to youngsters about her ordeal.

She added: ‘I love pizza and I love 
chocolate. Even when I was really poorly it was something I still liked.
 I’ve got to be in the right mood to be able to eat it. I don’t want to 
feel guilty afterwards. It’s the feelings that I struggle with.’

The e-petition, which requires 100,000
 signatures, calls for the Government to ‘ban airbrushing of all images 
and adverts aimed at children in the UK’, stating that such images ‘give
 a false representation of beauty’ and subject children to ‘completely 
unattainable’ images.
