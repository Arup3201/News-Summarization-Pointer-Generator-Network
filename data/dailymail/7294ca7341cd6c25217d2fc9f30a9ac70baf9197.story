J.Crew customers have accused the retailer of cutting back on shoe quality, while failing to lower prices.

After newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $125 Cece Ballet Flat, which was discontinued in early 2014, had returned last week both in the brand's US and UK stores, customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes.

The blog J.Crew Aficionada pointed out that the ballet flats, still priced at $125 - and an even pricier £125 in the UK - are no longer made in Italy, and customers have described their 'disappointment' on J.Crew's website. 

New CeCe:  After newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $125 Cece Ballet Flat, which was discontinued in early 2014, had returned last week, customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes

A woman from Colorado ordered a pair of her beloved CeCe ballet flats in red leather and said she noticed differences 'immediately'.

'[They are] overly wide at the center, no reinforcing leather strip up the heel, a pieced sole rather than a solid one, 1/2 to 3/4 inch lower at the top of the heel.

'The resulting quality and fit are poor ... excessive width makes them difficult to keep on when walking, the lower-hitting heel results in my heel slipping in and out, the original interior wedge has been replaced with an interior bump at the instep. How disappointing.'

Another customer notes that her new Cleo loafers are no longer made in Italy either; now, they're made in Brazil.

And for one anonymous reviewer who said she 'doesn't care where it's made,' but she does 'care about the quality', the new CeCe flats are unsatisfactory.

Old CeCe: Made in Italy, customers say the original CeCe ballet flat was of much higher quality, and far superior in comfort 

'[They are] not as buttery soft as before and stretches out too easily. It's also cut wider and falls off the back of my feet,' she wrote.

To prove their point, J.Crew Aficionada compared the shoes' old and new descriptions from J.Crew's online store.

'New: We resurrected one of our most popular ballet flats from the J.Crew archives—and for good reason. With a cushioned insole for maximum comfort, a rubber sole for maximum flexibility and an elasticized topline so they hug your feet just so, they feel as good as they look.  Import.

'Old: Beautifully styled in sumptuous suede (from Italy, of course). Our designers deliberated over every detail to ensure our ballets are the most comfortable you'll ever wear, adding more padding, removing the shank and finishing them with an arch-hugging wedge. We think they've nailed it. Made in Italy.'

However a J. Crew representative said the company hasn't changed anything about the shoe.

In fact, the retailer told Daily Mail Online that the new CeCe flat is made with the same last, same sock, same upper, same materials, and same fit – the only difference being, it said, is that  a pull tab in the back of the shoe, which customers said was causing discomfort, was removed.
