With Manchester City still nursing an striker crisis at the club, veteran defender Martin Demichelis put forward a case to play in the makeshift role for the champions after a stunning goal in training.

Demichelis produced something out of the ordinary ahead of his side's FA Cup win against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday, flicking the ball over  team-mate Bacary Sagna before hitting a rasping volley into the net, giving Joe Hart no chance in the goal.

The 34-year-old, who has just three goals to his name since joining City in September 2013, was an unused substitute as his side edged past the Championship opposition to advance to the fourth round of the competition.

With City's striking options still limited early on in the New Year, Demichelis could be considered for such a role in the near future, especially if their striking problems worsen.

Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko remain on the sidelines, with fellow forward Stevan Jovetic only recently returning from an injury lay-off. 

In their absence utility man James Milner played as a false No 9 for a three-game spell, with Manuel Pellegrini's men winning two and drawing one of those fixtures during that time.

Pellegrini's men are currently level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League, with only alphabetical order separating the two sides currently.
