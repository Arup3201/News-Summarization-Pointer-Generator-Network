Microsoft took a fresh pop at Google yesterday, accusing its rival of invading Gmail users' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads.

The attack, the latest volley in Microsoft's Scroogled campaign, comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company's Outlook.com email service.

It follows a series of Scroogled adverts last year which targeted Google's controversial privacy policies.

Scroogled! Microsoft's website to accompany its latest campaign taking a swipe at Google for its policy of scanning Gmail users' emails to target adverts

'Google goes through every Gmail that’s sent or received, looking for keywords so they can target Gmail users with paid ads,' the website says

'And there’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy.'

It also includes a feed of quotes from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt.

These include his infamous declaration that '[i]f you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.'

And also: 'We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are, with your permission; we know where you’ve been, with your permission; we can more or less know what you’re thinking about.'

According to data from a survey by Mozaic group published on the Scroogled micro-site, 71 per cent of people don't know that Gmail and some email services scan the texts of the messages they send and receive to target advertising.

That same survey showed that 87 per cent of Gmail users feel that using the content of their messages in this was is 'an invasion of their privacy'.

'If you’re a Gmail user, Google scans all of your sent and received messages, extracts keywords that they think are relevant to you, and then uses that data to target you with ads,' the website says.

'And if you’re not a Gmail user but have at some point sent an email to someone that uses Gmail, Google has scanned your message, extracted keywords, and used that data to serve ads to the recipient of your email.'

'Invasion of privacy': Microsoft included this example screengrab from a Gmail conversation with the key words and related adverts highlighted to show how Google scans emails to deliver ads

Stefan Weitz, Microsoft's senior director of online services, told MailOnline: 'One of the key things that separates us from Gmail is the fact that we don’t invade your privacy by going through your emails with the express intent of targeting ads.

'Public opinion, at least in the U.S., is very much against this practice. Nearly 70 per cent don’t even know it’s happening and when they do find out, 88 per cent say it should stop.

'This is a pretty staggering statistic.

'In order to help people hear about this issue, we have taken a little more cheeky tone than we normally might.'

Mr Weitz added: 'There are a ton of unanswered questions about Gmail’s practices yet Google continues to mail journos a bland statement about how ads improve the product for consumers.

'Unanswered are how they use information from Gmail scanning to build profiles, how long those live, where that information is used, and more. 

'With all their privacy and choice gaffes over the past year, this is not just some inflammatory campaign to get people over to Outlook.com – it hopefully encourages them to be more transparent about how and what they are doing.

'Most importantly, it will hopefully get them to offer users a choice to opt out of these invasive ads (which they can't) or provide them options to have the ads removed (other than signing up for a Google Apps account which, by the way, still has the ad serving code enabled. Why that is no one is sure.)

'There are real issues here around consumer choice and privacy in email. We think we have an excellent product in Outlook.com.

'We want users to know the difference between what we do and what they do. They scan your private communications to target ads and there is no easy way to opt out. We don’t.'

Very personal: A Microsoft spokesman admitted the company's campaign was 'cheeky' but added that the company had taken that tone to ensure that people are aware of the issues

Some industry observers have argued that Microsoft's aggressive marketing campaign is selective with the truth. For example, the site claims there is now way to opt out of Gmail's targeted advertising, but there is.

Search engine marketing expert Danny Sullivan wrote on the Marketing Land blog: 'Is the campaign fair? I’d say mostly no, but there are some things that Google could do to improve things.'

ITProPortal pointed out that Microsoft's own privacy policies say that the company's services 'may include the display of personalised content and advertising.'

But on the Scroogled site Microsoft claims it only scans email to detect spam and other security related purposes.

'Just like the postal service sorts and scans mail and packages for dangerous explosives and biohazards, Outlook.com scans your mail to help prevent spam, gray mail, phishing scams, viruses, malware,' the site says.

'Microsoft and its email services... do not use the content of customers' private emails, communications, or documents to target advertising.'

Google's privacy policy says it also 'scans the text of Gmail messages in order to filter spam and detect viruses, just as all major webmail services do.'

However, it adds, 'Google also uses this scanning technology to deliver targeted text ads and other related information. This is completely automated and involves no humans.'
