David Cameron will support an attempt to compel Britain by law to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, after his hand was forced by the Liberal Democrats.

At the last election, all three main parties promised to introduce the law, but the Prime Minister quietly ditched the policy following fierce protests from the right of his party.

However, in a move calculated to provoke a damaging Tory split on the issue, Nick Clegg yesterday endorsed a Private Members’ Bill on the 0.7 target – causing the Conservatives to quickly say their party leadership would support the measure in any Commons vote.  

Pressure: David Cameron will support an attempt to compel Britain by law to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid 

The Lib Dems were copying Tory tactics, for Mr Cameron has highlighted Mr Clegg’s opposition to an EU referendum by supporting a private bill to introduce the vote.

There is now the bizarre prospect of a Conservative prime minister speaking in support of the legislation, but backbench MPs being free to try to wreck it.

The Bill will be introduced in September by former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Michael Moore. 

It stands a strong chance of being approved by the Commons even without Tory support, as Labour MPs are expected to back the measure. 

In 2010, Mr Cameron controversially ring-fenced the foreign aid budget from austerity measures hitting other areas – giving it protection only otherwise afforded to the NHS and schools spending.

Official figures show Britain hit the 0.7 per cent target for the first time last year after giving away £11.4 billion. Meeting the target required a 30 per cent increase in the budget.

Mr Cameron has said that hitting the target is his proudest achievement in Government – but many Tory MPs have argued big increases in spending have been unjustifiable at a time of austerity at home.

Conservative MP Peter Bone, a long- standing critic of aid spending, said: ‘Overseas aid should be based on need, not a fixed percentage of GDP.

If the Government is supporting this measure, it should introduce a Government Bill. It would be outrageous to try to bring it in through the back door, and I will be voting against the damn thing.’
