Being circumcised does not affect a man's sex life, a landmark study has revealed.

Australian scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction.

While some studies have previously reported a negative outcome, these were found to have flaws - and their reliability has been called into question by this latest research.

Being circumcised does not affect a man's sex life, a landmark study has revealed. Australian scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction

The most scientifically rigorous studies, however, concluded the circumcision had little, if any, effect.

Lead author of the study, Professor Brian Morris of the University of Sydney, told MailOnline: 'This is a ground-breaking article.

'The health benefits of male
 circumcision have been well documented, including substantially lower 
risks of HIV and other viral and some bacterial sexually transmitted 
infections.

'It also lowers 
rates of penile cancer and possibly prostate cancer - and women whose 
partners are circumcised have lower rates of cervical cancer and 
infections such as HPV and chlamydia.

'However, there is continued concern that circumcision may reduce male sexual function and pleasure.

'Yet the highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction.'

He and his co-researcher John Krieger 
looked at 36 studies totalling 40,473 men - half of were circumcised 
and half were not. Each of the studies was graded in terms of quality, 
according to official guidelines.

Male circumcision prevalence in 2007: Yellow is lower than 20%, orange is 20-80% and red is higher than 80%

The professors found that the very 
high quality studies reported circumcision 'had no overall adverse 
effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, sexual sensation, erectile
 function, premature ejaculation, duration of intercourse, orgasm 
difficulties, sexual satisfaction, pleasure, or pain during 
penetration.'

In contrast, the studies which find negative effects were poor quality, Dr Morris said.

He added: 'The methodology was impeccable - it searched all of the conventional 
publication databases to retrieve all research articles containing 
relevant data. It then ranked these by quality according to the 
conventional guidelines.'

The study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, discusses large studies to back up the findings. 

One high-quality trial of nearly 3,000 
sexually experienced men in Kenya involved them completing a 
questionnaire at six-monthly intervals up to 24 months after they were 
circumcised.

At each time point, there were no significant differences in sexual performance or satisfaction in men who were circumcised and those who weren't.

At 24 months, 99.9 per cent of men were satisfied with their circumcisions. In fact, 72 per cent of men said sensitivity had increased and 19 per cent said it was the same.

Ease of reaching orgasm was greater in 63 per cent and the same in 22 per cent.

Another large trial, involving 2,250 Ugandan men, found no difference in sexual desire or difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection.  A year after circumcision, 99 per cent reported being sexually satisfied. 

However the authors concede that circumcision for medical reasons may be linked with problems in the bedroom.

They mention an Australian study which found that men circumcised after infancy for medical reasons were less likely to want sex.

They say studies which suggested the opposite tended to be lower quality
