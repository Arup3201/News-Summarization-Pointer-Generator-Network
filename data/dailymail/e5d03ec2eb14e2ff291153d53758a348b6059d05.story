Hundreds of birds take a break during a 1000-mile flight by perching on telephone wires and enjoying the morning sunshine, in photos just released by a French nature photographer.

The photos, taken last October, show barn swallows flying over a cemetery in France before settling and taking in the view high above a French cemetery.

These agile birds perched on the wires and stayed there for 30 minutes before heading off as a flock towards Nigeria in Africa.

Barn swallows are shown taking a rest from their migration to Africa last October by relaxing on telephone wires in Poitou in western France. 
The photos have just been released by French nature photographer Cyril Ruoso from Burgundy

Photographer Ruoso travelled to Poitou last October specifically to capture the barn swallows in flight. He set up his camera on top of a seven-metre high tripod to capture the images

The swallows were taking a rest from their migration to in Africa last October by relaxing in Poitou in West France.

Nature photographer Cyril Ruoso, from Lailly in Burgundy, France, travelled to Poitou to capture this moment and had to be careful not to touch the wire.

The 42-year-old said: 'Swallows are gregarious birds, they like to be in pack, especially before they leave for migration.

Four out of the six breeds of barn swallows are classed as 'strongly migratory'.

They can travel from all over Europe and migrate to Africa, Argentina and northern Australia.

Some breeds have been recorded covering up to 11,660 kilometres on their annual migration.

Barn
swallows have been known to travel in flock numbers of a hundred up to a
thousand as they migrate to Africa, Argentina, Australia and other 
countries in the Southern Hemisphere.

There are believed to be around 190 billion barn swallows worldwide

'The young birds are the first to gather.

'Wires are a good option as they are safe against terrestrial predators and they can still communicate between themselves.

'They fly around and are looking for a good location to relax and catch the sun in the morning.

'There are several hundreds of birds on the wire, but when they reach the roosting place in Africa, there could well be several million.'

Barn swallows can live in Europe, Asia, Africa and America and the moment reminded Mr Ruoso of his childhood.

He said: 'It reminds me when I was kid in the French countryside, and I used to watch these birds on my way to school.

'They stayed on their wires for half an hour, enough time for them to enjoy the sunshine.

'But it's sad that every year before they migrate there are less and less swallows on the wires.

Ruoso said this particular breed of barn swallow were heading to Nigeria as part of their annual migration. These birds would have undertaken a journey of around 1,000 miles but other barn swallows have been known to fly over 11,000 miles during migration season

'And in order to capture this moment I have to plan it - you can't do it with regular equipment.

'You
need to need the exact location where the birds might come, and then 
you must set up your camera on the top of a seven-metre high tripod.

'I had to be careful not to touch the wire with the equipment because of the high voltage!'

Ruoso said the birds perched on the four telephone wires in Poitou for around 30 minutes during their migration flight last October before heading off as a flock towards Nigeria.
