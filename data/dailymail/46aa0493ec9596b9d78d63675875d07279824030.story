England and Sri Lanka paid their respects to Phillip Hughes before the start of their second one-day international in Colombo.

Alastair Cook's side joined their Sri Lankan counterparts for a two-minute silence in honour of the Australian batsman, who tragically died aged on Thursday.

Both sides took to the field at the Premadasa Stadium wearing black armbands and both lined up their bats with caps on top as part of a social media campaign paying tribute to Hughes.
