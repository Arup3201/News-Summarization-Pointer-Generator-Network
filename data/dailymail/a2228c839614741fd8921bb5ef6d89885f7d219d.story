Finding your way around a bustling city can be difficult – and it can be even trickier if you suffer from autism.

The condition affects people in a variety of ways, but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills, making tasks such as shopping, asking for directions, planning a route and navigating crowded areas testing.

Now one architecture student has taken a fresh look at town planning in a bid to create more accessible urban environments that are inclusive of people with autism, like her brother.

A planner has  developed a toolkit that helps designers make cities more inclusive for adults with autism. The perfect accessible city (pictured) should have jobs, affordable housing, health and vocational training facilities - all linked by public transport (denoted by symbols), to enable autistic adults to live independently

The U.S.' National Institutes of Health has 
identified six needs for adults with autism:

The new urban toolkit highlights 
these needs and services, which many cities lack.

The perfectly adapted accessible city should have 
jobs, affordable housing, health and vocational training facilities – 
critically, all linked by public transport - to enable autistic adults to
 live independently, Elizabeth Decker, of Kansas State University said.

Ms Decker developed a toolkit for her master's in Landscape Architecture that helps designers and planners make cities more accommodating for adults with autism like her brother Marc.

It centres on an inclusive approach to urban planning by knitting together public transport and services with green areas, markets and housing.

‘Through this project, I really want to understand my brother,’ Ms Decker said.

‘I want to see him go out in the real world and be successful. This project was a way for me to research more about autism and learn more about people like my brother. It helped me figure out how we can design for a group of adults that is getting bigger.’

According to the most recent figures, one in 68 children are diagnosed with autism in the U.S. and around 1 in 100 in the UK. As a generation of diagnosed autistic children ages, it is especially important to find ways to help adults live more independently with the condition.

Inclusive-ville: The most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism-related services. Ms Decker said they should be linked by a simple 'corridor' (pictured) with good public transport to link green areas, housing and civic facilities and that such a corridor could be threaded through existing cities

The National Institute of Health has identified six needs for adults with autism: vocational training, life skills, mental and physical health support, employment, public transportation and affordable housing.

Ms Decker's urban toolkit highlights these needs and services, which many cities lack.

‘Cities can become more usable for individuals with autism when these six needs are met. The toolkit provides a beginning list of implications within these six needs that cities can follow in order to meet the needs for adults with autism,’ she told MailOnline.

Autistic people can find everyday tasks such planning and organising their days, going to the shops and keeping their homes in order challenging, so navigating a crowded city can be difficult.

They often have different 
patterns of thinking and can struggle with activities that involve social 
interaction, such as visiting a shop or asking for directions.

Centres 
offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as 
clearly designed cities and straight-forward transport systems.

Ms Decker’s adviser Katie Kingery-Page, who is an assistant professor of landscape architecture and community planning said: ‘Elizabeth's project is about connecting the dots.

'While many different aspects exist in an urban environment, she is looking at how future planning and design changes can help connect everything in a way that works and is inclusive of a particular group.

'We want to allow people to function fully in an inclusive environment.’

The designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a proposed corridor of autism services, shown in bright pink. Gyms, healthcare facilities, places to buy healthy food, green spaces and affordable housing are marked

Ms Decker said: ‘The most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism-related services. It is not enough to view a city from a few city blocks and suggest placing an affordable apartment complex or park, because in order to develop the inclusive city, one has to view the city as a whole network of services.

To pinpoint the features of cities that make a real difference to people with autism, Ms Decker interviewed adults with various disabilities to better understand their needs.

The adults stressed the urban needs for public transportation, training services and access to health support.

She used Nashville, Tennessee, as a test city for the urban toolkit.

‘Without realising how to connect autism-related services, then the development of the inclusive city is unsuccessful. From my audit of Nashville, I found that proximity to services…and access to public transportation to existing or proposed services, are key components when designing the inclusive city.’

Ms Decker said that in any city, disused areas of land near well-used civic buildings - such as libraries - could be redeveloped to address the physical and health needs of people with autism – as well as the wider community.

Her designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a 'corridor' of autism services.

Ms Decker initially thought that she wouldn’t find services for people with autism in Nashville, but when she overlaid her inventory of needs with existing infrastructure, she found a cluster of useful amenities.

‘The core of downtown Nashville has an active cluster of services - vocational rehabilitation, disability services, etc - and Nashville's farmers' market provides fresh, healthy food,’ Ms Decker said.

She has provided links to healthy food areas, such as farmers’ markets and has recommended placing vocational training facilities near civic buildings.

She proposes preserving and increasing green space in downtown Nashville to offer areas for sensory relief from crowded, chaotic and noisy urban conditions.

Autism affects different people in different ways, but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills.

People with autism have different patterns of thinking and can struggle with sensory experiences, which when combined can make it difficult for an autistic person to live independently.

Everyday actions like getting dressed, preparing food and coping with crowded places can be tough for severely autistic people.

Some people have difficulty planning and organising - and so navigating a sprawling city can be especially difficult.

People with autism can struggle with activities that involve social interaction, such as visiting a shop or asking for direction. Centres offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as clearly designed cities and straight-forward transport.

In her modified city, Ms Decker also addressed employment for adults with autism and marked job opportunities - including craftworkers, service, professional, administrative work - throughout Nashville.

‘My project views cities from a larger perspective and demonstrates that cities lack connection of services for autism,’ she said.

‘It is not enough to view a city within a few blocks and suggest placing a building or park; without seeing the vision of an inclusive city as a whole, the design falls short of successfully connecting the needs of adults with autism.

‘The inclusive city not only provides opportunity for individuals with autism, but also adds another level of health and success to dynamic urban environments for everyone.’

Carol Povey, director of The National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: 'This is an innovative and exciting approach to city planning. In the UK we are increasingly seeing individual buildings - such as hospitals and museums - becoming more autism friendly.

It's encouraging to see that thinking about creating autism-friendly spaces is spreading to the wider canvas of the urban environment.

'The NAS is not surprised to see this has been done by the sister of someone with autism, who understands the difference that an inclusive environment can make - not only for people with autism, but for all of us, allowing everyone to participate fully in urban life.' 

As it is not practical to raze parts of cities to the ground and redesign them from scratch, Ms Decker said that an inclusive city can be ‘threaded though the existing form and space of the urban hub.

‘Trying to design an entire city in one master plan is unrealistic.

'Cities are meant to develop themselves, because the goal for a city is to be diverse…In order for any city to begin to be inclusive, it is necessary to determine what the existing services are and what is needed. From there, proposals for connections can be determined,’ she added.
