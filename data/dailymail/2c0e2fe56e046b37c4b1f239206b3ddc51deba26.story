A Tory councillor was condemned as ‘egotistical’ and ‘arrogant’ yesterday for naming a park after his son without permission.

Andre Gonzalez De Savage had the sign declaring the land ‘Adam’s Park’ erected after helping to arrange play equipment for it.

Last week council officials discovered that he did not have permission to rename  the land and had the sign taken down at  the weekend.

A defiant Mr Gonzalez De Savage said 
he was ‘very annoyed’, insisting that the honour was deserved as his 
eight-year-old son Adam had been a member of a council ‘planning team’ 
working on the park in East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire.

But John McGhee, Labour leader at 
Northamptonshire County Council, said: ‘It just shows you the arrogance 
of the Tories. I’m not surprised, but I am disappointed. It’s arrogant.’

He added: ‘I believe that for someone to have something named after them, they should have done long service.

‘If he has just named it because he 
can, when there’s so many volunteers who have gone unnoticed, then it’s 
absolutely egotistical. I’m surprised at Councillor Gonzalez De Savage.

‘It’s no wonder councillors get a bad name when they do things like this – we all get tarred with the same brush.’

He suggested that the park should have
been named by  the community, for example through a competition at 
local schools. ‘No individual should be able to make that decision,’ 
said Mr McGhee.

A resident who lives near the park added: ‘We were all a  bit surprised when the name went up.

'Adam's Park': The councillor did not seek permission to name the public park after his son

‘I think it was just a case of a councillor who likes everyone to know who he is and what he has done. It’s pathetic.’

But Mr Gonzalez De Savage, a cabinet member for Northamptonshire County Council, yesterday defended his actions.

He said his son Adam was part of a 
local youth council that helped choose play equipment for the run-down 
park’s opening in 2011. The father of three, who hails from Barcelona in
Spain, said he had used £3,525 of  his council funding allocation to 
buy play equipment for the park and the sign.

‘There was no equipment in the park, so the local youth council did research on the equipment they wanted,’ he said.

‘My son was part of that planning team
and the group decided to call it Adam’s Park after  him. It was quite 
nice of them  to do that, and I said I would  not object.’

Demanding that the sign be put back 
up, he added: ‘I’m very annoyed. I invested in that park when there was 
no play equipment there.’ A spokesman for the council said: ‘There was 
an unauthorised sign put up in the park which has now been removed. We 
have got no record of consent ever being given for any such sign to be 
put up in this park.’

It added that Mr Gonzalez De Savage ‘is welcome to collect it if he wishes’.
