Two female students have outraged the families of 9/11 victims by entering a nightclub fancy dress competition dressed as the Twin Towers being hit by planes.

Amber Langford and Annie Collinge, both 19, won the contest and a £150 prize at a Chester nightclub despite lampooning the worst terrorist attack in modern history.

Today, families of those who lost loved ones in the New York terror attack said that they found the costumes distressing.

Patricia Bingley, 79, whose 43-year-old 
son Kevin Dennis died in the atrocity said: 'It's hard to understand 
where they've come from to do this.'

Mr Dennis was working as a bond trader on the 101st floor of the North Tower when a plane struck the skyscraper on September 11, 2001.

Their actions have also enraged Miss 
Langford's father Martin, a pilot who was working in the US for United 
Express on the day Al Qaeda brought down the World Trade Center and 
killed 2,996 people, including 67 Britons.

'I didn't know anything about it, but I'm not happy at all,' the retired pilot, who now lives in Anglesey, told The Sun.

'She knows I'm a pilot and that's not cool at all. We will be having a little chat, I think.'

Miss Langford, who is studying biology at the University of Chester,
 and Miss Collinge, a criminology student, wore the outfits to a Halloween event at Rosies nightclub last Thursday evening.

They had modelled their costumes on the North and South Tower wreathed in flames and with victims jumping from windows. Both women also wore hats topped with the wreckage of the planes and U.S. flags.

The widow of a 9/11 victim living near Chester said she was 'angry and disgusted' at the girls' outfit and suggested that they were ignorant about the true horror of the terror attack.

Liz Gilligan, whose husband Ron was working in the World Trade Center at the time of the atrocity, told the Chester Chronicle: 'I can't begin to tell you how angry and disgusted I am.

'These girls and Rosie’s need to be made aware that 9/11 was very real and while it was 3,000 miles away, it affected people on their doorstep.'

Some clubbers were so disgusted that they tried to complain to management.

'I
 was completely outraged,' said 20-year-old George Borsberry. 'Not only 
were they labelled the "best dressed", but they were also given £150 to 
dress up in this way and mock the victims and the families of the 
victims.

'We asked to see the manager to complain and was turned down due to him being "too busy" to see us.

'After
 waiting two and a half hours to see the person who decided this 
dreadful winner all we got was, "Sorry but it was a good costume."

'He
 then had the audacity to say there were people in other disgusting 
costumes such as Jimmy Savile, as if to justify that it was alright to 
dress like that.'

Others took to the club's Facebook page to vent their anger about the decision to give the teenagers a prize for their outfits.

Ashley Goodall wrote: 'That's not even Halloween that's just a very bad joke, not like you'd walk around America like that.'

Millie Robinson tweeted: 'Can not actually believe that some people went as the Twin Towers blowing up on Halloween.'

John
 Feal, founder of the FealGood Foundation which supports 9/11 victims' 
families, told The Sun: 'The insensitivity level for this act of 
ignorance is topped by none.

'As for the nightclub who allowed it, sponsored it and endorsed it, shame on you.'

The
 pair at the centre of the storm said last night: 'We never meant to be 
offensive, but we apologise if any offence was caused.

'The idea was to depict a modern-day horror that happened in our lifetime and was not intended as a joke.'

The University of Chester and Chester Students' Union said in a statement: 'We utterly condemn the appalling photos.

'Both organisations have begun an urgent investigation with a view to taking the necessary action.'

American political commentator Charlie Wolf, a right-wing broadcaster who has used to present a regular show on TalkSPORT, called the outfits 'shameful and disgusting'.

Sarah Rappaport, an American TV 
producer working for CNBC in London, tweeted: 'Don't get how anyone could think 
dressing as the Twin Towers for a party woul be remotely okay or 
appropriate.'

Another 
American, commenting on a news story about the costumes, wrote: 'Just 
sickening. They owe all the families an apology. And our country.'

Home: Miss Langford lives with her family at this house in Menai Bridge, Anglesey

Miss
 Langford is from Menai Bridge, a small town on Anglesey, where she 
lives with her pilot father, her mother Marion and sister Freya, 22, a 
student at the University of Derby.

Their family home has three garages and a large garden overlooking the Anglesey countryside.

Miss
 Collinge was brought up on a dairy farm in Clitheroe, Lancashire, with 
her father Bryan, mother Carol, sister Katie, 22, and 24-year-old 
brother Tom.

She is vice-president of the university 'People and Planet 
Society', which says it is aimed at students who 'want to make a 
positive difference to the world they're living in'.

Apology: The company which owns Rosies said it was 'extremely concerned' about the competition

Atrocity: Thousands died when terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001

A spokesman for the Stonegate Pub 
Company, which runs Rosies, said: 'We are extremely concerned that an 
award of vouchers was made to two young women who were dressed in a 
distasteful and offensive manner.

'There
 was a serious error of judgement made on the evening by a contracted DJ
 to award such a prize and we apologise to anybody who may have been 
upset or offended by this.

'A full investigation by the company is taking place.'
