The NHS will today be warned it must save up to £10billion a year by cutting down on expensive agency staff and selling off land.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will tell NHS managers they need to spend money more efficiently to ensure the service is sustainable and improve frontline care.

In a speech to think-tank The King’s Fund, he will set out measures that could save up to £10billion a year by 2020.

‘If we are to be truly financially sustainable we need to rethink how we spend money in a much more fundamental way,’ he will say.

Mr Hunt will say reducing ‘avoidable harm’ to patients will save £2.5billion a year from the cost of further treatment and negligence claims, while minimising prescription errors could save £551million.

Better acquisition of services and goods could also deliver £1.5billion of savings on the £15billion annual NHS procurement budget by next year.

He will insist that private agency staff bills – which have increased by £1billion to almost £2.5billion – must come down, while NHS trusts will also be challenged to sell off surplus land and estates.

The total value of surplus NHS estate is estimated to be worth £1.5billion in London alone.

The Health Secretary will also restate his determination to claw back money from ‘health tourists’ – visitors and migrants who access non-emergency care.

A list of 25 drugs – which includes six breast cancer drugs and Jevtana used in prostate cancer – has been posted for ‘re-evaluation’ next month by the Cancer Drugs Fund, with a decision due in the New Year.

Existing patients would continue to be treated, but new patients may have to appeal to get drugs that are currently approved.
