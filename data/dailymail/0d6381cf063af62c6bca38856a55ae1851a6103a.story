A 14-year-old boy has been left in a coma after a cornice from the Galleria Umberto in Naples, Italy, fell and hit him as he was walking below.

Salvatore Giordano was walking on Toledo Street - a road in the historic city centre - on Saturday evening with a group of friends when a fixture broke off from the building.

He was taken to the city's Loreto Mare Hospital, where he remains in a coma.

Collapse: A cornice at the Galleria Umberto in Naples, crumbled away from above the archway and on to Salvatore Giordano, who was walking on Toledo Street below

Hazard: Firefighters have since secured the crumbling facade. Local officials said it is still unclear who was responsible for the crumbling part of the building that fell and injured Salvatore

Rubble: Pieces of stone remain on the street next to where Salvatore was hit on Saturday. The 14-year-old remains in a coma in a Naples hospital

Fragile: A passer-by points at the top of the Galleria Umberto, where the cornice fell from. The facade had reportedly crumbled in the days before Salvatore was injured

It has been reported that the boy sustained head and lung injuries as a result of the accident.

Salvatore's family, from Marano, a town on the outskirts of Naples, have asked for privacy while the teenager is in hospital.

Police in Naples are investigating who was responsible for maintaining the cornice that collapsed.

They are also looking into claims that other pieces had fallen from the 
building, built between 1887-1891, in the days before the accident.Â 

Yesterday, Luigi Merola, an Italian priest and writer known for his close ties with the community said that someone will have to take responsibility for what happened. He asked that those in the local community prayed for his recovery.

After the accident, firefighters cordoned off an area of the road to ensure no one else was injured. It has been reported that there were others taken to hospital.

Closed: Red tape keeps a young boy away from the crumbling wall. The road outside the Galleria Umberto will remain closed until the police investigation into the accident has concluded

Cordoned-off: Firefighters and police officers inspect the scene where the cornice fell - on a popular shopping street in Naples historic city centre

Recovery: A firetruck arrives on scene. Salvatore was taken to Loreto Mare hospital after sustaining injuries to his head and lungs. He remains there in a coma

Popular: A view looking out from inside the Galleria Umberto. The partial collapse of the front of the landmark, built between 1887-1891, has prompted a debate on the maintenance of the city's other historic buildings

Speaking to journalists outside the hospital yesterday, Angel Liccardo, mayor of Marano, said that the boy's condition had deteriorated further.

One of Salvatore's teachers, Simioli Guild, who visited the boy, saying he was 'astonished' at what had happened, one Spanish newspaper reported.

Local officials told Spanish reporters that the accident had drawn attention to the maintenance that needs to be carried out on more of Naples aging buildings and urged that more money be allocated to such projects.
