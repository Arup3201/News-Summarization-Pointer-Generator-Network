The Ukrainian parliament has renounced Ukraine's 'non-aligned' status with the aim of
eventually joining NATO - a move angering Moscow which views the Western
alliance's eastward expansion as a threat to its own security.

Kiev first announced its intention of seeking the protection
of NATO membership in August following what it deemed the open
participation of Russia's military during the separatist war in its eastern provinces.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Ukraine's
renunciation of its neutral military and political status a
'counterproductive' step that would only boost tensions around
the crisis in the east.

'It will only escalate the confrontation and creates the
illusion that it is possible to resolve Ukraine's deep internal
crisis by passing such laws,' TASS news agency quoted him as
saying.

Addressing deputies in Kiev before the vote, Ukrainian
Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said the move underscored the
country's determination to pivot towards Europe and the West.

'This will lead to integration in the European and the
Euro-Atlantic space,' he said.

The amendment passed easily, receiving 303 votes, 77 more
than the minimum required to pass into law.

Any accession to the Western military alliance is likely to
take years, but a NATO spokesman in Brussels said: 'Our door is
open and Ukraine will become a member of NATO if it so requests
and fulfils the standards and adheres to the necessary
principles.'

Ties between Moscow and Kiev are at an all-time low since
Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in
March and the subsequent outbreak of the pro-Russian rebellion
in the east.

The pro-Western authorities in Kiev accuse Russia of
orchestrating and arming the uprising after the overthrow of a
Ukrainian president sympathetic to Moscow.

The Kremlin denies
that it is behind the revolt.
