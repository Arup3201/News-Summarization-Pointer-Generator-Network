A woman who arranged  for her 13-year-old daughter’s boyfriend to be killed after he posted topless  pictures of her online wept yesterday as she was jailed for seven years.

Gedu Bibi, 47, was furious after discovering that Sumon Miah, 21, had brought shame on her family.

She lured him to their home, where he was hit over the head with a table leg ‘to teach him a lesson’, the Old Bailey heard.

seven years yesterday for luring her 13-year-old daughter's boyfriend Sumon 
Miah, right, to her home in Walthamstow where he was killed

Bibi then tried to frame her daughter, Shuhina Khanam, for the murder by wiping the table leg clean and thrusting it into the girl’s hands.

She ordered Shuhina to tell police she had hit Miah in self-defence after he lunged at her with a knife. Her 12-year-old son, Fhalak, was also made to back up the story.

Although the killer has never been found, Bibi’s lawyer yesterday suggested that it was her estranged husband, Angur Miah, to whom the victim was not related.

The court heard that Angur –  who was arrested but never charged – fled to Bangladesh, leaving his wife and five children.

He has since taken a ‘very young’ girl as his second wife and is ‘enjoying life’.

Bibi, who was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter  and perverting the course of  justice, sobbed as she was told she would serve at least three and a half years.

Judge Gerald Gordon said her actions meant that ‘the person striking the blow has never been brought to justice’. The court  heard Shuhina first met Miah at  the hospital where he worked  as a porter.

They had a ‘fairly brief’ relationship, which Shuhina ended some time before the killing.

Four days before the attack, Bibi was shown four lewd photos of her daughter that Miah had  apparently posted on the internet.

The photographs showed the girl naked from the waist up.

In her fury, Bibi is said to have told ‘someone else’ to bludgeon Miah to death on her behalf.

After the attack on October 8, 2006, Miah fell into a coma and died nine days later from brain damage.

The photographs of Shuhina were still on his phone when it was examined by police.

Shuhina later told police that Miah had threatened her with a knife and she had hit him with the table leg in self defence.

However, police found only her fingerprints on the knife and there was no blood or hairs on the table leg.

Prosecutors say Bibi managed to ‘hoodwink’ the police for years  with her story, and the case was closed two years later.

But fresh information emerged in 2010 which led to Bibi and her friend, 49-year-old cafe owner Lilu Miah, being charged with murder.

He was arrested after a former friend, Monor Uddin, contacted police to say the cafe owner had confessed his involvement to him.

Although Lilu, of Forest Gate, East London, was cleared of  murder and manslaughter, he was jailed for two years for perverting the cause of justice by conspiring with his nephew to construct a false alibi.

The defence said Bibi, of Walthamstow, North East London, was of ‘good character’ and ‘full of remorse’.
