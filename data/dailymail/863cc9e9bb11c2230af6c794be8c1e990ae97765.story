Heather Mack, 19, cradled her growing baby bump as she learned she would stand trial over the murder of her socialite mother on Bali

A heavily pregnant American teenager tenderly cradled her growing baby bump as she was told she will face trial over the murder of her socialite mother on the resort island of Bali.

Heather Mack,19,  who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and stuffing her body in a suitcase.

The young lovers will face a firing squad if they are found guilty.

Mack appeared drained as three judges rejected a last ditch attempt by the Chicago couples' defence teams to have the case thrown out.

They had  claim that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar.

The case is now set to resume later this week.

'The indictment is fully qualified both formally and materially according to the law,' said presiding judges Made Suweda. 

'Therefore, the defence objections are rejected.'  

Dressed in matching  white shirts, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at the District Court.

Miss Mack's bulging baby bump was clearly visible. 

The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials.

They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua.

The accused are being tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court.

Prosecutors charged them with premeditated murder, which carries a maximum penalty of death.

Their lawyers argued earlier that inaccuracies in the indictment could lead to multiple interpretations of the suspects' activities and the crime scene, raising questions of whether other people had entered the victim's room and killed her.

They also objected to the citing of communications between the defendants on their mobile phones as evidence of premeditated murder, arguing that they are prone to manipulation.

Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach.

Both defendants sat quietly as the decision to proceed with the trials was read out by judges.

Unlike previous hearings, Schaefer did not dissolve into tears

In their indictment, prosecutors said the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship, and that Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali.

It said that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle.

Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, the indictment said. 

They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did.
