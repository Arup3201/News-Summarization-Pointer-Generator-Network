As the battle for America's eyeballs heats up, theater chain AMC has announced a $600 million plan to install plush recliners in movie houses to lure viewers out of their living rooms.

America's second largest theater company will remove up to 70 traditional seats to make way for fewer fully reclining Lay-Z-Boys in about 1,800 auditoriums.

While analysts say AMC could lose customers by reducing the number of seats, chief executive Gerry Lopez insists the changes will attract more patrons seeking a luxurious movie experience.

The bold five-year plan comes amid growing competition from video-on-demand streaming services such as Netflix, which boast cheaper monthly subscriptions than a single movie ticket.

Wall Street Journal reported AMC, which went public last December, will spend $350,000 to $500,000 to 'reseat' each theater, with landlords bearing some of the cost.

Lopez told WSJ that attendance has soared by 80 percent in the 37 AMC theaters which have already been reseated, even though they've lost about two-thirds of seating capacity.

He added that box office revenue was up more than 
60 percent in those theaters, showing that quality over quantity will improve AMC's turnover.

While industry analyst Eric Wold from B. Riley & Co told WSJ the move 'doesn't conceptually make sense', he admitted the attendance data was encouraging.

'There are no more bodies coming through
 the door,' Wold said. 'So you have to find something to get them to
 come back more often or pay more.'

Lopez, who joined AMC in 2009, said the jump in attendance at 'reseated' theaters was partly due to their full dine-in capabilities, offering patrons a substantial food-and-drink menu allowing moviegoers to 
consolidate their evening activities.

The former Starbucks executive said customers paying premium for cushy seats wouldn't tolerate poor food choices or inadequate bathroom facilities.

'If we're going to do this, we do the full monty,' he told WSJ.

In addition, he expects the reseated theaters will attract more midweek audiences than normal theaters, and draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teenagers or young children.
