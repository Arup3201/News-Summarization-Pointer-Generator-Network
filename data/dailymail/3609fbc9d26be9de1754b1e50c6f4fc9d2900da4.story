Philippe Senderos has heard all the snide comments down the years – but believes since his summer move to Aston Villa he’s now hitting the peak of his performance.

The 29-year-old Swiss international centre half has had a career that has seen him play in three World Cups as well as the top Leagues in England, Spain and Italy.

Yet he’s never quite shaken off the reputation from his early Arsenal days which saw some cruel fans dub him ‘Ponderos’.

Philippe Senderos has shrugged off his early critics as the defender believes he's on form at Aston Villa

Senderos will resume a promising partnership with skipper Ron Vlaar at Queens Park Rangers on Monday night and says he’s worked out that the only critic who matters is himself.

He said: ‘I think every player at our level deserves respect and credit for what they do – you cannot get to the Premier League and stay there for a long time without hard work and dedication.

‘Maybe when I was younger these things would worry me, but now I know what I have done in my career so I don’t let other people’s opinions affect my performances.

‘It isn’t about my pride, or needing to get praise to feel good about myself.

‘I know what I am on the pitch. I know what I am good at and what I have to work on. Nobody is ever the finished article, but you need hunger to get better and to give your maximum and I have got that.’

That attitude has shown in his performances since returning to the Premier League after a spell in Spain with Valencia and Senderos, who speaks five languages, has established an instant rapport with Vlaar.

Villa conceded only one goal in the three games they played before the Dutch World Cup star got injured and Senderos says he’s looking forward to resuming the partnership at the heart of defence.

He said: ‘We hit it off immediately – outside football we have the same mentality and on the pitch we are very similar too.

‘These things sometimes just click. We don’t need to talk too much to know 100 per cent what the other is thinking.

‘Ron is right up there with the best defenders – a top, top player. He was one of the best at the World Cup and is one of the best in the Premier League.

‘We’ve had a tough run of games, but we have to remember what we did well at the start of the season and maintain the belief.’
