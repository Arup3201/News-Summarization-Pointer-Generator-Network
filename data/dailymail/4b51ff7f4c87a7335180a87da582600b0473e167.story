Just weeks after publicly claiming that former first lady Hillary Clinton was waging a 'war on women' by enabling her husband's philandering ways, the aide who accused the former president of groping her in the White House has penned an article for a far-right-wing blog under the headline 'America Deserves Better Than the Clintons.'

Kathleen Willey was a Democratic fundraiser volunteering in the White House during Bill Clinton's presidency who claims the former president kissed and groped her inside a private study off of the Oval Office.

Now, with a potential presidential run by Hillary Clinton in the works, Willey has resurfaced to warn the American public about the 'dysfunctional' former first family.

Kathleen Willey accused former President Bill Clinton of sexually harassing her. Now she says America 'deserves better' than another Clinton presidency

The basis for much of Willey's latest criticism of the Clintons stems from Hillary Clinton's handling of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the deaths of four Americans, including ambassador Chris Stevens.

'The last time we saw Hillary Clinton as 
our secretary of state, she was testifying before a congressional 
committee about Benghazi,' Willey writes in the column published on WND.com. 'During that meeting on Jan. 22, 2013, we heard
 her shriek, “What difference does it make?"

'Earlier, right 
before one of the presidential debates, on Oct. 15, 2012, Hillary stated
 during a series of interviews that she, as secretary of state, was 
responsible for the security of the embassy staff. “The buck stops 
here.”

'I remember being so surprised when I heard it, but I was immediately suspicious,' Willey concludes. 

Willey qualifies her shock by claiming that 'taking responsibility for anything is rare' for the Clintons.

She goes on to say the former secretary of state knows more than she's willing to reveal about the Benghazi attack.

'If it is revealed 
that she played a major part in the demise of our four patriots, as we 
suspect she did, she might want to consider retreating from public life 
once and for all and, together with her husband, play the role of senior
 stateswoman,' she writes.

Willey concludes her commentary by simply stating that 'we deserve better' than the Clintons.

In February, Willey made claims that when she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton orchestrated a series of investigations designed to discredit the many women who have claimed her husband sexually assaulted them

'The point is what this woman is capable of doing to other women while she's running a campaign, basically, on women's issues,' she said. 'It just doesn't make any sense.'

'She single-handedly orchestrated every one of the investigations of all these women.'

Willey said the president groped her after she approached him for a paying job in the White House instead of her volunteer position

Willey (L) and Juanita Broddrick (R) both claim Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them. Broddrick's allegations include her insistence that the former president raped her in 1978, but she has changed her story several times

Kathleen Willey describes a 1990s Clinton White House where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations

She suspects Hillary Clinton of covering up 'nothing short of serious sexual harassment' in her case.

And addressing claims by some Democrats that Republican politicians are conducting a so-called 'war on women' through their social policies, Willey turned the notion on its head.

'Hillary Clinton is the war on women, and that's what needs to be exposed here!' she exclaimed.

WND.com first reported that Willey told WABC host Aaron Klein that Mrs. Clinton is 'addicted to power, and she saw early on that [Bill] could be a powerful candidate. He had a lot of charisma. And she could just ride on his coattails.'

Talking about the her allegations against Bill Clinton, she reiterated Sunday that 'the president sexually assaulted me,' leading her to 'the little room where he and Monica [Lewinsky] used to meet.'

'I started to go for the door and he was right behind me,' she recalled, 'and things went from bad to worse there. He acted just very inappropriately. He just did. I was shocked and bewildered, and I thought to myself, "What in the world is he doing?"'

Willey claims Bill Clinton, an old friend whose Virginia campaign organization she and her husband founded, 'was very intense. He's big. He's much bigger than I am.'

Following Willey's news-making allegations in 1998 on the CBS program 60 Minutes, the Clinton White House released a series of letters and phone messages, sent after the alleged 1993 sexual harassment, which seemed to show Willey had a friendly outlook toward the president, and wanted more contact – not less.

A federal judge later ruled that President Clinton had 'committed a criminal violation' of the Privacy Act by making her letters public. He was not prosecuted for it.

And Linda Tripp, a one-time friend of Clinton paramour Monica Lewinsky, testified in a grand jury proceeding that Willey pursued Clinton, and not the other way around.

But Willey maintains that she was a victim, and has even claimed the Clintons had her second husband murdered on November 29, 1993, the same day the president allegedly forced himself on her.

The death was ruled a suicide, but she said Sunday that twenty years later government agencies refuse to let her see files detailing the investigation.

Willey was a prolific Democratic fundraiser who co-founded Virginians for Clinton to help get him elected, but she would later turn on him after what she says was a sexual assault near the Oval Office

The botched Benghazi terror-attack aftermath isn't the only hurdle between Hillary Clinton and the White House: Foreign powers may believe she can be deceived and fooled because her husband was a serial cheater

Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, an all-but-certain presidential contender, said in January that although Bill Clinton's presidency was marked by 'predatory behavior, it's not fair to blame his wife for letting it continue.

'It’s not Hillary's fault,' he told Vogue magazine, 'but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history ... sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other.'

Willey had no problem focusing her venom on Hillary, though. It's her likely presidential candidacy that's bringing the former president's sexual flings back into the news.

'Just pack your bags. You’ve had your 15 minutes,' she slapped at Hillary. 'Stop forcing us to have to look at this stuff again. We're sick of it.'

But Willey also had harsh words for feminist groups that seem insistent on making Mrs. Clinton the first female U.S. president.

'All of these women's groups, they're all pro-Hillary,' she said. 'They need to ... talk to someone like me and listen here, what Hillary Clinton has done to me and many, many, many other women.'

'They are so hypocritical, it's unbelievable,' she claimed. 'And this is the woman that wants to be president.'
