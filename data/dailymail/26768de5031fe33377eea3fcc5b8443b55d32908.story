The remains of over 400 Red Army soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War will finally be returned to China for burial - 60 years after the end of the conflict.

These extraordinary pictures show Chinese government officials observing the remains of 437 Chinese soldiers at a cemetery in Paju, South Korea - all of whom were killed in the Korean War.

Communist China sent troops to fight alongside North Korean soldiers during the 1950-53 conflict - which was the primary result of the political division of the country following the Second World War.

The remains of the men, pictured, along with their helmets, ID papers and personal belongings were placed into coffins this afternoon and will now return to China

They fought against the South Korean army which was 
backed by the United States and other Western powers. 

Thousands of men from The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) perished on the Korean Peninsula during the war -  which ended in armistice following two years of negotiations.

Chinese troops were lumbered with poor military equipment and suffered from serious logistical problems - meaning a large number of men were lost during the conflict.

Some argue the conflict has never truly been resolved, however - especially following a series of incursions and acts of aggression from the North.

Today, the remains - as well as the soldier's clothes, helmets and other personal belongings - were put in coffins ahead of their planned repatriation to China.

About 55 men had their identification records attached to them.

Seoul and Beijing made an agreement in 2013 to return the Chinese soldiers' bodies which have been buried in the Paju cemetery for many years.

It came after Park Geun-hye, South Korean president, visited China in June last year.

The removal of the bodies began in 
December last year - with the process taking several months as the 
skeletons needed to be cleaned and dried.

Both South Korean and Chinese officials attended the coffin ceremony today  in Paju, a town near the demilitarized zone with North Korea.

An agreement was made to return the remains last year following the South Korean president's visit to China

Li Guiguang, an official from China's ministry of civil affair, told People Daily: 'We want to express our deep gratitude 
to South Korean government and all the people who have contributed to 
the return of the remains of Chinese soldiers.'

He say the ceremony marked a good day in terms of relations between the two sides

'The return of Chinese soldiers' remains was a milestone of healing the wounds of war both countries suffered,' Moon Sang Gyun, an official from South Korean defense ministry, added.

The bodies are not the first to be returned to China. It is thought 43 remains of Chinese soldiers have been returned via the United Nations Military Armistice Commission since 1981.

The Korean War was a conflict between the Republic of Korea  - now South Korea - who were backed by the United Nations, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  - now North Korea - supported at points by China and the Soviet Union.

It was the result, primarily at least, of Korea's division following the Second World War.

The Korean Peninsula was ruled by Japan from 1910 until 1945. Following the country's surrender in September of that year - officials from the US cut up the peninsula along the 38th parallel.

The US occupied the southern area and Soviet forces took the north.

The sense of division between the two areas was intensified when, in 1948, the North established a communist government and the south, a right-wing ruling system.

Over time, the 38th parallel became an increasingly political border - with negotiations following the war for reunification of the two areas causing more tension than solutions.

On June 25 1950 open warfare began when North Korean forces invaded the south.

The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution shortly afterwards authorising military intervention.

The US provided a vast majority of the soldiers who aided the South Korean forces, with men from twenties other countries also drafted in.

The North Koreans were pushed back past the 38th parallel before China stepped in - forcing southern forces to retreat back over the division.

The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice agreement was signed after long and troublesome negotiations.

The agreement restored the original borders and created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which acts as a 2.5-mile buffer zone between the nations. Minor incidents still continue today.
