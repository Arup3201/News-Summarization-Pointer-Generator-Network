A classmate of the grandson of Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens has been indicted for murder for allegedly injecting the 21-year-old with the heroin that claimed his life. 

Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 21, has also been indicted for manslaughter, tampering with evidence and delivering a controlled substance in the January 29 death of Ty Pickens, according to a spokeswoman for Tarrant County prosecutors.

The indictment accuses Rodriguez of injecting the drug into Pickens' body, causing his death.

Charged: Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, has been indicted for the murder of Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV

Unspeakable tragedy: Pickens, 21, was a junior at Texas Christian University and died after a suspected 'heroin and Xanax' overdose. He had probably been dead for hours when a friend finally drove him to the hospital

Rodriguez is also accused of hiding drugs and a syringe from law enforcement after Pickens' death.

Ty's father, Thomas Boone Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son.

T. Boone Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956.

In a statement, the Pickens family said they welcomed the development in the case.

'We are grateful that the Tarrant County Grand Jury has taken the first step in holding Brennan Rodriguez responsible for his role in the death of Ty Pickens.'

'Ty was not a heroin user or addict and we believe that the justice system will reveal the truth of what happened that unfortunate night.'

Rodriguez's attorney, Bruce Ashworth, declined to comment.

If convicted he faces between five years and life in prison.

In April, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner ruled Thomas Boone Pickens IV or Ty, as he was known, died of acute heroin intoxication.

Another student allegedly found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29.

The unidentified student said he wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours.

Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications.

'Ty¿s loss at such a young age is an unspeakable family tragedy for the entire Pickens family and his many friends,' the family said in a statement.

Tycoon: Oil executive Pickens is worth over a billion dollars after starting his career in 1956. He has also been active in national politics

TCU confirmed Rodriguez was also a student at the private university in Fort Worth but have so far declined to comment on the case.

'Because this is a police investigation, all we can do is verify that he is a TCU student,' they said in a statement in March.

'As in all such cases, he has been suspended from the university pending a hearing through the university's disciplinary process.'

Ty's grandfather, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George Michael. Homes can cost as much as $40 million.

The wealthy industrialist also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas.

The billionaire has his own gulfstream jet which he parks at his private airport in Pampa, Texas and fuels up to take him to Oklahoma State football games.

Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University, majoring in strategic communications.

Campus: Pickens and Rodriguez were both students at Texas Christian University, pictured

Unimaginable wealth: T Boone Pickens' luxurious Alva Court estate in Preston Hollow is for sale for $7m

He has also been actively involved in national politics.

He
was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid
to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004.

Now, after a career in the oil industry, he champions a plan to 
get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy 
such as wind, solar and natural gas.

He plans to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas to champion his idea.
