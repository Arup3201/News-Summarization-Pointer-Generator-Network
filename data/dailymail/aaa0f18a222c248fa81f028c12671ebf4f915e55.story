Christian Benteke suffered a minor scare during Belgium training on Tuesday - but will be fit for their Euro 2016 qualifiers and subsequent Premier League run-in. 

The Aston Villa striker, who limped out of their defeat against Swansea on Saturday, was with Marc Wilmots' squad ahead of their clash against Cyprus at the weekend. 

While he did leave training early, his manager confirmed there's nothing to worry about.

'He smiled as he left the field,' Wilmots said before revealing that Benteke will take part in Wednesday's session. 

The 24-year-old suffered a hip injury at Villa Park last weekend and Tim Sherwood will be relieved his main frontman has felt no lasting damage. 

Benteke has scored three in his last three games under Sherwood as Villa attempt to beat the drop. 

He is expected to play some part against Cyprus, with Belgium facing Israel in a friendly next Tuesday.
