A woman was found inside a cardboard box, wearing nothing but a shirt outside a landfill after her margarita was allegedly spiked in a Texas night club.

The Hispanic woman, in her 30s, was found outside the refuse site in the city of Irving after spending the evening at Angels Grill & Bar in Dallas.

She was drunk and had trouble walking through the parking lot after leaving the club, police said, and vanished with a man she had met that night after a friend left her to get her car.

When she came back five minutes later to take them home, both her friend and the man had vanished.

She was next seen at the landfill site in Irving, nine miles away. 

While the woman cannot remember anything about what happened next, police believe she may have been raped.

She took a rape test, but it was inconclusive, local station CBSDFW reported. Her name has not been released because she might be the victim of a sex attack.

According to a CBS reporter, she believes that she was raped, after drinking a drugged margarita in the club.

Volunteer workers at the landfill site found the woman, who only speaks Spanish, in the box around 9am the following morning.

The man who found her said the she did not seem to be badly hurt, and apparently refused his first offer of help.

He said: 'I lifted the box a little and saw a woman and immediately dropped the box. I then gathered my bearings and opened the box a little more and asked "Are you OK? Hello, are you OK?" 

Speaking to NBCDFW, he said: 'She was half-dressed with scuff marks on her knees, and she didn't have any shoes on.'

Officers from the Dallas Police Department are continuing to investigate, and are reviewing footage from surveillance cameras around the night club.
