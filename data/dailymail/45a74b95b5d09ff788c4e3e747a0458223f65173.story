Five young friends were killed early on Saturday morning after their car careened off a road in Burbank, California and burst into flames with the passengers trapped and injured inside.

Those killed were last night identified by tributes at the scene and online.

They were named - but not officially confirmed - as Sameer Nevarez, Sugey Cuevas, Stephen Stoll, Malak Hariri and Sebastian Forero, they were all 22 or younger.

The car's sole survivor was said to be Savannah Underwood, 18, who was found by police about 50 yards away from the charred Nissan sedan when they arrived shortly after 4 a.m.

Ms Underwood suffered a broken leg and was being treated for non-life threatening injuries at the Los Angeles County Medical Center, according to Sergeant Darin Ryburn, who added the girl’s father was at her bedside.

The five young adults all appear to have been friends since attending Burbank High School and graduated within the past few years.

Tributes poured in from the school community and devastated family and friends of those who died.

‘Heaven gained 5 angels today and 
they gave us clear skies and a beautiful day. Rest in paradise. You will 
never be forgotten,’ wrote Jamie Hizzle.

A relative of Malak Hariri simply wrote: 'No words'.

'She's a very smart girl, very good girl, very respectful girl. She never had problems at home with us," said Suhilah Hariri, another relative told Fox News.

Officials said they were still looking into the cause of the accident but feared speed could have been a factor.

The curving stretch of roadway has a posted 45 mph speed limit, but vehicles often fly off the freeway at speeds closer to 70 mph, and accidents have happened in the area in the past, according to authorities.

The accident took place around 4am but by the time the emergency services reached the vehicle it was too late. 

Fire Battalion Chief Ron Barone told Fox: 'There was absolutely no possibility of any rescue whatsoever'.

Lone survivor: Savannah Underwood, 18, somehow survived the accident after being ejected from the car
