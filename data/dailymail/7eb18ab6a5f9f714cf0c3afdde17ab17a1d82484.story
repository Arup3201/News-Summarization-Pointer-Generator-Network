A kind mother-of-six has died suddenly at the age of 43, just four weeks after giving birth to her sixth child.

Amanda Stevens collapsed outside her workplace and never recovered, but her cause of death is still to be determined. 

Amanda's husband of 13 years, Craig has had to give up his job to look after their baby Eden, who was born on October 29. 

Amanda Stevens, 43, gave birth to baby Eden on October 29 but dies four weeks later after collapsing outside work. The kind mother-of-six from Poole, Dorset was described as 'there for anybody'. 

The family, including Amanda's mum Pam Riley, have pulled together to care for the children.

Amanda also leaves behind Jordan, 23, Kayleigh, 21, Zach, 15, Morgan, 13 and Taylor, seven. 

Despite the trauma the family has suffered over the last few weeks, Craig is determined to make Christmas special for the children.

Amanda worked as a telephone operator for a local fast food company in Poole, Dorset and earlier this year she signed up to a slimming club hoping to lose ten stone.

Amanda's husband Craig has had to quit work to look after their six children, including newborn baby Eden 

Craig said: 'She was kind, loving and there for anybody.

'She went without for those children. As long as we had a roof over our heads and food on the table for the children, she was happy.

'Christmas was her favourite time of year and so I have got to make it special for all of the children.

'Amanda used to love watching the kids' faces as they opened their presents.

'The children have got to come first at the moment.

'I've had to give up my job to look after Eden and the children have gone back to school and are doing well.'

Amanda worked as a telephone operator for a local fast food company and earlier this year she signed up to a slimming club hoping to lose ten stone.

Her brother, Daniel Cooke, said: 'It is just so sad. She was doing so well and she had battled with all of her problems to come so far.

'It was suggested to her about not having another baby, but she desperately wanted it and she loved Eden.

'The only thing we want now is for the children to have a nice Christmas.

'Amanda never fell out with anybody. She was as bright as a button and the most amazing and incredible woman.'
