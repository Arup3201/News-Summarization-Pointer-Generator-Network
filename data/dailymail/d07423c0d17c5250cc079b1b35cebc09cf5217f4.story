One is an A-list actress and the other a renowned fashion designer, so when Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Kors announced that they were joining forces for a special collaboration, the results were likely to be pretty special.

And now, we can bring you a first look at the duo's one-off Christmas collection, which has just landed on Gwyneth's website, Goop.com.

The range was inspired by the actress's personal wardrobe and her favourite items from Kors's collections.

Teamwork: Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Kors have teamed up to create a one-off collection - and star in an accompanying video

Amongst the edit of holiday wear is a grey draped cashmere cape, a peplum grey sweater, a tan tote, a chunky gold watch and some black smoking slippers. 

The duo even star in a holiday-themed video together, which sees Gwyneth shaking up a cocktail for them to sip on before they wrap their gifts.

Fashion forward: (L-R) Black wool Melton peacoat, £1220.93, Suntan flared trouser, £581.40, Banker peplum sweater, £581.40

Accessorise all areas: (L-R) Curb link pendant, £76.50, gold-tone oversize runway watch, £168.30, Suntan cashmere elbow sleeve sweater, £290.70

The actress and designer have been friends for nearly two decades and have long been discussing the 
possibility of a collaboration.

Speaking about 54-year-old Kors, whose designs are favoured by the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Miranda Kerr, Gwyneth said: 'Michael's clothes are gorgeous, staple, American classics that never go out of style.

'I thought it would be wonderful to reinvent some of my favourite vintage Michael Kors looks that I have kept for years, that I wear over and over.'

Muse: Kors describes Gwyneth as having great style, being smart and having a sense of humour

And Kors returned the compliments when speaking about his muse.

'I have always been intrigued by the
 idea of someone who can juggle all the balls in the air and do it with 
great style, make it look easy, be smart and have a sense of humour,' Kors told WWD of Paltrow.

'We always said, "Wouldn't it be great if some
 time we could do something together, in whatever way."

'We started 
talking about the idea that when you buy something, you often don't know
 that it's going to turn out to be your favourite piece. Inevitably 
designers don't make it again and, she said, "It could drive you 
crazy."'

This isn't the first time that 41-year-old Gwyneth has collaborated with a designer, she also unveiled an edit with Matthew Williamson and Stella McCartney on her Goop.

Could it be named after Miss Kerr? Large Miranda zip clutch, £425.34, Delphia runway heel, £364.14 gold-tone chain bracelet, £88.74
