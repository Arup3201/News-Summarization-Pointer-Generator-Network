'Mind boggling': The NFF has suspended all four teams over the unusual scorelines

Four Nigerian football teams have been suspended after two of the clubs whose promotion depended on goal difference won 79-0 and 67-0.

The Nigeria Football Federation says 
it has suspended all four lower league clubs involved in the 'scandalous scorelines'.

In the matches played at the same time, Plateau United Feeders 
reportedly scored 72 goals in the second half to beat Akurba FC
79-0.

While Police Machine FC scored 67 goals against Babayaro FC, 61 of which were allegedly scored in the 
second half.

Both teams had been level on points before the match and were chasing a place in Nationwide League Division 3, Nigeria's lowest professional league.

Plateau United Feeders scored their second-half goals at a rate of about one every 40 seconds for 45 minutes.

The NFF called it 'a mind-boggling show of shame' and said players, 
match officials and the tournament coordinator all would be investigated
for match-fixing.

Nigerian Football Federation vice president Mike Umeh said: 'It is unacceptable, this is a scandal of huge proportions.

'The four teams involved are suspended immediately and indefinitely 
pending further sanctions. We will investigate this matter thoroughly 
and get to the bottom of it.'

The NFF
director of competitions, Mohammed Sanusi, said: 'The teams involved, their players and officials, match officials, tournament coordinator and anyone found to have played some role in 
this despicable matter will be severely dealt with.'
