Tottenham Hotspur vs Burnley (White Hart Lane) 

Team news 

Tottenham Hotspur

Emmanuel Adebayor is available for Tottenham's Barclays Premier League clash with Burnley on Saturday.

The Togo striker has returned from compassionate leave but is not yet fully fit, so is unlikely to start.

Mauricio Pochettino has an otherwise fully-fit squad for the match.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Dier, Rose, Davies, Fazio, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Mason, Capoue, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Kane, Adebayor.

Burnley

Burnley's trip to Tottenham is likely to come too soon for Sam Vokes, although the striker is nearing a first-team return.

The Wales international is instead expected to play for the Clarets' development squad on Monday against Blackpool.

Full-back Ben Mee has fully recovered from the illness which forced him off against Southampton, but Michael Duff (calf) has suffered a setback and joins Matt Taylor (Achilles) and Stephen Ward (ankle) on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Shackell, Mee, Reid, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Chalobah, Jones.
