The captain of the Germanwings plane which crashed into the Alps tried to break down the cockpit door with an crowbar after his co-pilot locked him out, it emerged on Friday.

Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately flown the Airbus A320 into the side of a  mountain after locking the captain out of the cockpit,  killing himself and all 149 others on board.

The flight recorder showed that Patrick Sonderheimer repeatedly knocked on the door of the cockpit as the plane began to descend.

But he resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the Alps.

French prosecutor Brice Robin sensationally reveals that the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings Airbus A320 locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing into a mountain to 'destroy the plane'

German newspaper Bild yesterday reported that he had attempted to use an axe, and a Germanwings spokesman confirmed that such a tool was on board the aircraft.

But it emerged last night that the only axe on the plane would have been in the cockpit, meaning it was out of reach of the captain. 

The latest revelation came after the final moments of the flight, were described in horrific detail by Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin.

Data extracted from the black box recorder shows that co-pilot - 28-year-old German Andreas Lubitz - locked the captain out of the cockpit and intentionally destroyed Airbus A320 on Tuesday.

Mr Brice said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph).

'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. 

Mr Brice said that earlier in the flight Lubitz's responses, initially courteous, became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane.

The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter.

Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something.

'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane.

'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'

Mr Robin said Lubitz 'voluntarily' refused to open the door and his breathing was normal throughout the final minutes of the flight.

8.55am - The Airbus A320 takes off from Barcelona, Spain, and is expected to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, approximately 90 minutes later. It is carrying 150 people: 144 passengers and six crew members.

A transcript recovered from the black box of the plane's final 30 minutes reveals that for the first 20 minutes the two pilots talk in a 'normal fashion', according to Mr Robin.

Preparation for the plane's arrival can then be heard in the cockpit. It is at this point the pilot asks Mr Lubitz to take over, a chair is pushed back and the door closes.

Co-pilot Mr Lubitz uses the flight monitoring system to start the plane's descent, an action which can 'only be done voluntarily'.

Through the on-board intercom system, the pilot is heard trying to regain entry to the cockpit, but there is no answer from Mr Lubitz. The pilot then knocks on the door, again getting no reply.

9.30am - Air traffic controllers get no response from the plane after they attempt to make contact. It is at this time that the plane reaches a height of 38,000ft, according to flightradar24.

9.30am- 9.40am - The plane drops from 32,000ft to 6,175ft, where flightradar24 logs its final position on radar.

All that can be heard from the cockpit from this moment until the plane crashes is the co-pilot breathing, apparently normally.

During this descent, the pilot can be heard trying to break the cabin door down and alarms go off - indicating the plane's close proximity to the ground.

A first crash is audible, but the final impact happens several moments later. During this time, no distress signals are sent out.

Passengers are only heard screaming during the final few moments of the recording, implying they were initially unaware anything was wrong until just before the plane crashed.

He said: 'His breath was not of somebody who was struggling. He never said a single word. It was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes. Nothing.'  

Air Traffic Control at Marseille asked for a distress signal, but there was still no response, said Mr Robin.

He added: 'So the plane becomes a priority for a forced landing.

'Control asks other planes to contact this Airbus and no answer is forthcoming.

'There are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground. Then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door. 

'The door is reinforced according to international standards.' 

Mr Robin went on: 'Just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact. It's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact. 

'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower.' 

Lubitz had just 600 hours of flying experience after joining Germanwings in 2013 straight from training. 

He was, however, highly regarded, having won an award from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 for his outstanding flying skills.  

The investigation is now a full-blown criminal enquiry.

The plane was carrying six crew and 144 passengers, including 16 German teenagers returning home from a school trip, who had reportedly won the trip in a lottery of their classmates.

It was the deadliest air crash on the French mainland since 1974 when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed, killing 346 people.

Lufthansa said the aircraft was carrying citizens of 18 countries. Three Americans and three Britons were confirmed among the victims.

Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, France, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico and Morocco also had nationals on board, according to officials.

'He did this for a reason which we don't know why, but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane.

'We have asked for information from the German investigation on both his profession and personal background. 

'There is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack.

'People who commit suicide usually do so alone... I don't call it a suicide.'
