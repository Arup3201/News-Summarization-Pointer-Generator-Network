Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan may not be executed this week despite having just spent their first night on 'death island'. 

Indonesian president Joko Widodo has reportedly told an Al Jazeera journalist that there will be no executions this week.

Al Jazeera's Indonesia correspondent Step Vaessen tweeted on Wednesday night: 'President Jokowi told me no executions this week at sidelines of interview I had with him this afternoon.'

An official statement of when the duo will be killed by firing squad is expected to be announced later today.

On Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran left the cells that have been their home for much of the last decade at Kerobokan jail in Bali. They were arrested for the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot.

Fellow Bali Nine member Andrew Chan was also onboard the chartered flight to Cilacap

Indonesia deployed its heaviest security for the transfer - more than 100 police, armoured cars and even fighter jets.

The Australians walked calmly from their cells as they were transferred, stopping to thank officers for their care and shaking their hands before they were handcuffed.

Chan, now a Christian minister, took a Bible, and Sukumaran, an accomplished painter, took pencils and a drawing book.

They were flown to Nusakambangan, and spent Wednesday night on the island where they are expected to face a firing squad.

On Thursday morning MPs in Australia gathered outside Parliament House in a final plea for mercy.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Labor leader Bill Shorten, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek all put their differences aside to stand together in a candlelight vigil.

Ms Plibersek said a sense of 'helplessness' had united the MPs as they prayed and hoped for the lives of the Bali Nine duo to be spared.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports Mr Abbot said: 'As people have been pointing out over the last little while here at this vigil, it would ennoble Indonesia if they were to extend mercy.'

It has been revealed Foreign Affair Minister Julie Bishop bargained to have the duo's lives spared in exchange for three Indonesian drug smugglers who were caught with 252 kilograms of heroin in Australia

President Joko Widodo emphasised to Al Jazeera that the decision to execute the two Australians had been made by the Indonesian court system, 9News reported. 

He also defended the country's notoriously corrupt justice system's ability to hand out appropriate penalties for drug offenses, saying the decision was 'valid.'

Chan and Sukumaran's families are expected to arrive in Cilacap, the nearest town to the island, on Thursday, flying from Sydney and Bali.

They will be allowed to visit the men, Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo says, but he is yet to announce a date for the executions, saying only it will be as soon as possible.

He is also reconsidering how many prisoners should be executed at one time, after planning for weeks for 10 to be shot simultaneously.

'We want to show the world that Indonesia is trying very hard to combat drugs,' he said.

The prisoners will get 72 hours' notice of the executions.

There has been speculation that the prisoners would be put to death this weekend, based on the timing of the executions of five people at Nusakambangan in January, which were held after midnight on a Sunday.

Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran are still pursuing legal avenues and say the men shouldn't be executed in the meantime.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Wednesday said Australians are 'revolted' by the prospect of the executions.

Australia is continuing its efforts to seek clemency for the men, he said.
