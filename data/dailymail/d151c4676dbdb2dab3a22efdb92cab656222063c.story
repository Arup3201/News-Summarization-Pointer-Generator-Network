Jack Wilshere will hand Arsene Wenger a boost when he returns from his injury lay-off next month.

But the Arsenal manager may be hesitant to rush the England international back into first-team action if these statistics are anything to go by.

Arsenal's win record with Wilshere in their side this season is a lowly 37 per cent, whereas without the midfielder, the Gunners have a win percentage more than double that number.

Tomas Rosicky was on target for Arsenal in their 3-2 FA Cup win against Brighton on Sunday 

Wilshere hasn’t featured for Arsenal since he limped off in their 2-1 defeat against Manchester United at the Emirates on November 22.

And of the 16 matches he played in prior to sustaining that injury, Arsenal won just six matches, drew five, and suffered five defeats.

In contrast, the 18 games that he hasn’t played for Arsenal, the Gunners have won 13  – a win percentage of 72 per cent.

Wenger’s side also have a greater average goals per game without Wilshere; 2.2 in each match without, compared to 1.6 with him in their side. Their defensive record is also better.

It should be noted that Wilshere’s three-month lay-off has coincided with the return of Theo Walcott, Mesut Ozil and Laurent Koscienly to first-team action. 

Tomas Rosicky and Francis Coquelin have also been inspired in Wilshere's absence, the former starring in Arsenal’s 3-2 FA Cup victory on Sunday. Coquelin meanwhile, was a kingpin in Arsenal's 2-0 victory at Manchester City earlier this month.

Wilshere has been out of action since November after he sustained an ankle injury against Manchester United

The England international sustained the injury following this late tackle by United defender Paddy McNair  

Mesut Ozil opened the scoring for Arsenal as they secured their fifth-round spot with a win over Brighton 

Wilshere is slightly ahead of scheduled in his rehabilitation from the ankle injury he sustained after a late challenge from Paddy McNair in Arsenal's 2-1 defeat. 

The 23-year-old is expected to be back in time for his side's Champions League last-16 tie against Monaco in mid-February.
