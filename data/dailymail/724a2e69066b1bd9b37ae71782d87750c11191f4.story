Today is Cyber Monday, the biggest day of the year for online sales. Fed up with parking charges, cold weather and the price of petrol, more of us than ever will be Christmas shopping on the internet.

I'm as guilty as anyone - the booze and the fish for my festive dinner this Friday will be delivered and I won't have to carry a box more than a few feet from the front door.

It's convenient to buy your Christmas stuff online, but is it morally acceptable? There are two big issues at stake. The first is tax avoidance. We know that the little people in this country pay a far bigger proportion of their earnings in tax than the rich, and the Revenue & Customs seems disproportionately obsessed with our piddling tax returns, rather than those of huge corporations.

Starbucks, Google and Amazon have all been summoned to appear before a House of Commons committee to explain why they have paid so little tax in this country, if any at all...

Recently, the extent of corporate tax manipulation was laid bare when the bosses of Starbucks, Google and Amazon were summoned to appear before a House of Commons committee to explain why they paid so little tax on their profits in this country.

The figures were shocking - by basing their headquarters overseas, they cleverly avoid paying the same level of tax as UK-based retailers like John Lewis. These companies call it smart financial planning - I call it morally unacceptable, when they make such a big stink about their ethical values.

Starbucks has 700 coffee shops in the UK, employing almost 8,500 people. They are expanding, planning another 300 stores, and yet their boss told MPs 'we are not making money in the UK'. In the last three years they paid no corporation tax at all here on sales of £1.2 billion.  Outraged customers threatened to boycott the chain and drink their coffee elsewhere, and now Starbucks has announced it is rethinking its 'approach' to tax and is in talks with HMRC.

In other words, it's realised that such blatant manipulation of the system is a PR disaster.

Bosses at tax-paying business John Lewis have called for an overhaul of a tax system littered with loopholes

Will Amazon follow suit? The UK accounts for 45 per cent of its sales in Europe, a whopping £3.35 billion in 2011, on which it paid just £1.8 million in tax - 2.4 per cent.

No wonder the boss of John Lewis complains that retailers do not have a level playing field - if 27 per cent of your profits are going straight back to the Treasury, there's less to invest in expanding the business.  George Osborne says he is going to invest more in fighting tax avoidance schemes in his Autumn Statement this week, but I doubt these companies will suddenly be coughing up millions. Consumer power is the only way to force change - are you prepared to boycott Amazon until they pay the same level of tax as John Lewis?

Christmas shoppers hit up a festively lit Guildford High Street and keep smaller retailers alive and kicking

The second issue is that online shopping is killing off the High Street. Every day, 32 shops close - over the whole country, one in seven is boarded up, and in spite of Mary Portas' Big Ideas (funded with a pitiful £5.5 million of government money), most will never open again. Marks & Spencer has reported a 10  per cent drop in profits, and the boss of the Accessorize chain says some of its 400 stores face closure.

Things are grim - but what's the solution? The former chief executive of the defunct DIY chain Focus says old-style shopping centres have had their day, and the Government must focus on leisure - cafes, restaurants, galleries and advice centres - and not saving stores.

As consumers, we can save our High Streets by choosing to use them. Instead, we stay at home, click a mouse, and there's no denying that's very convenient.

Retailers want the Chancellor  to freeze
business rates, and  small-shop owners in trendy towns like Whitstable,
Kent, want landlords to delay rent increases. I have some sympathy, but
in the end, it's the consumers who control their destiny, and all the 
signs are that we've fallen out of love with popping out to the shops.

I want town centres to come alive again, but we can't turn back the clock.

Online purchasing is here to stay, but 
remember, every time you click that mouse for Amazon, you are increasing
the profits of a company that treats our tax system with contempt. 
Choose companies who are prepared to play by the rules.

Odd nosh for Posh

David Beckham says he's taken cooking lessons and plans to open a restaurant with his pal Gordon Ramsay.

Let's
just hope Victoria is not allowed any input into the menu. Recently, 
she told her followers on Twitter she was living on a diet of kale, 
'sprinkled with a little salt and roasted'.

Victoria is renowned for her fondness for dieting fads and living off low calorie foods such as prawns

Let's just hope Victoria is not allowed any input into the menu. Recently, she told her followers on Twitter she was living on a diet of kale, 'sprinkled with a little salt and roasted'.

I grow this nutritious green vegetable, but why you would shove it in a hot oven when it tastes delicious shredded and stir-fried or steamed is beyond me.

But Victoria's bizarre food fads are well-documented - for years she lived on a simple diet of a few leaves of rocket and prawns.

You don't get those stick-like arms by eating carbs!

Is this the world's most expensive bra?

Last week, Christie's auction house in London sold two of the iconic outfits that were designed by Jean Paul Gaultier for Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour in the 1990s.

The outrageous sequined and beaded conical bras and bustiers worn on the  tour created an instantly recognisable cartoon-character image for Madonna that has lived on ever since - but what kind of person pays £48,700 for two well-worn bits of underwear?

Please don't write in to tell me!

It's getting awfully amorous in Ambridge

Have the writers of the Archers finally acknowledged that the lusty Fifty Shades Of Grey could be their female audience's guilty pleasure?

Last week, listeners were treated to TWO bouts of bonking in Borsetshire in as many days! Recently, the soap has been mired in worthy dreariness - Ed and Emma's money problems, Jim's feeble attempts as a local journalist, and Vicky's never-ending pregnancy. Now, Fallon has spent the night with Reece, after months of dithering, and Lillian took herself to Birmingham for a spot of hotel nookie with Matt's brother Paul.

After finishing their frolics, my radio started emitting a gasping and groaning. I couldn't believe this middle-aged couple would be able to manage three times in less than an hour… but the heavy breathing turned out to be Vicky and Mike practising birthing exercises. Ugh!

New Government issue Australian cigarette packets

Smokers left fuming over punchy new packaging

Proof that packaging is all-important - from the this month, Australian smokers  have to purchase their cigarettes in plain olive green packets, which are covered  in prominent warnings like: 'SMOKING CAUSES BLINDNESS'.

The new packets also carry distressing pictures of terminally ill cancer sufferers, diseased feet, malformed eyeballs and sick babies, all designed to hammer home the message that puffing on the contents of the packet will seriously damage your health.

Already, angry consumers have been calling advice groups claiming that the repackaged cigarettes have been doctored to 'taste different.'

The manufacturers insist that is not the case, but smokers  remain unconvinced.

The Government is considering adopting the same tactics here - would it work for booze as well as tobacco?

Coinciding with 'Cyber Monday', Janet Street-Porter urges Christmas shoppers to hit the high street instead of buying online but if absolutely necessary, choose internet retailers with great care!
