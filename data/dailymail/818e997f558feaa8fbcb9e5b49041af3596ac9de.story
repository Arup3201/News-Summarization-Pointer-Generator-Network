A last picture: Marco Simoncelli arrives at Sepang for the Malaysian Moto GP yesterday before his fatal crash with Valentino Rossi and Colin Edwards

Italian motorcyclist Marco Simoncelli died in a horrific crash at yesterday's MotoGP race in Malaysia, in full view of his devastated family and girlfriend.

The 24-year-old was flung from his bike and skidded across the track, before apparently being hit by competitors Colin Edwards and Valentino Rossi.

His mother Rossella, father Paolo and girlfriend Kate watched in horror as Simoncelli's bike was smashed to pieces after his dramatic loss of control in the second lap.

They wept in shock as the unconscious rider was taken to the medical centre at the track in Sepang for treatment, but 
his injuries to the chest, head and neck were too serious for him to be saved.

Simoncelli's fellow Honda rider Dani 
Pedrosa, who had
fallen out with Simoncelli earlier in the season, said: 'I've been 
with his father and all we could do was to hug, nothing else matters.

'Everybody in the paddock remains in 
shock. Many times we ourselves forget how dangerous this sport can be 
and when you lose people on the way nothing has any meaning. It's clear 
that we all do what we like, what we love, but on days like today 
nothing matters.'

He added:  'In a tragedy like this there is not much to say. I just 
want to give my condolences to his family and all the people who love 
him.'

The rider's girlfriend, Kate looked ashen-faced and she walked through the deserted MotoGP garages.

Fans were also spotted huddled near the track sobbing over the rider's death. He had only moved up to MotoGP level last year.

The fatal accident comes just a week after British IndyCar racing driver Dan Wheldon died after crashing in Las Vegas.

Organisers cancelled the race soon after Simoncelli's accident and said in a bulletin reported on website Autosport: 'Race cancelled as the medical 
centre staff is focusing on treating Marco Simoncelli and track action 
cannot be resumed in the current circumstances.'

The rider was given CPR in the ambulance which continued for 45 minutes but Simoncelli was declared dead at 4.56pm local time.

Yesterday tributes were posted on Twitter in memory of the talented rider.

friends and everyone involved in MotoGP. Motorsport can be so cruel...'

Button's Formula One teammate Lewis Hamilton wrote: 'My thoughts are 
with his family, friends and team at this extremely sad time. Another 
tragic loss at such an early age.'

Newly-crowned MotoGP champion Casey Stoner said: 'I'm so shocked and saddened by the loss of Marco. When things like this happen it reminds you how precious life is.

The Australian told BBC2: 'As soon as I saw the footage it just makes you sick inside. Whenever the helmet comes off, that's not a good sign.'

A message on the MotoGP website read: 'Marco Simoncelli succumbed to injuries sustained in Malaysia.'

Simoncelli's
compatriot and Repsol Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso said: 'I watched the
images and I'm shocked: in a race you fight and push hard and disaster 
is often around the corner.

'Marco
was a strong rider and he always pushed hard. We raced together since 
we were kids, I saw him always pushing to the maximum, he crashed many 
times, but without major injuries, he was seemed invincible. What 
happened today seems impossible.'

The last death in MotoGP came at the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix, when Japan's Daijiro Katoh died from his injuries.

Medical director at Clinica Mobile Dr
Michele Macchiagodena said at a press conference yesterday that U.S. rider 
Edwards had suffered a dislocated shoulder in the crash but it had been 
reset and he was 'fine'.

When asked about Simoncelli's helmet 
coming off, race director Paul Butler said at the press conference: 'I 
think if I may reply, that will be for another occasion. Quite clearly 
the consequences and circumstances surrounding the accident will be 
thoroughly investigated.'

Australian
Formula One driver Mark Webber wrote on Twitter: 'R.I.P Marco A special
talent that will be missed... Thinking of your loved ones, and all the 
motogp paddock..mark.'

British
MotoGP rider Cal Crutchlow tweeted: 'RIP Marco Simoncelli ! A 
great rider and all round nice guy. My thoughts are with all his family 
& friends. I will never forget today.'

Tribute: Driver Lewis Hamilton described Simoncelli's death as 'another tragic loss', coming just a week after IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed in a racing accident

Inconsolable: Stunned fans wept after the brutal accident killed the MotoGP star

Just after the accident, Tony
Elias, Moto2 world champion, had spoken of his prayers that Simoncelli's injuries were not serious.

'We just hope Marco is OK - that's my wish,' he said.

Last week British IndyCar racing driver Dan Wheldon died after he was catapulted helplessly into the air in a 225mph smash before landing on a barrier and suffering fatal head injuries.

Just days earlier the father-of-two joined a number of other drivers in expressing the fears over the speed of cars and overcrowding on the oval-shaped track.

But in a blog post, he had promised fans he would go out to win and put on a show of 'pure entertainment'.
