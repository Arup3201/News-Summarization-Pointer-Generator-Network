Royal Mail have launched an inquiry into dog attacks as figures revealed that postal workers are bitten around 4,000 times every year.

Almost 400 staff have been forced to take time off work in the last year after being savaged by animals while doing their round.

In total, workers have been attacked 24,000 times since 2006, official figures revealed.

An independent inquiry into the problem was announced yesterday by Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon.

They will make recommendations on how to stop the attacks which are happening at a rate of 11 per day.

Mr Brydon said: 'It is an offence to 
decency that good people should suffer these attacks when carrying out 
their daily jobs and serving the public.'

Royal Mail halted deliveries to a whole street after a tiny terrier 'growled' at postmen.

The owners of the Yorkshire Terrier (pictured), called Peggy, insisted she has never hurt anyone.

Patrick Joyce, from Northampton, said: 'The house is full of kids and she would never harm them. She's just a harmless little thing.'

However, alleged 'repeated attacks' on a postal worker were enough to prompt Royal Mail to stop deliveries to the road in December 2010.

In a letter delivered to all the street's residents, delivery manager Jim Evelyn said: 'Because of the dog's behaviour, your postman believes your mail cannot be delivered safely and in the circumstances I have instructed him not to deliver mail to your address.'

Angry homeowners said they were forced to go on a 14-mile round journey to collect their mail or pay a 'small charge' to have it delivered to an alternative address.

Although the Joyce family insisted their pet was harmless, a neighbour disagreed.

'She looks cute but she's got that glint of evil in her eye - she terrifies people,' she said.

Dave Joyce, national safety officer of the Communication Workers Union, which has been campaigning for measures to tackle dangerous dogs, said: 'This is a very positive and welcome development at a key moment and will definitely raise the profile of the issue and influence the public and political debate and strengthen the case for change which is overwhelming and must not be further delayed.'

The inquiry will be led by former high court judge Sir Gordon Langley and will study the number of attacks, which are running at between 3,500 and 4,000 a year.

Devon postwoman Patricia Prew was forced to take six weeks off work after being attacked by an golden retriever as she entered the front garden of a house in Budleigh Salterton.

She said: 'It just grabbed hold of me and pulled me
down and then it bit me so deeply that it took a chunk of my muscle 
from that part of my arm.'

In August 2011, Andrew Berge suffered 
severe damage to his left-hand ring finger and tendon when a dog bit him
in south west London.

'As I posted an item through the letterbox, a dog bit and held on for four to five minutes,' he said.

The Royal Mail has spent over £100,000 on campaigns and equipment to try to reduce the risk of injury, including a device to put letters through doors to protect fingers.

Around 4,100 working days have been lost in the last year costing Royal Mail around £400,000, they claimed.

Unions claim many dog bites go unreported and the actual number is closer to 6,000 every year.

The Communication Workers Union said it received an assurance from Prime Minister David Cameron almost two years ago that he supported its campaign for tougher laws against dangerous dogs, but changes have not been made.
