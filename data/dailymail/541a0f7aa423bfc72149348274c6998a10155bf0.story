For most of us, Christmas is a wonderful time of year. But for Victoria Harris, 33, from Jersey, December 25th is loaded with bittersweet memories.

For three years in a row, the festive season brought heartbreak as she suffered one miscarriage after another.

But this year, things will be different as she, and her boyfriend James Cornick, 27, now have a son, Jack, to share the big day with.

Relief: Victoria with her son Jack who was born on 17th December 2010 following three miscarriages

Miss Harris, who has chosen to share her story three years after her final miscarriage, said her experiences have left her a stronger person and a loving mother, and she hopes to offer encouragement and comfort to women in similar situations.

'Throughout everything, I have stayed positive, but Christmas is still a difficult time of year for me and James,' she said. 'We have sad thoughts every now again.

'We do our best to keep that feeling away from Jack. While I was growing up, Christmas was the most magical time of the year for me, and I want my son to have that feeling too.'

Miss Harris, a former sales advisor, and Mr Cornick, an electrician, celebrated Jack's third birthday on December 17th. 

For Miss Harris, a former sales advisor, the date was a significant milestone on the long and difficult journey she has taken to have children.

'I had half my cervix removed when I was 18, and tried getting pregnant for three years with no luck, so when the doctor said it was unlikely I would conceive I wasn't surprised,' she revealed.

'When I fell pregnant for the first time I was shocked but really pleased.' Sadly, she lost the baby boy on November 22nd 2007. 'My body had been trying to expel blood clots, but the amniotic sac was expelled too, which meant I lost the baby,' she remembers.

'Going through the miscarriage was terrible, but I was determined not to let the experience defeat me, so we started trying again fairly quickly.'

Six months later, Miss Harris discovered she was pregnant again. 'This time, the pregnancy was perfect - there was no bleeding,' she recalls.

'But the week before Christmas, I started leaking fluids. The doctor tried to reassure me that my bladder was leaking, but I wasn't convinced. 

'They kept me in hospital overnight and sent me home the next day. Then, on Christmas morning, I started to experience leaking and pain and went to hospital again.

'Everyone expected the baby's heartbeat to be strong, but the senior doctors couldn't find it at all.

'There was no water left inside me - it had all leaked out. All the doctor could say was, "I'm sorry, you've lost the baby". Then, everything became a blur.'

Miss Harris delivered her stillborn daughter, Harriet, on Christmas Day 2008. She said: 'James and I had Harriet with us in the hospital family room for two days and nights. Eventually the nurses said, "it's time to go". Then it was time to say goodbye. It was like a bad dream.

'It was heartbreaking, leaving her there. I'd arrived at hospital half-expecting to leave with Harriet. But instead, I left with nothing. I'm still grieving for her today.'

The following December, when she was six weeks pregnant, Miss Harris endured yet another miscarriage, this time requiring a surgical procedure.

But finally, in the spring of 2010, she discovered she was pregnant once again.

'I felt like I knew something bad would happen,' she explains, adding: 'I didn't dare look ahead - I took one day at a time. I would only believe it once the baby was in my arms, crying.'

There were nervous moments when she experienced bleeding in the early stages of the pregnancy and again when her cervix began to open at 25 weeks.

'After two days in hospital, my cervix closed again,' she adds. 'Everyone was amazed. They let me go home, but under strict orders to relax and avoid physical exertion.'

Their son's due date was December 30th 2010, but in order to prevent the baby arriving on Christmas Day, Miss Harris chose to be induced on December 17th.

Magical: Victoria hopes to make Christmas a wonderful of year for her much-loved son Jack

She said: 'Christmas Day is Harriet's
 day - a day to remember her. We didn't want to celebrate a birthday and
 an anniversary on the same day.' 

A
 week before the birth, Miss Harris's grandmother, Barbara, passed away.
 But finally, after weeks of a mixture of anxiety, grief and growing 
expectation, the fateful day arrived.

'Jack didn't cry when he was first born and the cord was wrapped around his neck three times, which meant the nurses had to ring the emergency bell. But eventually I heard him cry and it was an enormous relief.' 

Her son Jack is now a cheeky, adventurous three-year-old and his parents are looking forward to celebrating Christmas with him. 

'He's coming through his terrible twos and is tall for his age,' said Miss Harris. 'Me and James are so protective of him.

'There are lots of fears which have been left over from our experiences - I'm sure most parents would understand what I mean.'

Miss Harris says she hopes to offer comfort to women who are going through the heartbreak of unsuccessful pregnancy.

'My advice would be to stay strong and stay positive - don't despair,' she says. 'It was terrible after the losses, but there was joy at the end. Don't give up.'
