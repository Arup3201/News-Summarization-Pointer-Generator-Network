The Los Angeles County Coroner paid a visit to devastated Taylor Armstrong today to talk to her about her estranged husband Russell's suicide.

LA County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter met with the 40-year-old mother-of-one for half an hour this morning at her residence in the Hollywood Hills.

Mr Winter was keen to talk to Armstrong as she was at the scene when the 47-year-old businessman's body was discovered.

Russell, who appeared alongside Taylor on Bravo show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, had hanged himself.

It came amid the breakdown of his marriage and financial troubles, with spiralling debts of $1.5m.

The coroner told photographers Taylor was doing well under the circumstances, but said he couldn't say any more than that.

TMZ.com reports Taylor told Winter 
that Russell was not undergoing a course of drugs at the time of his 
death and that she had no idea he would commit suicide.

It has been previously reported that Russell had stopped taking anti-depressants just weeks before taking his own life.

On Wednesday, a memorial service was held for Russell at Forest Lawn in Los Angeles.

Taylor was supported by some of co-stars, including Kyle Richards, Lisa Vanderpump, and Adrienne Maloof.

Kim Richards, Kyle's sister, opted to stay away, as did Camille Grammer.

Armstrong's parents and family also 
shunned the event due to bad feelings with Taylor. They will instead 
hold their own service in Texas in the coming weeks.

Russell's lawyer told Life&Style magazine that his late client would not have wanted the Housewives at his memorial.

He said: 'All I can tell you about Russell's memorial is that his Texas family was not there, and the last thing he would have wanted to see there are the Housewives.'

Reports claim Russell believed that the women tried to make him look bad during the taping of the show.

Father of three Russell had a five-year-old daughter Kennedy with Taylor, plus two sons from previous relationships.

He was found dead a week on Monday at a home he was stay at in Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles.

Meanwhile, RadarOnline reports that 
Taylor has decided their daughter Kennedy will get help from a mental 
health professional in the wake of her father's death.

According to the website Taylor has 
been reading books to Kennedy that help children try and come to terms 
with the loss of a parent.

'Kennedy is only five, she understands that Russell has died - however, she keeps asking for him,' a source told the website.
