John Kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over Benjamin Netanyahu's forthcoming speech to Congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program.

The Secretary of State said he did not want the Israeli's Prime Minister's forthcoming address to a joint session of Congress to become 'some great political football'.

Netanyahu's speech, organized by John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, was set up without the blessing of the Obama administration - and comes as the White House tries to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

It is feared that such a public show of closeness to Israel, a firm foe of Iran, could dash Obama's hopes in the negotiations, in which he hopes to curb the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions.

Kerry played up U.S.-Israeli unity in an interview on Sunday for ABC's This Week show, insisting 'the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously.

'And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history.'

There is, however, a clear different in policy between Netanyahu and the White House - with the Israeli leader expected to urge Congress to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime.

Congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong, but the President has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations.

Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying the White House deserved 'the benefit of the doubt' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached. 

By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to
address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the
Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech
before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol.

Solemn: Netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political, and says he is standing up for all Jews by visiting Washington. He is pictured above praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall

But both sides have tried to downplay the rift. 

In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem's Western Wall,
Netanyahu said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to say
that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama.'

He added that he
believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, 'that strength
will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and
those yet to come.'

Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on
Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, who is running for
re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being
above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for
all Jews.

'I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic,
mission,' he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv.

'I feel
that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who
do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,' he told
reporters.

Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to
approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to
veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks.

U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran
diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate
election stunt that will play well with voters back home.

While White House and Israeli officials insist that key
areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to
cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran
talks has shaped up as the worst in decades.

Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate
between the Republican and Democratic camps.

The planned
address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's
government and some congressional Democrats. Some two dozen or
more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial
estimates.

Iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well. 

Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine
the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians'
unresolved bid for an independent state.

'Netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution,' Zarif said.

Meanwhile a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the 'politicized' nature of his visit threatened 'what
undergirds the strength of the relationship'.

As one former U.S. official put it: 'Sure, when Netanyahu
calls the White House, Obama will answer. But how fast will he
be about responding (to a crisis)?'
