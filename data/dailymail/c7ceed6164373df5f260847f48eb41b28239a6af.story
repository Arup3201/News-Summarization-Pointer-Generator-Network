Welcome to the Kangaroo Hilton - an exclusive sanctuary for the small number of loyal yet wild guests that happen to hop by.

Five generations of kangaroos have been regular guests at this home on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and the generous hospitality is what keeps them coming back.

Linda and Graham Hill have lived at the property for 20 years and they have been feeding and nurturing the wild animals for almost as long.

'Our place is like a little sanctuary for them – they have grass, food, water and protection,' Linda told Daily Mail Australia.

'During the day they go off and they come back in the afternoon to eat... sometimes they lay under the trees at our place all day.

'They are wonderful animals – we sit down in the afternoon and just watch them. They are just like cats and dogs.'

The couple, who leave bowls of water, pellets and rolled oats out for them everyday, treat the kangaroos like their very own pets.

Their property has even been dubbed the 'Kangaroo Hilton' by animal groups.

The kangaroos treat the property like a holiday resort and regularly laze about all day long 

'We have given them all names,' Linda said.

The couple regularly snap photos of their clan eating and lazing about on the property, which have often then been shared on Facebook by the Australian Society for Kangaroos.

The kangaroos started coming to the property after the koala and deer sanctuary next door to their 10 acre property closed down years ago.

'With Australia Zoo opening they shut down because no tourists were coming through. The animals were all sold off, but the kangaroos were all wild and they stayed. 

'It took many years for them to become used to us and a couple ended up being very friendly and we could scratch their heads.

The couple have even helped rehabilitate a few who have become sick or injured by calling in the medical team from nearby Australia Zoo

'Once that little family started have joeys they decided our place was pretty good and they've been here ever since.'

The couple have even helped rehabilitate a few who have become sick or injured. 

'We call up Australia Zoo's wildlife hospital and they come up to treat them or take them back to the hospital until they're better,' she said. 

'We have the best of conditions and we just do our best to keep them going.'
