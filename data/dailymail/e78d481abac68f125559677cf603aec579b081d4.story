A Wall Street investor who hoarded designer clothes and expensive silverware in his disheveled rent-controlled upper east side apartment left behind a massive $18 million fortune when he died last year.

But his widow of 10 years says she still can't find the documents that detail the fortune's whereabouts because they're buried under piles of paperwork and boxes. 

Lewis David Zagor, who died in December at the age of 77, made millions on Wall Street investing in cash and mutual funds but chose to live modestly in a relatively small, two-bedroom, rent-stabilized apartment on Park Avenue and 96th Street East, for which he paid $1.641 a month.

This photo shows some of the massive quantity of stuff under which Zagor's widow says is buried evidence of his $18million fortune. 

While he saved on flat expenses, Zagor spent the sizable dividend checks he received from his investments going on shopping sprees at Saks Fifth Avenue and traveling around the globe, according to DNAinfo New York. 

'You have no idea the amount of wealth that is in the apartment,' Valentina Phillips-Zagor, his third wife who was with him for the last 10 years of his life, told the website. 'The most important are the financial documents.'

She moved into a different apartment on Fifth Avenue and was in going through her husband's flat and cleaning it out.

But before she could get to the home office, where Zagor kept most of his financial information, in May the building's management company, MSMC Residential Realty, changed the locks because she owed rent and wanted to charge her market rates after Zagor died, she said. Phillips-Zagor, 68, refused.

Complicating the resolution of Zagor's finances further is the fact that he never made a will, though he apparently has no living relatives other than his wife. 

Even Zagor's bed isn't immune from the clutter of debris, collected over the 38 years he lived in the apartment

MSMC last month asked a Manhattan judge to appoint a public administrator to oversee Zagor's estate so it could file a lawsuit to recoup back rent, DNAIinfo reported. Phillips-Zagor owes it nearly $5,000, the company claims. 

She also filed a petition, in which she claimed her husband's estate was worth $18 million and she is the only beneficiary. She is unable to cash any of the dividend checks or access his bank accounts until the estate is sorted. 

Phillips-Zagor said she's more than happy for MSMC to help sort through her husband's mess.  

'I said, 'You go to the court. You go to the apartment and go through the ocean of papers and you will file the petition to become the executor,' she said.
