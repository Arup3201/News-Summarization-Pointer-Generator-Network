The U.S. Secret Service's latest brush with booze-related embarrassment in the Netherlands last week comes as the agency's higher-ups already were on high alert about agents' alcohol use following an incident involving two agents earlier this month, according to published reports.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson had reportedly warned supervisors about agents' alcohol use after two counter-sniper officers were involved in a car accident on March 7, during a presidential visit to Miami.

The agent driving the vehicle passed a field sobriety test and was not arrested. However, it was suspected that alcohol was involved.

Warnings: Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is catching criticism for last week's drunken incident in the Netherlands

The Washington Post, which broke both the story about the incidents in the Netherlands and in Miami, cites 'people familiar with the incidents' as the paper's sources.

Last week, three Secret Service agents tasked with protecting President Obama on his trip to the G7 summit in the Netherlands were sent home and suspended after a night of drinking after one of the agents was found passed out on the floor in their hotel.

When the U.S. Embassy in Amsterdam learned of the incident from the management of the hotel, the agents' superiors responsible for the president's travel plans were immediately notified.

On Tuesday, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan confirmed that the federal agency 'did send three employees home for disciplinary reasons.'

The unnamed agents were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.

Anonymous sources familiar with the embarrassing episode told The Post that the agents are members of the elite Counter Assault Team.

The Secret Service staffers allegedly got sloshed the day before Mr Obama arrived in the Netherlands for the high-level G7 talks with other world leaders to discuss the crisis in Crimea.

The incident comes on the heels of a 2012 scandal where a dozen Secret Service agents hired prostitutes in Cartagena, Columbia, during preparations for President Obama's visit to the South American country.

In the aftermath of the reported debauchery, Pierson was named the first female director of the male-dominated Secret Service last March.

In a bid to change the culture of the agency, the Secret Service has adopted a new set of rules that prohibit any staffer from consuming alcohol 10 hours prior to being on duty while on an official trip.

The agents at the center of the incident in the Netherlands were part of a large entourage consisting of military and State Department personnel sent as an advance team to prepare for President Obama's week-long trip to Europe and Saudi Arabia.

A source told the paper that one of the agents caught drinking just hours before a briefing Sunday was a 'team leader.'

The Counter Assault Team is considered the most elite of all Secret Service units, its highly trained members responsible for protecting the president if he comes under attack.

Secret Service Director Pierson traveled aboard Air Force One with Mr Obama and is expected to accompany him to the Middle East on the next leg of his trip.

Sources tell the Post that the Netherlands incident enraged Secret Service managers because it happened so close to the incident in Miami.

Following the Miami incident, the two officers involved were sent back to Washington D.C.

The two officers involved are part of the uniformed division, sources told the paper, and following the wreck they notified their superiors.

They were ordered back to Washington as part of the agency's 'no tolerance' policy.

Both officers continue to work for the Secret Service.

The Secret Service says the Sunday incidents haven’t compromised Obama’s security.
