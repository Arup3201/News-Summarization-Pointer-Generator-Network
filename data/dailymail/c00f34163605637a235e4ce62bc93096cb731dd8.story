A little girl who had been suffering from a rare form of cancer gave her best friend, and fellow sufferer, some surprise news to cheer her up.

'Juni! You're going to Disneeeylaaaand!' Violet, 4, said excitedly in a video to her chum who is just 3.

Both girls were having cancer treatment for retinoblastoma which affects the eye after meeting  at Seattle Children's Hospital.   

The girls became friends the moment they met as they went through treatment together.

Best friends: Juniper and Violet are best friends who are both battling the same rare form of cancer

The girls bonded over their love of Disney characters. Violet always wanted to meet Mickey Mouse and Juniper is a huge Minnie Mouse fan. 

The idea for Juni's trip came after Violet was sent to Disney thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in December 2013.

The charity allowed her to break the news to Juni by appearing in a heartwarming video which has now been posted on YouTube.

Dressed in a shimmering Cinderella costume she wore on her own Make-A-Wish trip, Violet dances around her her bedroom. 

'You're going to twirl like a princess,' she said as she twirled around. 'And do your princes pose. And wave like a princess,' she continued.

Violet told her friend about everything she could expect to see, including 'Mickey and Minnie nose-kisses.'

Dreams come true: Violet went to Disneyland first, and when she heard her friend Juniper was going, she wanted to send her off with a farewell video -- while wearing a Cinderella costume

'Juni, I'm so happy your wish is coming true,' Violet said into the camera. 'I love you.' 

Danielle Ouellette, Juniper's mother, says her daughter cheered when she saw the video.

'She was super excited to see Violet and she knows what Disneyland is, so she got really excited,' she said.

She told ABC News that having Violet and her family around during their 6 months of chemotherapy was a huge help. She said they called the duo 'the flower girls,' because Juniper and Violet are both named for flowers.

When Juniper saw Violet's video, she kept repeating 'That's my violet! That's my friend!' Ms. Ouellette said. 

She said Juniper's trip to Disneyland helped her heal after the emotional and physical toll of her cancer treatment.

'During her cancer treatment, Juniper shut down,' she told CNN.

The cancer treatment destroyed her right eye, and she grew embarrassed after being fitted with a prosthetic.

But Juniper regained her confidence during her trip.

'The video has captured our hearts here at Make-A-Wish and we are excited to see that Violet and Juni were so enthusiastic about meeting Minnie and Mickey Mouse,' said Make-A-Wish spokesperson Josh deBerge. 

'The two tiny voices of a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old paint the perfect, simple picture of what we do at Make-A-Wish every day: give hope and strength to kids battling life-threatening medical conditions, helping them feel better and sometimes, even get better.'

The organization has 61 chapters nationwide and grants 14,000 wishes a year, with Disney engaging in one of every two wishes the nonprofit grants. 

Violet and Juniper are both in remission but because they only live an hours drive away from one another, they continue to have magical play dates together.
