The new Defense Secretary  said that transgender Americans should not be kept from military service, explaining that the 'best people in our country' should be able to serve.

Ashton Carter, who was sworn in as defense secretary last Tuesday, spoke during a town-hall meeting in Kandahar, part of a trip to Afghanistan.

NBC News reports that Navy Lt Cmdr Jesse Ehrenfeld, a doctor, asked Carter about transgender soldiers trying to serve in an 'austere environment' such as Afghanistan.

'We want to make our conditions and experience of service as attractive as possible to our best people in our country,' Carter said.

'I'm very open-minded about — otherwise about what their personal lives and proclivities are, provided they can do what we need them to do for us.'

'I don't think anything but their suitability for service should preclude them,' Carter added.

The American Military Partner Association, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families within the military, released a statement praising the comments.

The organization also stated there was a need to examine 'outdated regulations that prevent the estimated 15,500 transgender service members currently in uniform from serving openly and honestly.'

'Thousands of transgender service members are currently doing the job, and doing it well, but are forced to do so in silence,' President of the AMPA Ashley Broadway-Mack said in a statement.

'Forced to lie about something as fundamental as who they are in order to continue to serve.' 

Until last year, US service members could be dismissed for 'sexual and gender identity disorders,' according to the Palm Center, a think tank focused on issues of gender and sexuality.

In August, the Defense Department eliminated the regulation, though Army, Navy and Air Force regulations still require transgender members to be discharged.
