Stoke chairman Peter Coates says Marko Arnautovic is not for sale despite the Austria international being disgruntled at his lack of first-team starts.

Feyenoord are keen to take the 25-year-old on loan but Coates said he is a vital member of Mark Hughes’ squad.

‘He has been an important player for us and remains so,’ said Coates.

‘I don’t imagine we would even think about releasing him, even if there was an offer in January.

‘Bear in mind we have got the FA Cup to come then and there is also the chance of injuries.'

He told The Sentinel: ‘You have to have enough players, particularly at that time of year, and Marko remains a fine player in whom we still have very high hopes.

‘When he has come in he has done well this season and we have all seen what a wonderful player he can be.’
