What happens when you wring out a wet cloth in space?

This was the question posed by two high school students of Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield.

Fortunately, as he currently lives on board the International Space Station orbiting Earth, he was able to demonstrate the remarkable answer.

Another world: Some of the water droplets look like bubbles as they float away but most of the liquid stays together

Amazing: As Commander Hadfield squeezes the cloth, the water forms a strange 'tube' around his hands

Space science: The experiment was the idea of two Candian high school students

In the absence of gravity, water does not fall downwards and in effect forms a floating water 'tube' around the cloth.

Commander Hadfield's live experiment on board the space station was beamed back to 1,200 pupils at Lockview High School in Fall River, Nova Scotia.

The Canadian Space Agency had asked pupils to come up with a simple science experiment that he could perform in space.

Teenagers Kendra Lemke and Meredith Faulkner came up with the 'ring it out' experiment to test how a microgravity environment might affect and experiment using items which would already be available on board the station.

Speaking into a floating microphone, Commander Hadfield first soaked a wash cloth in water. 

Then, as it floats in front of the camera, he attempts to squeeze out at the liquid.

Incredible results: The water takes on a jelly-like form a clings to the astronaut's hand

Mind-boggling: Commander Hadfield has performed hundreds of simple scientific experiments in space and posted the results online

Demonstration: Earlier Commander Hadfield had sprayed ordinary drinking water onto the cloth

But without the force of gravity, it simply surrounds the cloth or attaches itself to Commander Hadfield's hands like a gel.

Pupils can be heard gasping with excitement as they witness the mind-boggling reality of life in space from their school's gymnasium.

Science teacher, John Munro, said: 'The Canadian Science Challenge was a great tool to teach about
space, science and weightlessness in my class. In addition, having this
opportunity to speak live to Commander Hadfield from space was a 
special treat the students will remember for a long time and may 
influence their future career paths.'

Commander Hadfield said: 'The space station is an orbiting laboratory where we work on unique experiments that may eventually improve life on Earth.'

Addressing the schoolchildren back in Canada, he said: 'I was about your age when I decided I wanted to become an astronaut. I hope that you remember today and continue to be curious about science and space. You are the space explorers of the future and the sky is no longer the limit'.
