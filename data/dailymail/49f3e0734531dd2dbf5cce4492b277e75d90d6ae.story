Two men have been arrested as part of a police investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring at a care home and guest house in south-west London.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police swooped on a home in St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex this morning and arrested 70-year-old John Stingemore, who formerly worked for Richmond council.

Another man, a 66-year-old from Norfolk, was also arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, according to the Met, and both are currently in police custody.

The two men were taken to Belgravia Police Station in London for questioning.

Peter Spindler, head of the Specialist Crime Investigations, said: 'This is a complex multi agency investigation supported by the NSPCC, CEOP and Richmond Social Services involving non-recent allegations of sexual assault against children.'

Stingemore is believed to be a former deputy of head of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, which is at the centre of the abuse allegations.

Operation Fernbridge was launched with the help of Labour MP Tom Watson to investigate claims that a group of senior 'Establishment' figures sexually abused 
boys in council care throughout the 1980s.

Former
 ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the 
royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, 
under-age males at a care home and nearby guest house.

It is claimed that boys living at Grafton Close were taken to Elm Guest House in nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.

One frequent visitor to the guest house is said to have been Liberal MP Cyril Smith, who is widely believed to have abused the teenage boys who lived in a hostel run by him.

A
 spokesman for Richmond Council, which ran the care home, said: 
'Richmond Council considers the safeguarding of all children and young 
people as an utmost priority and we take any allegations of abuse very 
seriously.

'As such we 
are offering our full support and co-operation to the police during 
their investigation. As the investigation is ongoing, it would be 
inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

Director
 of the NSPCC helpline Peter Watt said: 'We are assisting the police on 
Operation Fernbridge and are asking anyone with information to come 
forward.

'We will 
assist the police in gathering evidence and supporting those who come 
forward. It's important we recognise the massive impact abuse has on 
children and young people, often well into their adult life.'

Responding to a report that the man 
arrested in Norfolk is a Catholic priest, Father Mark Hackeson from the 
Diocese of East Anglia said: 'The church diocese takes safeguarding of 
children very seriously and so we will be co-operating fully in any way 
with the police investigation.'

Detectives 
launched the probe after they obtained a
 list of ‘prominent people’ who allegedly stayed at the guest house in 
the 1980s, compiled by a veteran child protection campaigner.

Visitor: Liberal MP and suspected paedophile Cyril Smith is said to have been to the guest house

Allegations of child abuse in the early 1980s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, London were made by Tom Watson MP in the House of Commons

Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police have stressed
 that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current 
occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats.

Allegations over Elm Guest House first emerged at a 1990 inquest into the suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir.

Child protection campaigners said at the hearing that in 1988 she told 
them boys from council-run Grafton Close had been taken to the 
guesthouse and abused.

Mrs Kasir had a 1982 conviction for running a brothel. But campaigners 
said the manager had no idea at the time of the child abuse.

Arrest: Officers from the Met have arrested two men as part of an investigation into an alleged paedophile ring

Officers working on the probe are liaising with Mr
 Watson, who told the Commons in October that politicians belonging to a
 paedophile network had used their powerful connections to escape 
justice.

He sensationally claimed a ‘senior aide of a former prime 
minister’ had links to a member of a child sex ring.

He added that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter 
Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear 
intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang.

In a statement, Scotland Yard said Operation Fernbridge would be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command.

It added: ‘The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially 
assessed under Operation Fairbank which was information passed to police
 by MP Tom Watson. Operation Fernbridge reached the threshold for a 
criminal investigation.’

Scotland Yard are still seeking further leads on the investigation, and have urged anyone with information to call the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000 or contact their local police force.
