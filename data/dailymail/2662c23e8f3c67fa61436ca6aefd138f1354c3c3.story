A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a deal that would remove the cap from a settlement to compensate former NFL players over the next 65 years for concussion-related claims.

Thousands of former players claiming their quality of life had deteriorated as they suffered from depression, memory loss and other consequences of repeated head injuries had previously balked at a $675million cap on claims.

Their claims were made in well over 200 lawsuits and then consolidated into the class action lawsuit that appears to have finally been settled.

'This is an extraordinary settlement for 
retired NFL players and their families — from those who suffer with 
neuro-cognitive illnesses today, to those who are currently healthy but 
fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future,' attorneys Sol Weiss and Christopher Seeger said in a statement shortly after the decision was announced.

U.S. District Judge Anita Brody also announced that final approval will hinge on a fairness hearing scheduled for Nov 19. Lawyers will now begin notifying eligible players of their possible payouts.

Those eligible include former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett, Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, who suffers from dementia, and former Indianapolis Colts tight end Ben Utecht (pictured above), who claims he is suffering from memory loss.

'We are grateful to Judge Brody for her guidance and her thoughtful analysis of the issues as reflected in the comprehensive opinion she issued today,' NFL senior vice president Anastasia Danias said in a statement.

Brody denied in January an adjusted settlement with a cap of $765million and a fixed payout of $675million - which was an improvement on the league's first offer.

The original settlement included $675million for compensatory claims for players with neurological symptoms, $75million for baseline testing and $10million for medical research and education.

The NFL would also have payed an additional $112 million to the players’ lawyers, for a total payout of more than $870 million.

There is now no limit to how much the league may be required to payout to settle claims, but many do not believe the league will pay out much more than $675million when all is said and done.

The revised settlement eliminates the cap on overall damage claims but retains a payout formula for individual retirees that considers their age and illness.

A young retiree with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, would receive $5 million, a 50-year-old with Alzheimer’s disease would get $1.6 million, and an 80-year-old with early dementia would get $25,000.

The NFL was also limited to 10 annual appeals of decisions that a former player was eligible for a monetary award under the first settlement offer.

Under the revised settlement, there is no limit on the appeals to a court-supervised 'appeals advisory panel.' But the settlement says if the NFL makes 'vexatious, frivolous or bad faith appeals,' the players' attorneys can petition the court for relief.

All former NFL players retired as of Monday's preliminary approval will be eligible for benefits of the settlement — not just the ex-players who joined in suits. In court documents, the judge estimated there are about 20,000 retired NFL players.

Brody scheduled the hearing, which will 
determine if it is 'fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best 
interests' of former players, for November to allow adequate time for 
them to be notified.

In the suits, the ex-players alleged that for decades the NFL knowingly concealed the risk of concussions and their long-term effects. In the settlement, the NFL makes no admission of guilt to those allegations. The players also are not required to prove that their conditions are related to football.

The diagnoses would be made by a network of physicians approved by the NFL and the players' attorneys.

Attorneys for the players will get paid, too. The judge will determine that based on a petition by the attorneys provided it does not exceed $112.5 million. That amount will be paid separate.

'These fees and incurred costs will be paid separately by the NFL Parties and not from the Baseline Assessment Program Fund, Educational Fund or Monetary Award Fund,' says the settlement notification to ex-players.

Players who do no opt out of the settlement may still raise objections to its terms. They are asked to notify the court in writing. They may also ask the judge for permission to speak at the fairness hearing.

Critics of the deal have said the league, with annual revenues approaching $10 billion, was getting off lightly. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement avoids the risk of a protracted legal battle.
