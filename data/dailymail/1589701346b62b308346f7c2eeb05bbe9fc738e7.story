Galatasaray have appointed former Italy manager Cesare Prandelli as their new coach, the Turkish club have announced.

The Istanbul outfit, who had held an 'exchange of ideas' with former Manchester United manager David Moyes, were looking for a new coach after parting company with Italian tactician Roberto Mancini last month.

Prandelli resigned as Italy boss after the national team's 1-0 defeat by Uruguay at the World Cup that saw them exit the competition early.

A statement on Galatasaray's official website read: 'Galatasaray football team's new coach Cesare Prandelli is coming to Istanbul this evening.

'Tomorrow (Tuesday) morning at the Florya Metin Oktay (training) facilities, he will be introduced to the players and staff.

'Galatasaray will sign the deal tomorrow (Tuesday) at 2pm (local time) at the Turk Telekom Arena.'

The 56-year-old Prandelli, who had two years left in his contract with the Italian Football Federation, guided Roma and Fiorentina before replacing Marcello Lippi at the helm of the national team in 2010.

He led the Azzurri to the final of Euro 2012, where they lost to Spain, and a third-placed finish in last year's Confederations Cup.

Mancini led Galatasaray into second place in the Super Lig behind Fenerbahce and also won the Turkish Cup, but left after one season in charge.
