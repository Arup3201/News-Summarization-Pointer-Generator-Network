Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her neighbouring garden

An 83-year-old woman launched a shocking harassment campaign against an Army sergeant major and his young family who lived next door after the children’s football landed in her garden, a court heard.

Ethel Watkins breached her restraining order just one day after it was put in place, allegedly verbally abusing her neighbours as well as banging on the walls and setting off her own burglar alarm to deprive the children of sleep.

Watkins is even said to have taunted the young mother about the loss of a six-month-old baby and allegedly said she hoped her husband ‘wouldn’t come back from Afghanistan’.

The family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were subjected to ‘some of the nastiest harassment’ that a police officer said he had seen in ten years on the force.

Watkins originally admitted a charge of harassment in July this year and narrowly avoided prison because of her age, instead receiving a fine and five-year restraining order preventing her from contacting the family.

But she was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance for allegedly resuming her campaign on the quiet street in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

Today she faced the Loughborough Magistrates’ Court accused of breaching the order on four separate occasions.

The court heard the family, who now live in Cyprus where the Sgt Maj is based, moved in next to Watkins in 2011 because they wanted to make a ‘fresh start’ after the loss of their baby and initially got on well with their new neighbour.

The mother even confided in Watkins, who lives alone, about the death of the child but the relationship turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in Watkins’ garden.

The investigating officer in the 
original case, Pc Chris Perry, of Melton Police, said at the time: ‘It 
was some of the nastiest harassment I’ve seen in the 10 years I’ve been 
doing the job. 

‘It was used to totally try and mentally scar and control the victim and make her feel worse than she possibly could.’

Taunted young family: Just a day after a restraining order was put in place against her, Watkins allegedly continued her campaign, verbally abusing her neighbours as well as banging on the walls, setting off her burglar alarm to deprive the children of sleep and making rude gestures as she passed their house (left)

Carol Huston, prosecuting, said the trouble then escalated rapidly, with Watkins setting off her own burglar alarm to prevent the children from sleeping. 

Watkins would regularly insult the mother with songs she had made up, the court heard.

Mrs Huston said: ‘She would repeat over and over things like “You’re poison, an evil woman. Go back to where you come from, you witch”.’

Mrs Huston said that on September 3 Watkins was in her front garden when she started making vomiting noises when the neighbour came outside to take her sons to school. 

She added that on occasions, the taunts referred to the dead child.

She said: ‘Watkins would shout words similar to, “What kind of life would the child have had if it lived?”’

The
family were asked by police to log every incident to build up a dossier
of evidence against Watkins. Pictures the family took included the 
widow flashing a V sign as she passed their home.

She
was eventually arrested and appeared in court on July 25 where she 
admitted harassment and was given the restraining order. However, just a
day later Watkins allegedly committed her first breach.

Giving
evidence via videolink from Cyrpus, the mother claimed she ‘couldn’t 
believe it’ when Watkins allegedly renewed her campaign.

She told how the children were playing in a paddling pool when Watkins began shouting over the fence.

The
court heard she was singing about being ‘on top of the world’ because 
she had avoided prison, and spoke loudly about how she hoped the soldier
wouldn’t return from Afghanistan ‘but probably would because he would 
hide behind others’. 

The mother said: ‘She spoke about us being vultures and that we were in it for the money. 

‘My heart was racing. I couldn’t believe what she was saying. 

‘I can’t explain how it made us all feel. It was totally destructive.

Quiet street campaign: The family moved into the street (house pictured far right) to make a 'fresh start' next to Watkins' house (centre) and initially got on well with her

‘I know what she was trying to do to us. Her aim was to get us out of the house. She said that she managed to get the previous neighbours out. 

‘I felt her aim was to get us out of the house. Why? I don’t know. Was it the children? I just don’t know. Unless you were involved in it, you can’t understand what we were going through.’

Watkins committed three further breaches of the restraining order in early September. She made retching noises at the family, called the mother ‘scum’ and insulted the children.

The woman said: ‘I can’t explain what she’s done to us without getting upset. When it’s directed at you and your family and your security it’s totally destructive and it has been.’

The hearing was told that while the mother and her sons were in their garden, Watkins held a Dictaphone over the fence and said into the machine: ‘I just want everyone to hear the hooligans. I’ve never heard anything like it.’

Giving evidence from Cyprus, the Sgt Maj said the continuing harassment had prevented him returning to Afghanistan.

He said: ‘I can’t protect my family if I am in Afghanistan. It is hard enough as it is over there just talking to your family by telephone. 

‘It is hard to take knowing your family are being abused.

‘I’m a proud man. I’m proud of my job. I am 6’1” and a well-built soldier who has served his country in war zones all over the world. But here I was frustrated by a very old lady.

‘It felt like there was little I could do to protect my wife and children while I was away from home. 

‘Peace and quiet was the reason we moved up there, and all I wanted was her to leave my family alone.’

Watkins denies breaching a restraining order.

The trial, which was adjourned to December 18, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
