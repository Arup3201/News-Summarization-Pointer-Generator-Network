A new menu from a swanky London restaurant promises to be every dieter's dream, offering a full three-course meal with a total of just 500 calories.

The new low-calorie gourmet menu is on offer at The Balcon, part of London-based Sofitel St James hotel group.

Dieting diners and the calorie-conscious can enjoy meals such as baked tomato filled with tuna mousse on cucumber tartar (clocking in at a very low 65 calories) from the so-called De-Light menu.

Two of the restaurant's dishes are molten mango cake, 130 calories, left, and Cornish sea bass with turnips, carrots, beetroot and caramel sauce, 225 cals, right

This can then be followed by a seared Cornish sea bass fillet, turnips and carrots and red beetroot caramel sauce at a healthy 225 calories.

For dessert guests can finish with a molten mango cake with a light coconut ice cream at a guilt-free 130 calories.

What the menu lacks in calories it makes
 up for in price, with starters costing from £7, the cheapest main course
 costing £18.50, and desserts costing £6.

It was initially launched in 2010 and is available across a selection of Sofitel addresses around the world.

There are over 300 low-calorie recipes already developed, so diners can enjoy a range of three-course meals that total between 500 and 700 calories.

The chefs keep the menu choices low-fat by using strong flavours and spices instead of high-fat ingredients, and healthy cooking methods such as steaming and poaching are used in place of frying.

Vincent Menager, The Balcon's head chef, said: 'With the De-Light menu you can indulge without the guilt.

'The menu is perfectly well-balanced and bursting with flavours at the same time, ideal for a delicious lunch on the go or for a healthier dinner.'
