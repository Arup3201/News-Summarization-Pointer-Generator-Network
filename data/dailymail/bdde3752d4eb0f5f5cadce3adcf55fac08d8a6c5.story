Vow: Prince William is on a mission to clamp down on the brutal murder of elephants, rhinos and tigers for ivory

Prince William has vowed to destroy all 1,200 ivory artefacts in Buckingham Palace to 'send a message' to illegal elephant poachers.

The priceless collection includes a throne from India that belonged to Queen Victoria, as well as fans, tankards, statuettes, and furniture.

But sources close to the prince say he feels strongly about putting 'his money where his mouth is'. If successful, he will go on to urge other heads of state to follow suit.

A long-term supporter of animal rights charities, the Duke of Cambridge makes regular speeches imploring world leaders to adopt a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal poaching in the lucrative trade.

On Thursday, he joined his father Prince Charles to a summit in London urging industry members to 'follow the money' to chase the brutal gangs, just days after the pair released a multi-lingual appeal for people to condemn illegal poaching across the world.

At home in Clarence House, William is said to have ordered for all ivory items to be hidden from sight for years.

Speaking at a conference last year, the 
second in line to the throne said: 'The forces that are currently 
destroying some of the world's most endangered species are sophisticated
 and powerful, but this week we are seeing the creation of an equally 
powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them.'

The royal collection now under threat mainly consists of gifts handed to the Queen by leaders across the world.

Palace sources insist they were all acquired 'in full knowledge of relevant legislation'.

However, experts have hailed the suggestion as a powerful move that will have significant impact.

'It's difficult to imagine a stronger
 symbol of the horrors of ivory than Buckingham Palace publicly 
destroying its own,' Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith told the Independent 
on Sunday.

'Good for Prince William for pushing this.'

However, the move, the latest in a 
number of bids by the prince to protect elephants, has sparked outrage 
in the art world as experts claim destroying works 'of the highest 
order' is 'menacing'.

Royal collection: There are over 1,200 items in the Royal Collection which are listed as containing ivory, including this throne and footstool which comes from India and dates to 1850

Destroyed: This ornately carved cup and lid, and this sword hilt, which both feature in the Royal Collection, would both be ground to dust under plans from Prince William

This ivory cockade fan was made in 1790 for the then-Prince of Wales, and later King George IV

The royal collection mainly consists of gifts handed to the Queen by leaders across the world.

Brian Sewell, art critic and elephant-protection supporter, told the Independent on Sunday: 'We have to recognise that [these items] exist.

'Ivory was a treasured material that was worked on by craftsmen of the highest order during the Renaissance... It's pointless.

'I can't see the connection between saving elephants and destroying works of art made centuries ago.'
