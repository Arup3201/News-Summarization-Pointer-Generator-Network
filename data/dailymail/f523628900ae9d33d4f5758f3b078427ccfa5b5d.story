Jimmy Savile was given his own keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital, it emerged yesterday.

The gold-plated set was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed.

The extraordinary revelation came as NHS chiefs came under mounting pressure to start an inquiry into Savile’s freedom to sexually abuse child patients.

He was given bedrooms or an office at three hospitals, and yesterday more former patients came forward to say he abused them on children’s wards.

There are growing fears NHS bosses turned a blind eye to sick and disabled children being attacked by Savile because he raised so much money for them.

Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where nurses warned children to ‘pretend to be asleep’ when the Jim’ll Fix It star came calling – made £40million from his fundraising.

The TV entertainer volunteered as a porter to gain access to children recovering from cancer and brain surgery, and sexually assault them. He said hospital chiefs ‘realised I might be useful to them’ and boasted he was ‘untouchable’.

A former Stoke Mandeville nurse yesterday
 claimed managers were ‘well aware’ that Savile – given a bedroom at the
 hospital for two decades – was a child abuser. Holly, from Dover, told 
LBC radio: ‘Jimmy Savile molested one of the patients on the paediatric 
unit. He was not supposed to go on any children’s wards unaccompanied.

‘Stoke Mandeville were well aware of 
what was going on. For them to say now they knew nothing is complete 
lies. They knew. It makes me so angry. He raised all this money for 
them. There has been a massive cover-up.’

The
 National Association for People Abused in Childhood said it had been 
‘inundated’ with calls about Savile. Chief executive Pete Saunders said:
 ‘Two this morning told us that not only did Jimmy Savile abuse them at 
Stoke Mandeville but a doctor did as well.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband called for 
every institution connected to Savile to hold a ‘far-reaching 
investigation’ into ‘who knew what when about what was happening and why
 nothing was done about it’.

Tory MP Rob Wilson, an aide to the Health Secretary, demanded an independent inquiry into the scandal at Stoke Mandeville.

Mr Wilson said: ‘It is being alleged that
 his money-raising made him untouchable, despite the information that 
circulated about his behaviour. It must be a priority that the hospital 
answers these concerns as soon as possible before huge damage is done to
 its reputation.’

He added: ‘I am astonished to learn 
Savile had keys to Broadmoor, one of the highest security hospitals in 
the country. From what we’ve learned he should have been locked inside 
the institution, not been given the keys.’

One
 Broadmoor victim claimed the Top Of The Pops presenter put his hand up 
her nightdress when she was 17 after walking in on a group of girls 
watching TV in 1969.

Alison 
Pink said: ‘I felt absolutely disgusting afterwards, like I had been 
used as a piece of meat for his sexual gratification.’

She said Savile kept his own mobile home
 in the grounds of the Berkshire hospital, where patients include 
Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe.

‘He definitely had his own keys – they
 were gold, especially for him. Both male and female patients thought it
 was very strange. He could access any of the girls’ bedrooms.’

Alison, who has since had a sex 
change and is now Steven George, 60, of Portsmouth, added: ‘He made very
 good friends with patients on the male ward, which was full of sex 
offenders.’

Broadmoor hospital did not deny Savile 
had been given keys, but said the allegations related to a time when it 
was run as a ‘separate, somewhat isolated’ organisation. A spokesman 
said volunteer access and activity at Broadmoor was now strictly 
controlled and the hospital operated ‘within strict child and adult 
safeguarding guidelines’.

Meanwhile, psychiatric nurse Naomi Stanley told the Guardian that a patient told her she had been frequently abused by the star while she was in hospital in the 1980s.

She said the young woman said Savile had raped her repeatedly near the stage of the theatre at the hospital and that Savile had claimed 'nobody would believe her and he could do what he liked' when she threatened to report him.

The woman told the nurse Savile was 'very forceful' and 'treated her like she was an animal', and the nurse was left with no doubt the woman was extremely distressed by the alleged attacks.

Leeds General Infirmary, where Savile raised also millions of pounds and was given his own office, has declared ‘shock’ at claims he groped vulnerable children recovering from surgery while volunteering as a porter. Two more victims came forward there yesterday.

Thirteen police forces have now taken statements from people claiming they were raped or molested when they were children by the late BBC presenter, who died last October aged 84.

Scotland Yard has branded Savile a ‘predatory sex offender’ who preyed on children as young as 13 for four decades in a nationwide campaign of abuse.

Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which is responsible for Stoke Mandeville, said it was supporting the police inquiries and would take further action ‘if their findings suggest that we do need to’. It also said it had advised staff to contact police if they had any concerns.

West London Mental Health Trust, which covers Broadmoor, said it had not received any allegations of abuse from patients, their representatives or from staff, but would co-operate with police if they investigated.
