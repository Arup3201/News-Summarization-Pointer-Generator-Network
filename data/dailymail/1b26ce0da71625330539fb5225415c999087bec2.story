Speaking out: Dr Charles Alessi said doctors treat patients as 'conditions rather than people'

Many older patients’ lives are becoming a misery because they are being prescribed up to 18 tablets a day for different illnesses, a senior government health adviser has warned.

Dr Charles Alessi said modern medicine treats patients as ‘conditions rather than people’ and urged doctors to stop practising ‘medicine by body part’ which leads to the over-prescribing of many drugs.

But he also said that older patients needed to be more resilient and take control of their illnesses by leading more pro-active lives.

Speaking at charity Age UK’s For Later
 Life conference, Dr Alessi, who is lead adviser for preventable 
dementia in Public Health England, said: ‘Lots of medicine is starting 
to lose its way. It’s become far more reductionist – we practise 
medicine by body part.

‘We 
end up treating conditions on their own.

'So somebody with diabetes and 
dementia, who has had a stroke, has a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs to 
take in a day and it is very difficult to do that.’

And he said many give up on the pills anyway because they are so fed up with it dominating their lives. 

He
 said: ‘Most people who are put on medication for long-term conditions 
are very rarely on the same medication a year later because they have 
stopped taking them, because every normal person would if they’re on 18 
drugs a day, because there is very little time to do anything else.’

Almost
 half of over-65s have three chronic health problems, such as high blood
 pressure, diabetes, and arthritis, leading to many taking an array of 
drugs every day and having to cope with the side-effects.

Dr
 Alessi, who is also chairman of the National Association of Primary 
Care, said there was a need for a ‘personalisation of medicine’ in which
 doctors would discuss a patient’s priorities with them.

But
 he also said that older patients must act too and take charge of their 
illnesses by finding support from someone who ‘loves you’.

High numbers: Dr Alessi said some elderly people are on 'a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs a day'

He said: ‘We need to give control back to people and we give control back to people by increasing their resilience.

‘The steps to do that are remarkably simple: be active, connect with people.

'Somebody loves you somewhere, you must belong somewhere, look around you, connect with people around you.

‘Try to learn something every day; try to help somebody else around you and be aware of your surroundings. That’s all you need to do. That activates you.’

Earlier this year Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for NHS patients to be ‘treated as people’.

Since April, doctors’ practices have had to assign every patient aged 75 or over a named, accountable GP.
