Faf du Plessis overcame an early test of nerve and patience to score 82, AB de Villiers made 65 not out and David Miller struck a vividly aggressive 49 as South Africa posted 281-5 Tuesday in a Cricket World Cup semifinal against New Zealand which has been heavily affected by rain.

Showers forced the players from the field after 38 overs, with South Africa 216-3. When players returned an hour and 54 minutes later the match had been shortened from 50 to 43 overs per innings.

South Africa added 65 runs in the five overs available after the resumption, leaving New Zealand to score 298 under the Duckworth-Lewis system to reach a World Cup final for the first time and after their seventh semifinal appearance. 

Neither side have made the World Cup final, but that will all change in Auckland and you can follow all the action with our scorecard.
