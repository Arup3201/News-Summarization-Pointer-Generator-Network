A toddler is battling a rare condition that keeps erasing her personality and all the skills she has learnt.

Evelyn Kealy, who is 22 months, has been diagnosed with West syndrome, a rare and serious form of epilepsy in infants.

At her worst, she was having up to 200 seizures a day and was given just 11 months to live.

Evelyn Kealy (pictured with her mother, Lisa) has West syndrome which is a form of epilepsy. Every time she has a seizure she forgets all of the skills she has learnt and her personality changes

Every time she has a relapse, she loses all of the skills she has learnt, including the ability to smile and giggle. She even likes different foods and toys.

Her mother, Lisa, 36, and father, Paul, 35, even say that it is like having a newborn baby all over again.

‘After each episode, it feels like we have lost a daughter and gained a new one,’ said Mrs Kealy.

‘We bought her a really cute musical cot mobile with little pink bears, and it always used to calm her and make her smile. But then afterwards, she would cry as soon as we switched it on!’

But Evelyn’s parents could not be prouder of her.

Mrs Kealy said: ‘Evelyn has been through a lot, but she keeps on smiling. She still can’t walk, talk or feed herself, but she keeps on getting better and we are hopeful that things will continue to improve.’

When she was diagnosed, Evelyn's parents were told she was unlikely to live for much more than a year but she was then put on a new drug which has dramatically improved her health - she has not relapsed for a year

Because of her condition, Evelyn requires round-the-clock care and her seizures have also left her with hearing loss and visual impairment.

She was diagnosed at just three-months-old after her mother noticed she was jerking in her highchair at their home in Syston, Leicestershire.

After she was rushed by ambulance to the A&E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary, an EEG scan confirmed she had West syndrome.

Mrs Kealy and her road worker husband were devastated by the diagnosis, but quickly pulled themselves together for the sake of Evelyn and their other daughter, Mary-Kate.

Evelyn was diagnosed with West syndrome when she was three-months-old. Her mother took her to hospital when she noticed her jerking in her high chair. An EEG (pictured) confirmed the diagnosis

Evelyn was put on steroids which caused her to gain two stone in just eight weeks (pictured). She had to wear clothes made for a five-year-old and her mother was told her condition was the worst the doctor had ever seen

Mrs Kealy said: ‘At first, we cried. But we realised that we were parents to two children and had responsibilities, so instead we threw ourselves into researching the condition.

‘The doctors were explaining things in medical terms, and I didn’t understand what they were talking about. I wanted to know exactly what they were saying to me.’

For the next three months, Mrs Kealy stayed by Evelyn’s side in hospital as she underwent a series of tests.

Her husband would pick Mary-Kate up from school after work and drive straight to the hospital so the sisters could bond.

Eventually, Evelyn was discharged from the hospital, but her health deteriorated after she suffered side effects of a steroid medication prescribed to prevent her seizures.

Evelyn's sister Mary-Kate (pictured with Evelyn), eight, says she is extremely proud of her 'special sister'

In just eight weeks, she gained two stone in weight and was forced to wear clothes for five-year-olds.

During a hospital appointment, distraught Mrs Kealy was informed by a neurologist that Evelyn’s EEG scan was the worst he had ever seen, and it was unlikely she would live past 14 months.

He offered only one alternative - a medication called Vigabatrin that could help to save her life.

Mrs Kealy said: ‘I managed to hold it together until I got back to my car, and then I completely fell apart. I just didn’t know what to do. I thought we’d lose her.

‘But I still had to pick Mary-Kate up from school, so I took a deep breath, put my makeup on and tried to stay strong.’

Miraculously, the medication worked and Evelyn has been relapse-free since Christmas last year.

Evelyn could have another seizure at any time but, for now, her parents say they are just enjoying getting to know her as she is

Whilst aware a seizure could take Evelyn from them again, Mr and Mrs Kealy are enjoying getting to know their daughter.

In fact, Mrs Kealy says Evelyn is a positive influence on the whole family, saying that she has taught them to be more ‘humble’ and appreciative of their health.

Office manager Mrs Kealy said: ‘We have a really good life, and we are a very happy family. It’s important for people to know that it isn’t the end of the world if their child is born with this condition, or any other disability.

‘Mary-Kate loves that Evelyn is different from all the other children. She is always saying how proud she is of her “special sister”, and how no-one else has a sister like Evelyn.

Mrs Kealy said: 'We have a really good life, and we are a very happy family. It's important for people to know that it isn't the end of the world if their child is born with this condition, or any other disability'

‘At first I questioned if we would ever be able to cope, but this is our norm now - it doesn’t feel strange to us any more.

‘Evelyn is such a funny little character, and I wouldn’t change her for the world.’

West syndrome, which affects just one in 4,000 children, is characterised by infantile spasms, which make the sufferer bow forwards or backwards.

In 90 per cent of cases, the spasms start before the child is one and will usually continue as they get older.

Often West syndrome is mistaken for colic, as the spasms are initially irregular and the cries the child makes during or after the seizure are very similar.

Each episode typically lasts only one or
 two seconds, but the effects can be devastating, and many children will
 develop lifelong learning difficulties.

Each episode typically lasts only one or two seconds, but the effects can be devastating, and many children will develop lifelong learning difficulties.

Dr Nahin Hussain, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said: ‘Evelyn’s loss of developmental skills is known as regression - in essence she is developing backwards.

‘It is absolutely essential that West syndrome is diagnosed and treated early, as the longer the syndrome is left untreated, the greater the risk that the child will develop severe developmental problems - including learning difficulties.

‘West syndrome is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy, and we will continue to monitor Evelyn as the pattern of seizures can change over time.

‘But Evelyn is responding to her medication, and is progressing well.’

West syndrome is a rare and serious form of epilepsy in infants.

It usually occurs in babies between the ages of three-months and one.

It affects one in 4,000 to 6,000 children and is more common in boys than girls.

The condition usually starts with brief, infrequent attacks and is often initially misdiagnosed as colic.

The seizures usually see the child bend forward with stiff arms and legs.

Typically, each episode lasts a few seconds and there is then a pause followed by a further spasm.

Many babies with the condition see their development slow or even reverse until the spasms are brought under control.

Many children with West syndrome go on to have other kinds of seizures later in childhood and a lot have learning difficulties.

The prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the condition.
