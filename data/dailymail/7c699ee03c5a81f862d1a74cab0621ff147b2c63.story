Hull City’s £7million summer signing Robert Snodgrass will be sidelined for six months after suffering from a dislocated kneecap.

The Scotland international suffered the injury during Saturday’s 1-0 win at QPR, his league debut for the Tigers following his arrival from Norwich City.

But Snodgrass, 26, will now be missing until next year.

Speaking at Humberside Airport ahead of Hull’s trip to Belgium to face Lokeren in their Europa League qualifier, manager Steve Bruce revealed: ‘He dislocated his kneecap and damaged the ligaments which hold it in place.

‘It looks as if it will be a repair job and an operation.

‘We’ll know more today (Wednesday) because he’s seeing a specialist in London. The odds are he’ll need an operation and that will be six months.’

Bruce, though, hopes to bring in a replacement before September 1.

‘We didn’t envisage losing Snodgrass for six months, which is a huge blow to us,’ he went on. 'He was brought in to give us that little bit of quality in the midfield area.

‘It’s a huge blow but hopefully we’ve got 10 days to bring in a replacement.’

Meanwhile, Bruce confirmed his interest in Lorient striker Vincent Aboubakar but said no bid had yet been tabled.
