Glennis Brierley was stabbed four times by her schizophrenic son 

A paranoid schizophrenic stabbed his mother to death after convincing himself his parents were part of a satanic paedophile ring. 

Matthew Brierley killed his 64-year-old mother the day after he moved back into her home in Littleborough, Rochdale. 

The 45-year-old called 999 from a phone box in the town centre after the attack, telling officers: 'I've just killed somebody.' 

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court. 

Glennis Brierley had been stabbed four times in the neck and chest by her 'delusional son', it was heard. 

On December 14, he attacked the grandmother-of-two before alerting emergency services to her address. 

The court heard how 'alarm bells starting ringing' when he discovered ornaments were missing from his mother's attic. 

An argument ensued in which his mother threatened to report him to social services. 

In interviews with detectives, Brierley said: 'I just went for her. I threw her down and got the knife and stabbed her. I was aware I’d just stabbed my mother and I didn’t have any response to it.'

He said he had previously considered killing both of parents who he thought were part of a 'paedophile syndicate'. 

He went on to tell police about young girls who had gone missing in the Rochdale area. 

Matthew Brierley attacked his mother at herhome in Littleborough (pictured) before phoning police from a phone box in the town centre 

Prosecuting Raymond Wigglesworth QC said: 'It’s clear from the psychiatric history that over the years (Matthew Brierley) has harboured a number of delusional beliefs and one of those was that his parents were members of Satanic paedophile conspiracy. 

'He claimed to be in fear of them.'

Recommending that he be sentenced to a hospital order, forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Haddock told the court Brierley’s ‘actions were driven by mental illness’.

Brierley will be sentenced at 10am tomorrow.
