Microsoft was left red-faced over Christmas when its Xbox One service was infiltrated by hackers, and now its facing a similar problem. 

Reports on a German website claim that a list of 1,800 Microsoft-owned Minecraft's usernames and passwords have been published online. 

With access to these details, a security expert warns that criminals could break into accounts, change settings and buy virtual items.

The hack was reported by Heise Online, and many of the verified accounts (selection pictured) are believed to belong to German gamers. It is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials, but security analyst Graham Cluely wrote : 'Possibilities range from phishing attacks, malware, or even a security breach'

The hack was reported by Heise Online, and many of the verified accounts are believed to belong to German gamers. 

It is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials, but security analyst Graham Cluely wrote on the Hot for Security blog: 'Possibilities range from simple phishing attacks, keylogging malware stealing players’ details as they log into the game, or even a security breach at Minecraft itself. 

'Let’s hope it’s not the last one - because the game has over 100 million registered users.'

However, a Microsoft spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that no Mojang.net service was compromised. 

'Normal industry procedures for dealing with situations like this were put in place to reset passwords for the small number of affected accounts.'

Minecraft was created in 2009.

At the start of the game, a character is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available. 

He added that when the company discovers lists gamertags, usernames and passwords posted online, it takes 'immediate action to protect  customers by reviewing valid credentials and resetting account access when necessary.'

Based on the huge number of registered users, the hack is relatively small. 

But, as Mr Cluely pointed out: 'If unauthorised users exploited the exposed email addresses and passwords they could not only log into other people’s gameworlds, but also download a full version of the game which normally sells for €19.95 Euros ($26.95 or £17.95).'

Plus, once a cybercriminal has access to a person's email address they could use it hack other accounts, send spam or spread malware. 

Mr Cluely additionally said there is no guarantee that the hacker who released this current list also doesn't have more 'in their back pocket.' 

Microsoft bought Mojang in September in a deal said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion).

The game is available on PCs, Android, iOS and Windows Phone, as well as games consoles including the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

However, a Microsoft spokesman told MailOnline that no Mojang.net service was compromised. Although the number of released details is a small percentage of the game's 100 million user base, Mr Cluely said there is no guarantee the hacker who released this current list doesn't have more 'in their back pocket'

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials.

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs.
