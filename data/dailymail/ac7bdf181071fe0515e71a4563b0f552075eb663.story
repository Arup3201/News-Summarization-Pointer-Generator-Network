The girlfriend of a Texas man who was aboard the missing Malaysian Airlines flight believes he is still alive.

Philip Wood, a 50-year-old father-of-two originally from Dallas who was working for IBM in Beijing, was one of the 239 people on board flight 
MH370 that vanished on March 8.

His girlfriend of two years, economics teacher and fellow American expat Sarah Bajc, has said she believes the flight did not crash and simply needs to be found.

'My feeling is that they’re still alive,' she told NBC News on Monday. 
'I've had that feeling the whole way through. I haven't ever 
believed that the plane crashed.'

Holding out hope: Sarah Bajc said she believes her boyfriend, who was on the missing plane, could still be alive

She added that recent revelations that the plane was intentionally diverted gave her a 'glimmer of hope… because the alternative is that they're just missing'.

She said she is now holding onto hope 
that a flight simulator taken from of the pilot's homes might reveal 
recorded drills that could show if he had practiced landing on water or 
in trees.

Wood's brother Tom Wood told NBC Dallas Fort 
Worth that he is also thinking positively.

'There might be a
 good ending to this,' he said. 'I mean, we're believing there is a miracle in 
this.'

He went on: 'I know he's strong. He's a strong guy 
and he's a smart guy and he can survive things, you know, he can survive
 this. He can survive this, he is surviving this.'

Happier times: The couple had been together for 2 years and were about to move to Kuala Lumpur

Hopeful: She said she hoped that Wood, who worked in China for IBM, was simply missing

The family has set up a Facebook 
page to help gather information, which Bajc says will allow her to 'at least I feel
 like I’m doing something useful'.

Bajc, who lived in Beijing with Wood, said her faith in 
humanity was 'dashed' at the thought that someone might have hijacked 
the plane, but is thankful for the support through social media.

The couple were about to move to Kuala Lumpur for Wood's new job there with IBM.

'I'm still hoping and kind of making 
assumptions that I'll be together with Philip and that we will have a 
fairy tale ending, and enjoy many, many years together,' she said.

Missed: Wood with his two sons, Chris and Nick, who have said they do not know if they will see him again

Wood, who is divorced, has two sons, Chris and Nick, who said last week that they do not know if they'll ever see their father again.

'I'll
 never really give up hope, but that doesn't mean that I won't accept 
that he won't come back,' one said. 'We 
may not ever see him again, and odds are we won't. I'll be able to come 
to terms with that.'

Wood was one of three Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air traffic control on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members.

Ten days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel.

Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese.

Families vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian ambassador.

No clues: Malaysian authorities revealed on Tuesday that checks into the background of all the Chinese nationals on board the missing Malaysian jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism

Support: A woman writes a note for the missing flight MH370 at a mall in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia

'What we want is the truth. Don't let them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn't life, what's the point? Where is compassion?' asked one middle-aged woman.

'You're always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their heart why we want you to answer us. Because you're always tricking us, telling us lies,' added one man.

The plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing less than one hour into the flight.

A massive search operation has yet to find any trace of the plane.
