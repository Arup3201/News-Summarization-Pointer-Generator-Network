A five-month-old male orangutan has been sent to the Milwaukee County Zoo to try and find a suitable surrogate mother after failing to bond with his real mom.

Little Kecil rejected his birth mother after he was born in January at the Toledo Zoo in Ohio.

Officials there placed the baby primate with a surrogate and chose a female who already had experience in such a role.

There's a new orangutan at the Milwaukee County Zoo. Four-month-old Kecil arrived at the zoo on  May 19. He came from the Toledo Zoo because he could not bond with his mother.

The Zoo has an excellent track record with successful orangutans births in the past, but on this occasion, the mother simply didn't want to get to know her offspring.

Yasmin has raised her own offspring in the past, she experienced a difficult delivery and had shown little interest in caring for the baby.

The Zoo’s keepers and veterinary team worked tirelessly to offer mom Yasmin and the baby private, off-exhibit quarters in Toledo, in the hopes that they would bond but in the end it was decided he should be moved to Milwaukee.

'This baby’s well-being has been a priority since he was born, and we feel it is of utmost importance that he is raised by one of his own species,' Jeff Sailer, the Zoo’s executive director, said.

'Every orangutan matters; this is an endangered species that could go extinct in the wild during this baby’s lifetime.'

M.J. was the surrogate mother for Mahal, a baby orangutan who was brought to Milwaukee in 2008. Mahal died last December.

A new bond: Baby Kecil is being moved from the Toledo zoo to Milwaukee where he will be cared for by M.J., a surrogate mother. (Pictured here, baby Kassiu, a gorilla who died last year and his mother Naku at Milwaukee Zoo)

Kecil is the second baby ape to live at the Milwaukee County Zoo this year. The first was a female gorilla named Kassiu who was born in March but also died a month later.

Kassiu was the first gorilla born in Milwaukee in 22 years.

M.J. is considered a 'proven surrogate,' and she and Kecil slowly have been introduced to each other at the Milwaukee County Zoo.

Kecil, which means 'little man' in Indonesian, is in good health and was accompanied to Milwaukee by one of his keepers from Toledo, who has remained at the zoo to work with a Milwaukee zookeeper to assist in the transition.
