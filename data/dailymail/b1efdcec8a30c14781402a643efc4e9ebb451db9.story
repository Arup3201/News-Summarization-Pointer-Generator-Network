Emerging from the shadows of their secret command outpost, these are the members of the only all-female fighting unit in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.

Around 150 women have formed the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in Arabic - which is playing a major role in the fighting, according to a monitoring group.

The katiba, made up of mostly Kurdish women, is fighting beside the Free Syrian Army against government forces on the streets of Syria's second city.

'The Kurdish popular committees have 
set up the first women's battalion, comprising some 150 women fighters. 
The battalion is named the Martyr Rokan Battalion,' said the Syrian 
Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the regime.

'While women are now fighting 
alongside the rebels, pro-regime forces and Kurdish militia, this is the
 first women's battalion as such,' said Observatory director Rami Abdel 
Rahman.

'Women are now playing a major role in the fighting in Syria,' he said.

The formation of the women's battalion was announced 
in Ifrin, the scene in late 2012 of violence pitting Kurdish fighters 
against Arab rebels fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

Assad's troops pulled out from 
majority Kurdish areas in 2012, and while Kurds have been split over the
 anti-regime revolt in Syria, most have chosen to remain neutral in the 
conflict.

An agreement in Ras al-Ain on the 
Turkish border brought an end to fighting between Kurds and Islamist 
rebels, though some activists have described the agreement brokered by a
 prominent Christian dissident as fragile.

The announcement of the Kurdish 
women's battalion comes a month after pro-regime forces set up the 
National Defence Forces, a paramilitary unit in which women of all ages 
have been asked to volunteer.

Anti-regime activists have also distributed images of women fighters joining rebel ranks.

'Women are fighting on all the fronts
 now, though it's possibly the Islamist rebel ranks that have the fewest
 women taking part in them,' the Observatory's Abdel Rahman said.

A female activist in the coastal 
province of Latakia said women often transport weapons and supplies for 
rebels as they are less likely to be searched at army and security 
checkpoints.

Troops loyal to Assad and rebels have
 been locked in a deadly stalemate in Aleppo, Syria's largest urban 
center and main commercial hub, since an opposition assault last summer.

Eight months later, 
the rebels hold large parts of the city and its outskirts, including 
several army bases. But they have been unable to overcome the regime's 
far superior firepower.

Today, Syria's government and rebels both demanded an international investigation into an alleged chemical weapons attack, as the country's feared arsenal became the latest propaganda tool in the two-year-old civil war.

President Barack Obama said the U.S. is investigating whether chemical weapons have been deployed in Syria, but noted that he is 'deeply sceptical' of claims by President Bashar Assad's regime that rebel forces were behind such an attack.

'Once we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,' Obama said in a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.

The use of chemical weapons by either side is a nightmare scenario. Along with its warnings about Assad, the West is just as concerned that rebel forces, including some linked to Al Qaida, could get their hands on Syria's chemical weapons supplies.

Despite the importance, any clear confirmation of the nature of the attack that took place on Tuesday in the northern village of Khan al-Assal, killing at least 31 people, is unlikely. Syria's government seals off areas it controls to journalists and outside observers.

The two sides blamed each other for a chemical attack without offering clear proof or documentation, as has frequently been the case in the Syrian civil war.

If confirmed, it would be the first time a chemical weapon has been used in Syria's war that has already killed an estimated 70,000 people.
