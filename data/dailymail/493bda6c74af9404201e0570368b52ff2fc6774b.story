Lord Judge: The Lord Chief Justice said issues such as prisoners' voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not the ECHR in Strasbourg

The former head of Britain’s judiciary last night demanded sweeping reforms to the Human Rights Act to make it clear our courts do not have to follow European rulings.

Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice until September, said issues such as prisoners’ voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not for the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg.

He warned that a dangerous ‘democratic deficit’ was emerging, adding: ‘My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported.’

Lord Judge accused the ECHR of seeking to expand its role into a US-style ‘Supreme Court of Europe’ and said: ‘In my view, the Strasbourg court is not superior to our Supreme Court.’

Last night, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – who would like to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act but  cannot while in Coalition with the  Lib Dems – welcomed the judge’s speech.

It came just days after another senior judge, Lord Justice Laws, called on British courts to stop deferring to Strasbourg on every issue and develop their own rulings.

Ministers are still deciding what to do to comply with a European  court decision on prisoner votes originally made in 2005. Strasbourg said the UK’s blanket ban was contrary to prisoners’ human rights, but the Commons has voted in favour of continuing to deny all prisoners the vote.

Speaking at University College  London, Lord Judge said: ‘You can argue for and against prisoner voting rights. You can argue for and against the whole-life tariff. Reasonable people will take different views.

‘My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported, and we should be wary of the danger of even an indirect importation of the slightest obligation on Parliament to comply with the orders and directions of any court, let alone a foreign court.

‘Ultimately this is a political, not a judicial, question.’

The former Lord Chief Justice said Britain’s unwritten constitution included the core principle that Parliament is sovereign over the Supreme court. But recent judgments made it unclear whether it was the same case for Strasbourg.

Justice secretary: Chris Grayling said the ECHR¿s role in the UK needs to be ¿curtailed¿ and the Human Rights Act replaced

‘My profound concern about the long-term impact of these issues on our constitutional affairs is the democratic deficit,’ he said.

‘Are we – are they – prepared  to contemplate the gradual  emergence of a court with the equivalent jurisdiction throughout Europe of that enjoyed by the Supreme Court in the USA? Thomas Jefferson would have strongly advised us against it.’

Lord Judge concluded changes should be made to the 1998 Human Rights Act to make it clear that Britain’s Supreme Court is ‘at the very least, a court of equal standing with the Strasbourg court’.

Mr Grayling said the ECHR’s role in the UK needs to be ‘curtailed’ and the Human Rights Act replaced.
