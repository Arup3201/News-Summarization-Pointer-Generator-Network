Busted: Darien Meheux turned himself in to police in connection with the slaying death of Jasmine Benjamin

An ex-boyfriend has been arrested for the slaying of the Georgia college freshman whose parents learned of their daughter's death hours after her body was discovered through a Facebook post forwarded by one of her friends.

Darien Meheux, 18, of Lawrenceville, Georgia turned himself in Thursday evening to sheriff’s deputies in Ellaville in Schley County, about 115 miles south of Atlanta, and was booked for murder, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Meheux is charged with mortally suffocating Jasmine Benjamin, a 17-year-old Valdosta State University nursing student whose lifeless body was found on a college dorm study room couch on Nov. 18.

'Right now, he's the sole suspect,' Steven Turner told People Magazine. 'They had dated at one time. The status of their relationship back in November is not necessarily clear whether they were dating or not.'

The story gained notoriety for the bizarre manner in which Benjamin's mother, Judith  Brogdon and her stepfather, James Jackson, learned of their daughter's untimely demise.

The parents told CBSAtlanta.com in the days after Benjamin's death that the university never notified them of the tragedy, but they discovered what had happened when they saw a Facebook post from a friend.

The university, for its part, reportedly said its Valdosta State University Police Department notified both the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department and the Lawrenceville Police Department.

A Gwinnett County sheriff's deputy then notified Benjamin's parents of her death on Sunday afternoon, or several hours after Benjamin's body was discovered.

'For someone to be so insensitive not to
reach out to the family, or not even to keep up with what's going on 
because it's a holiday and you're going away on vacation or whatever 
you're doing – it's very, very hurtful to say the least,' James Jackson 
told CBSAtlanta.com.

Benjamin and Meheux reportedly both hail from Lawrenceville, Georgia, and even - for a short while - together attended Valdosta State University, although the college is now saying that Meheux only enrolled for a single semester.

The Journal-Constitution could not reach Benjamin’s family for reaction, although a private investigator that had been hired by the family to look into her death, Robin Martinelli, said the arrest was not a surprise and that the family had suspected Meheux from the outset.

'I think they’re absorbing everything today,' Martinelli reportedly said. 'This just happened.'
