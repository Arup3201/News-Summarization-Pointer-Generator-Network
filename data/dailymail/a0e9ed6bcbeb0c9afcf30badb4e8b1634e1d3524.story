A stag do company has been accused of encouraging anarchy on Britain's streets as it allows people to take part in a full-scale riot.

For £79 participants are handed batons, dressed in body armour and allowed to batter riot shield wielding 'police' while experts show them how to throw petrol bombs.

Wish.co.uk say the experience is so popular it is booked up every weekend for the next four months, and is based on an industrial estate close to the spa town of Droitwich, Worcestershire.

The website promises those who take part: 'Noise, fire, smoke and fear are the main ingredients. All hell breaks loose. You’ll come under a barrage of debris'.

But local Tory MP Peter Luff says he wants it banned.

'This is completely dangerous and quite wrong. I would hope it is illegal and if it isn't I would like to know why not,' he told MailOnline.

Training: Experts train them how to use weapons and also recreate scenarios like kettling

'Not only are they showing people how to instigate a riot, they are showing them how to instigate a riot well. It is utterly irresponsible.'

He has already written to the chief constable of West Mercia Police about the issue.

Residents in his Mid-Worcestershire constituency are also very upset.

One wrote to Mr Luff to say: 'This riot class is really worrying me. It is things like this that make me frightened to leave the house.'

Another said: 'Is this really the best thing to teach young people - to go and torch things and loot shops. It is disgusting.'

Promise: Participants are told they will have an atmosphere of 'noise, fire, smoke and fear'.

Birmingham MP Jack Dromey, whose own constituency was caught up in the 2011 riots said: 'Rioting is not a game. It is utterly irresponsible and insensitive not least because there are thousands of victims scarred to this day by the memories of what happened in that terrible August week of last year.'

The activity's webpage says thrill-seekers arrive and have a full briefing on modern riot control techniques.

Then they are trained to use batons and four foot riot shields, see a petrol bomb demonstration and learn the basics of casualty evacuation. They will also be kettled.

After lunch they are split into a group - one acting as police, the other as rioters - before a ' pitched battle will ensue'. They then switch sides.

The company is being criticised as offering something in bad tastes after Britain's cities suffered days of violent riots in 2011.

Tackling that argument a spokesman said: 'We are not inciting a riot, nor are we encouraging anybody
to break the law.'
