Cancer isn't a laughing matter but that didn’t deter one brave woman from carrying out her wish to have a joyeous dance around the operating theater with her surgery team just before her double mastectomy on Tuesday.

Deborah Cohan, 44, is a mom of two, a Buddhist and an Ob/Gyn (obstetrician/gynecologist) in San Francisco, California.

When she found out last month that she was having surgery she decided she wanted her final moments pre-op to be filled with joy and so she set about organizing the dance-off to Beyoncé’s upbeat dance hit Get Me Bodied.

Every member of the surgical and anesthesia teams joins in dancing, but it is Deborah leading the way and she shows she’s also got some serious moves as she wiggles and twerks her way through the six minute plus workout.

The clip has been posted on YouTube and has already attracted more than 250,000 plays.

The operating theater dance was part of a virtual Get Me Bodied Flash Mob that Deborah decided would help her recover from her operation.

She also requested that friends and family make similar videos of themselves dancing to Beyoncé so that she could watch them during her recovery.

‘I have visions of a healing video montage,’ she wrote. ‘Nothing brings me greater joy than catalyzing others to dance, move, be in their bodies.’
