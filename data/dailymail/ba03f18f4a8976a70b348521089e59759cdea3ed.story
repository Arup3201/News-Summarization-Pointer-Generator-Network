Hope for pancreatic cancer sufferers: Abraxane 
- already licensed for advanced breast cancer - is given as an injection costing £600 a month

A new drug that improves survival in sufferers of pancreatic cancer - one of the most deadly forms of the disease - has been licensed for use in the UK.

Abraxane increases survival by two months on average, but some patients are  living up to two years longer.

The drug is being hailed as the biggest advance in almost two decades against a  disease that kills four in five sufferers within a year.

About 8,500 Britons are diagnosed each year and survival remains the lowest of  all the major cancers.

Only
 five per cent of patients are still alive five years after diagnosis 
and  there has been no improvement in five and 10 year survival rates in
 the last 40  years.

Tumours
 are hard to detect because the pancreas is buried deep in the body so  
symptoms emerge when the disease is at an advanced stage.

Pancreatic
 cancer claimed the lives of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and author  
Iain Banks, and was the disease which triggered the character Hayley 
Cropper in  TV’s Coronation Street to end her own life.

The drug, which is already licensed for advanced breast cancer, is given as an  intravenous injection costing £600 a month.

Patients
 with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with Abraxane and chemotherapy 
 lived for 8.7 months compared with 6.6 months for those on standard 
treatment.

Trial data shows that Abraxane, also known as nab-paclitaxel, increases the  number of patients alive after two years.

Professor
 Juan Valle, consultant oncologist and honorary professor of medical  
oncology at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, said ‘Pancreatic cancer 
is one  of the most difficult cancers to treat and treatment options 
remain extremely  limited, with those diagnosed typically only surviving
 for three to six months.

‘Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine represents a significant advance in the  treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and offers new hope in the battle  against this intractable disease.’

Professor David Cunningham, Director of Clinical Research at The Royal Marsden,  said Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cancer, yet progress in  treating the disease has been limited.

‘One-year survival for patients with pancreatic cancer is still less than 20  per cent and we have waited for many years for an alternative to current  treatments.

‘Today’s news represents a significant step-forward in the treatment of  metastatic pancreatic cancer.

‘It is important that nab-paclitaxel, which has  demonstrated an increase in overall survival, should be available for patients  with this cancer.’

It is the first new medicine licensed for 17 years for the disease and the NHS  rationing watchdog Nice will decide later this year whether it should be funded.

But makers Celgene are applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund next month to enable  patents in England to get it in the meantime. Ali Stunt, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer Action charity, said ‘Abraxane  could really benefit eligible patients in the UK and Ireland.

‘For decades there have been very few treatment options for pancreatic cancer,  therefore this news will be a welcome advance for patients who are at a stage  in their life when time is at an absolute premium.’

Alex Ford, chief executive officer of Pancreatic Cancer UK charity, said ‘The  specialist nurses on our Support Line assist patients and carers with questions  around treatment and care on a daily basis.

‘With so few treatment options available to patients, we know that they want  access to new and effective treatments such as Abraxane.’
