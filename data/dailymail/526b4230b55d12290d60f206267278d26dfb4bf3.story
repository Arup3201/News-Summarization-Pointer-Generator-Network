The BBC has posted a job advert to find the next editor of Newsnight after the controversial decision to drop a probe into claims of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile cost the previous boss his job.

Peter Rippon, who took over at Newsnight in 2008, 
stood aside when his explanation in a blog about why the investigation 
was pulled was criticised for inaccuracies and had to be corrected.

He was asked to leave by Director General George Entwistle who later resigned himself in the face of mounting criticism of his handling of the crisis.

A job advert has been posted on the BBC's website to find Peter Rippon's replacement and a Head of News Programmes.

The salary is quoted as under band SM2, the second tier of senior BBC management, where average pay is around Â£100,000 a year.

Among the attributes which candidates are expected to have it reads: 'Making tough decisions at very short notice is an important part of the job and the programme must never shy away from the controversial and the sensitive.'

An independent inquiry led by former Sky head of news Nick Pollard has been set up to examine whether there were any failings in the BBC's management of the 
Newsnight investigation.

Controversy: The decision by Newsnight to drop an investigation into claims of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile led to editor Peter Rippon standing down

A shocking report published yesterday by the Met Police and the NSPCC detailed how Savile used his celebrity status to 'groom the nation' committing 214 confirmed offences of sexual abuse.

Lawyers for the victims have already 
instigated compensation claims against the BBC, NHS and education 
authorities for failing to stop the serial predator. The payouts could 
run into millions of pounds.

The job advert for the Newsnight role reads: 'After a period of intense external and internal scrutiny and challenge Newsnight is looking for a tough, innovative and creative individual with sound editorial judgment to be the next editor.'

Whoever lands the post will answer to a new Head of News Programmes - a role which the corporation is also recruiting for.

Director of news Helen Boaden, and her deputy Stephen Mitchell, temporarily stood down from their jobs at the BBC in November while the Pollard review is ongoing.

However, it is understood they returned to their roles before Christmas.
