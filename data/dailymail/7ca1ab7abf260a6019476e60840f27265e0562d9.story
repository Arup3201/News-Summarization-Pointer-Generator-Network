This is the moment a bionic squirrel manages to lift a very heavy-looking dumbbell... or so it appears.

After a few quick seconds inspecting the weight, the creature gets itself into prime lifting position - and is ready to put his muscles to the test.

Incredibly, he appears to lift the weight into the air - holding it proudly just below his head.

Ready to go: The creature looks as though he is willing himself to pick the dumbbell up

Lift me up: The squirrel appears to pick up the weight - and even looks shocked at his own ability

However, the scene is really just a clever trick set up by photographer Max Ellis in his garden in Teddington, London.

Mr Ellis, who has photographed bodybuilders for a number of projects, attached the dumbbell to a wire.

He then slowly lifted the weight as the squirrel held on, creating the illusion.

Mr Ellis said: 'I had a few weights lying around so thought it'd be fun to see whether the squirrels which regularly come into our garden would check it out.

'Did anyone see that?': The trick was achieved using a pulley system - set up in the photographer's garden

'I used some see-through wire so it looked extra natural and then it was just a matter of time waiting for one to get into the perfect position.

'It took a while and as they are wild animals you need a lot of patience. But fortunately one eventually sat in the exact spot I was hoping for and I managed to get a few snaps.

'I nicknamed him Arnold Squirrelnegger.'

'Maybe I'll give it another go': The photographer said he nicknamed the creature Arnold Squirrel-negger
