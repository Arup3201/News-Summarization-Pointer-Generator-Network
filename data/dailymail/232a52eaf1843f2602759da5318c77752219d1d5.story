The Duke of Edinburgh was seen with what appeared to be a painful-looking black eye as he was presented with one of Canada's highest orders.

Prince Philip was presented with insignias of Companion of the Order of Canada and the Commander of the Order of Military Merit by Governor General David Johnston, the Queen's representative in Canada, yesterday.

Prince Philip arrived in Toronto for what was described as a 'private working visit'.

The Duke and Gov Gen Johnston appeared in matching ties during the presentation yesterday.

He was due to present a new regimental colour today to the Third Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment in Toronto. 

Regimental colors are a kind of ceremonial flag considered the most prized possession of every regiment.

The 91-year-old prince has served since 1953 as the regiment's colonel-in-chief, an honorary title often bestowed on members of the Royal Family.

A sprightly looking Duke of Edinburgh was seen last month accompanying the Queen and a pregnent Duchess of Cambridge as they visited Baker Street tube station to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground.

And he was back to his devilish best as he joked with an 83-year-old factory worker about her talent for 'stripping' earlier this month.

The Queen’s 91-year-old husband 
proved he still has a twinkle in his eye as he indulged in a string of 
double entendres with Audrey Cook, who has worked at the at the Mars 
factory in Slough for 69 years.

Mrs Cook explained that when she 
first joined as a 14-year-old girl in 1944 she was employed in the 
stripping department where the original Mars bars were cut by hand.

'Stripping department? That’s Mars bars?' Philip enquired. 'I thought it was something else!'

Undeterred the factory’s 
longest-serving staff member told him innocently: 'It was all done by 
hand then.' To which the flirty nonagenarian replied: 'Well, most 
stripping is done by hand.'
