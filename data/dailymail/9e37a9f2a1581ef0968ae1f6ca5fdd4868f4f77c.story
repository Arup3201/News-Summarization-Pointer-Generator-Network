An oil magnate worth $19 billion who agreed to pay his ex-wife $1 billion in their divorce, has now changed his mind after seeing his personal fortune fall by half amid a rout in oil prices.  

Harold Hamm, 69, of Oklahoma City  called the $1 billion payout ruling 'fair and equitable,' publicly thanked the judge and said he was happy to have the
case behind him last month.

Now the chief executive of
Continental Resources  has appealed the divorce ruling.

Hamm considers it 'erroneous and inequitable,' according to filings in Oklahoma
County Court.

Hamm's appeal hasn't been previously reported. The appeal,
and an earlier one by 58-year-old ex-wife Sue Ann Arnall, will be heard by
the Oklahoma Supreme Court. 

Arnall, a former Continental
executive, has claimed the ruling wrongly allowed the oilman to
keep more than 90 percent of the wealth the couple built
together. (Arnall resumed using her birth name after the
divorce.)

The dueling appeals are the latest twist in one of the
largest divorce cases in U.S. history. 

The contest pits
America's top owner of oil against an attorney ex-wife who is
intent on showing that the Hamm fortune stemmed from hard work -
both his and hers - during a 26-year marriage.

Hamm contends his 68 percent Continental stake, which he
owned before meeting Arnall, surged in value during the marriage
due to 'passive' or market factors, like rising oil prices.

The
distinction is crucial, since Oklahoma law says only marital
wealth stemming from active efforts or skills of either spouse
should be split in a divorce. In essence, the most successful
oilman in America is arguing that he was lucky.

'The vast majority of the enhanced value of the CLR
(Continental) stock was due to market forces and contributions
of third parties,' Hamm said in an appeal filing.

The appeals risk dragging Hamm, and his oil company, deeper
into a personal divorce battle that's already in its third year. 

The fight has featured costs in the tens of millions of dollars
and a 10-week trial that ended last month. The case was
conducted mostly behind closed doors, after the judge ruled that
opening it would harm Continental.

November's billion-dollar judgment, while one of the biggest
on record, allowed Hamm to retain his majority stake in
Continental. But he recently told the court he would need to
borrow money to fund the divorce payments, filings show.

Continental, the top driller in North Dakota's oil boom, has
publicly claimed its CEO's divorce has had, and will have, no
impact on its business or operations.

But according to new court documents reviewed by Reuters,
the firm's minority shareholders have also paid a price.

In a filing, Continental complained to the court about 'all
of the expense that Continental's minority shareholders have
been dragged through' as a result of the divorce case.

How much time and money Continental has spent so far on its
CEO's divorce case isn't clear, however.

A review of Securities and Exchange Commission filings shows
the firm has not disclosed any such costs to shareholders.

Continental did not respond to questions for this article.
The company hasn't said if Hamm will reimburse it for the costs
incurred. Hamm's lawyer, Craig Box, didn't respond to requests
for comment. 

Hamm's appeal 'raises the stakes for his ex-wife,' said
Carolyn Thompson, an Oklahoma family law specialist. As Arnall
presses Hamm for billions more, the oilman will try to convince
the state's high court that what he owes her 'should be reduced
or eliminated,' Thompson said.

Arnall was awarded a total of about $1 billion, in cash and
assets, to be paid over a period of years. In his appeal, Hamm
is contesting most of that award, including the court's order
that he split with Arnall $1.4 billion derived from the rise in
his Continental shareholdings. He also lists 26 other
investments or properties he says were wrongly split up as
marital assets. These include the couple's former Oklahoma City
home and a $17 million California ranch, both awarded to Arnall.

Hamm's appeal comes after the value of his Continental
shares has fallen by more than half, to $9.3 billion, down from
as much as $19 billion during the trial in August.

Continental's market capitalization eroded amid a recent
plunge in oil prices, which now trade near five-year lows of $57
a barrel. In response, Continental plans to sharply cut spending
next year.

Hamm founded Continental in 1967. When he and Arnall wed in
1988, the company was worth less than $50 million, filings show.

A month after the November 10 divorce ruling, Hamm asked the
court to consider new evidence: a chart showing that Continental
shares dropped 22 percent as oil prices fell 16.5 percent
earlier this month.

'The dramatic drop in oil price post-trial and the
corresponding drop in the CLR stock price demonstrate the
overriding impact of the oil price on the value of the stock,'
Hamm said in a court filing dated December 16.

Hamm's request is unusual, said family law specialist
Thompson. In her view, she said, the courts should only consider
evidence admitted during the trial, which ended in October. 

Arnall believes she was short-changed when the court
failed to take account of both spouses' contributions to
Continental, according to a person familiar with her case.

As an attorney for the company in the 1980s and 1990s,
Arnall was part of Continental's successful lawsuits against a
string of industry competitors. The millions it won were
reinvested in drilling. Between 1996 and 2008, she formed and
often managed Continental's profitable oil and gas marketing
divisions, the person said.

Continental hasn't commented on Arnall's previous roles
there.

At trial, Arnall told the court that during the marriage,
Hamm had often refused to put property in both spouses' names.
That became a point of contention between the couple, according
to people familiar with her version of events, since she worried
Hamm would leave her.

The couple had filed twice previously for divorce - Hamm in
1998 Arnall in 2005.

Arnall filed for divorce again, the current case, in 2012.  
At trial, Hamm admitted to spending $150,000 on an extramarital
pursuit, without offering further details. His relationship with
Arnall had been 'loveless' for years, his court filings said.

In their divorce battle, Hamm has sought to tweak the
historical record in his favor. Reuters reported in September
that Continental had altered its corporate timeline on the
company's website, and made changes to language in SEC filings,
in ways that could benefit Hamm's case. The revised timeline was
largely accepted by the court. It included claims that important
milestones, such as Continental's lucrative shift in focus from
natural gas to oil, came years before the marriage began.

In August, under questioning from Arnall's attorney, Hamm
testified that several statements on Continental's web site had
been incorrect and that he had only recently discovered the
errors.

Hamm has also sought to downplay Arnall's role. Among the
evidence the couple has battled over is a 104-page book
published in late 2012 and commissioned earlier by Hamm,
entitled 'Continental Resources - A Tribute to the Enid Years.'

It chronicles the huge success of Continental since it was
founded by Hamm in Enid, Oklahoma. The book, read by Reuters,
was written by longtime Hamm friend and fellow oilman Mickey
Thompson.

The saga contains no mention of Sue Ann Arnall. Thompson
said in an interview that he had intended to include material on
Arnall, a person he considered among the 'key players' in
Continental's rise. But after Arnall filed for divorce in May
2012, Thompson said, Hamm told him that 'Sue Ann was not going
to be in the book.'
