UK brand Lovestruck are the label behind Kate's latest maternity purchase and are sold at Topshop stores around the country

The Deirdre dress features a delicate print of tiny flowers and is available in the cream colour Kate is believed to have chosen, as well as purple.

With a mandarin collar and a cross over bust line the dress evokes the feel of the fifties, and the fully elasticated waist will leave plenty of room for the growing royal baby!

A big fan of the high street, Kate has helped many of her favourite brands enjoy a huge sales boost, with nearly every dress she is seen in selling out in hours.

Kate has always favoured simple, classically cut dresses and has often been seen sporting fun floral prints.

Kate's maternity style has thus far focused on loose fitting and feminine wrap dresses

Although she has has scaled back her public appearances since announcing her pregnancy with her first child, when she does step out she has mainly been seen in flowing wrap dresses which allow plenty of room for her expanding middle.

Zara, Reiss and Jigsaw, for whom she previously worked, have all experienced the ‘Kate effect’ on their sales when the 31-year-old has worn their pieces to events.

A fellow shopper tweeted: 'Oh Just an average day, Kate Middleton smiled at me! :) oh best bit... This was in Topshop! Truly Beautiful :) (sic)'.

Topshop's maternity range features trousers, tops and skirts, dresses jackets and jeans 'to keep you looking amazing in your new growing shape!'

Speaking to MailOnline, Layla Maan, a Business Development Manager, said: 'She really is stunning up close.

'I am still in shock! I had to sit down after.

'She was just browsing next to me and then was shortly in the personal shopping area which I usually am in but they had security there.'

Kate wore her hair in a bouncy ponytail, with her trademark pearl earrings and casual black leggings.

She swapped her court shoes for flat boots and wrapped up warm with a short fur trimmed brown jacket.

In January, Kate was spotted in another high street store, Gap, on the hunt for some maternity jeans.

Happy as Kate may be to shop on the high street, Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton - the designer behind the duchess's wedding gown for her 2011 nuptials - recently revealed she wants to design maternity wear for Kate.

When asked if she would be making any maternity clothes for Catherine, the acclaimed designer said: 'I hope I will be.'

However, with Sarah due to give birth to twins herself any day now, it's a good job Kate has been stocking up her wardrobe herself.
