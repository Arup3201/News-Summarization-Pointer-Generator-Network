While millions of families are squashed into cramped city flats with no outdoor space, the majority are dreaming of living somewhere else, according to a poll published today.

In an ideal world, they would like to live in a detached Victorian house in the South West of England, such as Devon or Cornwall, with a large garden, a garage and a walk-in wardrobe.

Around 3,500 homeowners were asked, if money was no object, where they would like to live and the sort of home they would like to own.

Despite having an unlimited budget, most people said they would like only four to five bedrooms although they would theoretically have enough money to buy a castle or a mansion.

Most British families, if money was no object, would choose a four or five bedroom house in The West Country, such as this thatched cottage in Goatacre, Wiltshire

The majority - 66 per cent - said they would like ‘a large garden as an essential part of their ideal property.’

Around half would like a ‘multi-car’ garage, and a similar number nominated a walk-in wardrobe as ‘a key feature for their dream home.’

And very few people want to live in a city, which suggests that millions living in London, Manchester, Birmingham and other cities are only doing so for their jobs.

When asked where they would like to live, only 14 per cent of people chose London, and just five per cent chose a large city or town other than London.

The most popular choice, selected by one in four people, was to live in a rural village, while a further 22 per cent chose a larger country town.

As well as the location and the bedrooms, those surveyed said a garden and a walk-in wardrobe were part of their dream home

Primelocation.com said 17 per cent would choose to live on the rural coast and 18 per cent would choose a seaside town.

The South West was ‘the clear winner’ with nearly a third of Britons nominating it as their dream location. The North East was the least preferred location picked by just 1.3 per cent of people.

Lawrence Hall [corr], from Primelocation.com, said: ‘Typical British reserve and understatement shines through in selecting of their ideal property.

‘Forget sprawling mansions or flash 
penthouses, the quintessential English country house with enough room 
for a family is what the majority of Brits view as their dream home. A 
quiet rural retreat is preferred to city life.

British reserve: Even given a theoretical unlimited budget, those surveyed still didn't plump for a mansion

‘With numerous chocolate-box villages spread across the South West, it is little wonder the majority of Brits would position their ideal home there.’

Mr Hall said the high price of a home in London, with some selling for tens of millions of pounds each, jars with the fact that so many people do not want to actually live there.

He added: ‘London is home to some of the most expensive prime properties in the world. High-spec townhouses, mansions and apartments attract some of the wealthiest buyers from across the globe.

‘But the bright lights of city-life appear less attractive for the majority of Brits who see their ideal home in a rural idyll 200 miles away.’

London fared poorly in the survey, with just 14 per cent saying it is their ideal location

It comes at a time that the average home in the countryside is already around £200,000, around £30,000 more expensive than a home in an urban area, according to the banking giant Halifax.

With an average full-time salary of £26,500, millions of people cannot afford to buy in either the city or the countryside, forcing soaring numbers of people to rent or live with their parents.
