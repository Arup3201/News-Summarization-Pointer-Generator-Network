The NYPD is investigating if there are other potential abuse victims of actor Stephen Collins after a recording of him purportedly acknowledging that he molested underage girls was released.

The audio comes from a 2012 counselling session he took part in with his estranged wife, Faye Grant.

Grant has said she gave police the audio only after Collins refused to seek appropriate treatment.

The NYPD is investigating if there are other potential abuse victims of actor Stephen Collins

The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after the attorney of his estranged wife Faye Grant withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin

The recording was first aired by celebrity website TMZ, but Grant denies giving it to them.

The site said that two NYPD detectives have interviewed the woman Collins allegedly admitted to molesting when she was 10 and are keen to track down other potential victims. The actor has not been charged.

Police looked into three cases of molestation and indecent exposure, but the alleged incidents are so old the statute of limitations has probably passed, officers believe. 

Collins’ divorce case with Grant has been complicated by the recording.

And the 67-year-old actor has lost roles as a result of it, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming film Ted 2.

His attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said on Wednesday that the actor was also losing residual income on the 7th Heaven series.

Last week it emerged that the divorce trial will be delayed because Grant’s attorney withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over divorce cases, granted a motion by attorney Larry Ginsberg to withdraw from the case on November 5.

Judge Mark Juhas, who was slated to preside over the trial, ordered the proceedings to be delayed until January 5 to give Grant time to find a new lawyer.

The former couple had been scheduled to start an eight-day trial on how to divide their assets and how much spousal support Grant should receive.

Collins, who starred in the series 7th Heaven, was not present in court. Grant represented herself at a hearing in which the trial was delayed and her estranged husband's lawyer sought to reduce her spousal support payments.

Kaplan said having Ginsberg withdraw hours before the trial's start would be 'visiting a terrible hardship on Mr. Collins.'

He said the actor has spent $1 million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay would probably cost him another $200,000.

Collins contends that his estranged wife should receive no support because the recording from a 2012 couple's counseling session and its subsequent posting by celebrity website TMZ has destroyed his career.

Gordon ruled on the motion after meeting in closed session with Ginsberg and Grant.

Kaplan, Collins' attorney, was kept out of the proceedings so that Ginsberg could give details on why he was leaving the case abruptly.

Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, left, 

Gordon said Ginsberg's motion was not motivated by an effort to delay the trial and that there was a complete breakdown in the lawyer's communications with Grant.

Collins filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year.

Grant, also an actress, has said in court filings she put her career largely on hold during her marriage to Collins, is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments.

Juhas refused a request by Kaplan to reduce Collins' support payments immediately.
