The manager at disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen’s store in Savannah, Georgia has blamed the fallen star’s recent troubles after she was recently busted by the cops.

Kristina Noelle Hoppe, 33, has been charged with battery after police were called to break-up a fight between her and live-in lover Dennis Maher on June 29.

According to a police report, Hoppe and Maher, 38, had both been drinking when they started to argue over money.

A source told the National Enquirer that Hoppe had been distraught over accusations that Deen had used a racial slur which resulted in her losing millions in sponsorships deals with brands including Target and Walmart. 

‘Kristina adores Paula, so she flipped out when her idol began losing everything due to racial slurs,’ a source told The National Enquirer.

‘She was crying and saying no one understands Paula, and they are going to ruin her life.’

In the police report Maher alleges that the incident became physical when Hoppe started hitting and he grabbed her wrist to stop her.

He alleges that he then pushed her away and that she threw a flower pot at him.

Maher was left with scatches on his neck and face and his shirt was ripped.

Hoppe has admitted to throwing the flower pot, according to the police report.

MailOnline spoke with Hoppe, but she wasn’t prepared to comment on the incident.

The Paula Deen Store is located next door to the chef’s 'Lady & Sons' restaurant in Savannah and sells a wide variety of goods branded with Paula Dean’s image and catchphrases like ‘Y’all’ along with autographed cookbooks.

Deen's has endured a turbulent time of it since the public disclosure of a legal deposition last month in which she admitted under oath to having used the N-word.

Last week Deen announced that she has cut business ties with the agent who 
had helped to make her a Food Network star and launched a media and merchandising empire 
that has largely crumbled in the wake of her admission.

Deen had worked with New York agent Barry Weiner for more than a decade. She 
has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the 
Food Network in 2002. She gave no reason for her parting with Weiner in a 
prepared statement.

'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, 
said in an email. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort 
and dedication over the many years.'

The Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off 
the air.

Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity 
endorser, dropped her soon after.

Retailers including Wal-Mart and Target said 
they'll no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans 
for her upcoming cookbook even though it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon.

Even 
the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a 
paid spokeswoman dumped her.

Weiner worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little 
more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned 
raves for her fried chicken.

In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled 
meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could 
turn her into a star.

'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula 
character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted 
Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.'

Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as 
Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.'

Deen's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath 
in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former 
manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her 
brother, Bubba Hiers.

Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an 
environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo.

Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her 
deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.'

That 
she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the 
companies paying to use her name and image with their products.

Neither were 
they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' 
show's Matt Lauer.

Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity 
chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million.

Her company Paula Deen 
Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to 
Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource 
Group.

Deen cast no blame in her statement announcing her split with Weiner. It 
ended by saying, 'Paula wishes him well in all future endeavors.'
