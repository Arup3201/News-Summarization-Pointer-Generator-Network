Overstretched GPs have been given the green light to strike thousands of patients from their lists.

So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope.

Some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home.

A further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval.

GPs say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and cannot provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Some of the worst-affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments.

On top of this, many GPs are retiring, moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession.

Figures from NHS England – obtained by GP trade magazine Pulse – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since April. Officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including Surrey, Sussex, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

Dr Maureen Baker, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘This is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for GPs. Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to, and GPs want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients.

‘No surgery wants to de-register patients. This is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs, with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring.’

So far this year, 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn.

Patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will easily find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Some of those removed by a practice in Watton, in Norfolk, now have to make 16-mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor.

Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘This is people just basically saying, “We are not coping.” They are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients.’

Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable. We must protect GP services and achieve real choice for patients.

‘Patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a GP.’
