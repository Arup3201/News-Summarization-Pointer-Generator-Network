The Duchess of Cambridge's decision to have her mother present when she gives birth was proven to be a good one today as it was revealed that Carole Middleton is trained to help women in labour.

The 58-year-old received emergency midwife training at a British Airways training centre in 1976.

During the training Carole learned how to cope if a passenger should go into labour while onboard.

Call the midwife? No need! Carole Middleton was trained how to cope with passengers going into labour during her air hostess training back in 1976

Carole attended BA's Cranebank centre in west London in 1976, and learned to cope with a whole host of emergencies.

According to OK! magazine's former royal correspondent Marcia Moody, who wrote Kate: A Biography, Carole's training was like 'an antiquated finishing school'.

She wrote: 'They were taught how to be good listeners, how to maintain good eye contact and always have a smile on their face.

'Many people commented on how composed the Middletons were at the royal wedding and it struck me that Carole's training provided exactly the right sort of skillset you might need to be a member of the Royal Family.

Fully trained: Carole attended BA's Cranebank centre in west London in 1976, and learned to cope with a whole host of emergencies, so could help daughter Kate when she goes into labour

'I'm sure part of it has rubbed off on Kate.'

In a break with royal tradition, 
Kate, 31, has said she will not employ a maternity nurse after the 
birth. Instead, she will live with her parents for at least the first 
six weeks after leaving hospital.

Kate's decision to stay at home with her parents following the birth means a future monarch 
will be starting life in a commoner’s home in Berkshire rather than in 
the splendour of a royal residence.

Kate
says she ‘just feels safest and most secure’ with her family and 
believes that no one could be better placed to teach her about bringing 
up a baby than her mother, who has three children of her own.

She
will particularly need her advice and moral support when Prince William
returns to work as a helicopter pilot after taking his paternity leave.

Kate’s
parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, recently bought a £4.85million 
Georgian manor in rural Berkshire with plenty of space for their first 
grandchild to run around.

Proud grandparents-to-be: Michael and Carole Middleton, recently bought a £4.85million Georgian manor in rural Berkshire and Carole has apparently been busy redecorating ahead of the birth

A
recent visitor said Carole, who is ‘over the moon’ at the prospect of 
being a grandmother, and has been busy overseeing the redecoration of the house – 
including the installation of a new kitchen and ‘nursery-style’ room.

‘Carole
fully intends to be part of this baby’s life and Catherine, for her 
part, plans to spend a lot of time with her parents, especially while 
she is waiting for the new apartment to be completed,’ they said.

‘And surely it is no bad thing this little prince or princess is given a taste of life outside of the Royal Family?’

Break with tradition: Kate, 31, has said she will not employ a maternity nurse after the birth. Instead, she will live with her parents for at least the first six weeks after leaving hospital as that is where she feels most comfortable
