Keith Bennett, 12,was snatched and murdered in 1964. He is the only moors victim whose body has not been discovered

The family of moors murders victim 
Keith Bennett have criticised police for not renewing the search for the
body of the 12-year-old whose mother died on Saturday without 
fulfilling her dream of laying him to rest properly.

They said they were fed up with ‘pointless platitudes’, amid claims that it was only because of a forthcoming TV documentary that officers 
carried out high-profile raids to trace a letter in which killer Ian 
Brady may have finally revealed the burial site.

Keith’s brother Alan Bennett spoke following the death of their mother, Winnie Johnson, at 78.

The mother, who was taunted until the very end by Brady, has asked that her grave have a plot left empty beside it for her murdered son's burial, if he is ever found, the Mirror reported.

Her family have vowed to continue her fight, after she spent her whole life trying to find Keith's remains, despite Brady refusing to tell her their location.

Meanwhile 74-year-old Brady’s health was reported to be fading amid claims that after 13 years on hunger strike, injuries he sustained after a seizure last month meant he is now too ill to be force-fed.

Mrs Johnson died after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the possible existence of Brady’s letter.

Last week Martin Bottomley, head of Greater Manchester Police’s cold case unit, said his officers would act on any credible new information about its whereabouts.

However following Mrs Johnson’s death, Alan Bennett, 56, accused officers of not taking reports of the letter seriously until spurred on by media attention.

He also claimed detectives – who have classified the search for his brother’s body as dormant after repeated efforts came to nothing – had ignored leads from two ‘credible’ witnesses in recent months. 

'In an open letter he complained that ‘all we receive is pointless platitudes and false statements that all new information will be treated seriously’.

And he warned: ‘As far as I am concerned, until Keith is found then he is still in the possession of Brady and Hindley.

‘Our fear as a family is that now my 
mother is no longer with us, this may be seen by the police and the 
media as some sort of closure to the case. This must not be allowed to 
happen both out of respect for Keith and my mother’s memory and for 
those of us who loved them both.’

Keith’s half-brother Kenny Johnson, 46, added yesterday: ‘Greater Manchester Police only act when they’re prompted. They’ve not been very helpful for years. It does all come down to money – it wasn’t high on their list of priorities. But it’s what people want, they want to find him.’

It is claimed that after being force-fed for 13 years, Brady, who is in a high-security hospital, has been receiving only water since fracturing two vertebrae in a fall five weeks ago as he can no longer sit up to be given nourishment through tubes into his nose.

Keith Bennett was on his way to visit his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester, when he was snatched by Brady and Myra Hindley on June 16, 1964.

Until her health failed her, Mrs Johnson made frequent trips to Saddleworth Moor where Brady and Hindley – who died in 2002 – buried four out of their five child victims.

Greater Manchester Police declined to comment yesterday on criticism of their handling of the search for Keith’s body or of their hunt for Brady’s purported letter.

Officers called me scum

Alan Bennett has cut a lonely figure during the 20 years he has dug in the peat on the bleak and windswept Saddleworth Moor. His tireless search has so far been in vain. And like his mother Winnie

Johnson before him, it is a quest he will pursue doggedly until his dying day.

For Winnie’s death at the weekend does  not bring her family’s suffering to a  close. Alan, 56, is the forgotten victim of the Moors Murders.

His elder brother Keith was snatched by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley as he walked the short distance to their grandmother’s home in 1964. The 12-year-old’s body has never been found. And the death of their mother has made Alan more determined to find where Brady concealed Keith’s body.

It is a search that has taken its toll on Alan’s life in many ways: ‘It’s always on my mind – I can’t get rid of it,’ he said. During his search, he even agreed to meet Hindley in the hope that she might give him a clue.

What drives him is more than brotherly love. He is also determined to ensure that Brady is not allowed the final insult of taking his secret to the grave.

Alan was just eight when Keith went  missing. On his website (searchingforkeith.com) he explains how they used to share a room in the end of terrace house in Eston Street, in the Longsight area of Manchester.  He recalls how they bent the street light which was positioned near their bedroom window so it almost came into their room.

‘We had the biggest bedside light in  Longsight. The room was flooded with an orange glow every night,’ he says. ‘Keith thought it was hilarious when we were told to be quiet and turn the light out.’

To this day, Alan treasures his brother’s 1962 school report card which noted how Keith struggled with reading, despite his brother’s attempts to help him. In return, Keith tried to teach Alan how to swim.

Alan adds: ‘Keith had little time for anything but laughter and nature. He was an ordinary, uncomplicated child.’

He recalls how Keith disappeared on June 16, 1964, four days after celebrating his  birthday. ‘He just vanished from our lives.’

Within days, the now well-known photo of his brother with a wide grin and NHS  spectacles appeared on a ‘missing’ poster in shops, on billboards and in newspapers.  Suddenly, for Alan and his other five siblings, Keith’s disappearance marked the end of the innocence of youth.

‘He was there one day and gone the next. I used to lie in bed at night talking to him, saying: “Where are you Keith?” At first we used to imagine he’d been kidnapped, then gradually you realise he’s not coming back alive.’

Alan was plagued by the ‘what ifs’ about that fateful day. Even when Brady and Hindley were convicted in 1966 for the murders of John Kilbride, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, the pair refused to put the Bennett family out of their misery by admitting they had murdered Keith, too.

In 1985, Brady finally confirmed that he had murdered Keith and Pauline Reade, 16.  The confession, which came out of the blue, led Alan to begin digging on the moors. He says: ‘It will never bring him back to life, but finding Keith and giving him a proper burial would be a way of bringing it to an end.

‘We went up every weekend and dug it until we hit rock. We went down until we couldn’t go any further.’ He was often accompanied by well-wishers who had been moved by the family’s plight. For their part, Greater Manchester Police called in archaeologists, anthropologists, geologists, geophysicists and geochemists – before giving up.

Keith’s body is the only one of the Brady’s victims not to have been found. Alan’s meeting with Hindley came after he wrote to her and she invited him to meet her in prison.

He was shocked when she grabbed his arms and sobbed as she repeatedly said sorry for her ruthless crimes. But although she did provide some maps before her death in 2002, it was not enough to pinpoint Keith’s body.

Alan’s decision to meet the Moors Murderess horrified his mother.

Anne West, the mother of Lesley Ann Downey, also condemned him as a ‘treacherous fool’.

But he felt justified because Hindley was the only person likely to reveal where his brother was buried.

Later, his mother said she understood what he had done.

The search, though, at what he calls ‘that lonely place’, has had an adverse effect on his family life. ‘I regret the effect it had on my relationship with my son Robert, whom I hardly ever saw,’ he says.

Last night, someone had placed flowers on the moors near to where Alan has spent years digging.

An accompanying card reads: ‘Both together at last’ – a reference to how  Keith and his mother are  reunited in heaven. It is a sentiment Alan cannot share.

‘Until Keith is found he is still in the possession of Brady and Hindley,’ he says.  ‘Our fear as a family is now my mother is no longer with us, this may be seen as closure.

‘This must not be allowed to happen out of respect for Keith and my mother’s memory. He was a son, a brother, a friend and should have been a father and grandfather. He should have been whatever he wanted to be.’
