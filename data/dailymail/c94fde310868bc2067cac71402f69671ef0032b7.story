Just a few years ago, Eugenie Bouchard was awestruck when she met her childhood hero – five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova.

But after the 20-year-old reached the Wimbledon finals yesterday, she announced that she no longer dreams of being the next Sharapova.

‘I don’t want to be the next someone else. I want to be the first of me,’ the glamorous player announced with steely determination, days after the Russian former world No.1 crashed out of the tournament.

Miss Bouchard, who has been embraced by tennis fans as the tournament’s sweetheart, said she would now ‘try to make my own history’.

The Canadian – named after the British princess by her royalist mother – took a step closer to being crowned queen of the court after beating 22-year-old Romanian Simona Halep.

She is the first Canadian woman to make it to a Grand Slam singles final.

Ranked 13th in the world, she said she was ‘not surprised’ that she had beaten world No.3 Halep, because she had worked so hard for it.

The player has acquired a loyal fanbase dubbed ‘Genie’s Army’ since winning the Wimbledon juniors two years ago and has received countless offers of marriage on Twitter. Asked about the marriage proposals last night, she smiled: ‘There is always a chance that I’ll say yes over Twitter, so keep them coming.’

Her semi-final match was not without drama and it took six match points before Miss Bouchard finally won, which she admitted was ‘a little stressful’. Her mother Julie Leclair said afterwards: ‘I was very nervous. Watching was a bit like going to the dentist but we are so proud of her.’ Miss Bouchard has described her mother as a ‘royal nut’ who named all four of her children after royalty.

Her twin sister Beatrice and brother William are also named after members of the Royal Family, while younger sister Charlotte is named after Princess Caroline of Monaco’s daughter.

William, 15, who has attended all of his sister’s matches at Wimbledon this year, said: ‘It’s amazing. All of my friends can’t believe my sister is top in the tennis world.’

And Beatrice, who claims to have a telepathic link with her twin, said recently: ‘Every day I am just in awe. I have seen everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years. She has sacrificed a lot to get where she is today.’

Miss Bouchard prepared for the tournament by pulling a weighted sledge across American football fields and jumping over hurdles. She also ran along sandy beaches in Florida, where she has been training since she was 12. ‘It’s getting really physical nowadays, the game, so you’ve got to be in top shape,’ she said.

She is a huge fan of singer Justin Bieber but said he would need to ‘clean up his act’ before she would consider dating him.
