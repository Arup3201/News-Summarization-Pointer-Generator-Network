Imagine getting directions that didn’t just stop at the street location, but showed you exactly where to go inside a building.

That’s the thinking behind Google’s Project Tango, a 3D-mapping service that was announced for phones back in February.

And now the company has revealed a $1,000 (£600) tablet prototype that uses the same technology.

Project Tango, headed by Motorola’s ATAP division, has been developed in secret behind the scenes.

The current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment.

These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time.

It then combines that data into a single 3D model of the space around the user.

The technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person's home simply by walking around the table.

Directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else.

Project Tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places.

Or, when shopping, the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on.

Google also highlights some of the gaming aspects, such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character.

Its goal is to use 3D scanning technology, akin to that in Microsoft’s Kinect sensor, to create 3D maps of an environment.

This means that a person’s phone or tablet, for instance, could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings, rooms and houses.

The technology has a number of proposed uses.

For example, it could be used to measure the dimensions of a home for furniture shopping, or it could allow for interactive games of hide-and-seek.

This latest 7-inch tablet, employing the same scanning technology used in the Project Tango phones, will run Android 4.4 KitKat.

The device maps the world in 3D through the use of two cameras, one on the front that can see 120 degrees, and a 4MP camera on the rear.

A motion tracking camera on the back also helps the mapping process, in addition to an integrated depth sensor.

Aside from the innovative 3D sensors in the device, the tablet will also have a 1080p display.

Inside it is powered by NVIDIA’s quad-core Tegra K1 chip, and it has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

Development kits of the device are available to pre-order through Google for $1,024 (£610), with the Wall Street Journal reporting there will be about 4,000 prototype tablets available this month.

The process wlll be similar to how Google Glass was rolled out to a select few ‘beta testers’ last year.

Project Tango can be used by a handset to automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation. This could, for example, allow someone to get directions to an exact desk within a building or find the right shelf a product is located on in a shop

‘The goal 
of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding 
of space and motion,’ said Johnny Lee from the ATAP-Project Tango Team.

‘Our
 team has been working with universities, research labs, and industrial 
partners spanning nine countries around the world to build on the last 
decade of research in robotics and computer vision, concentrating that 
technology into a unique mobile device.

‘We
 are putting early prototypes into the hands of developers that can 
imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality.’

Project Tango was first announced for phones back in Feburary, but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month. The process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how Google Glass was rolled out last year
