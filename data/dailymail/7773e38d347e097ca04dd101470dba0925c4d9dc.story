An astronaut has described the moment he realized his pressurized helmet began to fill with water, covering his eyes, ears and nose, while he was carrying out a mission at the International Space Station.

Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was at 
the beginning of a six-and-a-half hour spacewalk with U.S. colleague 
Chris Cassidy when cooling water began streaming from the air vent in 
his space suit and into his helmet.

'It was like walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl,' Parmitano said in a NASA video describing the malfunction. 'It's just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face under water for all that time.'

The helmet quickly filled, 
filling Parmitano's ears and covering his nose and mouth. The astronaut 
couldn't hear or see and relied on his memory to get him back to the 
airlock cabin.

'I was just lucky to be back inside in no time.'

The suits worn by astronauts when outside pressurized cabins are known as EVAs, Extra-Vehicular Activity suits. Astronauts wear a liquid-cooled garment under the suit which serves to regulate body temperature. It was the cooling water used in this under-suit that experts suspect began to leak into Parmitano's helmet.

'The water - if it had continued to leak much more, it would have been very serious,' Chris Cassidy said a separate NASA video released Tuesday.

Cassidy explained that the cooling water somehow got into Parmitano's ventilation system. The helmet of the suit has an air vent that blows oxygen from behind the astronaut's head.

Water bubbles built up then began leaking water from behind Parmitano's head into the helmet, saturating his communication cap and filling up to cover his nose, mouth and ears.

'Once the water got big enough that it went all the way around and 
started coming outside the edge of the white plastic piece, then it 
saturated his communication cap, and sort of capillary flow just brought
the water all around his head,' Cassidy explained.

'He had water filled up in his ear cups, and it started to creep into his eyes and covered his nose.'

Parmitano, who is the first Italian in space, said there was about 3lb of water inside his helmet.

NASA engineers in Houston are investigating what could have caused the leak, which is a serious concern for astronauts and mission control.

A board of experts has been appointed to the investigation.

'The mishap investigation board will look more broadly at past operations and maintenance, quality assurance, aspects of flight control and other organizational factors,' NASA officials said last week.

'The board's responsibility is to make observations and recommendations that can be applied to improve the safety of all of NASA's human spaceflight activities.'

The astronauts' mission that day involved repair and maintenance operations, preparing the orbiting lab for the arrival of a new Russian module later this year and checking on ongoing scientific research experiments.

Cassidy and Parmitano, who are part of the six-month Volare mission to the International Space Station, were about 90 minutes into a planned six-and-a-half hour spacewalk when the leak happened and they had to abort the mission.
