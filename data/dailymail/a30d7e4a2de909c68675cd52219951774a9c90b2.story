It is not a region known for its promotion of equal rights for women.

However, a 28-year-old woman from Dubai has struck a blow for her Arabic sisters after becoming a train driver for the city's Metro system.

Not only is Mariam Al Safar the first female in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to get behind the controls of a train - she is also the first in the Middle East.

Inspiring: Mariam Al Safar urged women to think more about unconventional jobs when considering their career paths

'Top priority': Miss Al Safar said her jobs had made her open to challenges and unafraid to take risks

Her feat is all the more impressive when you consider women are arrested in Saudi Arabia for driving a car.

Miss Al Safar, a native Emirati, is one of a select few UAE residents qualified to get behind the controls of a Dubai Metro train - and is the only woman, it was reported.

The network, which is described as the most advanced in the world is primarily an unmanned automatic driving system, which is operated from a centralised control room.

However, in the event of system repairs or an accident, it needs manual operation.

Miss Al Safar told Gulf News: 'I am always open
 to challenges and I am not afraid to take risks. I work hard and my job
 is my top priority.'

She added: 'Being a train attendant 
has helped me understand how to interact with people and staff from 
different nationalities and different cultures. This has empowered me to
 tackle different kinds of situations with ease.'

She also urged more women to think more about unconventional jobs when considering their own career paths.

She told Gulf News: 'Don't 
live your life without a target or vision. Set a target and strive to 
achieve it.'

Dubai's large expatriate community accounts for 80 per cent of its citizens, making Emiratis minorities in their own country, so jobs like Miss Al Safar's are usually carried out by foreign nationals.

However, in a bid to reduce the UAE's reliance on foreign labour and expertise, the Government is introducing policies to boost the number of Emiratis in the workforce.

The Dubai Metro said it actively promotes the policy of employing of local Emiratis and claimed the number of locals working for Serco - the operator of the system - is almost 135, which is 12 per cent of the total workforce.

The process of 'Emiratisation' is to be increased to push up this number to between 50 and 60 per cent by the end of 2014.

In recent years, Dubai has seen an upsurge of young women overturning a traditionally patriarchal culture to find their feet in the workplace.

The government drive to empower and educate women - along with exposure to westernised cultures - has resulted in the female population moving into a range of professions.

The UAE's stance on women's employment is progressive when compared with other countries in the Middle East.

In Saudi Arabia, women can be arrested for driving a car.

Several campaigns have been mounted 
to overturn the ban, but there is still widespread opposition to 
allowing women behind the wheel of a car.

A report published in the Middle 
Eastern kingdom last year claimed that allowing women to drive would 
result in an increase of prostitution, pornography homosexuality and 
divorce.

Highly segregated: Women and men in Saudi Arabia are restricted in how they are allowed to mix in public

Women struggle to get around in Saudi Arabia, and it isn't just a result of the driving ban.

Taxis can be sparse and some men refuse to drive a woman without a chaperone - usually their husband or a close male relative.

In September, a woman in Jeddah named Shayma Jastaniah was found guilty of driving through the streets.

She was sentenced to 10 lashes as a result of the charges despite holding an international driving license.

Earlier this month Saudi
 Arabia's government announced it will begin enforcing a law that allows
 only females to work in women's lingerie and clothing stores, despite 
disapproval from the country's top cleric.

The 2006 law banning men from working in female apparel and cosmetic stores has never been put into effect.

This is partly because of the stance 
of hard-liners in the religious establishment, who oppose the whole idea
 of women working where men and women congregate together, like malls.

Women and men in Saudi Arabia remain highly segregated and are restricted in how they are allowed to mix in public.
