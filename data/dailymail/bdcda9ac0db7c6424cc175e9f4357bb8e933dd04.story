These horrifying pictures show the pitiful state of a pet Alsatian that had to be put down after it scratched the skin of its face – because owners didn’t take it to a vet for eight years.

Kevin and Agnes Stringfellow, both 51, were both charged with failing to protect their dog Spike, a German Shepherd, and causing him unnecessary suffering.

A worried shopper spotted the dog, who had been suffering from chronic facial dermatitis, in a car in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with no fur on its face and its skin was inflamed and infected.

Spike, the German Shepherd, had been suffering from chronic facial dermatitis and had to be put to sleep

They alerted officers at the RSPCA who were left shocked, with one inspector describing it as the worst skin condition she had ever seen.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard the couple are married but live separately and the dog spent most of his time with Mrs Stringfellow – who is said to have a mental health problem.

Spike had last been taken to see a vet for the facial condition in 2006 but had not been seen since.

By the time RSPCA officers were alerted the dog was in such agony that the vet decided it had to be put out of its misery.

The charity’s prosecutor, Christopher Wyatt, told the court: ‘Some of the staff at the veterinary practice had to leave the room as they were so upset at what they saw.’

Mr Wyatt added that the facial dermatitis was a long-term condition.

The dog had not been to see a vet for eight years and its owner thought the problem 'would sort itself out'

A witness saw the animal in a vehicle on the car park at Tesco in Horwich, Bolton, on April 12 and was so concerned she took the registration number and contacted the RSPCA.

An inspector later went to Mrs Stringfellow’s home in Earby and was shocked when she saw the dog. It had no fur on its face and the flesh was exposed and red raw, with scabbing. The inspector couldn’t see the dog’s eyes.

Agnes Stringfellow, the dog's owner, did not attend the hearing but the case was proven in her absence

He added that the inspector spoke to Mr Stringfellow on the phone and he said Spike’s skin condition had been ongoing for about three or four months.

He said his wife had been looking after the dog for 12 or 13 years and that the animal had been taken to the vet about six years ago, but it had not been back since.

Mr Stringfellow gave the inspector permission to take the dog to experienced vet, Shaun Taylor in Bury.

He reported Spike was aggressive, in obvious discomfort, restless and scratching and had been suffering for at least a month.

The inflammation was across most of its face, fluid was coming out and it was infected. The prosecutor added: ’The dog was in a state.’

He decided Spike really needed to be put to sleep to end his suffering, which Mr Stringfellow agreed to.

A check was made with the vet Mr Stringfellow said he had taken Spike to who confirmed they saw the dog in 2006 for the condition but had not seen him since.

When Mr Stringfellow was interviewed, he said the skin condition had got worse over the last six months.

He said he didn’t take the dog to the vet as he thought he could sort the problem out himself. Mrs Stringfellow was not interviewed, despite attempts by the RSPCA to do so.

Mr Stringfellow, from Colne in Lancashire, admitted failing to protect Spike from pain, suffering, injury or disease by failing to get proper and necessary veterinary care and attention, between October 16, last year and March 16 and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal between March 16 and April 16, this year.

The self-employed dairy engineer, was banned from owning or keeping dogs and cats for 10 years and cannot apply for the order to be lifted for five years. He was made to pay compensation - the vet’s fees of £320.63 - and £600 costs.

His wife, of Earby in Pendle, who was accused of the same allegations, did not attend the hearing and the bench found the case against her proven in her absence and adjourned it until October 17.

Mr Stringfellow, who was not legally represented, told the court: ‘I’m very sorry. It wasn’t done with any intent. Things got on top of me. I tried to get help for Agnes.’

He added: ‘The worst thing that could have happened has. I have lost Spike.’
