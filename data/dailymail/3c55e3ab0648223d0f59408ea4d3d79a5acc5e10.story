A close friend of Nelson Mandela today claimed that the ailing former South African president was ‘totally conscious’ when he visited him in hospital this week.

Denis Goldberg, a white anti-apartheid activist and stalwart of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), contradicted medical opinion presented in court this week, which states that Mandela has been in a ‘vegetative state’ for the last nine days and his family had discussed switching off his life support machine.

The medical report into Mandela’s condition emerged during a court case this week between rival members of the Mandela family battling over where the Nobel Peace winner should be buried.

Former South African president Nelson Mandela, pictured in hospital, is still in a 'critical condition' but is said to be 'conscious and responsive'

Visitor: Nelson Mandela's close friend Denis Goldberg visited the former anti-apartheid leader at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital, pictured, on Monday

Denis Goldberg, pictured left outside the hospital, claimed Mandela was 'conscious and responsive' - contradicting claims made in court documents that he has been in a vegetative state for the last nine days

Goldberg, who was jailed for 22 years
 during the infamous Rivonia trial of 1964 that saw Mandela imprisoned 
for life, insisted that he had visited Mandela on Monday and he that ‘he
 is clearly a very ill man, but he responds to voices and tries to 
talk.’ 

He added: ‘He was dozing when I got 
there. I spoke and told him who I was and he opened his eyes and looked 
at me. I spoke to him for about ten minutes and he responded positively 
to what I was saying. He was aware of who I was.'

Goldberg, who served his sentence
 in a white jail in Pretoria while Mandela was shipped to Robben Island,
 said the 94-year-old ‘was incapacitated but he is totally conscious.’

He added: ‘He did not answer because he can’t 
talk, with the pipe in his throat, but he was moving his jaw as if he 
wanted to talk. I was absolutely amazed – after the stories I had 
heard.’

With most South Africans resigned to 
the fact that Mandela is unlikely to every recover, the conflicting 
statements about his health have caused consternation, with one 
commentator accusing the ANC government of misleading the public.

Update: Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader

United: 'Whatever is the outcome of his stay in 
hospital, that will remain the second time where he offered his nation 
an opportunity to be united under the banner of our flag, under the 
banner of our constitution,' she said

Two years ago, Mandla exhumed the 
bodies of three of Mandela's children from Qunu, where Mandela grew up, 
and moved them the 20 km to Mvezo, where Mandla has built a visitor 
centre and a memorial centre dedicated to his grandfather.

Meanwhile Mac Maharaj, the spokesman for President Zuma, today questioned whether Mr Mandela’s condition had been exaggerated by lawyers acting for the family in the court case.

David Smith, a lawyer for 15 of Mandela’s family, submitted papers to the Eastern Cape High Court revealing that doctors as long ago as last week had declared that he was in a vegetative state ‘the anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds.’

Known as a Certificate of Urgency, the medical document was submitted to urge the court to deal swiftly with an unseemly dispute over the alleged theft and removal of Mandela’s three children from their graves by Mandla, his grandson.

‘Affidavits will be provided from his treating physicians that he is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in breathing by a life support machine,' it said.

Having initially refused to comment on this explosive medical opinion, South African officials released a statement yesterday denying the report and insisting that the country’s first black president remains ‘critical but stable.’

Visits: Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8,
 remains in critical but stable condition, according to a statement 
today by President Jacob Zuma's office.  Zuma visited Mandela yesterday

'This is the very family that has 
taken their own father, their own grandfather, to court for his monies,'
 he said, referring to a long-running legal bid by Makaziwe to remove 
the guardians of a Mandela charitable trust.

‘Madiba (Mandela’s clan name) remains in a critical but stable condition and that is based on Mr Zuma going to the hospital and being briefed by the doctors,’ the spokesman said. ‘Certainly in that statement, there is no suggestion that he is in a vegetative state.'

Meanwhile, retired archbishop Desmond Tutu has 
appealed to the family of Nelson Mandela to end a bitter feud over the 
reburial of three of his children.

'Please,
 please, please may we think not only of ourselves. It's almost like 
spitting in Madiba's face,' Tutu said in a statement released by a 
foundation he leads.

'Your
 anguish, now, is the nation's anguish - and the world's. We want to 
embrace you, to support you, to shine our love for Madiba through you. 
Please may we not besmirch his name.'
