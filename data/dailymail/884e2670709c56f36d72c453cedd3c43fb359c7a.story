Military chiefs yesterday admitted to putting down 109 of their horses in the past six years – a rate of more than one a month.

The Ministry of Defence said the animals had either become too sick or could not be found a new home.

Often the animals have to be put down because they fall lame or suffer from colic – but some are simply judged to have a bad temperament.

The military keeps around 500 horses, which are used mainly for ceremonial occasions such as Trooping the Colour and the State Opening of Parliament.

These horses cost more than £1million to maintain, and when they fall ill a decision has to be taken on whether to spend more money on vets’ fees or whether putting the animal down is the better choice.

Officials at the MoD try to find new homes for horses when they cannot serve the military any more, but for every two animals that are rehomed another one is euthanised.

Among the horses that were put to sleep last year was an animal called Gotthewrongun, who was suffering from an infected wound to the fetlock.

Others put down were Chieftan, who had a foot condition, Combermere, who had a broken leg, Invictus, who had chronic lameness and Marley, who was suffering from a disease of the immune system.

In 2013, two horses called Geronimo and Journeyman were put down because of colic.

Three others, Apocalypse, Constable and Johannesburg, were euthanised because of lameness.

As well as the 109 horses that were put down by the MoD since 2009, a total of 526 military dogs have also been euthanised.

Like the horses, these dogs had suffered injuries or could not be rehomed.

Mimi Bekhechi, director of animal welfare charity PETA, said: ‘The Ministry of Defence has no business using horses, dogs or any other animals.

‘They are not soldiers, nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service.

‘While painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals, a combat zone is no place for them.’

A MoD spokesman said: ‘The majority of our horses are re-homed at the end of their military service but our priority has to be the welfare of the animals.

‘Sometimes, we sadly have to put down animals that are in pain, have debilitating diseases or are a danger to others.

‘That decision is only taken as a last resort, based on veterinary advice. They are not pieces of kit.’
