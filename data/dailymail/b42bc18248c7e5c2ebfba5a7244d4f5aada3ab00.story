Former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour has backed Thierry Henry to replace Arsene Wenger as manager at the Emirates one day. 

The Frenchman’s future is uncertain after he left New York Red Bulls at the end of the MLS season and has been linked with a return to Arsenal in a coaching capacity and Parlour has backed him to take the top job in the future.

Henry is Arsenal’s record goalscorer and Wenger is keen to add him to Arsenal’s backroom team.

Parlour told talkSPORT: ‘I think he will definitely get involved with Arsenal. I certainly believe, one day, if he really wants to be a manager, he will be manager of Arsenal.

‘He was such an intelligent player. Arsene Wenger used to have a meeting on a Monday with the players after a game and Thierry would always have his say. He would make some great points, not just about forwards, but about defending and how we defend as a team.

‘He always had that charisma to be a manager. And look at his name around the world. People would want to play for him and he would attract big players.’
