Residents in Cambridge are furious after the city council spent £35,000 building Britain's most expensive bird nesting box, saying that the money could have been better spent elsewhere.

The colourful 33ft-high steel tower was built in 2011 as part of a plan to reverse the decline in the number of swifts - a species which sees its population fall by three per cent each year due to a loss of habitat.

But the hi-tech bird box has sat empty in a field for three years, with its first feathered inhabitants only moving in this summer.

Summer visitors: The steel structure, which was built in 2011, features 200 nesting boxes for swifts. The birds spend most of the year in southern Africa, arriving in the UK to breed between May and late July

New home: A swift darts out of the tower on the outskirts of Cambridge. The species nest in old buildings but have seen their numbers decline by three per cent each year as these buildings are renovated or demolished

African sun: The colours of the nesting boxes were inspired by the sun in Africa - where swifts live for most of the year. Cambridge city councillors say the specialist nest is helping to reverse the decline in the species

The tower, which features 200 nesting boxes, was built at Logan’s Meadow nature reserve on the outskirts of Cambridge as part of a wider wetland habitat creation plan in 2011.

It was commissioned by 
Cambridge City Council and created by London-based artist Andrew 
Merritt, who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design 
with a functional home for the birds.

The design is inspired by the colours of the African sunset - where the birds live for most of the year - and recorded bird calls are played through loudspeakers built into the tower in order to attract young swifts.

But some residents feel that the money, which was donated by housing developers to be used for public art, could have been used to benefit the local community.

Helen Phillips, 43 said: 'I can’t believe they have spent so much money building a bird’s nest.

'The money would have been much better spent on facilities for the local community, such as a children’s playground.

'It’s ridiculous that they have spent thousands building a nest which hasn’t even been used for three years.'

City councillors say the special nest is helping to play an important part in reversing the decline of swifts.

The birds come to the UK to breed, arriving in mid-May and staying until late July when they return to Africa.

They nest in old buildings but each year their population declines by three per cent as these buildings are knocked down or renovated.

Nesting boxes: Some of the 200 boxes that make up the top part of the tower. It was designed by artist Andrew Merritt, who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design with a functional home for the birds

Local volunteers from Action For Swifts worked with the council and the artist to create the specialist nest.

Councillor Carina O’Reilly said: 'This is fantastic news for this innovative project, which is helping biodiversity in the city by providing a habitat for this important species.

'Now the swifts have found it, it should provide a great spectacle every summer as the birds demonstrate their exhilarating flying skills around the tower.'

Guy Belcher, nature conservation officer for Cambridge City Council, said: 'Although these young birds are not expected to breed this year, the activity is extremely encouraging and we predict breeders next year, following their return from Southern Africa.'
