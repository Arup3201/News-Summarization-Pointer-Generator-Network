This is the terrifying moment the son of Big Fat Gypsy star Paddy Doherty slammed a stolen BMW into another car leaving its driver hospitalised following a dramatic eight-mile, high-speed police chase.

Reckless Martin Doherty, 20, sped through road works, swerved to avoid
 oncoming traffic and drove down 
the wrong side of the road before colliding into a Nissan Micra writing both vehicles off.

Police had spotted the powerful black BMW 5 Series with four passengers inside, driving erratically through the frozen streets 
of Dudley and Tipton in the West Midlands.

Horror crash: Footage taken from a police car's dashboard cameras captures the scene moments after Martin Doherty slammed the high-powered BMW M3 into a red Nissan Micra

Yesterday West Midlands Police released footage taken by a police car's dashboard camera showing Doherty hitting the red Micra on the A4123, sending the small car spinning 180 degrees.

Driver Ronald Gough was left trapped inside his vehicle and had to be cut out before being taken to hospital.

He was treated for 
multiple injuries including bruising all over his body and pain in his 
legs, arms and chest.

It took him a month to make a full recovery, during which time he lost a stone in weight and struggled to walk.

Last week Doherty, the son of former 
Big Brother winner and bare-knuckle boxer Paddy, was jailed for 14 
months and banned from driving for three years after he pleaded guilty 
to aggravated vehicle taking.

Passing sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Judge Martin Walsh said he was fortunate his 'appalling' driving did not have 'catastrophic' consequences.

Prosecutor
 Zaheer Afzal told the court: 'He (Doherty) drove through roadworks and 
on the opposite side of the road towards oncoming traffic, overtaking 
other cars at excessive speed.

'It was a prolonged chase. Throughout the entire incident his driving was extremely erratic.'

Doherty and his accomplices were arrested a short distance away from the crash hiding in a garden.

The five defendants were not charged with the theft of the BMW which had been stolen in October, 2012.

The other four defendants, aged between 18 and 20, received suspended sentences and ordered to carry out unpaid work.

Adam Roxborough, defending Doherty, said: 'His father has taken him under his wing and is teaching him the building trade.

'He accepts fully his responsibility and knows the consequences could have been far worse.'

Speaking after his son was jailed, Paddy Doherty, who won Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, said: 'Iâ€™m very sorry.

'What has happened should never have happened. What he did was wrong and he has got what he deserves.

'He could be dead. I am grateful to God for giving him back to me. He has learned his lesson and these days he is out working every day and keeping away from trouble.'

In March, the former bare knuckle boxing champion, 55, was himself given a six-month supervision order after he admitted head-butting his stepbrother at a funeral wake.
