Labour MP Simon Danczuk has confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who 'live in the real world'.

The husband of selfie-loving Karen Danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on Twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iPhone. 

However, the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe. He stressed he does not use porn regularly, but insisted: 'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do.'

And wife Karen urged people to watch porn, claiming it is 'healthy'.

It came as Mrs Danczuk was invited to host the UK Porn Awards, although she has apparently turned down the opportunity.

Mr Danczuk explained that he accidentally favourited a tweet  linked to an account described as 'an 18+ Erotic account for posting sexy pictures of sexy women'.

The Rochdale MP does not follow the account, which features dozens of pornographic pictures of women.

Giving a convoluted explanation for the gaffe, he told radio station Key 2 in Manchester: ‘This is genuinely true. It’s what you might call a technological accident.

'I had put my iPhone on charge using one of those uncertified chargers. I went on to Twitter while it was plugged in.

'And when I went on Twitter it started jumping about. It started doing predictive text and moving around the screen everywhere.

'Before I knew it, and unbeknown to me, I had favorited a tweet which related to this porn site image.'

He insisted that politicians should not be berated for viewing porn. 'Let’s be truthful about this. If I am being asked have I ever used porn, then the answer is yes. 

'I am a man of the world. I wouldn’t deny that sort of thing. I think we should not be too sanctimonious about this.

'I think there is far too much of that in politics and I think don’t put politicians on a pedestal. Let’s just have real conversations about real issues.

'The reality is politicians are under scrutiny and many others have been caught out on this.'

MP's wife Karen Danczuk took to Twitter to urge people to watch porn, insisting it is 'healthy'

He pointed out that one of David Cameron's official accounts was found to be following a 'high class escort agency' on Twitter while fellow Labour MP Jack Dromey like a tweet from 'some gay porn site'.

It’s something that easily happens. We are under a lot of scrutiny,' Mr Danczuk said.

Asked if he watches porn regularly, he replied: ‘Not regularly but the point I am making is I am not going to come on this show and say I haven’t.

'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do. Let’s not be sanctimonious about it.

Wife Karen, who has made a name for herself posting photos of her cleavage online, tweeted yesterday: 'Anyone seriously offended by a bit of porn favouriting?? Come on,if you're not watching it yourself you really need to. It's healthy.'

Mr Danczuk added: 'I have had a real laugh about it. It is not really a massive policy political issue is it? I think the public get that. They want politicians who do live in the real world.'

The MP, who has campaigned against child sexual exploitation, hit the headlines last week when he said in an interview in the New Statesman that Ed Miliband was considered more of a 'toff' by voters than David Cameron.

The interview was brought up by Jeremy Paxman during Thursday's live TV debate with Mr Miliband and David Cameron.

Mr Danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist Katie Hopkins on Twitter over race relations.

Hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in Rochdale next to a Pakistani flag.

She linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town, which led to jailing of a gang of Asian men for 77 years in 2012.

But Mr Danczuk accused her of spreading 'vitriol' and of 'racist generalisation'.

Mrs Dancuk, known as the Queen of the Selfies, is a former Rochdale councillor who announced she was stepping down earlier this year to pursue other career opportunities, including media work.

She became known for posting a series of racy images of herself on Twitter and revealed in February she had been sexually abused as a child.
