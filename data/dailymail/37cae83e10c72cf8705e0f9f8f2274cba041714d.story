Zaad Al-Hilli has been questioned by police over the death of his brother, Saad, who was shot dead in he French Alps.

The brother of a British engineer murdered in the Alps alongside his family has been placed under armed guard after being questioned over the killing.

Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, apparently has a panic alarm that summons police to his home when it is pressed, it emerged yesterday.

The heavy security is believed to be provided by the Metropolitan Police and Surrey Police, with taxpayers footing the bill.

Mr Al-Hilli was interviewedby French detectives on Friday close to his home in Chessington, Surrey.

It comes almost seven months to the day since his 50-year-old brother, Saad Al-Hilli, died alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and and Mrs Al-Hilli's mother, Suhalia, 74, in the family BMW.

Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist, also died in the September 5 bloodbath at a beauty spot near Lake Annecy, which is believed to have been carried out by at least one gunman brandishing a pistol.

Prosecutors consider Zaid a key figure in the case because of an alleged bitter dispute with his brother over a family inheritance, though he denies any wrongdoing.

He has not been arrested and is not considered a suspect by police.

The Daily Telegraph revealed last night that his home in Britain is subject to special security measures, after police swooped on a reporter and photographer who knocked on Mr Al-Hilli's door.

The armed officers arrived just moments after the journalists, and asked them what they were doing on the property.

Mr Al-Hilli is said to have told British officials he fears for his life, but Surrey Police refused to confirm whether or not they are aware of a specific threat to the Iraqi-born Briton.

A spokesman said yesterday: 'Around 1pm today two units from Surrey Police attended an address in Chessington alongside officers from the Metropolitan Police Service following a report of a disturbance at the location.

'Two men were spoken to but no offences were disclosed and no arrests were made.'

Sources told the Telegraph that it was impossible to estimate the cost of the security operation, as the officers guarding Mr Al-Hilli's home are considered to be fulfilling their normal duties.

The scene of murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps where Saad Al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal, her mother, Suhalia, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier were killed

The men's father, Kadhim Al-Hilli, 
died in Spain two years ago, leaving a number of properties and cash 
including the equivalent of some £800,000 in a bank account in Geneva, 
which is less than an hour's drive from the murder scene.

Saad
put a legal block on his father's will, effectively preventing Zaid 
from inheriting his share until 'unknown' disputes had been resolved, 
according to published legal documents.

The French wanted to question Zaid
over claims that he tried to use an expired credit card to withdrew 
cash from the Geneva account shortly before the killings.

Saad
kept a Taser stun gun protection weapon at his home in Claygate, 
Surrey, and had also changed the locks of the £1million property to 
prevent Zaid getting in.

According to a French police source, Zaid was asked to explain at length his 'whereabouts on the day of the tragedy.'

He also offered information about the will, and about Saad's work as satellite technology engineer.

Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered head injuries after being pistol whipped in the attack and was also shot in the shoulder.

Her sister, Zeena, escaped unscathed after hiding under her mother's skirt in the back of the family BMW.

Both girls are now in the hands of social services, with surviving members of the Al-Hilli family, including Zaid, only allowed limited access to them.

There have been no arrests since the murders happened, with Mr Maillaud admitting that the baffling case 'may never be solved'.

He recently ordered investigators to visit Iraq, which is where the Al-Hillis originally came from, but this has been delayed because of security worries.
