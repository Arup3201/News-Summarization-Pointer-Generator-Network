Rake-off: Machines that swallow users' change have made millions for local authorities

Motorists are being short-changed by millions of pounds as council chiefs profit from pay-and-display parking machines that don’t give change, the RAC Foundation has warned.

Local authorities could be coining it in by up to £38million a year by swallowing overpayments, analysis of new figures reveals.

One local authority has admitted creaming off £650,000 in just two years from motorists who have been denied the correct change from their parking fee.

The RAC called for an end to the unfair rake-off and said town halls had already made a £594million profit from council car parks and on street bays last year.

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘This is adding insult to injury. Many would say charges are already too high without drivers having no choice but to pay for parking they do not need.’

Cornwall Council disclosed in answer to a Freedom of Information request that it collected what it calls an ‘estimated over-vend’ of £649,404 in 2011-12 and 2012-13 on parking income of £23,611,678 – equivalent to 2.7 per cent.

Overpayments have also been reported in Bournemouth and Poole in Dorset, Exeter, Devon, and Preston, Lancashire, along with Carmarthenshire and Bridgend in Wales, Portsmouth and by Craven District Council, North Yorkshire.

Professor Glaister said: ‘We have heard similar stories from several areas of the country.

‘If the situation is replicated across all or most authorities then motorists are being short changed to the tune of many millions of pounds per year. ’

Of Cornwall’s cream-off, he said; ‘This is a council which by its own admission made an £8million ‘profit’ from its parking activities in the last financial year, the 12th highest amount in England.

'Is it seriously suggested some of this cash can’t be used to upgrade machines either to give change or enable other methods of payment such as by phone or by card?.’

RAC Foundation research reveals that councils in England earned £770million from on street parking bays in the 2012-13 financial year and a further £635million from car parks – a total of £1.4billion including a £594million profit after costs are deducted.

An estimated 100,000 coin-operated machines were still in use last year despite the creation of phone services

If the same proportion were retained as in Cornwall then town halls received a £37.9million boost by failing to give change.

Cashless payments via mobile phone which debit the correct fee are being introduced in many places and card payments are widely accepted.

But an estimated 100,000 coin-operated ticket machines were in use at the last count.

The RAC report showed that London’s posh Westminster borough earned the most in takings overall from on and off street parking fees – £77.9million in 2012-13.

Outside London, Brighton & Hove Council had the biggest takings at £24.2million.

Cornwall Council, which collected a total of £14.2million, claimed it would be too costly to keep its 250 machines stocked with change. It is introducing cashless payments but said it could not afford to scrap all its older machines.

A spokesman said; ‘We do upgrade machines
 as they become obsolete.  As they are replaced we will consider other 
options for cashless payment.’

The RAC has called for an end to the unfair system, which saw Cornwall Council earn £650,000 in two years

The British Parking Association, which represents councils and parking firms contracted to issue penalties, said parking charges would have to increase further to cover the cost of keeping machines stocked with change.

A BPA spokesman said; ‘Dispensing and recycling coins to give change would mean bigger machines and more staff to replenish and maintain them, which would in turn add to costs and increase parking charges.

‘The more cash they hold, the more vulnerable they are to vandalism and thieves. This type of equipment is often targeted by opportunists and organised crime gangs.’

The Local Government Association which represents local authorities in England and Wales said councils are obliged to spend any surplus on local transport projects.

An LGA spokesman said: ‘Councils try and make the process as easy as possible for motorists with many offering additional cashless payment options where possible for people who not have the correct change for parking machines.

‘Parking revenue is spent on paying for parking services. Any money left over goes towards transport services like filling potholes, concessionary travel, park and rides, street lights and road improvement projects.’
