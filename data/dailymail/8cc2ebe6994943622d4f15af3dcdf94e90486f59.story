Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor has won a call-up to the Scotland squad for next month's clash with world champions Germany.

The 21-year-old has been rewarded for an impressive start to the season which has seen him strike four times for the Scottish champions.

The news was confirmed by Scotland Under-21 coach Billy Stark, who has seen him promoted from his squad.

Stark said: 'Andy Robertson has stepped up from the Under-21s and now Callum McGregor. Whilst it has not been the most successful of campaigns, the other part of it is players going through.'

Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon is also included in the squad following his comeback from a career-threatening knee injury.

Morrison has made the squad while Wolves midfielder Kevin McDonald is the only other uncapped player alongside McGregor.

Chris Burke, Shaun Maloney and Craig Bryson are among the other midfielders in Gordon Strachan's squad.

The Scotland manager has named three strikers - Steven Fletcher, Steven Naismith and Derby's Chris Martin - meaning there is no place for the likes of Jordan Rhodes, Ross McCormack or Leigh Griffiths.
