A valet driver working for Mercedes Benz of Greenwhich, Connecticut was charged after he sent sexually explicit text messages and photos to a customer.

Jonathon Silva, 22, was arrested on Monday 30 days after a married female customer he 'sexted' pictures of his genitals to in December reported the unnerving messages to police.

Silva is charged with disorderly conduct, second-degree harassment, and obscenity.

The woman's attorney Mark Sherman told The New York Daily News, 'Shortly after she was dropped off, she got a text message that showed a man's genitals.'

She later received more texts that were 'harassing and sexually offensive.'

The woman reported the incident to Mercedes-Benz and to police immediately after it happened but the man was still employed at the dealership until he was finally arrested on Monday.Â 

Silva is employed by a company called All-American Valet and was contracted for work by the auto dealership, reported News 12 Connecticut.

'We have received an apology, however, we reported this to Mercedes Benz over a month ago and they did nothing," said the woman's attorney.

'They allowed this man to continue working there without a proper investigation for 30 days until he was finally arrested.'

The woman is trying to obtain a restraining order against Silva and damages which are undisclosed.

'She's a hardworking well-regarded mother and wife from Stanford who did nothing to deserve this kind of treatment,' her lawyer said.
