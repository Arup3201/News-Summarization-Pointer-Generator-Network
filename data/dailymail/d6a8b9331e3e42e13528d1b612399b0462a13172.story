Criminals are four times as likely to avoid a jail sentence if they offend in the right areas, research has revealed.

Offenders face a postcode lottery when they appear before magistrates' courts with just 1.5 per cent being locked up in Warwickshire - compared with more than six per cent in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

Overall, the use of jail sentences fell by a quarter between 2001 and 2011, new figures revealed today.

Easy ride: Prisoners are four times less likely to be jailed if they offend in the 'right' areas

Nationwide, just 3.8 per cent of offenders are jailed when they appear before magistrates, the report by the Howard League for Penal Reform found.

In England, courts imposed immediate 
custodial sentences in 3.8 per cent of cases in 2011, down from 4.9 per 
cent in 2001. But the rate in Wales rose over the same period, however, from
4.0 per cent to 4.3 per cent.

Although the discrepancies may appear relatively small, courts are dealing with thousands of cases every day. Overall magistrates jailed 46,000 offenders in 2011 as they handed down 1.2million sentences.

The figures show that in Warwickshire just 162 jail terms were handed down during 11,097 sentencing hearings.

Areas where criminals are most likely to be jailed by magistrates.

1) Northamptonshire 6.5 per cent jailed

2) Derbyshire 6.2 per cent

3) West Midlands 5.8 per cent

4) South Wales 4.6 per cent

5) North Wales 4.6 per cent

Where criminals are likely to escape a jail sentence.

1) Warwickshire 1.5 per cent jailed

2) Northumbria 1.6 per cent

3) Hertfordshire 2.7 per cent

4) Lincolnshire 2.7 per cent

5) Lancashire 2.8  per cent

The Howard League - who want more criminals to be given community sentences rather than being jailed - welcomed the figures.

In Derbyshire, Gwent and Northamptonshire, magistrates' courts jailed offenders more frequently in 2011 than they did in 2001.

But the number of defendants sent to 
jail fell during the same period in Bedfordshire, Dorset, Durham, Kent, 
Northumbria, Staffordshire and Warwickshire.

Frances Crook, the Howard League for Penal Reform's chief executive, said: 'One cannot ignore the striking 
disparity in sentencing trends between different criminal justice areas.

'A short-term prison sentence is a 
catastrophe for everyone. It does not help change the life of the person
sentenced – indeed, it is likely to compound issues such as drug 
addiction and make them more likely to reoffend.

'It costs the taxpayer a fortune and it does nothing to help victims, who get no recompense or easing of trauma.'

Magistrates' courts can jail criminals for a maximum of six months if they have only committed one offence, or a year if they have committed more.

More serious cases are dealt with by the crown court where longer prison sentences can be handed down.

Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said the government was in favour of giving fewer offenders short prison sentences

'Prison will always be the right place for the most serious and persistent offenders. But reoffending rates are unacceptably high - and are currently highest among those sentenced to short prison sentences,' he said.

'We are tackling this by changing the way we deal with these offenders, so there is greater supervision and rehabilitation.'

A separate survey, conducted by the Howard League 
and the Prison Governors’ Association, found that many prisoners 
preferred a short-term prison sentence to a community sentence because 
they were easier to complete.

Others considered community sentences to 
be a greater punishment than prison.
