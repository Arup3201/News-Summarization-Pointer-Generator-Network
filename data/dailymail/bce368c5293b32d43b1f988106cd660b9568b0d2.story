A humorous Ebay advert for the ultimate 'proper lads car' complete with a wing mirror held on by string and 103,000 miles on the clock has gone viral.

The advert for the 13-year-old W-plate Ford Fiesta Zetec put on by 21-year-old Jamie Rogers has had more than 20,000 views since he listed it on Monday.

By 5pm today, the price for the car had rocketed to £153,900 after 64 bids.

Mr Rogers, who lives in Chelmsford, Essex and is a Recruitment Consultant in the City, wrote: 'I'm selling this Ford Fiesta Zetec S of mine because now I've grown up, I feel it's time for me to pass on this special car to another young lad on the path to manhood.

'Proper lads car': An advert for this 13-year-old W-plate Ford Fiesta Zetec has gone viral after its owner posted a tongue-in-cheek description on Ebay in his bid to sell it to 'another young lad on the path to manhood'

Sen better days: Owner Jamie Rogers makes no attempt to hide the fact the wing mirrors are held on by string

Honesty the best policy: Mr Rogers does concede that the Zetec is '13 years young' and has 'bounced across 103,000 miles of road to the beat of many a black rap track'

'You can't become a man until you've owned a proper lads car, so if you don't buy this Zetec S you will always be spotty, your voice will never break properly and you will never beat your addiction to masturbation.

'I'm not selling this car to help myself, I'm selling this car to save teenagers across the world from themselves.

'So if you're a teenager looking at making that next big step in your life, this is the car for you.

'If you're a parent looking for a car on behalf of your son, this is the car for you.

Wear and tear: Mr Rogers says you 'first test of manliness' will be fixing the dodgy clutch and wing mirror, which his drunken friend fell into after a party'

Hard sell: The car has a speaker system 'perfect for enhancing your hard-man image at low speeds in built-up areas', according to Mr Rogers

Sense of humour: Mr Rogers says the car is 'filthy dirty inside and out, but at least it has 'four round wheels'

'If you're 35 years old still living at home and yet to be touched intimately by a woman, then this car is not for you.'

Although, Mr Rogers does concede that the Zetec is '13 years young' and has 'bounced across 103,000 miles of road to the beat of many a black rap track'.

One comic owner: Jamie Rogers says he is selling the car because 'I've grown up'

He says you 'first test of manliness' 
will be fixing the dodgy clutch and wing mirror, which his drunken 
friend fell into after a party.

The car is also 'filthy dirty' inside and out' but Mr Rogers does say it has 'four round wheels' and has an aftermarket speaker system 'perfect for enhancing your hard-man image at low speeds in built up areas.'

He finished the advert simply with: 'You are an idiot if you're in your late teens and don't buy this car.'

Mr Rogers, who bought the car last year said: 'I had a chat with my mates about selling the car.

'In my group of friends it is the car in the worst shape.

'I said, 'I guarantee I will get £1,000 for that car'.

'Nobody believed me, so then I thought 'I have said it now how am I going to make it happen?'

'I thought maybe if I give it a quirky advert someone will buy it.'

He said his target market is young lads looking for their first car like he was and who will be excited to be having any car.

Mr Rogers is hoping to replace his car with an Audi, he said: 'I've got a proper job now, it is time for a proper car'.
