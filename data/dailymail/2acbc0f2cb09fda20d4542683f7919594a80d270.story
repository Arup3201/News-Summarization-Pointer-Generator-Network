The cake was iced, the sandwiches made and the balloons blown up and hanging from the ceiling. All that was needed was the guests and with Prince George the birthday boy, they were never going to be ordinary.

The most important guest was his great-grandmother, the Queen, who could be seen perched in the back seat of her car as she was driven through the gates of Kensington Palace in London, and spent 50 minutes with her great-grandson.

Looking summery in a floral patterned dress and her trademark pearls with bright red lipsick, the Queen looked delighted to be attending - and even got her car to slow down as it drove past the cheering crowds that lined the route to the palace.

Royal Ranger Rover: Kate was pictured at the wheel of her Ranger Rover as she took Prince George to see the Queen at Buckingham Palace yesterday

Earlier in
 the day Kate, accompanied by her nanny, Maria Borallo, and a police 
protection officer, drove George to Buckingham Palace so the little 
prince could see his great-grandfather, Prince Philip, who was unable to
 attend the party due to work commitments.

Arriving
 at around 11am, they spent an hour at the Queen’s official residence 
and as they were inside the band of the Irish Guards played a tuneful 
rendition of Happy Birthday in honour of George’s big day.

The
 little prince’s doting grandfather Prince Charles, who also missed 
Prince William’s first birthday as he and his then wife, Princess Diana,
 were on tour in Canada, was also away, this time in Scotland on 
official duties.

But
 he looked delighted after being given a large cuddly toy red squirrel 
to take home to his grandson as he visited a Perthshire estate.

The
 first guests to arrive were Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael 
Middleton, who drove in through the palace gates shortly after 3pm in 
matching Range Rovers.

Doting: The Queen might have been left with a nanny on her first birthday but she made sure she saw her great-grandson not once but twice on his big day

Favourite
 cousin: The Middletons were followed by Zara Phillips, reportedly 
William and Harry's favourite cousin, who arrived with her husband Mike 
and daughter Mia

Family:
 Zara was driven through the gates of Kensington Palace by her husband 
Mike Tindall and represented a rare day off from her stellar eventing 
career

Party time: As well as his uncle Prince Harry, George's first birthday guest list also included his maternal uncle, James Middleton, who arrived wearing a pair of Ray Bans

It's Aunty Pippa! Pippa Middleton, herself a fan of a themed birthday bash, also arrived at Kensington Palace for Prince George's first birthday party

Despite being thought to have organised the party, there was no hint as to whether Carole had brought along a few bits and bobs from 
Party Pieces, her online partyware store, to make the afternoon go with a
 swing.

Shortly
 afterwards another of the godparents, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, arrived 
on foot clutching a large rectangular-shaped present, wrapped in 
brightly coloured paper.

Jamie
 LP, as he is known in royal circles, is one of William’s most trusted 
and long-serving aides. Although he recently retired from his role as 
Principal Private Secretary to William, Kate and Harry, the former army 
officer was immediately re-appointed as William’s ‘Extra Equerry’, so 
trusted is his counsel.

Other
 godparents to arrive included Emilia d’Erlanger, one of Kate’s closest 
friends from her days at Marlborough College, and William van Cutsem, a 
childhood friend of the prince.

Julia
 Samuel, a confidante of William’s late mother, Diana, Princess of 
Wales, and another of George’s god-parents, was also driven in by car.

The
 brains of the operation: Carole Middleton, wearing a typically elegant 
polka dot tea dress, drives into the palace for the party she organised

Grandpa's
 here: Michael Middleton arrived in a separate car from his wife. Prince
 George spent his first few months at the Middleton home in Bucklebury

Heads
 turned as Kate’s heavily-bearded brother, James Middleton, zipped in 
driving a £60,000 convertible F-type Jaguar, while Aunty Pippa was 
dropped off in a black taxi.

The
 Queen’s grand-daughter and William’s cousin, Zara Philips, fresh from 
competing in an equestrian event on the continent, was among the last to
 arrive and drove in with her husband, Mike Tindall.

Godmother
 Zara laughed and smiled at the waiting crowds as they roared past. 
Although she could not be seen, it is believed the couple’s own baby 
daughter, Mia, was in the back of their car.

According
 to palace sources, Uncle Prince Harry – sure to be the life and soul of
 even a children’s tea party – strolled over from his cottage in the 
palace grounds to join in the fun.
