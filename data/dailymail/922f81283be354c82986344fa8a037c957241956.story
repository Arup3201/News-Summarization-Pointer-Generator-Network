UFC lightweight Ross Pearson has admitted that he put a lot of 'personal' pressure on himself to claim a knockout win over Sam Stout at UFC 185 on Saturday.

The British fighter, who met Stout at the preliminary rounds in Dallas, needed a win to halt a run of one win, two losses and a no contest from his four previous fights - and to avoid questioning his future in the sport. 

'It was all personal to me,' he said backstage at UFC 185. 'Live by the sword, die by the sword situation. I went out there and I put a lot of pressure on myself to win.'

Pearson agreed that, following his recent results, defeat by Stout would have led to him making some 'massive decisions'. 

'Like, where was I going in my career in the UFC,' said the 30-year-old, who emerged by winning the lightweight tournament on The Ultimate Fighter 9.

'I don't think the UFC thinks I'm going to be out the door any time soon, because I'm winning fights, but it was personally, what am I going to do in this division? 

The 30-year-old also picked up a 'Performance of the Night' bonus of $50,000 (£34,000)

'Am I going to be a gatekeeper, or am I going to be a guy that's going to push to the top of the world?'

Pearson came through his personal test by out striking Stout before knocking out the Canadian with a booming left hand in the second frame, earning the Brit a $50,000 (£34,000) 'Performance of the Night' bonus.

Next up, Pearson has set his sights on '1,2 and 3' or the top fighters in the 155-pound division.
