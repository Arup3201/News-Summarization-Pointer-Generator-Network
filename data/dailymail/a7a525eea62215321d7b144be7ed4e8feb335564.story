Sabine Lisicki’s mission to exorcise the memories of last season’s Wimbledon wobble continued on Monday with a three-set win over Ana Ivanovic.

Ivanovic was booed off on Saturday evening when she refused to play on because of the darkness, with Lisicki 6-4, 1-1 ahead.

Ivanovic returned on Monday in fine form, taking the rain-interrupted second set 6-3, but she fell apart in the third, losing 6-1 to last year’s beaten finalist.

Falling short: Ana Ivanovic ultimately could not overcome Sabine Lisicki in a thrilling game

Lisicki endured a nightmare final 
against Marion Bartoli last year, her game falling apart in a 6-1, 6-4 
defeat. But the German was close to her best at times as she knocked out
 the 11th seed over the course of three days to reach the quarter-finals
 for the fourth successive year. 

After converting match point with 
her seventh ace, Lisicki said: ‘It was a good match. She is such a good 
player. She hit amazing winners when we started today, then the rain 
came and we were both hitting winners.

‘I have had a great few matches. The fans made me feel so good. It feels like being at home.’
