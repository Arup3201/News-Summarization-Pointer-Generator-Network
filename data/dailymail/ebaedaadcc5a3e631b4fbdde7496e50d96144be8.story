Europe's most active volcano Mount Etna has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside.

The two-day explosion last weekend was the third major burst of activity in under a month, after eruptions on October 26 and again on November 10-11, with the latter burying a seismic station and the access road.

The latest outburst sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night.

It was at its height between midnight and 5am on Sunday morning.

Glowing: In the early hours of Sunday morning, the white ash cascading across Catania's mountain slopes was lit up by molten lava and a full moon

Searing lava: The molten ash burst out at midnight on Saturday, turning the pitch-black night into a sea of flames and smoke

Violent: Tom Pfeiffer, the German geologist who captured the moment, said the eruption was violent and forceful - but he expects another to come soon

And it was captured on camera by German geologist, volcano photographer and tour operator Tom Pfeiffer, 43, from the Schiena dell'Asino on the southern rim of Valle del Bove, around 4km from the crater.

The breathtaking footage shows the volatile volcano emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core.

Mr Pfeiffer said: 'Etna had started a
series of violent eruptions from the same crater in February 2013 until
April, then was relatively quiet throughout the summer until October, 
when another paroxysm occurred.

'Everyone then thought there would be a second one relatively shortly after, but it took about two weeks to occur.

'Now, we're waiting for the next one. The general feeling and opinion is that something big is going to happen soon.'

Contrast: One thick, orange block of smoke coated half the night sky, as the moon set and the sun rose, casting morning light across the mountains

Colourful: Photographer and geologist Tom Pfeiffer stayed up through the night to capture the contrasting colours as molten lava burst out into indigo skies

Outburst: The eruption lasted two days and sent streaks of lava kilometres into the air. Residents of Catania woke to see a mist of orange smoke bathing the sky

Endless: The night came and went, but Mount Etna was still bubbling and bursting, transforming the surrounding land into black and white craters of ash

There
have been more than 40 paroxysmal eruptions since January 2011, always 
at the New SE crater, which formed during this period and has now become
a grown-up summit cone in just two years.

The
November eruptions also changed the volcano's vent geometry, causing it
to produce a series of perfect steam rings - a rare phenomenon.

'I
saw a perfect steam ring racing over the sky, something I had last seen
at Etna back in 2000, when it had a phase of several months to produce 
frequent rings.

Late night activity: This is a shot around midnight, when the lights in the town below are still on. People in Catania could see the explosion but escaped harm

The volcano, in Sicily, Italy, has been relatively quiet over the summer months, but erupted into life on October 26, with a further eruption following on November 10-11

Escaped danger: Despite spitting lava for two days, civilians in Catania were not endangered. However, staff at Catania Airport closed the airspace.

Breathtaking: The images look like paintings as long, think lines of bright orange lava stream across the landscape towards the slopes below

'I 
shouted at my girlfriend Ingrid to look and grab her camera and started 
to take some pictures myself. The steam puffs shot out from the weather 
cloud as small mushrooms and many of them "gave birth" - I have no 
better way to describe it - to rings.

'The
most amazing was to see their rotation, how they detached from the 
plume, and how stable they were despite the storm-force wind up there.

'They
lasted several minutes, perhaps up to 10, becoming smaller and smaller 
with distance, but always stood out as a clear sign in the sky. Some 
penetrated even other clouds at distance.'

Breathtaking: Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, spews molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside during its latest eruption

Fiery sight: A group of men engage in conversation, seemingly unaware that the volatile volcano is emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core

Explosive: The eruption was captured on camera from Acireale, near Cantania. It is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year

Powerful: The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night - forcing airport officials to close airspace over Mount Etna

The explosionÂ  - which is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year - did not endanger any of the 
villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain.

However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe.

This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass.

This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down.

Incredible: The explosion - which lit up the Sicilian sky - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain

Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992 - causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain.

Despite the town of Zafferana being endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid, successful diversion efforts saved the town and only one building was destroyed.

However, the fiery volcano, currently standing at 10,925 feet tall, is still in constant activity. Astonishingly, it is steadily growing, and has been for 500,000 years, when eruptions began.

Its latest eruption was preceded by a violent tremour on Monday, which sent hundreds of perfect smoke rings into the air.

Risk: However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe

Danger: This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass. This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down

No signs of stopping: The fiery volcano is still in constant activity. It is situated on the geological boundary where the European and African plates collide

Experts believe the eruption may have sparked a change in the structure of a vent, perhaps into a particularly circular shape - allowing Mount Etna to spew the unusual smoke-like formations.

The volcano, which came into existence almost one million years ago, has been well-documented since 1500BC, when its eruptions forced civilians to migrate for safety.

Since then, there have been more than 200 eruptions - from the almost undetectable to the catastrophic.

In
122 BC, an explosive eruption spewed so much ash onto the town of 
Catania - crushing hundreds of houses - that the town's inhabitants were
exempted from paying taxes to Rome for ten years.

Horrific: Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992, pictured, causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain

The most powerful eruption to date was in 1669, when the explosions destroyed part of the summit and the lava flows reached the sea more than ten miles away.

This disaster prompted town leaders to attempt to control the flows of lava - to no avail.

An extremely violent eruption in 1852 produced more than 2 billion cubic feet of lava and covered more than three square miles of the volcano's base, while the longest eruption began in 1979 and went on for thirteen years.

Near-miss: The town of Zafferana was endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid; however, successful diversion efforts saved the town from much damage

Mount Etna's current activity consists of 
continuous summit degassing, explosive Strombolian eruptions, and 
frequent basaltic lava flows.

It has proved a constant concern for Sicily - with more than 25 per cent of the island's 
population living on Etna's slopes.

The volatile volcano is also the main source of income 
for the island due to a combination of agriculture - stemming from its rich volcanic 
soil - and tourism.
