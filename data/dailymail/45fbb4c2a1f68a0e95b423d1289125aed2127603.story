A Mormon blogger has said he is facing discipline and possible excommunication by church officials over posts about Mitt Romney.

David Twede's posts offer his account of the history of the church's political involvement, along with criticism of fellow Mormon and Republican presidential candidate Romney.

Twede, a 47-year-old fifth-generation Mormon and the managing editor of MormonThink.com, claimed he was confronted over his posts and advised of the possible discipline at a meeting with local church leaders this week.

Outspoken: David Twede has posted his opinions about the Mormon Church along with his views on Mitt Romney on his blog, landing him in hot water

In a blog post on September 17, Twede, who lives in Florida, described his meeting with church officials the day before.

'Most of my family is true-believing Mormon, and they will be hurt by my probable excommunication for apostasy,' he wrote.

The
Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declined to 
comment specifically on Twede or his blog, saying that disciplinary 
matters were confidential.

But
in a statement, church spokesman Michael Purdy said it would be 
'patently false' to suggest a Mormon would face discipline for having 
questions about their faith or for expressing political views.

'The church is an advocate of individual choice. It is a core tenet of our faith,' Purdy said.

'Church
discipline becomes necessary only in those rare occasions when an 
individual's actions cannot be ignored while they claim to be in good 
standing with the church.'

Public
excommunications are rare in the Mormon religion. But several 
high-profile scholars and feminists had their memberships revoked in the
1990s.

Warnings: The LDS headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. Blogger Mr Twede said church officials told him his website was 'antithetical'

Church leaders set a September 30 disciplinary meeting to address Twede's case, he said. Twede posted to his blog a letter he said is from a Mormon Church official and that says Twede is 'reported to have been in apostasy'.

Twede said church officials did not specify which articles they did not like, but told him being the website's managing editor was 'antithetical to the church'.

He said he has asked church officials to reconsider holding the disciplinary meeting.

In a letter posted on his blog, Twede wrote that he understands that 'some of what I wrote in my blog may have treated the church unfairly'.

Mormon Church disciplinary decision are made at the local level and the outcomes can include probation, dis-fellowship, excommunication or exoneration.

Excommunicated persons can still attend church, but cannot receive the sacrament, hold church callings, speak at services or enter Mormon temples.
