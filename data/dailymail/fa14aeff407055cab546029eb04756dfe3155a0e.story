Two young designers have invented a folding boat which flattens into a shoulder bag - and takes its lone captain just two minutes to assemble.

Its inventors claim the vessel, which unfurls from a 5ft by 3ft sheet of plastic and is strong enough to hold two adults, could revolutionise the way people enjoy rivers, lakes and canals.

It comes with two oars, made from the 
remains of the polyethylene plastic sheet which was used to make the 
body of the boat together with solid ash wood.

Once assembled it transforms into a rigid-hulled boat more than 7ft long and 3ft wide.

Designers Max Frommeld and Arno Mathies came up with the idea while studying at London's Royal College of Art and first showed off a prototype three years ago.

Mr Mathies, from London, said: 'The idea originated from a curve folding paper workshop we did when studying at the RCA.

'Since that workshop we have developed the idea of curve folding and trying to apply it to a bigger scale and then we decided to make a folding boat.

'The boat is made from a single standard sheet of plastic and it only takes two minutes for one person to assemble it.

Simple: The designers tested their creation on the calm waters of London's Regent's Canal

Flat pack: The constituent parts of the boat, most of which were made from a single plastic sheet

Sturdy: The contraption once it is folded into a complete boat. It comes with cushions to make it more comfy

'It can easily fit two people, but it is definitely more comfortable for one person.

'It is still difficult to provide a precise selling price for our product at this stage, but we hope to make it available as soon as possible.'

Mr Mathies said it is easy to explore city centres with the quirky boat because it is so portable.

He added: 'The best thing about our boat is the possibility to explore cities in a different manner.

'It is an alternative leisure activity and method for discovering the rich waterways of the city such as Regentâ€™s Canal in London.

'Its portability provides numerous boating activities because it is light and it can easily fit into a car.'

The creation is far from the world's first flat-pack boat.

Last year keen canoeist and inventor Stuart Woodward from Bath, Somerset, invented the Stakanoo - a canoe which can be assembled from three separate parts in just 60 seconds.

And the 2013 Sydney International Boat Show saw the unveiling of the foldable 'Quickboat', whose creators boasted it could also be clicked together in 60 seconds and travel at 20 knots.
