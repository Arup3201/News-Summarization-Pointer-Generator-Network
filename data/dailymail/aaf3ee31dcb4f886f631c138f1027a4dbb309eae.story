Sergio Aguero, Manchester City’s hero in the last-day drama
two years ago, has been passed fit for Sunday’s title decider against West Ham.

The Argentina striker, City’s 28-goal top scorer despite
missing 19 of the last 32 games, had to watch Wednesday’s win over Aston Villa
from the sidelines with a groin strain but returns to the squad as the Etihad
braces itself for another nail-biting finale. 

‘The whole squad is fit,’ confirmed manager Manuel
Pellegrini. ‘If you have your whole squad and can choose between all your
players it is the most important thing for a manager.’

Pellegrini is well aware of the events in 2012 when City
needed two late goals to beat QPR to snatch the title from Manchester United
on goal difference.

They lead Liverpool by two points going into the last game
this time and must simply avoid defeat against the Hammers to be crowned
champions again.

Pellegrini believes that he and his players will hold their
nerve and promised to go for victory rather than settling for the point that
will prove sufficient.

He added: ‘The experience of the players (in 2012) is always
very important but I think it is a different moment, in a different year, with
a different manager and a different squad.

‘Always to have experience is important but the best way to
work this game is trying to repeat what we have done all year. 

‘Every team must play every game to win. It doesn’t matter
in which conditions they are playing, every team must want to win. When I
arrive here, my target was always to play well and try to win the title.

‘I expect to win. We are thinking not of winning one point
but just to win the match and the best way to do it is to play the way we
always do.

‘Big teams cannot avoid the pressure that you must win
important things. I talk about our team, United, Chelsea, Arsenal Tottenham
Liverpool, all the big teams.

‘There will be the normal nerves we have every week but
normally the last games are the most important because they finish what you did
the whole year. But I always told the players the title would be decided by one
point or one goal. 

‘I think it is very important of the manager to be calm, to
try to repeat what we did the whole year. Preparing the game here is one game
more. We must prepare the same way.

Manchester City will break the Premier League scoring record if they score three goals against West Ham

‘I know how to control the nerves. After so many years, it
is very important to control your emotions because when you have to take
decisions under emotion normally you do it the wrong way.’

City thrashed West Ham 6-0 at the Etihad earlier this season
in the Capital One Cup semi-final, but Pellegrini warned that it will count for
nothing on Sunday.

‘I think that all the games are different,’ he added. ‘We
beat them here in the Capital One Cup, it was a very good game and I hope we
can repeat it tomorrow, but the best way to do it is to play in the same way.

‘We did it especially against Aston Villa, I think that was
one of the best games we played the whole year.’

Should City fall to a shock home defeat by West Ham, Liverpool could steal in and snatch the title from under their noses if they beat Newcastle at Anfield.

The Reds have stumbled in their last couple of games following a home loss to Chelsea and a draw at Crystal Palace, but remain favourites to defeat the Toon on Sunday and keep up the pressure on City.

Liverpool trained at Melwood on Friday and with the title pressure off, looked relaxed as Brendan Rodgers' side looked to have recovered from letting a 3-0 lead slip at Palace on Monday night which severely dented their title aspirations. 

Speaking at his pre-match press 
conference, Rodgers reflected that the Reds has enjoyed a 
successful season regardless of Sunday's outcome and praised his 
players' season performance.

However the Northern Irishman admitted he still hasn't recovered from the Palace capitulation, revealing he has watched the game three times.

'I have watched it three times and I'm still in shock at what happened. I can't believe how we get to 78 minutes with such control and did not win.

'The level of football shows we can cope with the pressure. You can only focus on what has happened and how we can improve. We have had a really successful season.

'Everyone at the start of the season probably thought the top four was a big ask yet here we are talking about the title. It's my job to make sure we improve again.

'I want to congratulate my players on this season. They have put Liverpool on the world map. Come Sunday we will fight to the very end.

'To come second to 
the richest team in history of sport is incredible. This is only the 
beginning. I see and hear about other teams that will improve but I 
think we will improve dramatically. Steven Gerrard will improve 
dramatically next season. We are really excited.

'It's not over. We can only concentrate on our job. We have got a tough game. Us at home and our supporters, we have been a formidable occasion.

'To be successful you have to be able to lose. If you look over the years the great winners have been teams and individuals who have lost and gone on to become champions again.

'For us we have made great strides this season and there is still another game to go.

'If anyone had told us in August we would be top going into the last week of the season we would've taken it.

'We've qualified for the Champions League but there is an awful lot more we want to achieve. I found when I first came in they wanted to learn and wanted to be better. After six months of last season, from last January (2013), they have been absolutely incredible.'
