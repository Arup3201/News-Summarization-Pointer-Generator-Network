The father of the 16-year-old California girl who was brutally gang-raped by as many as 20 men told a jury Tuesday about the horrifying moment he realized his child had been assaulted.

He recounted how he received a vulgar call from his daughter's cell phone from one of her attackers who boasted how good she was at sex. The dad raced to the school and was soon approached by a police officer who called him by his name.

'When he addressed me (by my name), I started to buckle because I had not given my name," the father said.

As the victim passed by on a gurney, the father saw her horribly beaten face and the vomit that was in her hair, the Mercury News said.

'I told her that we loved her very much and to hold on,' he said. 'I could see she was not conscious enough to respond back.'

The father was the first witness in the trial of Jose Montano, 22,Â  and Marcelles Peter, 20, who each face life in prison if convicted.

'I'm envisioning it, and it was a horror,' the dad said.

Prosecutors also said how two condoms, a can of energy drink and a Four Loko were found at the scene.

On Monday, Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney John Cope delivered a graphic opening statement yesterday in which he described how police found the girl propped up by a 
metal beam under a picnic table half-naked and bloodied.

She was 
'incoherent and barely conscious' and covered in alcohol, urine and 
dirt. Cope said Peter took part in the more than two-hour assault on the girl after she was plied with alcohol.

She had a blood alcohol level of .35 and has no memory of the attack.

Opening statements are scheduled today for another defendant in the case, Jose Montano, 22, from Richmond. Both men are being tried in front of dual juries.

Peter is charged with three criminal 
counts of forcible rape, rape by foreign object and forced oral 
copulation. Each count alleges that he acted in concert with others and 
inflicted great bodily injuries on the victim.

Montano faces similar charges.

Cope described the series of events that unraveled on October 24, 2009. The victim, feeling bored and hot, left the school dance and went outside to phone her father when she encountered a male classmate who asked her if she wanted to come and 'party' with them.

After drinking brandy with the boys, things took a turn for the worst, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Witnesses will testify that the victim was punched, kicked and dragged around the area. She was assaulted with a walkie-talkie and someone urinated on her. Others watching were invited to join in.

As many as 20 men are thought to have participated in the attack, Cope told the jury, with one even answering the girl's cell phone and telling her father how good his daughter was at sexual acts.

Peter's attorney Gordon Brown told the jury in his opening statement that DNA evidence found in a condom at the scene was unreliable and that the crime scene had been compromised.

He said that wind from the helicopter could have compromised evidence at the scene and carried Peter's DNA from a beer can to a broken used condom found in the courtyard.

'I don't think we will ever know all that happened,' Brown told the jury.

Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively. They are expected to testify against Peter and Montano.

Two others, John Crane Jr and Elvis Torrentes, still await trial.
