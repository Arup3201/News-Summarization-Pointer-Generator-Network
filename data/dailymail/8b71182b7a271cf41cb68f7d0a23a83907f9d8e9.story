It is thought no more than 200 people have ever laid eyes on the pristine waters of Elizabeth Reef - which is 145km north of Lord Howe Island, off the coast of New South Wales.

And it is no wonder why, as it takes 12 hours to get there and only a select handful of vessels will brave the trip to its northern tip, which is the only place to anchor and explore the wonders the reef has to offer.

But three men - John Green, Ben Ohlback and one only known as Rafael - boarded a boat called Omega to the destination and were lucky enough to capture their experience on camera, including their time on the reef's sand key which only appears between three to six hours during low tide.

A shipwreck is also on sight and is accessible by swimming up to reef and walking along 20m, but the ship is only a third of its original size
