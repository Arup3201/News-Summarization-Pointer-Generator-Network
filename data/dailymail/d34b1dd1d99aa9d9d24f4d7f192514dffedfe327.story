A Tory MP has been criticised after he described viewers of the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies as ‘chavs’.

Stewart Jackson MP accused Dr Christian Jessen of making ‘crap chav TV’ after the TV presenter criticised a fellow Tory MP for being against gay marriage.

The row began yesterday with Dr Jessen alerting his Twitter followers to an article in which David Davies was quoted saying that legalising gay marriage was ‘barking mad’.

Dr Jessen tweeted: ‘Consider that this man is an MP who makes decisions affecting yr life. Worrying.’

Mr Jackson, MP for Peterborough, responded: ‘Yes maybe he shouldn’t be representing his constituents as he sees fit but making crap chav TV like you.’

Twitter users criticised Mr Jackson for effectively attacking the millions of people who watch Embarrassing Bodies, which explores the problems that can affect intimate parts of the body.

One Twitter user said: ‘I forgot only chavs get testicular/breast cancer & so are the only ones who need to learn how to check for it.’

Dr Jessen tweeted: ‘So Tory MP SJacksonMP calls my TV viewers chavs and so shows how beautifully in touch with the public he is. Surprised? Not a lot . . .’
