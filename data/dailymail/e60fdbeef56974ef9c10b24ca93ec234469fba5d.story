Authorities have raided the home of the Sydney siege terrorist's wife, carting away huge paper bags and wheeling containers of unknown material out of the home as neighbours told of their encounters with the murderous militant.

Man Haron Monis, 50, killed two hostages and died in a hail of bullets in the early hours of Tuesday morning after he kept more than a dozen people prisoner inside the Lindt chocolate store in the Sydney central business district (CBD) for more than sixteen hours.

Monis regularly stayed at his wife Amirah's family home in Belmore, in south-west Sydney, where neighbours said they could often hear his prayers to Allah - so loud sometimes they could hear them while underwater in the pool.

Amirah's brother John Aspros was shocked to hear the news that Monis had died and said he was only aware of the siege. 'He was killed?' he asked.

The stunned neighbours said Monis regularly threw garbage bags of rotting food over their fence, as Daily Mail Australia witnessed NSW police and other suited security officials sorting through the home’s two sheds. 

Officers spent more than three hours in the weathered brick home, where three women - believed to include the so-called Sheikh’s partner, Amirah Droudis - were holed up. The suited officers wore gloves as they sorted through two sheet metal sheds out the back of the aged family home.

Neighbours said they could see guns in the officers’ holsters.

Inscriptions on the seized material revealed officers from NSW Police's Critical Incident Unit had seized a large black briefcase from the home which contained several documents. 

An elderly female voice from behind the front door would only say: ‘Get off my property, now.’

It is understood one of the women inside the home has asked neighbours if she can escape the house over their back fence. The neighbour called the Triple Zero emergency line in front of Daily Mail Australia.

One neighbour said she was stunned when she saw Monis on the news on Tuesday morning - who she occasionally saw strolling the streets wearing a white hat and a flowing Islamic dress.

‘Seriously, I’m shocked. Had I seen the guy, you know, on the street struggling with something I would have pulled over with my car and said, "mate can I give you a lift, can I give you a hand. This is the sort of neighbourhood we have here.’

Ms Droudis herself is facing charges of murdering Monis’s ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal in December last year. Monis was charged with being an accessory to the murder. The militant has a considerable rap sheet.

He was facing sexual assault charges for sexually abusing a woman in Wentworthville, in western Sydney, while he was advertising himself as a ‘spiritual healer’. He was also convicted of sending abusive letters to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel. ‘I knew he was an imbecile,’ the neighbour said.

Monis would occasionally say hello but never speak to them. The only common sign of his presence was the regular, loud prayers they heard during the day, which one neighbour said they could hear while swimming underwater in their pool. ‘It was no more praying than you’d hear in a minaret,’ a neighbour said.

Monis would occasionally dump his food waste behind the shed in the neighbour's yard, with the most recent bag containing Coke cans and rotting fruit, but neighbours were not overly concerned with the un-neighbourly stunt.

‘Every few days my husband would go to water the garden and say, "our neighbours left us a present again! And there would be bags of rubbish. And it would be pretty stinky rubbish too.'

NSW Police did not respond to a request for comment. The Australian Federal Police denied any involvement with the raids and a NSW Police Sergeant onsite refused to comment.
