A young driver who passed his test just three days ago was killed alongside his girlfriend and best friend in a horrific crash on a mountain pass notorious for road racing.

Rhodri Miller, 17, was driving with his girlfriend Alesha O'Connor and best friend Corey Price, also both 17, when they collided with an oncoming car on the mountain road near Brecon, South Wales.

Grandmother Margaret Challis, 68, also died in the crash. She was a front seat passenger in a black Volkswagen Golf estate which collided head on with Rhodri's car.

Three people, two teenagers and the driver of the car with Mrs Challis in, remain critically ill in hospital from their injuries.

Rhodri, who had only recently passed his driving test, was said to have joined a 'convoy' of six cars before the crash. 

Seven teenagers, aged 17 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving on the notorious twisting stretch of the A470 which sweeps through the Brecon Beacons National Park.

Grandmother Margaret Elizabeth Challis also died in the crash 

Rhodri and Corey, both pupils at Bro Morgannwg High School in Barry, South Wales, were killed almost immediately in the collision. Corey was a promising football player with the Cardiff City Academy.

Alesha, who attended St Richard Gwyn Roman Catholic High School in Barry, and Mrs Challis, from Merthyr Tydfil, were rushed to hospital but died of their injuries in hospital on Saturday.

Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the four people who died.

Today Andrew Beattie, 37, the step-father of Rhys Hunter - one of the teenagers who survived the crash - told how Rhodri lost control of the car and veered into oncoming traffic. 

'[Rhys] remembers Rhodri losing control of the car as they went around a corner. 

'They went over the other side of the road and hit another car.' 

Rhys suffered a broken leg and has undergone surgery to have the bones put back in position. 

He is recovering at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny and was expected to be allowed home in the next few days. 

'He is lucky to be alive,' Mr Beattie added. 

Rhodri turned 17 on October 11, starting driving lessons just two weeks later. 

A friend said: 'He was delighted to pass so quickly... One of the boys had just had a new car and asked Rhod if he fancied a cruise on Friday - but now this has happened.'   

Two other teenagers travelling in the same car are still in a critical state in hospital and friends on social media are asking for people to pray they pull through.

Mrs Challis, who lived alone, was on her way home from an evening out with a friend when she was killed. 

Next door neighbour Mandy Driscoll described her as 'such a lovely woman'.  

Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver of the car in which Mrs Challis was a passenger remains 'seriously injured' in hospital. 

The mountain pass road reaches 1600ft as it goes through Storey Arms, the main access point for the climb to Penyfan, the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons.

It is a known accident blackspot - there are two roadside shrines less than a mile away from the scene of the latest crash. 

Dylan Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, confirmed one of those killed was a sixth form pupil at the school and a former male pupil had also died while a third pupil was seriously injured in hospital.

Mr Jones said: 'I have spoken to both parents and we are preparing for Monday so that we can offer all assistance and counselling to the pupils.' 

Superintendent Chris Curtis said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families at this difficult time. We are working with South Wales Police in order to provide support to the families affected and also the communities they live within.

'We will work with partners to ensure that the incident is fully investigated.'

Two 17-year-old boys were arrested by Dyfed-Powys Police on Saturday night and joined five other teens, aged 17 and 18, arrested on Friday after the crash.

All seven have been released on bail as the investigation into how the head on collision.
