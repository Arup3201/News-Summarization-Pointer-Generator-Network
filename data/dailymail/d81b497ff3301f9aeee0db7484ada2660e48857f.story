Darren Wilson spoke out for the first time today, to recount how terrified he was of Michael Brown the day he shot the 18-year-old to death in a tragic incident that has sparked national outrage over racial profiling in law enforcement.

But Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was walking with the victim when the two were approached by Wilson on that fateful day in August, says it was the Ferguson, Missouri police officer who was the real fiend and that he too feared he would be shot in the heated confrontation. 

Johnson spoke to CNN a day after it was announced that Wilson would not face charges in the August 9 fatal shooting, saying he was 'very upset' and angry over the grand jury's decision.

He spoke out on Tuesday, saying he was 'very upset' with a grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson on any charges. Pictured above with his attorney James Williams (left)

First interview: Officer Wilson (right) spoke out for the first time in an ABC interview which aired Tuesday. The 28-year-old cop told George Stephanopoulos (left) that Brown charged at him before he fired the fatal shots. That account directly contradicts Johnson's version of events, which state that Brown was trying to surrender 

According to Johnson's account, Brown was killed after raising his hands in an attempt to surrender to Wilson. Wilson on the other hand told ABC in his Tuesday interview that the teen was actually charging at him and that he fired at the teen out of self defense.

The grand jury appears to have disregarded Johnson's account of events in their decision not to bring up a handful of possible charges against Wilson which included first-degree murder, second-degree murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. 

Victims: 18-year-old Michael Brown (left) was shot dead by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown's death was considered similar by many to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (right), who was shot dead in the Florida apartment complex where he was living two years ago by George Zimmerman, who thought he was a burglar

'I know exactly what I saw. I was there the whole time and I definitely saw my friend stop and put his hands up, being compliant after being fired upon.

'He had already shot my friend so there was no way I thought that [Brown] would even believe in himself that he could take on a police officer while he himself was unarmed,' Johnson said.  

'I was in fear for my life. Like I said, Darren Wilson never separated the two of us, he never said "Dorian Johnson I'm not shooting at you, I'm not chasing you" so at the time I thought he was after both of us. I feared for my life,' Johnson added. 

Expected: Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton (pictured) says she was not surprised by the grand jury's decision, but maintained hope that the cop would face consequences for killing an unarmed teenager

Johnson is joined in frustration by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, whose death two years ago sparked similar fury from civil rights activists when shooter George Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury in the slaying.

Fulton also spoke on CNN to accuse Officer Wilson of murder, while admitting she wasn't surprised by the grand jury's decision after witnessing how her own son's case was handled.

'Judging by history, I wasn't surprised but there was a certain part of me that just wanted him to be held accountable for the death of a young man,' she said.

Fulton also isn't surprised by Officer Wilson's account of events, saying he is just trying to save himself from receiving any consequence in the teen's death. 

'You have to remember that it was a murder that was committed here and what did we expect him to say? We're not going to expect him to say things that's [sic] going to convict himself and so he's going to say whatever he needs to say in order to get out of this situation,' Fulton said. 

'He's going to say that he felt threatened...The unfortunate thing is that nobody knows for sure what happened but the officer and Michael Brown. And just as in Trayvon Martin's case, Michael Brown isn't here to tell his side of the story.'
