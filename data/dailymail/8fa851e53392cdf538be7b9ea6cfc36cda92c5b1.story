Could have proven useful for situations like the London

Rumours spread fast, and with social media sites like Twitter it's quicker than ever to share your thoughts – and boasts – with the online world.

But be careful what you tweet; scientists from the University of Sheffield are developing an online lie detector that can tell fact from fiction in just 140 characters or less.

The lie detector, named 'Pheme' after a Greek goddess famed for spreading scandalous rumour, will sift through tweets from news outlets, individuals, members of the public, and automated 'bots' to see if their posts are as truthful as they claim.

A new lie detector is being developed that will sift through user tweets on social networking site Twitter, to tell truth from lies and identify accounts set up to spread malicious rumours

Such a system could have been valuable for situations like the 2011 London riots, where rioters used networks like Twitter to organise themselves and spread untrue information.

'There was a suggestion after the 2011 riots that social networks should have been shut down, to prevent the rioters using them to organise,' says scientist Kalina Boncheva of the University of Sheffield, who is leading the development of the system.

'But social networks also provide useful information – the problem is that it all happens so fast and we can’t quickly sort truth from lies. 

'This makes it difficult to respond to rumours, for example, for the emergency services to quash a lie in order to keep a situation calm. 

'Our system aims to help with that, by tracking and verifying information in real time.'

Pheme
 will use a range of different indicators to tell the difference between
 truthful tweets, malicious rumours, and harmless boasts.

The
 system will assess the authority of the Twitter user, assigning more 
trust to well-known, reliable outlets like experts or news accounts.

It
 will trawl through the history and background of users to pinpoint 
accounts that were created purely to spread lies and rumours.

Pheme
 will hunt for other accounts that confirm or deny the information, and 
keep a close eye on how the conversation is developing - plotting all 
the results in a visual dashboard to easily spot popular rumours that 
are taking hold.

A system like Pheme would have been very valuable during the London riots in 2011. A scene from the riots in Croydon from August 2011 is pictured, as British riot police walk past a burning building in Croydon

Pheme will classify online rumours into four different types: speculation – for example, over rising interest rates; controversy – such as the furore over the MMR vaccine; misinformation – where a lie is spread unknowingly; and disinformation – where the information is spread with malicious intent.

Although the lie detector is not currently up and running, Boncheva hopes to have a final version within 18 months, with working prototypes completed sooner.
