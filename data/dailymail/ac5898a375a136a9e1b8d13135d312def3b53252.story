The Queen is to visit the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George at their new home over the Christmas period.

It will be Her Majesty’s first chance to see Anmer Hall in Norfolk – her wedding present to William and Kate – since the couple oversaw a £1.5 million makeover of the property.

‘They have worked very hard to make Anmer Hall feel like family home,’ says a source.

William and Kate have asked Kate’s parents Carole and Michael, and her younger siblings Pippa and James to stay at the property over the festive period.

The Cambridges will be expected at the Queen’s Christmas Eve supper at her estate at nearby Sandringham, and on Christmas Day they will attend church and have lunch with the rest of the Royal Family, but will be free to spend the rest of the holiday period at Anmer Hall.
