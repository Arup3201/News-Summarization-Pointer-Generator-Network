Ken Livingstone was accused by his own party of crying 'crocodile tears' after it emerged that a political broadcast that made him weep used paid 'supporters’ reading from a script.

The Labour mayoral candidate wept at a screening of his advert featuring 28 unnamed Londoners spelling out why the capital needed Mr Livingstone back in charge.

He had described the saccharine production as a 'real tearjerker'. Labour leader Ed Miliband even patted his shoulder to console the former mayor as he rubbed his eyes during the screening on Wednesday.

In reality, Mr Livingstone had seen 
the film the night before, raising questions about why he was apparently
 caught off-guard. Last night Labour admitted that the 'ordinary 
Londoners' had actually been reading from a script.

They were also paid expenses for their time after the advertising agency BETC hired people from the street.

It is also believed one of the 
'actors’ is a paid-up member of the Labour Party. The advertisement was 
created by film-maker Johnny Maginn of Mustard Films.

At the beginning of the broadcast, Mr
 Livingstone sits behind a desk and says: 'We’ve all seen party 
political broadcasts before but this one’s a bit different.

'It’s a political broadcast on behalf of ordinary Londoners.’

While political parties regularly use
 scripts for their advertisements, Labour supporters rebuked Mr 
Livingstone for apparently pretending to cry.

The grassroots website Labour Uncut 
concluded that either Mr Livingstone's tears were fake or 'he was moved 
to tears listening to sweet words of flattery that he had practically 
written himself'.

Labour Uncut's associate editor, Atul
 Hatwal, added: 'Whether it's tax avoidance, relations with the Jewish 
community or crocodile tears, this election has virtually become a 
referendum on Ken Livingstone.

'There's no space in the debate for policies or issues, just the one, overweening flawed personality.'

Down in the mouth: Mr Livingstone, right, is joined on stage by an equally gloomy-looking Ed Miliband, and this latest gaffe could further damage his election campaign

A spokesman for Mr Livingstone said 
those appearing in the 'party political broadcast are ordinary Londoners
 who are backing Ken on May 3'.

He added: 'No actors were used in the broadcast.'

The campaign team confirmed that those who took part were recruited by the advertising agency and paid expenses.

The 66-year-old's bid to win back the
 London mayoralty from Tory Boris Johnson has so far been buffeted by 
controversy. Mr Livingstone was plunged into a race row after saying 
'rich Jews' would not vote for him.

The former MP was also damaged by 
revelations that he paid himself through a limited company, potentially 
reducing the tax on his income.

Research for Taxation Magazine by 
experts TolleyGuidance suggested Mr Livingstone paid nearly £78,000 less
 tax during the three years to June 2011 by putting his income through a
 private firm.
