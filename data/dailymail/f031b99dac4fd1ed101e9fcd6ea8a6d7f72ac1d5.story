Many consumers buy 'green' or organic household products in the belief they are safer and kinder to the environment.

But many of these products also contain cancer-causing chemicals, a new study has warned.

Australian researchers found that common products marketed as ‘green’, ‘all-natural’, ‘non-toxic’ and ‘organic’ emit compounds that could harm health and air quality.

At this time, consumer products sold in Australia, the US and around the world are not required to list all ingredients, or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called 'fragrance'. 

This means consumers cannot check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous.

Household items marketed as 'green', 'organic', 'all-natural’ and ‘non-toxic’ could still emit compounds that damage health, a study has warned

The researchers analysed 37 different products, such as air fresheners, cleaning products, laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world, including those that claimed to be ‘green’ or ‘organic’.

Then, they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds (VOC) the products emitted.

VOCs are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature.

They can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth, causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse.

In the long term, exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer, liver damage, kidney damage and damage to the nervous system.

The reseachers found 156 different VOCs emitted from the products, with an average of 15 VOCs per product.

Of these 156 VOCs, 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under US federal laws, and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals.

They found the cancer-causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced ‘green’ products

And they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that aren't marketed as organic, researchers said.

The most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes, which were not in fragrance-free versions.

Researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds (pictured). These are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage

Terpenes react very quickly with ozone (a pale blue gas found in the air) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles, the researchers said. 

The researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information. 

Lead author Professor Anne Steinman, of Melbourne School of Engineering, said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain.

She said: 'The paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products.

‘But the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products.

‘Our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored.

‘Given the lack of information, consumers may choose products with claims such as green, natural, or organic, but those claims are largely untested.’
