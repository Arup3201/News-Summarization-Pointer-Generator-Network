Miranda is one half of the best central defensive partnership in Europe and were any Premier League club to land him they would have some player. Think Ricardo Carvalho in the John Terry/Carvalho partnership in Jose Mourinho’s first spell at Chelsea.

Diego Godin is Atletico's Terry – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots, sliding into tackles and heading in set-pieces - while alongside him Miranda is the cool head.

He is the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong. You don’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time.

No you don't! Atletico Madrid central defender Miranda holds off Chelsea striker Fernando Torres this season

Key man: The Brazilian has been important for Diego Simeone during their La Liga title last season

Most commentators in Spain believe 
Miranda has been the best defender in La Liga this season and no one can
 quite understand why both he and his Atletico team-mate Felipe Luis 
have been left out of the Brazil squad.

Six times Lionel Messi faced Miranda this season and the Argentine failed to scored, played out of the game by the 29-year-old who was consistently voted best defender in Brazil before Jorge Mendes helped bring him to Atletico Madrid from Sao Paolo in January 2011.

As well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals, giving Atletico the Spanish Cup last season by notching the winner at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid.

The fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone’s eye this season extends to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. The World Cup-winning manager enquired over the defender’s international status. Unfortunately for Spain, he had already played full internationals with Brazil and can’t follow Diego Costa in making the switch to Spain.

He did move back to Brazil with Sao Paulo in 2006 after ill-fated one-season spells with Coritiba and Sochaux.
