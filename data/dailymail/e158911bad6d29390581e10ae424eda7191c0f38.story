Before fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine, Irina was a croupier in a casino who never dreamt of taking up arms. Now she is gambling with her life.

Using the nom de guerre 'Gaika', a cartoon character that translates as Gadget, she has joined an artillery unit in a pro-Russian separatist group fighting government forces.

'When your home is being destroyed, everything that is dear to you, friends, work... It's about character,' she explains. 'Girls who go into combat are real Russian women.'

'Real Russian woman': Pro-Russian rebel Irina says she has no regrets about going to war against Ukraine

The experience of fighting against the formidable Ukrainian army has been tough but despite that, she has no regrets.

'Howitzers, large vehicles... the noise is what I will remember most,' she says. 'Painful memories go away. 

'We try to focus on the positive, joyful, meeting friends. There are so many friends around now, the war is bringing people closer.'

Her unit, based outside her home town of Donetsk, the main rebel stronghold in eastern Ukraine, is part of a rebel militia called Oplot and includes six women - herself, three medics, a fighter and a reconnaissance specialist.

'I had doubts before allowing women in,' admits their commander Yesaul, a Cossack from the nearby Luhansk region.

'But now I actually have more trust in them then in men. Women don't drink and I am sometimes seriously worried seeing my men's condition when they are relaxing after a mission.'

Like the men in the conflict, the women come from all walks of life. A comrade in arms, who gave her name only as Irina for fear of retribution after the conflict ends, used to work at a petrol station in the town of Gorlovka.

'The fear is always there,' she confesses. 'But I was more afraid when I was sitting at home and hearing shells fly by. Then I got used to the sound.'

Like her comrades, Irina has given up many home comforts, but not all. 'War is war but somehow I still need to wear make-up,' she smiles.

But it's not only the pro-Russian rebels who count women among their number. They are also among the volunteers fighting on the other side of the conflict.

Around 10 women have joined the 150-strong Shakhtarsk Battalion, a paramilitary force fighting alongside government troops, which is based in an oak grove about 40km from the city of Dnipropetrovsk - roughly 250km from Donetsk.

Action: Nadie, 36, is based in the village of Luhanske in eastern Ukraine and has seen action against the rebels

The unit if recovering from a battle in late August around the town of Ilovaysk in which government forces were encircled and suffered heavy losses.

A 20-year-old nurse called Maria was among those who came under fire and says about 30 of the battalion were killed or wounded.

'I didn't want to go into, let's say, humanitarian aid because that makes no real sense if there is no one to drag away our wounded lads,' she explains. 'Many die because there was no one to do that. I do that.'

She says the men and woman 'live, eat and fight together'. In combat, she carries only a pistol and a medical bag so that her hands are free to help the wounded.

Her comrade Alyona, 21, joined up after taking part in anti-government protests in the capital, Kiev, that culminated in the removal of former president Viktor Yanukovych who had been sympathetic to Moscow.

Feminine: Despite the privations of life on the frontline, women fighting on both sides don't scrimp on make-up

First she joined the National Guard but found the role - maintaining roadblocks and checking documents - less than interesting. 'I wanted to fight,' she insists.

'This is just the beginning, the so-called ceasefire is just a pause. I want to fight until the end.'

Although some women serve alongside their husbands and boyfriends, others are single, although that doesn't mean they're treated differently.

Female fighters on both sides say the men in their units treat them as equals, though sometimes showing more leniency. They have little respect for men who have not taken up arms.

'If a man has come to fight, he is a man. Real men fight,' said the rebel fighter Gaika. 'Those sitting in the city and sipping beer should put on skirts. It's shameful.'

Paramilitary: A number of paramilitary forces are fighting for Ukraine, among them the Shakhtarsk Battalion

Pro-Ukraine: Also fighting against the rebels is the paramilitary St. Maria Battalion currently based in Mariupol

On both sides, fighters expect a long conflict - despite the fragile ceasefire now in place. Among them is red-haired rebel fighter, Alla.

'So many people, children and women, were killed on our side. Now I don't want a ceasefire,' she says.

Alla has been with the separatist rebels since the start of the conflict, first serving as a cook on a roadblock.

'She fired her first training shots at a duck on a river and now has a pistol and an assault rifle - both of which she's more than happy to use.

'Maybe I won't kill many of them but if someone is coming, I will get him.'
