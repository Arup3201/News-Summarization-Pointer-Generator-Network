Cause: Prince Harry vowed to bring the event to Britain after being inspired by the US Warrior Games

Harry is a serving Army officer who was the driving force behind the Invictus Games, while the Mrs Biden is a keen supporter of forces families in the US and is involved in a number of initiatives.

One of highlights of the day was the rowing events where the servicemen and women, many with missing limbs, battled each other and the clock as they competed over a number of distances.

Former Royal Engineer Captain, Nick Beighton - who lost both legs in 2009 after stepping on an improvised explosive device while in Afghanistan, won gold as the British Armed Forces team claimed a clean sweep of medals in the one-minute rowing machine sprint event.

He also claimed victories in a four-minute rowing race and in a team event.

The two high profile spectators were all smiles as they enjoyed the action on the third day of the event, which sees wounded serving or veteran servicemen and women from across the globe.

Harry presented the medals to the British trio - Mr Beighton, silver medallist Scott Meehan and Cowan Botha who came third.

The ex-officer, from Shrewsbury, who lost his legs during an explosion while on a foot patrol in Afghanistan in 2009, competed in the Paralympics but narrowly missed out on a bronze medal in the double sculls.

He added: 'There was a real buzz out there everyone lifted their game but you try and tune it out a little but because you're trying to focus on what you're doing.'

He added: 'It's given everyone the opportunity to compete not just the Paralympians among us but right down to the people who have recently been injured -it's great to have a focus to get out there and do something.' 

The Invictus Games began on Wednesday night with a rousing military-themed ceremony that celebrated the achievements of injured, wounded and sick servicemen and women.

Prince Harry praised competitors, many still serving soldiers, from around the globe for their stories that 'move, inspire and humble'.

Inspired by the US Warrior Games, Prince Harry vowed to bring a larger event to the UK.

In the ceremony, in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the home of London 2012, Harry was introduced by US first lady Michelle Obama who had recorded a video message for the launch.

The prince told the 6,500 spectators who had watched the opening ceremony: 'No longer are these inspirational men and women defined by their injury but as athletes, competitors and team mates.

'Over the next four days we will see some truly remarkable achievements. For some of those taking part, this will be a stepping stone to elite sport but for others it will mark the end of a chapter in their recovery, and the beginning of a new one.'

He ended with the passionate words; 'Finally, I would like to thank you for the tremendous example you set. Your stories move, inspire and humble us. You prove that anything is possible, if you have the will.'
