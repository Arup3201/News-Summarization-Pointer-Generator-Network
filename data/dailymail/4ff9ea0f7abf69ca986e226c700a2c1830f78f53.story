Pick a card. Any a card. Although perhaps not for much longer?

A new device that contains the information of all the credit cards you have in your wallet or purse has been developed by a company in San Francisco.

Known as Coin, the company's plan is for for people to ditch the plastic, their bulging wallets and purses, and instead just use one single computerized card to handle all of your cash transactions.

The way of the future: The Coin card aims to make paying with multiple credit cards simpler by incorporating everything you own onto one device

Past/Future: Coin wants to replace bulging wallets full of credit cards with a single device called a Coin (right) that can hold the information of all the cards you own

The seven-person start-up has introduced an all-in-one credit card on which users will be able to load all of their credit or debit card information.

The clever part about the Coin card is that is uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card, however the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use.

A small microchip holds the information of up to eight cards securely in the device. The buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button.

However critics have claimed the device is nothing to get too excited about. As countries slowly move towards the more secure Chip & PIN credit card system, the Coin device is likely to become obsolete.

Compact: The Coin car is sleek and small by a regular credit card but it can hold the information of up to eight others including debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and membership cards

'This is designed for the lifestyle of today with the technology of tomorrow,” says Kanishk Parashar, founder of Coin. 'You don’t need eight cards every day, so your phone is kind of like your drawer, and your Coin is kind of like your wallet.'

Users then take photos of their cards, swipe them through the dongle and upload them to the Coin mobile app, which stores the info onto your Coin card. When you want to pay, you browse through stored cards on your Coin, select one, and swipe it anywhere credit, debit or gift cards are accepted.

Information is loaded onto the card through a mobile app. The process of adding card information to the mobile app is very simple and is done by taking a picture or two and swiping credit cards through a dongle attached to your phone.

Mobile payments remain an elusive area with a number of banks and card suppliers attempting to come up with a convenient, safe and secure solution.

One card for all: Coin is fabricated with a patent-pending magnetic strip that can change depending on what card one wants to use. The battery in Coin is supposed to last up to two years

Convenient: The coin card is approximately the size of a single credit card that can store all your swipe-able cards and be used to pay everywhere cards are accepted, all in real time

In order to make a payment with this card, users tap a button on the Coin card and pick which account they want to pay with, whether it's a business credit card or a personal debit card. After picking an account, the Coin card is swiped through, no different than any other card.

Both tech large and small have attempted to crack the mobile payments sector and any firm able to facilitate person-to-person or person-to-business transitions on a mass scale stands to gain significant profit off such payments.

Will Oreumus, a blogger with FutureTense, isn't convinced the technology will takeoff.

'To
me, the only real problem with Coin is that it feels like a stopgap 
technology, like those CD-changer cartridges that were popular for a 
little while before everyone switched to mp3s.

Replacing
eight cards with one may lighten your load by an ounce or two, but is 
that enough to convince people to take the leap of faith involved in 
adopting a new payment system?

Even
early adopters could be forgiven for holding out for a more 
comprehensive digital wallet—the kind that will let you pay for 
everything just by tapping your phone, or perhaps some other, even more 
seamless gesture.'

Other 
critics have said the card is not forward-thinking or future-proof 
whatsoever. One claimed it was nothing more than 'old technology wrapped
up in a posh case.'

'This
is not at all useful overseas where Canada, Mexico and most of Europe 
use Chip & PIN. In fact, it's typical American thinking whereby the 
developers have only thought of themselves and not of the winder 
consequences of usefulness of the product.Save your $100 if I were you!'

How it works: Your credit cards and loaded onto the Coin app by swiping them in and taking a photo. The Coin card can then be used like a normal credit card

Smart card: The Coin card uses a Bluetooth emitter which means if the card is left behind for any reason the card will no longer function

The
battery in Coin, said to last up to two years, powers a small display 
screen that shows which saved card will be charged, along with its 
expiration date.

Cards are entered into Coin after being swiped on a Square-like dongle plugged into a smartphone.

There are also few worries about leaving the card behind somewhere or losing it altogether.

The coin card only operates if your smartphone is nearby by using the Bluetooth signals.

If the card is disconnected for more than ten minutes, the phone will alert the customer that they have left their card behind.

If the owner drifts too far from Coin, his or her smartphone will alert them. If the card is disconnected for more than 10 minutes, it automatically disables itself, which could potentially be an issue if a phone runs out of juice.

Coin can be preordered for $55, with an expected delivery time of 2014. Later, it plans on selling the cards for $100 each.
