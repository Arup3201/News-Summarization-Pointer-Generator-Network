These blundering crooks literally put themselves in the frame  when they took a set of gun-toting selfies with a stolen phone which automatically uploaded the incriminating pictures to the internet.

The two men are suspected of robbing two young women on the streets of New Orleans, making off with their cell phones and purses.

But  it appears that after the robbery they could not resist using one of the phones to capture a set of selfies in which they are seen pointing handguns at the camera and throwing up gang signs. 

Selfie destruct: The two robbery suspects in blue shirts (left and right) are being hunted by police after pictures taken on a stolen phone of them posing with handguns were automatically uploaded to the internet

The suspects, one of which has now been identified by police, had not realised that the stolen phone was programmed to automatically upload pictures to the owners cloud-based data storage account.

In one of the photos distributed by the police, the two suspects wearing blue shirts stand with a third male wearing white, as they each point a gun at the camera.

Police have identified one of the men as Darious Anderson, 20, and are now seeking him and the other man. 

The robbery occurred early on Friday morning in the Marigny neighborhood, adjacent to the storied French Quarter.

Three women, one of them 20 and the others 19, were approached on the street at 4 a.m. by two men who demanded their possessions, police said.

'This is real, give me everything you got!' said the suspects, believed to be Anderson, who wore his hair in dreadlocks, the victims told police.

The women gave the men their purses and phones before running away, police said.

While investigating the case, police found that photos of the suspects taken with one of the victims' phones had been posted to her account, police said.

No arrests have yet been made in the case, they said.
