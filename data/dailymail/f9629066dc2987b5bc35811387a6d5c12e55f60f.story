A female teacher is facing aggravated sodomy and child molestation charges over the alleged indecent assault of a 15-year-old boy.

Victoria Tatum, 24, was arrested at Newton County High School in Georgia on Thursday on felony charges and booked into jail without bond. 

Tatum, from Decatur, has been charged with two counts of aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy, and enticing a child.

Victoria Tatum, 24, was arrested at Newton County High School in Georgia after allegedly engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy 

A worried family member reported the relationship to police on Tuesday, according to the Rockdale Citizen.

The math teacher, who is originally from Pennsylvania, was in her first year of teaching at the high school. 

It is not believed that any of the sexual molestation incidents took place on school grounds and have been going on for several weeks. 

It is believed that only one student was involved, police said on Thursday.  

Tatum was hired by Newton County Schools on July 28 this year. A criminal background check came back negative for charges at the time she was hired.

The 24-year-old has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of both the Sheriff’s Office investigation as well as an internal investigation being conducted by the Newton County School System.

In a statement to MailOnline today, Sherri Davis-Viniard, NCSS spokesperson, said: 'These are very serious charges.

'Newton County Schools is cooperating fully with the Newton County Sheriff’s Office in their investigation. We encourage anyone with information to please contact the Sheriff’s Office at once.'
