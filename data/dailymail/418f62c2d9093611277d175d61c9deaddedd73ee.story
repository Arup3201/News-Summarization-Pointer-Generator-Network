After seven years and six children,Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are finally engaged.

Robert Procop, a private jeweller for the couple, today revealed he designed an engagement ring for the actress under the actor's guidance.

And Brad's spokeswoman Cynthia Pett-Dante later confirmed the news, saying: 'It is a promise for the future and their 
kids are very happy. There's no date set at this time.'

The 36-year-old actress was spotted wearing the ring on her wedding finger at the Chinese Art collection at the LA County 
Museum earlier this month, where she was pictured with Brad, 48, and their son Pax, eight.

A spokesperson for the jeweller announced the news to the world, saying: 'I
 can confirm that, yes, Robert Procop did indeed design an engagement 
ring for Angelina Jolie, designed in collaboration with Brad Pitt.'

Procop
 said: 'Brad had a specific vision for this ring, which he realised over
 a yearlong collaboration. He wanted every aspect of  it to be perfect, 
so I was able to locate a diamond of the finest quality and cut it to an
 exact custom size and shape to suite Angelina's hand.

He continued: 'Brad was always 
heavily involved, overseeing every aspect of the creative design 
evolution.

'The side diamonds are specially cut to encirlce her finger. 
Each diamond is of the highest gem quality.'

Experts estimate the ring cost around $250,000.

Angelina's father Jon Voight was among the first to publicly congratulate the pair, telling Us Weekly: 'I'm very happy for them.'

Angelina has been married twice before - to 
British actor Jonny Lee Miller between 1996 and 1999 and then Billy Bob Thornton, from 2000 to 2003.

Brad's marriage to Jennifer Aniston 
lasted five years before they announced they were divorcing in early 2005 - which came after he had met Angelina on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith.

Brangelina
 - as they became known - quickly became a Hollywood power couple, with a
 brood of six children; five-year-old Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne, aged three, along with three adopted children Maddox, 10, Pax, eight, and Zahara, seven.

The couple once insisted they wouldn't wed until the legalisation of same-sex marriage in America.

Beverly Hills jeweller Robert Procop worked closely with Brad Pitt on the engagement ring for more than 12 months. He has been the private jeweller to Angelina Jolie for over a decade and collaborated with the actress for Style of Jolie – a jewellery collection auctioned off for charity last year. He is the former CEO of Asprey & Garrard, the British jewellery firm which has worked with the English royal family.

But Brad recently admitted he didn't feel they'd be to wait that long because of mounting pressure from their children.

'It seems to mean more and more to our kids,' he said in January.

'We
 made this declaration some time ago that we weren't going to [get 
married] till everyone can. But I don't think we'll be able to hold out …
 it means something to me, too, to make that kind of commitment.'

Angelina has also said that their children often ask why they aren't married like 'Shrek and Fiona'.

She said just months ago: 'We've 
explained to them that our commitment, when we decided to start a 
family, was the greatest commitment you could possibly have.

'Once you have six children, you're committed.'

Their high-profile romance has made headlines since sparks first flew on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith back in 2004.

There was intense speculation they started up a relationship while Brad was still with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston.

Brad
 and Jen announced they were divorcing in early 2005 - but it wasn't 
until early 2006 that Angelina and Brad acknowledged their relationship 
when the actress revealed she was pregnant.

In October 2008, Angelina told The New 
York Times that her children loved Mr & Mrs Smith because: 'Not a 
lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.'

However, the actress has maintained that
 she and the heartthrob remained nothing more than friends until after 
Pitt and Aniston announced they were divorcing.

She once said: 'To be intimate with a 
married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I
 could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that.
 I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.'

Angelina also said in a 2006 interview 
with U.S. Vogue that when she met the actor, she had not known 'exactly 
where Brad was in his personal life.'

She said: 'But it was clear he was with 
his best friend, someone he loves and respects. And so we were both 
living, I suppose, very full lives.

Chemistry: The pair met on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005

'Brad was a huge surprise to me,' she 
added. 'I think we were the last two people who were looking for a 
relationship. I certainly wasn't. I was quite content to be a single 
mom.'

The star also said that she and Brad had taken a 'long time' before deciding to embark on a relationship.

'We spent a lot of time contemplating 
and thinking and talking about what we both wanted in life and realised 
that we wanted very, very similar things,' she said.

'And then we just continued to take time. We remained very, very good friends - with this realisation - for a long time.

Angelina sought to explain how the film, a romantic comedy action film, had 'brought' she and Brad together.

'Because of the film, we ended up being 
brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this
 strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly 
happened,' she said.

'I think a few months in I realised, "God, I can't wait to get to work."'

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie may have already picked out the perfect location for their nuptials.

The pair are believed to be building a huge reception hall behind a chapel on their £35million estate in the South of France.

Aerial image of the construction site in February show a large white building being erected next to the quaint chapel which is part of their Provence chateau.

It is believed that builders are working hard to have the venue ready for September.

The couple are also understood to have visited the site to check on progress over the weekend.

They were already in France to attend
 the Paris premiere of Angelina’s directorial debut In the Land of Blood
 and Honey on February 16.

The pair purchased the Miraval 
property but are yet to move in as the sprawling estate has already 
undergone a series of renovations.

Of course, the country is dear to the couple's hearts with Angelina giving birth to their twins in Nice in 2008.
