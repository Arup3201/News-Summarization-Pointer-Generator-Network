Jen Arnold, star of reality show The Little Couple which follows a husband and wife who have dwarfism, has announced that she is fighting a rare form of cancer.

The Houston neonatologist broke the news just as she and husband Bill Klein, who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition, brought their second adopted child home to Texas.

The 39-year-old is currently having surgery and chemotherapy and is keeping a positive outlook.

Stars: Bill Klein and Jen Arnold, who is being treated for cancer, at the Gracie Awards Gala in 2011

Struggle: Jen and husband Bill have had a challenging few years as they tried to start a family

'While there is never a good time to get 
news like this, getting it just as we are building our new family is 
tough in many ways,' Ms Arnold told People.

Details of the type of cancer that has been diagnosed have not been released, but the mother-of-two said in a Facebook statement: 'I am very fortunate as the prognosis is good.'

Although she said she was ready to battle through the cancer treatments, a tweet from Ms Arnold's husband suggested she was feeling frail.

Mr Klein tweeted: 'My darling wife released today that she is currently battling a form of cancer. Prayers are welcome, hugs are not due to her weakened state.'

The couple met through an online dating website for little people and married in 2009. Mr Klein says he first saw his wife when she was 10 and they were both having surgery at the same hospital.

Heartfelt: Bill responded to his wife's announcement with a tweet asking for support from the couple's fans

The doctor, whose dwarfism is caused by a rare form of skeletal dysplasia called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, said: 'Being surrounded by the love of my husband and our two beautiful children is actually in many ways giving me the strength to fight it even stronger.'

The couple, who have starred in the TLC series since The Little Couple: Just Married aired in 2009, had only recently brought home their daughter Zoey, a two-year-old they adopted from India. 

Their desire to start a family has formed the main plot line of their show, which has so far spanned five seasons and will continue to chronicle their lives she Jen fights the disease.

'TLC has chronicled Bill and Jen's lives since 2009 and at their request, we will be following them through this challenge," a spokesperson said Friday.

'Jen is a doctor and teacher and she saw this as an opportunity to educate and possibly help, through sharing her story.'

Newlyweds: Bill and Jen show off their remodeled kitchen. They custom built their Texas home from the ground up to be accessible to their smaller stature

Adopting two children in rapid 
succession is something they say they are prepared for. 'I wanted us to 
be parents before we were too old to enjoy being parents,' Jen said 
recently.

The couple decided to adopt because Jen's bone-growth disorder meant pregnancy was not advised for the 3ft 2in doctor and surrogacy failed.

Initially they hoped to have a genetic child and her eggs were harvested and a surrogate found who was happy to carry the child. After several attempts the couple was overjoyed when they found out their surrogate, who was also featured on their show, was pregnant

But the joy ended tragically when she miscarried.

Jen, who works at Texas Children's Hospital, was devastated after learning the news while at work.

'I cried my eyes out,' she told People at the time.

'I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.'

Happy couple: Jen and Bill have starred in the TLC series since their wedding in 2009

Challenges: The couple with Will. They found out Jen had cancer just as they brought daughter Zoey home

Support: Jen with husband Bill Klein, who also stars in reality show The Little Couple

Caring: The proud parents watch as first son Will blows bubbles on a day out

The couple first adopted their son, Will, who was born in China. They welcomed him to their home in April after going to get him on a two-week trip to China featured on the show.

Both of the children they chose to adopt have dwarfism, and the couple of spoken of how their own experiences led to them wanting to help children with the same condition.

Jen and Bill responded to criticism in recent months when it was revealed that they were to adopt Zoey just a few months after settling Will in.

The couple explained that they had been on a waiting list with Little People of America for four years, when they were contacted and told about the 19-month-old girl in need of a family.

Struggles: In her efforts to start a family Jen went through multiple grueling rounds of IVF egg retrieval and tried surrogacy. The couple's surrogate miscarried and they turned to adoption

'We always thought we wanted two kids in general. What were we going to do, say no?' she told The Wrap. 'It wasn’t that we intended to, or tried to, adopt two children at one time. It’s just how the stars aligned, really.'

Millions of viewers watch the show, which has followed the couple from their wedding and early days as newlyweds, through their attempts to start a family which resulted in the overseas adoptions.

The couple have been praised by fans of the show for being able to turn the focus away from what makes them stand out to what they actually have in common with everyone else.

Although sensitive issues are dealt with in the show, such as hurtful stares from strangers, mostly the Little People is about two newlyweds going through the same experiences as others as they hunt for their dream home and start a family.

Positive: Jen relaxes on a fishing trip. Despite being treated for a rare form of cancer she says the prognosis is good

Battle: Jen has not said what type of cancer she has, but the always optimistic mom and animal lover, who also co-owns a pet store, is determined to beat it

Ms Arnold is known for her positive 
outlook on life, and earlier this year talked about how the obstacles 
she has faced in life made her stronger.

'In general, we are pretty tough people,' she told People.'We are good at putting things in perspective because of our life experiences. I am not a person to give up when something is important.'

The doctor had already had about 30 surgeries and medical procedures related to her genetic condition.

She then endured multiple IVF egg retrieval rounds, cameras rolling.

The next season, which will follow her latest battle, does not yet have a premiere date.
