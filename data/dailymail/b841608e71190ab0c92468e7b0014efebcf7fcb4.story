He spent 24 years on death row, but has been named a free man once more.

Michael Keenan, who was convicted in 1988 for the stabbing death of 19-year-old Tony Klann in a Cleveland Park, had the murder charge against him dismissed by a judge.

The dramatic turn in events began yesterday, when the clean-shaven 62-year-old was ready to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges in a bid to get out of jail.

Murdered: Tony Klann was 19 when his body was found washed up in Doan Creek; Keenan maintained his innocence the entire time he was on death row

Cuyahoga County judge John Russo dismissed the aggravated murder count against 62-year-old Michael Keenan after determining evidence that could have exonerated him was withheld from his trial attorneys.

He set Keenan’s bond at $5,000, a low sum that the Cleveland Plain Dealer notes will allow him to leave prison very soon.

Keenan’s co-defendant Joe D’Ambrosio was freed in 2010 by a judge citing the same reason.

A federal judge ruled in 2006 that prosecutors in D’Ambrisio’s murder trial withheld vital bits of information that could have exonerated him.

Keenan was convicted twice of killing Tony Klann in a Cleveland park and then dumping his body in Doan Creek.

Keenan's attorney says a priest who befriended the co-defendant helped uncover evidence favourable to both men.

Released: Joe D'Ambrosio was on death row until a judge exonerated him in 2010

A federal judge in April had ruled that Keenan must be retried or the verdict set side.

Throughout the two decades he spent on death row, he and D’Ambrosio maintained their innocence.

A man named Eddie Espinoza pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection to the teenager’s death for a reduced sentence.

He was sent to prison in 2001, and died eight years later.

He testified against them, saying that Keenan slit Klann’s throat while D’Ambrosio stabbed him.

The Plain Dealer notes that Keenan will again have to appear in court in October, but this time as a free man.
