A pet owner was forced to watch as a neighbour's dog burst through her front door and savaged her tiny pet to death.

Julie Davies, 55, was in the kitchen cooking dinner at her flat in Highworth, Wiltshire, when the vicious Rottweiler-Bullmastiff cross burst into the family home through the open door.

It lunged at Ms Davies' Yorkshire Terrier Maltese cross Pepe - which was cowering under the kitchen table - and killed it instantly.

Ms Davies and her partner Swithin Cardoso, 40, managed to grapple the dog out of the ground floor flat, but it remained in the car park at the block of flats until police arrived.

But Ms Davies warned it could have been far 
more serious as her nine-month-old granddaughter arrived at the flat just 10 minutes
 after the attack.

She said: 'It was terrifying. It was just fear. You knew straight away. I froze in fear because you could just see his whole behaviour and his head was going from side to side.

'My little dog ran from the living room just because he heard the door bang. He was under the kitchen table and this dog just lunged.

'He threw himself at my dog. I knew within seconds our dog was dead. It was absolutely horrendous.'

The incident happened around 8pm on Tuesday as Ms Davies cooked dinner.

dog Missy - who was not hurt in the attack - and her children Mia, left, Francesca, second from right and Tom Davies,

could have been the victim

Ms Davies had left the kitchen door open to allow a breeze through her flat on
 one of the hottest days of the year.

The dog then ran up 
the external stairs and pounced at Pepe, a family pet for more than six years.

Her partner Swithin, who is 6ft 5ins tall, wrestled with the dog, before forcing it back outside.

been put down by the owner. No charges have been brought by police (file

The dog has now been put down by the owners, police say.

Ms Davies said: 'It infuriates me because if it had been 10 minutes later my granddaughter would have been here, crawling around. It doesn’t even bear thinking about.'

Marie Burns, 33, Ms Davies' daughter and mother to her granddaughter Mia, said: 'The owner of the dog arrived 15 minutes later, before the police.

'He didn’t seem to care or show any remorse. He just said it was his girlfriend’s dog and it had nothing to do with him.

'When we told him our dog had been killed, all he could say was "It’s only a dog". He just kept saying it’s not his problem.'

Police were unable to take any action, but a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'Police officers have no power to seize dogs unless they witness an attack themselves or if the animal is a banned breed.

'The owners of the dog involved have taken the decision to put the animal down.

'The investigation is continuing to ascertain the circumstances around the incident and any witnesses should contact 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.'
