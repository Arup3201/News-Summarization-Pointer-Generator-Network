More than half of women risk unwanted pregnancy at Christmas, a survey has revealed

Many people worry about piling on the pounds or arguing with the in-laws at Christmas, but new research suggests there are other hidden dangers.

More than half of women risk unwanted pregnancy at Christmas, a survey has revealed.

Some 51 per cent forget to take their contraceptive pill, have to get the morning after pill, or have an unplanned pregnancy during the festive season, the researchers found.

They believe these lapses are down to drunken partying, hectic diaries and visiting family.

The research comes from LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor which says its data shows a 32 per cent increase in the use of its online contraception services at Christmas.

The pharmacy interviewed 2,000 women and discovered one in six have forgotten to take the Pill because they were drunk.

One in seven have missed taking it because they were distracted by the hustle and bustle of Christmas.

According to the survey, one in six women have missed taking the Pill for a few days while they struggled to get a repeat prescription.

And one in three say they find it hard to see a doctor or nurse in December.

Another 28 per cent admit to failing to take the Pill because they had gone to stay with relatives and forgotten to pack it.

As a result, it is perhaps no surprise that 13 per cent of women admit to having had to take the morning after pill over Christmas and one in 14 say they have needed it after their office Christmas party.

Dr Tom Brett, Medical Director for LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor said: ‘We often see peaks in our contraceptive services after the weekend but during November and December as the party season gets underway, there is a clear and significant uplift in orders. 

‘The combination of an increased need for contraceptive services with reduced hours at local GP surgeries over the festive holiday period can leave some women wondering where to go as many might not be aware that it is possible to seek this sort of help online.’

Only five per cent of people say they have used an online pharmacy but 45 per cent say they would consider it if the Pill could be prescribed and delivered to their door for a small fee.
