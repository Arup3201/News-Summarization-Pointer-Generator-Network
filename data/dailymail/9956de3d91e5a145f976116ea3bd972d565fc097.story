Search crews have found the bodies of a central Indiana woman and her five-year-old son, who were swept away after their vehicle became submerged in flood waters.

Conservation officers recovered the bodies of 24-year-old Jana Payton and Bronson Liggett in a flooded field Saturday afternoon along the White River in Owen County.

Conservation Officer Angela Goldman says the Paragon residents vanished in the early hours of Saturday morning after a friend who had been driving Payton's car left the pair, who could not swim, on the flooded car's rooftop and swam away to find help.

Goldman says that the woman called 911 at a nearby home, but when she returned about 15 minutes later at 1:45am, Payton and her son were no longer with the car.

Their bodies were found near the town of Gosport about 40 miles southwest of Indianapolis shortly after 4pm Saturday.

The victims' family say they believe they became lost on the dark, flooded road.

'I think they just had minutes to decide what to do, and it wasn't the right decision,' Payton's cousin, Mary Finney, told ABC 6.

Payton was a single mother of two children who held down two jobs, at a pizza parlor and a grocery store, to support her family.

The tiny town of Paragon, home to just 659 residents, is shaken by the deaths.

'It will be a huge thing here,' FinneyÂ  said. 'Everybody knew her. And everybody loved her.'

Finney described her cousin as affectionate, hardworking, positive and dedicated to her two sons, Bronson and his older brother, aged seven.

'They were inseparable,' she said of Payton and Bronson. 'I don't think that either one of them could have survived without the other.'
