A wildlife photographer kept his cool when an eleven-foot polar bear got up close and personal with his camera.

Bill Drumm, 29, captured the softer side of the enormous animal as it investigated his equipment.

He came across the bear, nicknamed Scar, while he was riding a Tundra buggy through Churchill in Manitoba, Canada. 

As he approached, quick-thinking Bill hung his camera out of the window just inches from the bear's nose.

Scar, roamed around the wagon and then stopped briefly to feast on a carcass.

Smile: 'I couldn't believe my luck that my camera was ready and waiting for the bear to take his own selfie,' said photographer Bill Drumm

Time for a snowball fight: Bill also captured the huge bear, nicknamed Scar, balls up some snow in his claws 

Bill, from Monterey in California, USA, said: 'Out of nowhere the bear got up and headed straight for our buggy.

'I was taking a photo of him when suddenly he jumped up on his back legs and stood right up to the side of the vehicle.

'When he was up there he took a few big whiffs of the air and looked around at the surprised people inside.'

He added: 'Everyone was really shocked the first time he jumped up like that.

'I couldn't believe my luck that my camera was ready and waiting for the bear to take his own selfie.'

During a six-week span in October and November, Manitoba has the highest concentration of polar bears in the world.

The bears gather along the coast, and wait for ice to form in the sea so they can begin hunting seals.

I give up! The bear investigated the buggy for a while, only stopping to eat a carcass, but here, he looks like he's growling in frustration
