Six in ten of the most expensive streets in Britain are crammed into one London borough, a report has found.

But not only is Kensington and Chelsea home to most of the country’s dearest properties, Egerton Crescent in South Kensington has been named as the street with the highest-priced homes of all for the second year running.

According to the survey by Lloyds Bank, the grade-II Georgian houses in the crescent are worth more than £7.3million each on average.

In stark contrast, Burnley, Lancashire, has been revealed to be home to the most affordable streets in Britain - with four streets ranked among the top five cheapest in the country.

In 2011, four streets in Burnley, Lancashire, were ranked among the top five most affordable streets in England and Wales.

Angle Street - which has a population of 
80,000 people - was named the most affordable road in England and Wales in 2011 - with homes in this area 
costing just £32,400.

Meanwhile, Elmwood Street, Spencer Street and

Withinlee Road in Macclesfield, Cheshire - where homes go for almost £1.9million - is the only street outside southern England to be placed among the top 50 dearest streets in England and Wales, ranking at 48.

Lloyds economist Nitesh Patel said: ‘Kensington and Chelsea has long had a global appeal and in more recent years the area has attracted many ultra-wealthy  foreign buyers. 

‘Low housing supply also helps support high property values in this area.

‘Across most regions, the most expensive streets are clustered in the same area.'

This year, house prices have soared in central London amid strong interest from wealthy overseas buyers looking for a safe haven to place their cash.

Recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that house prices in London rose by 12 per cent year-on-year in October, pushing the typical house value across the English capital to a staggering £437,000.

The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, London, has been ranked as the country's second most expensive street.
