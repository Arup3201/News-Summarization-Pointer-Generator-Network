A Hindu man was gobsmacked to find out that his favourite Golden Circle juice contains traces of meat and alcohol.

Sonjoy Chakraborty, from Melbourne, discovered the shocking revelation when he decided to write to Heinz Australia after he heard that such ingredients could be found in some fruit drinks.

The company replied saying that the Golden Circle long-life range was made using a clarifying agent derived from beef and that alcohol-based flavours were used across the drinks range.

‘This is wrong and unethical,’ Mr Chakraborty told GoodFood. ‘We are Hindu, beef is prohibited, alcohol is prohibited. But also I don’t want to give anything that contains alcohol to my kids.’

The clear apple juice used in the Golden Circle long life juice and drink range is made clear using a variety of clarifying agents one of which is from a beef source

Sonjoy Chakraborty was disgusted to discover traces of beef could be found in Golden Circle juice as being a Hindu his religion prohibits him to eat it

Heinz responded confirming none of the ambient Golden Circle juice range was halal suitable as they are made using either non-halal clarifying agents or contain alcohol based flavours and encouraged consumers to ‘carefully’ read the ingredients on the packaging.

However the Golden Circle apple juice is labelling as containing no added preservatives and makes no mention of beef or alcohol.

Mr Chakraborty replied calling on the company to come clean and explain to consumers why the ingredients were not listed on packaging.

‘In the ingredients section it says ‘all natural’,’ he said. ‘I don't think beef traces or alcohol [can] be treated as natural ingredients.’

A beef-derived gelatine was generally used to remove the ‘cloudiness’ in its apple juice, Heinz said in a statement to Fairfax Media

Spokeswoman Carolyn Fox said juice was filtered during the manufacturing process, and the final product did not contain gelatine.

Heinz said 'very small amounts of alcohol' were combined with concentrated flavours for them to remain 'stable, clean and crisp'

Heinz said the products met regulatory standards therefore there was no requirement to declare the processing aids, or components of flavours on the list of ingredients

Ms Fox said ‘very small amounts of alcohol’ were combined with concentrated flavours for them to remain ‘stable, clean and crisp’.

‘Alcohol has the functional purpose of allowing the flavour to disperse more readily in liquids,’ she said. ‘It evaporates from the juice during the pasteurisation process when heat is applied and if any remains in juices afterwards, it is so small that it is below detectable levels.’

She also stated that the products met regulatory standards therefore there was no requirement to declare the processing aids, or components of flavours on the list of ingredients.
