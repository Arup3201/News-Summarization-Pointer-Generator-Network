It will probably come as no surprise, but a Kentucky woman wearing an 'I Love Crystal Meth' t-shirt was arrested earlier this week for possession of... crystal meth.

Deborah Asher, 37, was snapped wearing the tell-all T-shirt after being caught with 3.37 grams of crystal meth and a set of digital scales.

The Laurel County Sheriff’s Department posted her mugshot on its Facebook page.

Very revealing! Deborah Asher, 37, is seen wearing an 'I Love Crystal Meth' after being arrested for possession of crystal meth in Kentucky on Tuesday

With her was Richard Rice, 57, a male acquaintance who was given just a generic orange top before having his mugshot taken. 

The duo were caught after an investigation was launched by Laurel County Sheriff's Department officers.

Asher and Rice were each hit with felony narcotics possession and charged with  first-degree trafficking of a controlled substance.

They are scheduled to appear in court in November 12,

Asher remains locked up in the county jail on $25,000 bond.

Evidence: Police found cash that were the alleged takings of drug trafficking, along with some digital scales

Accomplice: Richard Rice, 57, was also captured by police at the same time as Asher, although he was given the usual orange prison top to wear
