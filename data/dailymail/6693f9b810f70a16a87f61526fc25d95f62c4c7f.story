California? Hawaii? No – this huge crowd of surfers is gathering in the waters off North Devon.

This was the scene yesterday at Woolacombe, a spot proving more popular than ever with day-trippers and holidaymakers on the first weekend of August.

Photographer Guy Harrop, who took these pictures at midday yesterday, said: ‘The beach was busier than I’ve seen it in years.

Surf's up! The sea at Woolacombe in Devon is awash with holidaymakers, many with bodyboards in the shallower waters as those with surfboards head further out

Basking:
 Britons across the south coast (including on Woolacombe beach in Devon)
 took to the sane with parasols, tents and swimming costumes yesterday

Glorious:

sunshine as temperatures hit 24C ahead of an unsettled week across 
Britain

‘The sea has been particularly warm 
this year, so the difference between being in and out of the water isn’t
 as stark as it usually is.

‘This makes surfing or swimming a much more attractive option, wetsuit or no wetsuit.’

Woolacombe
 is a popular location for experienced surfers and beginners alike, with
 a strong lifeguard presence and plenty of surfing schools and 
instructors taking advantage of the sport’s ever increasing popularity.

Yesterday it was reported that more and more of us are choosing to take our holidays in Britain rather than go abroad.

Nearly
 three-quarters of us are taking a ‘staycation’ this year, up from 33 
per cent in 2010, and 65 per cent last year, according to a survey by 
Travelodge.

Travel industry 
analyst GfK said last week that summer bookings for overseas holidays 
were down 7 per cent in June, the third monthly fall in a row.

Having a splashing time: Sophie, Countess of Wessex, was drenched as she waited to present medals to the hockey teams but roared with laughter

Good spirits: Her sleek hair and pristine dress were soaked but Sophie joked and laughed with organisers, clearly enjoying the Commonwealth Games

Celebrations: The weather may have been bleak but Sophie and her group lit up spirits by roaring with applause as Australia took to the podium to take gold

The
 holiday rentals service HomeAway, which has about 20,000 UK properties 
on its books, said inquiries for stays in Britain had risen by 32 per 
cent compared with last year, with the West Country the most popular 
area.

For those who have chosen to stay in the UK, fortunes look fairly mixed.

Yesterday there were warnings that after a Sunday which was sunny in many parts, showers will hit over the next seven days.

Tomorrow
 will be more unsettled, with more showers in the South and West, while 
Wednesday will bring scattered heavy showers in the North and West.

Thursday will be rainy and cloudy across most areas.

Meanwhile
 Sophie, Countess of Wessex seemed more than happy to brave the rain in 
Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony.

She arrived in a sleek red dress yesterday, with her hair pristine, to present medals to Australia's winning hockey team.

Within
 seconds her locks were drenched and wedges squelching in the grass - 
but the Countess roared with laughter, beaming and applauding all the 
way through.

The world's top athletes have so far been pleasantly surprised by Glasgow's weather at the Commonwealth Games.

Even Usain Bolt remarked on the tournament's pleasant weather - although the rest was 'a bit sh**'.

And
 visitors to a farm in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, were treated to a 
spectacular sea of golden yellow as sunflowers, that have come into 
bloom, glistened in the sun.

Having
 only been around in Britain since the 1980s, when they were grown on a 
very small scale, the scene looked more like one from Provence in the 
south of France.

Heavens
 opened: Meanwhile in Glasgow the peloton made its way through the 
pouring rain as the Commonwealth Games comes to an end nearing the 
closing ceremony

Humid: Temperatures remain relatively high for Glasgow, in the high teens, but cyclists squinted as they pedalled through the worst of the rain forecast for tonight

Cheery: Spectators were undeterred by the dismal weather which marred the finale, lining the streets in raincoats and clutching umbrellas to cheer the cyclists on

But now, as
 the country experiences warmer weather, more UK farmers are planting 
the golden yellow blooms, which are used for bird seed and sunflower 
oil.

The flowers have 
bloomed just before the tail-end of the lavender season, meaning much of
 Hertfordshire's countryside is a kaleidoscope of colour.

The fields have a few more days to flourish in the sunshine before showers hit and a rain system sweeps in from the south west.

'We
 were expecting the sunflowers to open in another week, but lots of them
 have suddenly opened up overnight,' said Tim Hunter, who helps run 
family business Hitchin Lavender at Cadwell Farm in Hitchin.

'Traditionally
 England doesn't have the growing conditions for sunflowers and they are
 better suited to warmer climates with lots of sunshine and downpours of
 rain.

I
 do like to be beside the seaside: Brighton Pier glistened in the summer
 sun which coated the shore on the first weekend of August

Relaxing: Spectators at the Festival of British Eventing in Gatcombe Park, Gloucestershire, reclined on the grassy hills, catching the sun before showers hit

Summer time: It is typical August weather for the home counties, meaning a mix of high temperatures and sprinkling showers

'The sunflowers 
haven't looked very good for the last two years because last year it was
 cold and a late start to the summer and in 2012 it was very wet.

'This
 year the weather has been perfect for them with lots of sun, followed 
by some heavy downpours, and we've got a great crop.

‘The lavender is still flowering and the fields look amazing next to each other.

'We think there may be at least two weeks now when the plants are in bloom together.

‘It's
 a very unusual sight in Hertfordshire and one which more people would 
associate with Provence so we've been getting lots of comments.'

Sunflowers
 are one of the latest booming crops to hit the UK with a bumper harvest
 expected this year from the 800 acres across the country.

'We
 mainly grow lavender but decided to add sunflowers to extend the 
season,' added Tim, who has 15 acres of lavender and two acres with 
around 10,000 towering 5ft tall sunflowers.

'People
 can pick the sunflowers and take photos in the fields. We hope they 
will stay in bloom for at least three weeks as they are a really 
magnificent sight.'

Elsewhere,
 in Devon, two holidaymakers were treated to the sight of a fluffy cloud
 floating above them - shaped like a giant heart.

Gemma Rapkins, 29 and her friend Kiren Ali, 36, were relaxing by a swimming pool when they saw it drifting overhead.

Londoner
 Gemma, an executive assistant, grabbed her phone and took a photo of 
the amazing formation as the perfect reminder of her trip to Ebberley, 
North Devon.

She said: 'We 
were both lying out in the garden and we happened to look up at the sky 
and there right in front of the sun was a perfect heart-shaped cloud. We
 could hardly believe our eyes.

'It
 felt like a confirmation from the universe that despite all the hating 
going on in the world right now there is a lot of love all around us and
 human beings need to realise that.'
