An autopsy of a fetus found in a teenage girl's shopping bag at a New York City lingerie store was inconclusive, and more tests will be needed to determine how the fetus died, the city medical examiner's office says.

The needed tests could take a couple of weeks as police continue to look into the macabre case.

Preliminary reports from detectives suggest the fetus was born alive and possibly had been asphyxiated, but chief New York Police Department spokesman John McCarthy said that the case was still being investigated and that police were awaiting the medical examiners' determination of the cause of death.

The medical examiners also will determine whether it was a live birth.

Arrests: Tiona Rodriguez (left) was carrying a dead baby boy in her shopping bag when she was stopped on suspicion of shoplifting with her friend Francis Estevez (right) in New York on Thursday

The grisly discovery was made when 
Rodriguez and her friend Francis Estevez, also 17, were stopped by a 
security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of 
shoplifting.

But as well as
allegedly finding hundreds of dollars worth of stolen goods inside the 
bags, the guard noticed there was a strong odor inside and found a tiny 
body under the loot.

Rodriguez told detectives she had delivered a day earlier and didn't know what to do, authorities said. Police believe she delivered at the other girl's house.

She was taken to Bellevue Hospital where it is believed she remains under police watch.

Both girls were arrested on petit larceny charges.

A few hours later the fetus was removed 
by Medical Examiner's Office workers, who also removed other bags of 
potential evidence.

The girl believed to have given birth was taken to a hospital and remained there Friday.

A woman who said she was the other girl's mother said she hadn't spoken with her daughter since her arrest and hung up.

On her Facebook page late on 
Wednesday night, the teenager had complained about period cramps, and 
added that she was excited about an upcoming job interview at Chipotle.

Rodriguez and Estevez are both charged 
with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. Estevez 
allegedly had $230 worth of clothes and cosmetics in her bag.

One of Tiona's neighbors said she was shocked to hear the teenager had been pregnant.

Zami
Ford, 17, said: 'I’ve known her since she was little. She was probably 
nervous and didn't know what to do. She would never hurt anyone.'

She said she was unaware of the teen's pregnancy and was stunned by the allegations.

'She's a good girl,' Ford told the newspaper. 'I can't believe she would do that.'

Another
neighbor, Lydia Perez, said: 'She had to have hidden that pregnancy for
a while. I saw her outside here the other day with her family, and her 
baby.

Teen mom: Tiona, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before

'There was a whole bunch of joy. You would never know there were 
any problems.'

Customers at 
Victoria’s Secret were also shocked to hear that a fetus was found in 
the store, but most sympathized with the schoolgirl. 

'She must be going through a big depression. She must have been wondering how she was going to get rid of it,' Yvonne Sonera told the Daily News.
