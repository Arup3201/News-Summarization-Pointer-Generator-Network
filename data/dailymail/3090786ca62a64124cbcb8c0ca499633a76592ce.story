Ronny Deila last night confirmed John Collins was on a shortlist to become his assistant and provide the local knowledge he needs. 

The 38-year-old Norwegian was unveiled at Celtic Park yesterday as Neil Lennon’s successor and will strengthen his backroom staff in the coming days.

Deila will also assess Craig Gordon before confirming whether or not the former Scotland goalkeeper will be added to his squad for next season. 

Local knowledge: John Collins is on the short list to become assistant manager at Celtic

Hoop dreams! Stromsgodset boss Ronny Deila has been appointed as the new Celtic manager

The ex-Stromsgodset manager admits he wants someone with an in-depth understanding of the Scottish scene by his side as he adapts to his new job. 

Collins could fit the bill, although Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell insisted there were other names still in the frame. 

‘There are three or four candidates,’ said Lawwell. ‘Ronny has confirmed he (Collins) is one of the candidates so we will wait and see. 

‘I think we need someone who knows what Inverness is like and the trip up there at 12.15 on a Sunday, who knows Scottish football. I think that would be a big requirement for a no.2. We need to really start that process.’

Gordon is understood to have undergone a medical with Celtic earlier this week. He has been a free agent since quitting Sunderland with knee problems in 2012 but is now restored to fitness.

‘He has been in training with us and we are just going through discussions with his agent at the moment to see if anything comes out of that,’ said Lawwell.

‘He came to train with us and he was excellent. Stevie Woods (goalkeeping coach) couldn’t speak highly enough about him so we might be close on that one.’

But Deila was cautious about the speed of any move, saying: ‘It’s too early to say because I have not seen him play football and I have not talked to him. I have to see what is around and into the team.’ Lawwell made it clear the decisive call on Gordon would be down to Deila. 

‘Absolutely,’ said the chief executive. ‘We will work the same way that we always have in that the manager has the final say on all players coming in or going out, or their stays being extended.
