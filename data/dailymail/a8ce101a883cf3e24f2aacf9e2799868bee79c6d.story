A unique 90-year-old wooden chalet with no mains power or water on a remote moor has been sold at auction for £105,000.

The two-roomed chalet was built by artist Peter Younger in the 1920s who lived and worked there.

Since then the wooden building with corrugated iron roof has been used as a holiday cottage and campsite.

The chalet, at Belstone near Okehampton, Devon, has half an acre of land with it and the River Taw runs past it - the only running water near the building.

The guide price at the Exeter auction was £75,000 but was bought by a private individual for £105,000.

The hut is described as being in an unrivalled setting on the open moor, approximately half a mile from the village of Belstone being surrounded by open moorland and dramatic tors.

Cosden Hill, a well known landmark is within walking distance as is Belstone Tor and Taw Marsh.

The auctioneers description continued: 'This particular part of north Dartmoor has its own unique rugged beauty and the chalet would be an ideal base from which to explore Dartmoor's hundreds of square miles of unspoilt scenery.

'There are many opportunities for riding, walking and other outdoor pursuits. The village of Belstone is a particularly unspoilt moorland community, which is well known for its local inn 'The Tors'.

'The nearby town of Okehampton offers an excellent range of locally and nationally owned shops, together with three supermarkets, which include a Waitrose. The town has schooling from infant to sixth form level, together with a modern hospital and state of the art leisure centre in the attractive setting of Simmons Park.

'The A30 dual carriage way, which is easily accessible, provides a direct link west into Cornwall or east to the cathedral and university city of Exeter with its large modern shopping centre, mainline rail, international air and M5 motorway connections.

The north and south coasts of Devon are within easy travelling distance with attractive beaches and delightful coastal scenery

'In addition to the national park, this particular part of west Devon is well known for its rolling countryside and leisure and sporting opportunities, which include fishing on the Taw and Torridge rivers and walking and cycling on the Tarka Trail and Granite Way.

'The north and south coasts of Devon are within easy travelling distance with attractive beaches and delightful coastal scenery.

'Access to Riverside Chalet is via a vehicular track from the village of Belstone.

'The grounds, which extend to approximately 0.48 of an acre, are as delightfully untamed as the surrounding moorland with many granite boulders and outcrops providing natural features.

'Extensive frontage onto the River Taw, makes for a particularly unique environment. This is still a young, fast flowing river as it rushes down off the moor, but there are some deep pools to be found and shade given by mature trees.

'The chalet itself has two internal rooms comprising a living room/bedroom and kitchen.'
