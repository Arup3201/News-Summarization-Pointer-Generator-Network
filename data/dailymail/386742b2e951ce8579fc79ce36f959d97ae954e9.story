Obscene language: Oxford cox Oskar Zorrilla

The BBC was forced to apologise last night after its coverage of the Boat Race was marred by repeated swearing.

A crew member was clearly heard shouting obscene language during the race which was being broadcast live to millions.

Oskar Zorrilla, the 5ft 4in Oxford cox, said f*** at least five times, prompting the commentator to apologise for ‘unsavoury language’, but the BBC failed to turn his microphone down or off.

Mr Zorrilla, 25, who is believed to be the first student of Colombian descent to take part in the race, has a distinctive accent and was heard saying ‘Be f***ing tenacious’, ‘That’s the f***ing stuff’ and, as his team crossed the finish line to win the 159th run of the historic race, shouted ‘F***, yeah!’

Viewers took to Twitter and online forums to complain about the foul language and the constant use of the f-word throughout the clash between Oxford and Cambridge universities.

Jake Humphrey, a BBC sports journalist, tweeted: ‘What is happening to the world when the F word gets broadcast on something as traditional as the Boat Race?!’

William Lyons tweeted: ‘Was it just me or did the BBC coverage of the Boat Race lack a little charm? Swearing/Shouting cox – does it add anything?’

Others pointed out that the crews swore last year and said that lessons should have been learned at the BBC.

On his online television forum James Cridland said: ‘Did the BBC really assume that the coxes weren’t going to swear when they mic’d them up?  And why, after one naughty word, did they keep his microphone live – and up – for another, and then another.’

He added: ‘It turns out that they swore last year, too. So: why weren’t lessons learnt?’

Microphones were installed in 2006 so 
viewers could hear the coxes issuing instructions. But five minutes into
the race seven million viewers heard the Oxford cox screaming: ‘Let’s 
f*** them’ to his crew. Both teams were warned in 2007 not to swear 
during the race.

Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch, said it was ‘unacceptable’ for swearing to be broadcast and questioned why BBC producers failed to intervene.

She said: ‘I think it’s a real shame. I accept that in the heat of the moment that’s going to happen, but when it happens a couple of times, it’s the job of the producer to intervene and turn it off.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for any offence caused by the swearing overheard during the Oxford team’s celebrations after winning the 2013 Boat Race.

‘We had spoken with both coxes ahead of the race requesting them to be careful with their language.’

Royal Marines were stationed along the length of the course to prevent a repeat of last year’s disruption when Trenton Oldfield swam between the boats to protest against ‘elitism’.
