With his comical facial expressions, you could not accuse Nigel Farage of being wooden in front of the camera - but that hasn't stopped him being compared to a tree.

The UKIP leader is also clearly a man in touch with his wild side after fans and critics alike say he reminds them of a dog, turtle, meerkat and even a mouse.

Bumbling buffoon Mr Bean, played by Rowan Atkinson, is also said to be a dead ringer for the politician, as is Sam the Eagle from the muppets. 

The craze for Nigel lookalikes started on Twitter after Jonathan Ross tweeted a picture of Farage and his dog  spitting image.
