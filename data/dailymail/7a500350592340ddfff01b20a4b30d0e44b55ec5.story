The BBC has apologised after broadcasting a picture of Prince William with a doodle of comedy glasses, a moustache and a penis drawn on his head.

The unusual picture of the Duke of Cambridge was broadcast as part of a trailer used on BBC Breakfast for a feature on musical theatre group Barbershopera.

The clip, shown shortly before 8.30am today, was taken from the group's comedy song I Could Have Married Kate.

Mistake: An image of Prince William with a penis, comedy glasses and a moustached drawn on his face was broadcast on BBC Breakfast this morning

How he normally looks: The BBC have apologised after broadcasting an unusual image of the Prince of Wales, pictured here with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George last week

It appears that BBC producers failed to spot the image, which also featured William missing several front teeth.

Although no mention of the shot, which was on screen for a matter of seconds, was made by BBC Breakfast presenters, eagle eyed viewers were left unimpressed and took to Twitter to point out the image.

One Twitter user, Amanda Morrell, wrote: 'Just watching BBC Breakfast and they showed a pic of prince William with a drawn on willy on his head'.

Chris Bryant MP added: 'Did anyone just see the penis drawn on Prince William’s head on @BBCNews? #majorofcomfail.’

Another user, Dave Yates, added: Dear BBC Breakfast. The trail for 'Barbershopera' just showed a cartoon drawing of a penis on Prince William's head. Please be more careful.'

Complaints: Some BBC Breakfast viewers spotted the error even if producers did not

Sorry: The BBC has this afternoon apologised for the image which featured Prince William with a penis drawn on his head and comedy glasses

The BBC has apologised this afternoon and said that editors failed to spot the offending picture.

A statement said: 'This image was shown fleetingly within a comedy promotional video for Barbershopera, a humorous barbershop group, who were appearing later on in the programme.

'The material was provided by Barbershopera but we failed to spot the offending material within it.

'We apologise for this.'

The song, about a lovelorn fictional former partner of the Duchess of Cambridge, includes the lines: 'I'll be there, baby, on the day you marry and security won't notice me because I'll dress like Harry, and when Rowan gets things going I'll reveal myself before it's too late because it should be me who marries Kate.'
