Troubled football star Paul Gascoigne is understood to be heading back to Britain after a month spent tackling his alcohol problem in rehab in the U.S.

Celebrity friends of the former England legend, 45, clubbed together to help fund his £6,000-a-week treatment in Arizona after he suffered a public meltdown at a charity event in Northampton in January.

Now Gascoigne, who has vowed to quit drinking, is said to be 'back on track and coming home'.

A source close to the star told the Sun:
‘We’re just delighted that Paul’s back on track and coming home, where 
he can get back into his routine of doing the things he enjoys – without
the booze getting in the way ever again.'

The footballer is now said to have pledged to quit drinking once and for all.

Following his shambolic appearance in Northampton, a 
former friend of the one-time midfielder released video footage of 
Gascoigne mumbling, groaning, and struggling to stay conscious.

His ex-flatmate Shane Abbott claimed Gascoigne was drinking two litres of gin and 15 cans of Stella Artois a day in the period leading up to his stint in rehab.

The 36-year-old also said he was taking up to 30 anti-depressant Valium pills daily and injecting cocaine.

After being admitted to the Cottonwood Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, Gascoigne was rushed 
to intensive care amid fears alcohol withdrawal could have triggered a major organ failure, the report in the Sun said.

Celebrities
such as Chris Evans, Alan Shearer, Alan Sugar and Ronnie Irani have 
lent support to a Twitter campaign to raise the £100,000 needed to cover Gascoigne's treatment.

English players Frank Lampard, John 
Terry, Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere had contributed funds, while FA 
Charity the England Footballers Foundation also contributed £40,000 from
the national team.

The campaign followed the former footballer's public appearance at An Evening With Paul Gascoigne held at Northampton's Park Inn Hotel in January.

Hundreds of audience members watched as he mumbled stories and swore repeatedly in response to questions from his agent Terry Baker, who was interviewing him on stage at the event.

Gascoigne began by announcing: ‘I’ve had a f****** hard month. F****** hell.’ He also seemed to sob, and repeatedly raised his hand to his face.

While holding the microphone with his right hand it shook so uncontrollably that he had to steady it with his left.

At one stage Gascoigne mumbled ‘I’ve been on a whisky diet’. One onlooker said he seemed to be ‘dying in front of our eyes’.
