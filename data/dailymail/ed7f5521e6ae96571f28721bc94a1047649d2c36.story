Fifteen dogs have been saved from a foul-smelling property where they lived in unclean conditions and repeatedly attacked each other in their desperate fight for space and food, according to rescuers.

The mostly Labrador and Shepherd mixes were found by Palm Springs Police and Animal Rescue Corps officers on Tuesday who raided a boarded up home on Tramview Road after months of neighbors complaints, according to KESQ.

What they found was gut-wrenching.

'Unsanitary conditions': 15 dogs were discovered at the property in Palm Springs. The Animal Rescue Corps said the dogs were injured from fighting with each other and lived in unclean surroundings

Complaints: Neighbors had reported the Tramview Road home, pictured left, claiming constant barking and a foul smell. Rescuers ended up finding 15 dogs, one pictured right, living alongside their owner Richard Rutgard

The dogs were covered in bite marks and fresh wounds and lived in unsanitary conditions in the single-family home.

They all lived alongside their owner Richard Rutgard, according to the report.

Animal Rescue Corps President Scotlund Haisley said: 'The house was very typical to hoarding. It was boarded up, windows were boarded up, doors were boarded up, meaning something is in there and they don't want the world to know what's going on inside.'

'Because you have a large number of dogs in a small area, pack mentality, lots of anxiety, they're fighting over food, they're fighting over space, territory. They're ripping each other apart'.

Rutgard says he never wanted the dogs to live in poor conditions.

Defense: Richard Rutgard complained to a local broadcaster in August that he had been given an un-neutered puppy by the Palm Springs Animal Shelter. He says this is why he ended up with so many dogs

Five months ago he complained to Palm Springs Animal Shelter saying they had given him a dog that wasn't neutered.

He took it home to care for it alongside his two female dogs and that's when the puppies started arriving.

'Why did they sell me a dog that wasn't neutered?' he said in an interview with KESQ in August.Â  ' I'd like to have them [the animal shelter] pay it's like child support for puppies'.

The dog-owner was served a notice back then warning he had to get rid of most of the dogs within two months.

When asked why he didn't take them back to the home, he added: 'They are so amazingly nice and kind and sweet. I feel safe and secure and happy - they're very therapeutic for a person.'

Rescue: The dogs have now been permanently removed from the home, pictured, and will be rehoused

New homes: The dogs rescued in Tuesday's operation, pictured, are now in emergency accommodation at the Palm Springs Rescue Center, right. They will be nursed back to help before hopefully being found new homes

However, they are now in the back in the home and Rutgard faces animal cruelty charges.

The dogs will eventually be handed out to new homes across the area

'Our vet teams are assessing every injury and illness and putting them on a treatment plan,' Haisley added.

'The property owner was very cooperative. He had good intentions but I think he clearly got in over his head and wanted the right thing for these animals.'

'What we see is very difficult, but imagine how rewarding it is to reach into those cages, and break those chains, and look into the eyes of these animals and make them the promise that their suffering has ended forever. It's incredibly rewarding," Haisley added.

At the time of Rutgard's complaint Palm Springs Animal Shelter said they would look into the allegations.
