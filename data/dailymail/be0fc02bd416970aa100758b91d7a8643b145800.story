The makers of Monopoly have advanced to Lagos in Nigeria to launch the first African city edition of the famous board game.

Instead of Mayfair or Boardwalk, players will have the chance to buy Banana Island, a prestigious development where properties in the real world fetch millions.

The cheapest square - the Old Kent Road of London or the Mediterranean Avenue of the U.S. version - is a fishing slum on stilts known as Makoko.

The Nigerian Stock Exchange, which replaces London's 'Super Tax: Pay £100', and Murtala Muhammed International Airport also feature, while traditional favourites such as the Chance and Community Chest cards keep pride of place on the iconic board.

The 'go to jail' card has been adapted to say 'go directly to Kirikiri jail', the city's maximum-security prison.

The Lagos State Government was heavily involved in bringing the game to Nigeria not just to promote the country, but also as a means of educating the public about road safety, it was reported by CNN.

Many pedestrians are killed in the heavily congested city every year while trying to run across roads.

Rich and poor: Banana Island replaces Boardwalk from the U.S. version, while Makoko is the Lagos equivalent to London's Old Kent Road

Goodbye Mayfair: The most expensive square on the board was chosen as Banana Island, an artificially created island where only the richest live

Illustrious: On Banana Island (pictured) properties can fetch as much as $8million (£4.9million)

Poor man's property: The cheapest square on the board is Makoko, a fishing slum on stilts

American's Mediterranean Avenue: Makoko established itself as a fishing village in the 18th century and now has a population nearing 100,000

One Chance card, for example says: 'For using the overhead pedestrian bridge over Ikorodu Road, move forward three spaces'.

According to the BBC another reads: 'You've been caught driving against traffic. Report for psychiatric evaluation.'

Speaking ahead of the launch in Lagos City Hall, Nimi Akinkugbe, the head of Bestman Games which is producing the authorised Lagos edition, told the Nigerian Guardian that the choice for the Mayfair spot was a 'hot topic'.

The eventual winner, Banana Island, has 
property which would rival that of the prestigious London district, with
some selling for $8million (£4.9million).

That square and many others have been sponsored by businesses. But no-one wanted the cheapest.

By contrast, Makoko is a slum neighbourhood built on stilts that was established as a fishing village in the 18th Century.

Hasbro Inc, which owns the rights to Monopoly, said Bestman Games Ltd would distribute the Lagos version of the game under an exclusive licence.

But some feel a stumbling block to the game's success could lie in the price.

In the U.S. and the UK, the game typically costs around $18 and £10 respectively.

In Nigeria, however, it will set you back about $40 (£24), a hefty sum for the common man there.

Trading places: Other squares include the Nigerian Stock Exchange, which replaces London's 'Super tax: Pay £100' and Bourdillon Road instead of Park Lane

Prime real estate: Bus Rapid Transit Terminal, Tiamiyu Savage St and Lagos Yacht Club are among some of the other destinations that feature

Not just a game: The Lagos State Government was keen to bring famous game to Lagos in part to educate the public about road safety, as can been seen with this Chance card

Iconic: The London version of Monopoly, which was originally developed in Atlanta in the U.S. in 1933

While Lagos is the first African city to get its own version of the game, Morocco and South Africa already have their own country-wide edition.

There is also a Kenyan property game which resembles Monopoly, set in Nairobi, called Kumiliki, which means 'to own' in Kiswahili.

Monopoly was developed in the U.S., originally based on streets in Atlantic City, in 1933.

A London version of the game was produced two years later.
