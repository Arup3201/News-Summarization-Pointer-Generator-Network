Sam Strange, 23, raped a four-year-old boy on Christmas Eve and has been jailed for nine years

A 23-year-old man who raped a four-year-old boy on Christmas Eve when he was drunk has been jailed for nine years after his victim gave evidence holding his teddy bear. 

Sam Strange, from Folkestone in Kent, had denied three sexual offences but a jury took four hours and 21 minutes to convict him.

Sentencing, Judge Heather Norton told him: 'This was an extremely serious offence perpetrated on a vulnerable and defenceless young child.'

Strange was also placed on the Sex Offender's Register and made subject to a Sex Offences Prevention Order for life. 

Canterbury Crown Court heard how Strange had visited the boy's mother on Christmas Eve. 

Two weeks later, when questioned by his mother, the boy told what Strange had done to him. 

The 23-year-old was arrested on January 27 and later charged.  

The boy, who is now five, gave evidence at the case while clutching his teddy bear becoming one of the youngest to give evidence at a crown court. 

Wearing a blue hoodie, he sat in a special room next to an intermediary – a language specialist – and a member of the witness support team. 

Judge Heather Norton and two barristers went to meet the child just minutes before he gave his evidence via a special CCTV link to the courtroom.

Judge Heather Norton and counsel removed their wigs while the boy gave evidence, because he had a 'particular hatred of wigs', the judge said.

In an earlier video made by police and shown to the court, the child said he had been sexually assaulted by Strange.  

Prosecutor Eloise Marshall said the attacks were revealed when the child pointed to a doll to show where he had been assaulted by Strange.

After the video with the allegations was played to the jury, the child was asked questions by the barrister representing Strange, Stephen Earnshaw. 

Sam Strange, from Folkestone in Kent, had denied three sexual offences but a jury took four hours and 21 minutes to convict him by a majority of 10:2 at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) 

The judge told the jury: 'Mr Earnshaw won't be asking many questions and among the things he won't be asking is putting to the child that he is lying or anything like that which he might ask an adult witness.'  

He then answered questions from Mr Earnshaw who asked him five things and received mainly one word answers.

Once he had finished the boy was thanked by the judge and told he could go home. 

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Matthew Jones said: 'This was a very serious offence on a vulnerable young person. 

'Strange refused to admit what he had done, which meant putting the boy through the ordeal of giving evidence in court, which I commend him for.

'I hope now, he can put this behind him and continue to live a life like any other child would.'
