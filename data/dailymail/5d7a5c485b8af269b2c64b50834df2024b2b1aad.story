A drunk driver from Texas arrested on a ninth DWI charge last week injected some irony into his mugshot by wearing a statement T-shirt reading: 'WARNING: I DO DUMB THINGS'.

Luciano Gutierrez, 66, of Temple, Bell County, is seen in the police photo looking away from the camera with the message displayed on his chest mimicking a traffic sign design.

According to kwtx.com, because of the senior's number of offenses he faces felony penalties which include a maximum fine of $10,000 and  ten years in jail.

It could also result in his driver's license being revoked for up to two years.

Apparently Gutierrez was caught last Thursday on an outstanding warrant stemming from a DWI arrest three months ago. 

He was promptly booked into Bell County jail but later released after posting a $25,000 bail.

The original case was from November 24, 2014.

Gutierrez is now set to appear at court for the multiple DWI offenses. 

Texan authorities have not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment on the incident.
