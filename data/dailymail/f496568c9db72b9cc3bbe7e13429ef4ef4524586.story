As proposals go, it wasn't the most ordinary – involving a ring-bearing penguin.

Boyfriend Mitch arranged a day out at Pittsburgh Zoo in Pennsylvania, US, for his girlfriend Casey, but little did she know it was no ordinary day out.

At the zoo, Casey was overjoyed to get up close with the penguins.

But her joy turned to surprise when one of the penguins waddled out with a ring hanging from its neck on a ribbon.

Unable to refuse the cute penguin – Casey said yes.

Mitch, who had enlisted the help of a filming crew, caught the happy event on hidden cameras.

After spending their first Halloween together in penguin-themed fancy dress, the couple have always had a shared passion for their feathered friends.

Mitch said: ‘I wanted to keep the penguin theme in our relationship. I even thought of buying a penguin.’

Casey added: ‘It was just perfect. I always tell him – don’t buy me things – let’s just do things.'
