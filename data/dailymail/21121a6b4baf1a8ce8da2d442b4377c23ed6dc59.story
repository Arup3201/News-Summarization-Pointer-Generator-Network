A Florida man accused of strangling to death two prostitutes and burying at least one of them in his backyard filmed himself raping a third woman after trying to kill her, according to newly released court documents.

James Lee Maxwell, 44, has been charged with the murders of Pamela Will, 49, and Chasity Starr, 27.

Although Maxwell entered a not guilty plea in August, search warrants that were made public Wednesday show that the man had admitted to strangling Starr to death when questioned by detectives, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Her skeletal remains wrapped in a red, white and blue bed spread were unearthed on Maxwell's Port Orange property back in June.

Will's badly decomposed body was discovered in a ditch in Ormond Beach, where the suspect worked at one time. Police said she was also throttled.

According to authorities, Starr was killed January 15, 2011. A day later, Will's body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with her skull sticking out of the mud. The gruesome discovery was made nearly four months after she was reported missing from an area motel.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that the 49-year-old was kicked out from the Red Carpet Inn because she was no longer able to pay for her room.

A short time later, another woman working in the sex industry came forward telling police that Maxwell almost killed her in his garage in 2007, according to the search warrants.

The unnamed woman, who is now 33 years old, told detectives how the 44-year-old carried her to his bedroom where a camera had been set up to capture her rape.

The alleged victim said she never reported the incident for fear that no one would believe a prostitute’s tale of sexual assault.

In 2010, a dancer from a Daytona Beach club also told the authorities that Maxwell took her home and began to get rough with her, but she managed to get away unharmed, the warrants state.

In June, police arrived at Maxwell's Brandy Hills Drive home after two people reported his concerns over a proposed construction in the backyard of his property that would have involved digging.

Using cadaver dogs and a ground radar, officials unearthed Starr’s severely decomposed remains.

At the time, Maxwell was in jail awaiting trial in the rape of a nine-year-old neighbor whom police said he kidnapped from her home after a Christmas party and sexually battered in a wooded area in December 2011.

According to court records, Maxwell served time nine years in prison for the attempted murder of a prostitute whom he stabbed in the chest multiple times in 1998.
