The heroics of the men who fought valiantly to take Sword, Gold and Juno beaches on D-Day will never be forgotten but the stories of those who died are less well-remembered.

Now letters written by men preparing for D-Day and who didn't make it home are to be brought to life in a poignant documentary made to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings.

Among the accounts to appear on ITV's If I Don't Come Home - Letters from D-Day is the story of Captain Norman Skinner, 38, from Hillingdon in London.

Ahead of the assault on Normandy beaches,
 which would help mark the beginning of the end of World War Two, Captain Skinner wrote to his wife of eight years with whom he had two young daughters, 
Ann and Jane.

'As you know anything may happen at any moment and I cannot tell when you will receive this,' he noted. 'All the things I intended to say must be written.'

The former insurance worker confessed to feeling nervous ahead of the battle but said morale was high.

'I'm
 not a dashing hero by any means but the influence of everyone around me
 and the confidence of all the troops has made me lose any early fear 
which I expected,' he added.

'Whether it will last until the final moment I can't 
tell. I'm sure anyone with with imagination must dislike the thought of 
what's coming but my fears will be more of being afraid than of what can
 happen to me.'

Apprehension: Many of the soldiers writing home confessed to being nervous at the thought of D-Day

The most moving parts of Captain Skinner's letters come as he tells his wife just how much she meant to him and how much he loved the life they shared.

'You and I have had some lovely happy years that now 
seemed to have past at lightning speed but I, and I'm sure you as well, 
can look back on them with some kind of contentment, knowing that in our
 love and need of each other, we have injured no-one,' he said.

'Although I would give anything to be back 
with you, I have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to 
do.

...'Although I would give anything to be back 
with you, I have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to 
do'

'There is so much I mean to tell you, much of what you have 
heard before, but I mean it even more today.

'I shall always be grateful 
to the powers above for having been able to be with you, to have been 
loved by you. I'm sure I will be with you again soon and for good. Give 
my fondest love to my Ann and my Janey.'

Sadly Captain Skinner never made it home to his beloved family. Instead, they were sent a telegram informing them he had been killed by a direct hit from an enemy bomb which fell on a dugout he was sheltering in on the beach.

Another soldier writing home to tell his family how much he loved them was Canadian farmer's son, Rifleman Glenn Dickin, 22.

'As usual there isn't much news but I am 
getting along fine and I'm well,' he wrote in a cheerful letter to his parents ahead of the attack on Juno Beach.

'I suppose all the spring work on the 
farm is in full progress. So you still haven't had the veranda painted? I
 guess I'll have to get at it when I get back.'

But he never made it home. Although Rifleman Dickin survived the beach landing, he was shot down during an intense firefight further inland.

Brave: Captain Alastair Bannerman kept a journal of his experience of D-Day and capture by the Germans

His mother received a letter from 
the regimental chaplain which explained: 'I am going to tell you the 
circumstances of his death, I think you would like to know them.

'Glenn 
(and two others in his regiment) went to the top of a hill next to the 
church, within a few minutes of their arrival they were heavily shelled 
by enemy artillery and all three were killed.'

The chaplain then relates that when the bodies of the men were recovered, he and others in the regiment were moved to see they had been covered in flowers by French locals who were grateful to the soldiers for giving their lives to liberate them.

As letters from the front line often took time to be sent, Glenn's last letter to his parents actually arrived after they had received the news of his death.

His parting words were: 'Don't you be worrying too hard about me. I'm a pretty capable 
person, don't worry about me.'

Meanwhile, Morris Hardstaff, 22, a factory worker from Yorkshire, wrote from the engine room of a air-sea rescue craft to his young wife Dot.

'I would like you to know just how I feel in this great adventure,' he wrote. But he added: 'I'm fully aware that you may never read it. You only will if I hand deliver it as it won't pass the censor.'

Happily for Dot, Morris was one of the lucky men who made it home and was able to deliver his letter to her in person.

Another lucky soldier was Captain Alastair Bannerman, of the 2nd Battalion of 
the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, who was married with two small children.

'...My love was with you when you needed it most, you have been very close to me this whole time'

He kept a journal of his experiences so he could share them with his wife Elizabeth.

Three days
 before D-Day, not knowing exactly what lay ahead, he wrote: 'This morning this made me feel quite desperateâ€¦

'I felt
 a little empty. I am waiting so impatiently for news from you of 
yourself and my small sons, more than ever before in my life I am 
longing for you and if I am not able to send any letters at least I can 
write what I have to say in this little book and so express my 
emotions.'

Once ashore, he led his men in an 
assault on a wood, the brutality and panic of which he later described in harrowing detail.

'Suddenly an 88 got our range and up went our 
carrier in a deafening explosion with all our ammunition, knocking us 
all sideways.

'There was nothing for it but to crawl - "Sauve qui peut," I
 shouted. Everyone for himself. Good luck. And the next few minutes I 
felt were my last.'

Captain Bannerman was later declared missing in action and his family had an agonising wait to see if he had survived.

But he had in fact been captured by the Germans - and never knew why they didn't shoot him when they had the chance.

Once the Allies were victorious, he was able to write to Elizabeth and tell her that he was alive and well. She wrote back to him telling of her joy.

'I was so lucky to have my anxiety relieved. I can't describe what this has meant to me,' she wrote. 'I have been to church to be thankful for this miracle.

'My love was with you when you needed it most, you have been very close to me this whole time, let us say that is the ticket.'

She added: 'My darling keep going, au revioir, god bless, I love you.'

He eventually returned home in 1945 and the couple had a third son.

During the ITV documentary, Captain Bannerman's son returns to France to retrace his father's footsteps. The show also uses archive footage and speaks to veterans who lived to tell the tale.

One veteran, Tom Knight, said: 'I was glad I was there and twice as glad to get back. It was an experience I wouldn't have liked to have missed because there were some good times as well as bad times.'

If I Don't Come Home - Letters from D Day will be on ITV Thursday 5 June at 10.35pm
