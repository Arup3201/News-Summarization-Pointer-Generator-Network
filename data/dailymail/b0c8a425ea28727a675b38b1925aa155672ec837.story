Sharmila Mistry, 42, was accused of causing the deaths of two toddlers when she was distracted by a mobile phone call. She has been found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving

A BMW driver speeding and talking on her phone mounted the pavement and killed two toddlers, a court heard yesterday.

Accounts
 manager Sharmila Mistry, 42, was rushing to a meeting when she crashed 
into another car, then swerved into the children in their pushchairs.

She
 was making a call on a hands-free mobile device and did not notice as a
 car began to cross the junction ahead of her, the court heard.

The
 BMW hit the other driver’s Mini Cooper, then ploughed into Zofia 
Tabaka, two, and 21-month-old Oliwier Baczyk as they waited at a 
pedestrian crossing with family members.

Oliwier
 and Zofia, whose parents are Polish, died of head injuries later that 
day.

Mistry’s BMW 520d executive saloon was seen accelerating towards the
 junction in Leicester and was exceeding the 30mph speed limit, the jury
 was told.

Mini driver 
Christopher Andrews had become confused by roadworks and was crossing 
the junction against a red light, prosecutor James Thomas said.

In
 the build-up to the tragedy on the morning of August 6, 2012, Mistry 
overtook a van and, according to a witness, sped towards the junction, 
passing through the traffic lights just after they had turned to amber.

Mr
 Thomas told the hearing at Leicester Crown Court:  ‘Mistry was engaged 
in a mobile phone call on hands-free. She did not notice Mr Andrews 
enter the junction.

‘As the Mini drove across the junction it collided with the front off-side of the defendant’s BMW.

‘That
 diverted her BMW directly into the path of the children as they were 
sat in their pushchairs waiting to cross the road.

'The consequences were
 devastating and ultimately fatal.

‘The
 prosecution case is that their deaths resulted from a combination of 
the driving of Christopher Andrews and Sharmila Mistry, which the 
prosecution say fell below the standard expected of a competent and 
careful driver.’

Mr Thomas told the court Mistry ‘neither braked nor took evasive action’ before the collision.

‘Her vehicle was struck by Mr Andrews’ Mini and only after did she apply the brakes,’ he said.

Zofia’s
 father, Lucas Tabaka, had been pushing her, while Oliwier was 
accompanied by an uncle, Kamil Komar.

Killed: Oliwier Baczyck, 21 months, and Zofia Tabaka, two, were fatally injured after the accident in Leicster

Both adults, who had been shopping
 with the children, escaped with minor injuries.

Crash
 investigators discovered Mistry, who denies two counts of causing death
 by careless driving, was travelling at 36mph when she collided with the
 Mini.

Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry’s BMW went ‘flying’ past him as he slowed for the amber light at the junction.

He said: ‘The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.’

Mr Smith said that after the crash he saw a woman climb out of the BMW, shouting: ‘I’m so sorry.’

The
 court heard 61-year-old Mr Andrews had ‘misconstrued’ a green light 
telling traffic to turn left, believing he could cross the junction.

He 
has since died in circumstances unrelated to the case.

Mr Thomas said that had Mistry been travelling at the speed limit she would have had time to brake.

After
 her arrest, Mistry, of Bushby, Leicestershire, told police she had been
 driving the BMW, which costs from £30,000, ‘carefully and 
consistently’.

She denied accelerating towards the junction.

In a statement read to the court, Mr Tabaka said the group were hit as they waited on an island to  cross the dual carriageway.

‘I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW,’ he said.

‘I
 tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it, but the car 
hit both pushchairs. I was still holding the pushchair but her little 
head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face.’

In his statement, Mr Komar said he saw the female driver ‘motionless’ after the crash, ‘with a mobile phone in her hand’.

The trial continues.

Later, the court heard heartbreaking evidence from Lucas Tabaka, father of two-year-old Zofia.

In a statement read to the court by Mr Thomas, Mr Tabaka - who was waiting at the side of the road with family friend Kamil Komar, who was pushing Oliwier, told of the moment his daughter was struck by the BMW.

He said: 'Because the lights were on green we crossed half of the road and stopped on island.

'I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW.

'I shouted to Kamil "Watch out". I tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it but the car hit both pushchairs with the children in them.

'I was still holding the pushchair but her little head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face.

'I was screaming and shouting at a man who came to help to check her breathing.  Oliwier was on the ground in a pool of blood.'

In his statement Mr Komar, who is the cousin of Oliwier's mother, Miroslawa, said: 'Lucas asked me to join him for a walk.

Defendant: Sharmila Mistry, 42, denies two counts of causing death by careless driving

'Oliwier always wanted to push the crossing button. I heard a terrible bang and someone shout "Watch out".

'My immediate reaction was to pull the pushchair away. I saw Oliwier on the floor and heard Lucas shout "Save my beloved daughter".

'I just had a grazed chin. I saw the female driver motionless with a mobile phone in her hand.'

Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry's BMW came 'flying' past him as he slowed for an amber light.

He
 said he believed she drove through a red light, but the jury earlier 
heard she passed through just 0.8 seconds before it the signal changed 
from amber to red.

Mr Smith added: 'I saw the BMW quite far back from myself.

'It
 was driving at some speed. I say that because of the rate it caught me 
up.  As the BMW went past me I caught a glimpse of the red Mini and they
 collided.

'The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.'

Mr Smith told the jury a woman climbed out of the BMW shouting "I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry".'

He added: 'She was a bit distraught. I didn't really take much notice of her because we were too busy seeing what we could do.'
