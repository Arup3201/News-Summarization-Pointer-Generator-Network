A prominent Tory MP was arrested and cautioned by police for assaulting his partner during a row, it has emerged.

Former shadow police minister David Ruffley, 52, admitted domestic violence after a night in the cells.

A source told the Daily Mail he flew into a rage and ordered his then-girlfriend Wendy Drew to move out of his luxury flat in London after the argument in March.

Held: The Cambridge-educated politician, pictured after becoming an MP for Bury St Edmunds in 2005, was arrested and taken to the cells

Terrified, Mrs Drew rang the police while Mr Ruffley went to find the concierge to have her thrown out of the building.

She was still on the phone when the MP returned, and the 999 call handler heard him shouting at her, the source said. Officers arrived at the flat in Pimlico, a stone’s throw from Westminster, and arrested Mr Ruffley on suspicion of assaulting Mrs Drew, 56, a portrait and landscape artist.

Mr Ruffley was taken to a police station and held in the cells for several hours before accepting a caution in the early hours of the morning.

Cambridge-educated Mr Ruffley was a solicitor and an adviser to Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, before he was elected as MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk in 1997.

He was a rising star in the party and had served as one of David Cameron’s shadow ministers when he narrowly cheated death after falling under a Gatwick Express train at London’s Victoria station in June 2010.

He escaped with only cuts and bruises after he missed the live rail and the train passed over him. At the time the incident was described as a failed suicide attempt after he was exposed during the MPs’ expenses scandal for claiming £1,674 for a sofa and £2,175 for a 46in high-definition television.

Mr Ruffley had been depressed, lost weight and was smoking and drinking too much, friends said. But he has since appeared to have turned his life around.

Recalling events at Victoria station, Mr Ruffley told the Mail last year: ‘It was an accident. I certainly had a bout of depression.

‘I was incredibly lucky, to say the least. I now cherish every day.’

Today he is a member of the Treasury Select Committee, and was last year reselected to fight his seat at the General Election. He also told the Mail: ‘I feel healthier than I ever have in my life. My self-belief is higher than ever. In terms of my political career, many of my close friends are convinced the best is yet to come.’

But the revelation that he assaulted his former partner will raise new questions about his state of mind.

The MP had previously been linked with a number  of attractive women, including writer and socialite Petronella Wyatt, but he has  never married.

He met Irish-born Mrs Drew, a widow whose late husband was a wealthy property developer, in October 2010, four months after the incident at Victoria station.

Speaking last year, Mr Ruffley said she had made a ‘positive difference’ to his life.

Contacted at her home in Mr Ruffley’s constituency, Mrs Drew declined to comment on the incident that resulted in the MP being arrested and cautioned. She said: ‘I split up from David in March and am no longer in contact with him.’  

But a close friend said: ‘She was scared of him. I think she stayed for fear of what he might do if she left. He treated her so badly.

‘We hated his hold over her. Everyone is delighted she has finally made the break.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘On Saturday, March 15 at approximately 8.50pm police attended an address in Marsham Court, Pimlico, and arrested a 52-year-old man on suspicion of common assault.

‘The man was taken to a central London police station. He has since accepted a caution for common assault.’

Mr Ruffley could not be reached for comment yesterday.

A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘This matter was investigated by the police and dealt with by them at the time.’
