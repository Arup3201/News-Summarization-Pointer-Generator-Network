Former Grand National jockey Sean Quinlan had to be fought off with a pool cue after attacking customers in a Staffordshire pub. 

Barry Birch, the 61-year-old landlord, stepped in after Quinlan and his two friends started throwing punches at two other customers.

Race horse trainer Paul O'Neill, Quinlan, and their friend Luke Cooper were caught on CCTV attacking Martin Reeves and Adam Smith.

Brave: Landlord Barry Birch was forced to step in with a pool cue after the violence erupted in February

During the two minute video, they can be seen punching, kicking and throwing bar stools at the two victims while they lie helplessly on the floor.

In a desperate attempt to protect Reeves and Smith, landlord Birch grabbed a wooden pool cue and hit the thugs, who then fled.

Violence flared at 11.30pm on February 13 after Quinlan and his friends walked into The Priory pub in Leek, Staffordshire.

Despite the video being played in court, the trio all walked free after they were handed suspended prison terms.

They had pleaded guilty to charges of affray at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court earlier this month.

Quinlan, 30, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to a six-month suspended term, Cooper, 20, of Wetley Rocks, Staffordshire, was given three months, also suspended, and O'Neill, 34, of Swindon, Wiltshire, was sentenced to eight months, also suspended.

Mr Birch, whose wife Teena, 53, suffered a black eye in the violence, today hit out at the judge for not jailing the men.

Birch said: 'I have no idea why they haven't been locked up, it was horrendous. It's as bad as it gets in a pub fight.

'I've never seen anything worse than that and we've been landlords for more than 35 years.

'This wasn't just your average pub fight, this was a sustained attack on two men who were down on the floor.

'I couldn't believe what was happening because they were on the ground and still being kicked.

'I've been working in pubs and clubs for more than 35 years and I've never seen anything so brutal and so unprovoked as this.'

Locals rushed to try and break up the fight as Quinlan and his friends O'Neill and Cooper piled in to the melee

He added: 'If I hadn't stepped in to try to break it up they could have killed someone.'

His wife said: 'It's an insult that they have walked out of court effectively free men.

'The CCTV is absolutely horrific - the police officers said it was some of the worst they'd seen - and even the judge said it was disgraceful.

'If it hadn't been for Barry defending his regulars and himself it could have been much worse.

'The court heard they were responsible people with jobs, quite nice lads who just had too much to drink, but there's no excuse for what they did that night.'

Quinlan is considered to be among the top 30 national hunt jockeys in the country and has won thousands in winnings in more than 50 professional races.
