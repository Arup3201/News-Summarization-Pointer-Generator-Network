A Chicago billionaire hedge-funder has 'blindsided' his wife of 11 years, who heads up her own hedge-fund, by filing for divorce while she was on vacation.

Ken Griffin, 45, who is worth an estimated $5.5billion, sent legal papers to wife Anne Dias-Griffin while she was in London with their three children, aged six, three and two.

Mr Griffin founded Citadel LLC, the largest hedge fund in Chicago at $20billion, while his 43-year-old wife is head of Aragon Global Management.

Billionaire hedge-funder Ken Griffin, 45, filed for divorce from his wife Anne, who also runs a hedge fund, while she was on vacation this week in London with the couple's three young children

A source told the New York Post that Mrs Dias-Griffin was 'blindsided' by the divorce filing.

She has hired Robert S. Cohen, a notorious divorce attorney, who released a public statement which read: 'Ken Griffin unilaterally filed a divorce petition today with no notice to either me or my client... Anne’s highest priority remains her family, especially the well-being of her children.'

Mr Griffin has retained the services of attorney Karen R. Krehbiel. In a statement today, Mr Griffin’s attorneys told MailOnline: 'This is a personal matter, and the family asks for privacy at they work through this process and focus on the well-being of their children.'

The couple reportedly separated a year ago and were unable to reach an agreement on how to divide their vast wealth.

According to The Post, a prenup is in place that will allow Mrs Dias-Griffin a cash settlement but does not include real estate or the couple's art collection. 

In 2012, Mr Griffin spent $15 million on
 the penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, believed to 
be the most ever paid for such a property in the city.

Last year, the hedge fund billionaire purchased four Palm Beach properties for $130million to add to his portfolio

The couple also own a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17million, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Last year he bought a total of four properties in Palm Beach, Florida for close to $130milllion.

The extremely private couple married in an extravagant wedding in the garden at Versailles and are known for their philanthropy. 

In 2009, the couple donated $10 million 
for the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center through their foundation and $16 million to 
Children's Memorial Hospital. 

This February, the Harvard grad gave $150 
million to his former school, the largest in the Ivy League institute's history.

The Griffins have donated widely to political campaigns although lean in support of Republican causes.

They are also keen art lovers. In 2006, the Griffins bought contemporary painting False Start by Jasper Johns for a reported $80 million from media mogul David Geffen.

Mrs Griffin is said to have encouraged her husband's love of art and they had their first date at a museum. She is a director of the Museum of Modern Art, a trustee of the Foundation for Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Mr Griffin has been married before but divorced in the mid-Nineties.

Ken Griffin, who was born in Florida, began his life in trading from his dorm room at Harvard University, even installing a satellite dish to get real-time market data.

Multilingual Mrs Dias-Griffin graduated from the Harvard Business School.

Mr Griffin got his first fund with $265,000 including money donated by his grandmother and profited heavily from the 1987 stock market crash.

He founded Citadel in 1990. The fund suffered setbacks in the recession in 2008, falling 35 per cent in one year, but has since rallied.
