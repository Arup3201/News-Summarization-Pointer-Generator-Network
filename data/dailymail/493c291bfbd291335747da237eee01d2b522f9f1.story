Michelle Obama and her daughters spent Presidents Day weekend enjoying private lessons with numerous instructors at a top skiing resort in Aspen, Colorado, it has emerged.

The Obama girls, shadowed by security, enjoyed the hospitality of wealthy Democratic donors Jim and Paula Crown - and angered other visitors by shutting airspace so they could land their plane.

Their trip came as President Obama golfed with Tiger Woods in Florida - a day out that was kept under wraps from the public and the media despite the taxpayer footing much of the massive bill.

In Aspen, Michelle, Sasha and Malia, as well as a few friends, headed to the slopes for all-day private lessons with numerous pro skiers from the Ski and Snowboard School of Aspen, the New York Post revealed.

All-day courses with the school cost between $107 and $200 per person, but the White House said the First Family was picking up the tab.

'The first lady and the Obama daughters are on a private family trip to Colorado,' a spokesperson said. 'Personal expenses are being paid for by the Obamas.'

The same weekend trip to Aspen last year cost at least $83,182.99, Judicial Watch reported, with the flight costs at $22,583.70.

Kellie MacMullan, from KWGN, said she happened to be at the resort at Vail when she noticed Michelle Obama and her pack of security guards.

'When we got up to the lift there were huge crowds of people for Presidents Day and she and her crew just came right to the front of the line right to those lifts and kind of made a big deal out of it,' MacMullan said.

Other skiers told the Post that the Obamas stuck to the beginner 'Panda Pipe' area of Buttermilk Mountain, staying away from the more challenging peaks used for the Winter X Games.

'There were crowds of security guards dressed in black around them, all parked off the bunny slopes,' one said. 'Michelle and the girls were mainly going out each morning before the lifts opened.'

Other visitors were reportedly annoyed that the Obamas plane blocked airspace, meaning other private jets could not land, or had to be diverted, the Post reported.

The First Family stayed with Aspen 
Ski Company owners Jim and Paula Crown, Democratic donors who own four 
ski mountain resorts. The security team stayed at another house next 
door.

The first lady was last in Aspen in July, when she attended a fundraiser at the Crown's home for around 100 people.

Their trip came as President Obama enjoyed a relaxing golf weekend veiled in secrecy.

He was on the course on Monday for the third and final day of a Florida vacation with departing US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, the president's Chicago pal Eric Whitaker and White House aide Marvin Nicholson.

He
 had enjoyed a round of golf with Tiger Woods on Sunday - a fact that 
only emerged by chance after media were banned from attending the event.

The traveling pool of journalists who 
follow the President's every move were reportedly furious after being 
shut out of his round of golf and not being allowed on to the club grounds.

The
 President waved as he jogged up the steps of Air Force One at Palm 
Beach International Airport on Monday evening while a White House aide 
heaved golf clubs and large bags on board.

He had been relaxing on a trip to the Floridian, an exclusive club along the Treasure Coast.

The
 club's owner is Jim Crane, a Houston businessman who also owns 
baseball's Houston Astros. Crane also has given money to Obama's 
political campaigns.

The White House had barred media coverage of the president's golf holiday but released the names of his partners.

$943,687.50: estimated cost of a trip for Air Force One from Chicago to West Palm Beach and then back to Washington, D.C.

$13,500: Cost to rent out three four-bedroom guest cottages at The Floridian for three nights

$24,000: Cost of an eight-hour private golf lesson with famed instructor Butch Harmon

$1,800: Greens fees for three guests for two rounds of golf

$1,600: Cost of four caddies for two rounds of golf

$4,620:
 Cost of 20 rooms at the Port St. Lucie Holiday Inn for traveling press 
and security detail based on the government per-diem rate

                                          TOTAL: $989,207

The outrage over the lack of 
transparency came as much of the bill for the trip will be paid 
for by tax payers, yet Obama did not feel it appropriate to 
even release one photo of his time out the course.

The
 President played with the notorious philanderer on Sunday after getting
 a private lesson from Woods' former coach the day before.

However the only 
inside reports about the rounds came from a golf journalist who happened
 to be in the clubhouse at the time. 

The
 President's deputy press secretary Josh Earnest responded to the pool's
 concerns by simply saying that they were previously told about the 
level of access - or lack thereof - that they should expect from the 
weekend.

MailOnline 
has calculated that his entire trip incurred costs of $989,207, 
including the sum of Air Force One journeys, cottage rentals, golf 
lessons, greens fees and accommodation for security.

During
 his round on Saturday, the President played with Crane as well as 
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. He also played at least one round with his close friend Eric 
Whitaker who he has known since he lived in Chicago.

Both
 Carroll and Crane have donated to Democratic campaigns, and Chase 
hosted an Obama fundraiser during the presidential campaign last year.
