An obese woman has lost 9st after an addiction to junk food left her £1,500 in debt - and resorting to eating from the bin.

Louise Brown, 27, from Surrey, was so addicted to pizza and battered sausages that she ran up eye-watering bills on credit cards to fund her £20-a-day fast food habit.

But after eating pizza from a wheelie bin, the 21st 7lbs singer decided to curb her addiction for good and underwent a gastric bypass funded by her parents.

Now Louise is a slim size 12 and weighs a healthy 12st 7lbs.

She said: 'On the surface, I had a happy life. I had a good job, a lovely family and lots of friends.

'But I was leading a double-life. Unknown to my loved ones, my food addiction was spiralling out of control. I was killing myself slowly.

'The joker of the group, I'd always try and laugh about my size, but inside I was devastated. I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror.

'Eating pizza out of my bin was the last straw. I realised then that I needed to do something about my addiction to food.'

Louise had always struggled with her weight, and by the time she reached 26, she was 21st 7lbs and a size 26.

Still living at home with her parents, psychotherapist Anna, 50, and pawnbroker Andy, 56, she would return from work to healthy, home-cooked meals and then eat junk food once they were asleep.

At her worst, Louise was spending up to £20 a day on chocolate, crisps and battered sausages from her local chip shop.

Louise said: 'I'd gorge on sausage rolls, crisps and cream-cheese bagels until I felt sick. I was so ashamed, so I'd eat them in my car or in my room and hide the wrappers.

'But I couldn't hide the bills that were piling up. To my horror, I realised I'd racked up a massive £1.5K of debt on my credit cards - which I'd blown on junk food.'

Single for six years after her ex-fiance left her for a woman twice her age, Louise says her lack of confidence had a disastrous effect on her waistline.

Louise said: 'I felt like a fat, worthless mess and I longed to find someone to share my life with.

'But I'd get horrible comments from men on nights out. They'd shout things like ‘God, you're massive' when I walked past. It was so embarrassing.

'I tried to hide how upset I was by joking around. I even dressed up as a clown for Halloween!

'I was absolutely miserable, though, and resigned myself to a life of loneliness and takeaways on the sofa.

'Nothing I tried ever helped me to lose weight. I tried Slim Fast and WeightWatchers, but they never did anything for me.

'I couldn't talk to men, so I watched from the sidelines as all my friends got chatted up - never believing that anyone could ever be interested in me.'

The final straw came in 2013, when Louise ate leftover pizza out of her own bin and realised she needed help.

Louise would return from work to home-cooked meals and then eat junk once her parents were asleep

Breakfast: Five slices of buttered toast

Lunch: Ready-made sandwiches, crisps and fizzy drink

Dinner: Home-cooked meal, followed by takeaway pizza

Snacks: Cream-cheese bagels, battered sausages, sausage rolls, crisps, chocolate

Breakfast: A selection of healthy fruit, yoghurt and cereal

Lunch: Chicken salad

Dinner: Grilled chicken with rice and vegetables

Snacks: A selection of healthy fruit throughout the day

She arranged an appointment with her GP and after discussing the available options, they decided that a gastric bypass was the best step forward.

After an anxious eight-month wait, Louise was informed that she wasn't eligible for the operation on the NHS.

Louise said: 'I felt as though my whole life had been taken away from me. I had already tried all of the diets, so I knew that without the gastric bypass I would never fulfill my dreams of getting married and starting a family.

'There was no way that I could curb my food addiction by myself.'

Luckily, Louise's parents were understanding of her struggles and covered the cost of the £11,000 operation.

After undergoing the two hour procedure at St Anthony's Hospital in Cheam, Surrey, Louise could only eat yoghurt and soup for three weeks.

In a year she lost an incredible nine stone.

Louise said: 'It's completely changed my life, and I am so grateful to my parents for paying for my operation. Without it, I would still be hopelessly addicted to junk food.

'I never imagined that I could fit into a size 12. I've thrown away all of my baggy clothes and filled my wardrobe with dresses. I love showing off my figure.'

Louise has now found love with 28-year-old Nicky Duke, who works in a brewery.

She said: 'Instead of acting like I'm happy, I really am. I have so much more confidence, and I'm willing to take on new opportunities.

'I've said goodbye to my food addiction for good. Now I'm addicted to having fun!'
