Carlos Tevez scored two and set up another as Juventus beat Borussia Dortmund 3-0 away to reach the Champions League quarter-finals with a 5-1 aggregate victory.

Tevez opened the scoring in the third minute when he let fly with a thunderous shot from 20 yards into the top left corner. The Argentine then gave Alvaro Morata a simple tap-in to seal the victory on a counter-attack in the 70th.

Arturo Vidal set up Tevez's second in the 79th, giving the scoreline a flattering but fair look, as the Italian side advanced to only its second Champions League quarter-final since 2006.

Draw takes place on Friday in Nyon

Leading 2-1 from the last 16 first leg in Turin, the visiting side nullified Dortmund's attacking threat to leave Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga's only remaining side in the competition, with the final to be played in Berlin on June 6.

It was Dortmund's fourth loss in four European games against Juventus.

Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri had promised his side wouldn't sit back despite the first leg advantage. His players stayed true to his word and Tevez got the visitors off the mark with an effort that stunned the home fans.

Juventus then pushed high up the pitch and snuffing out Dortmund's response before it could even begin.  

The home side harried and fought, yet was unable to trouble Gianluigi Buffon in goal. The veteran goalkeeper reacted quickly to extinguish the danger with Marco Reus lurking in the 36th but it was a rare intervention.

Midfield marshal Paul Pogba had gone off injured before that, prompting a period of Dortmund pressure. The visitors were the only ones who created chances however, with Vidal firing over.

Fans made their frustration known in the first half, with confidence-hit midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan a particular target. There were more loud whistles at the break.

Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller kept Dortmund in the tie when he saved a great chance for Morata five minutes into the second half. Mkhitaryan was then crowded out on a counterattack at the other end.

Weidenfeller denied Morata again, before Buffon easily saved from Kevin Kampl with Dortmund's first shot on target - after more than an hour of play.

By then it was too late, and Tevez sealed Dortmund's fate shortly afterward.
