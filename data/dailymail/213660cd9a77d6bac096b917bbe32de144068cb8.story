A rugby player was left waiting for three hours for an ambulance after he broke his leg - despite the hospital being just five minutes away. 

Ambulance chiefs have launched an inquiry after Luigi Segadelli, 30, was left lying face down on a freezing rugby pitch with his ankle bent almost 90 degrees during a game for Morriston RFC in Swansea, South Wales.

The flanker broke his tibia and fibia in a horrific tackle. When paramedics arrived at the pitch they told him he could lose his foot which had turned blue in the freezing cold.

His shocked teammates called an ambulance - but had to cover him with blankets to protect him from the cold as he lay face down waiting for medics. 

Mr Segadelli said: 'The rugby club is only five minutes away from the hospital so none of us thought we'd be waiting for half an hour, let alone three.

'I was cold and shaking. When the paramedics saw how long it was taking to get colour back into my foot they said it was a big concern because I had been in the cold so long there was a risk of losing my foot.

'That was when I started panicking.

'I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else.

The 30-year-old broke both his tibia and fibia. When paramedics arrived he was told that he could lose his foot due to the severity of the injury

'I want an apology for the delay - they must have the decency to make sure it does not happen to anyone else again. 

'I'm a proud rugby player so I was up for moving to the hospital but there was no way I could move my ankle, it would have made things worse. 

Still, the fact that it was considered as an option shows how frustrating the wait was.' 

He was given morphine at the scene and has had an operation to put pins in his leg

The game was called off following his injury shortly after the 2.30 kick-off on Saturday afternoon.

When his teammates called 999, operators told them Mr Segadelli wasn't to be moved.

Mr Segadelli had to wait until almost 6pm for an ambulance - and the pitch floodlights had to be put on as it became dark.

He was given morphine at the scene and has had an operation to put pins in his leg.

Mr Segadelli said once he was eventually reached the ambulance and hospital

staff were 'brilliant' but he said he wanted an apology and an assurance no one else would have to wait so long for treatment.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said in a statement: 'Demand on our ambulance service over the Christmas and New Year period was unprecedented and it meant we were unable to respond to some some calls in the time we would have liked.

'Unfortunately the call to help Mr Segadelli was one of those calls.

'The trust has had contact from Mr Segadelli and will now be looking into the matter to ensure we have a full understanding of what happened.

'In the meantime, we would like to wish him a speedy recovery.'

Mr Segadelli had been playing for around 20 minutes during Saturday's match when he suffered the injury saying his ankle 'turned right round'.

He said initially 'the adrenaline kicked in' and he did not feel too much pain but he soon began feeling severe pain and the 999 operator gave advice that he should not be moved.
