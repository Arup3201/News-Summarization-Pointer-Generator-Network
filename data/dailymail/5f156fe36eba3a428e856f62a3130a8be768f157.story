Authorities have issued a serious warning about toy chargers being sold across Australia after a remote-controlled toy helicopter was found packaged up with a deadly charger that could cause electrocution or burst into flames.

Inspectors from NSW Fair Trading raided Sydney's Paddy's Markets yesterday and found a vendor selling a faulty charger contained within a toy helicopter packet.

The 240-volt charger, which plugs into a power point, did not meet Australian safety regulations and could cause death by electrocution or fire, said Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins.

A toy helicopter was seized at Paddy's Markets by Fair Trading investigators. The packet was found to contain a faulty charger that could be fatal

'The charger itself is the problem, using the helicopter with a different charger is fine,' Ms Collins told MailOnline.

However since the charger is sold as part of a package with the helicopter, the concern is that people may use it without first checking if it is safe to be used.

'Our concern is that you could buy it for you child and the child could be recharging it and cause a spark or fire,' said Ms Collins.

'Electricity is so dangerous, we get complacent with it because we use it all day every day, but a 240-volt will kill someone,' she said.

The seizure was part of a statewide crackdown on unapproved electrical items following the electrocution death of Sheryl Aldeguer, a nurse and mother-in-two, in Gosford in April due to a faulty phone charger.

Department of Fair Trading investigators have raided retailers across New South Wales and targeted vendors in Paddy's Markets after a woman in Wollongong reported that her son bought a cheap USB-charger that had sparked from a store in the markets.

The vendor who sold the faulty charger inside the toy helicopter box is being investigated by NSW Fair Trading who will decide if he is issued with an on-the-spot fine of $500 or prosecuted, which could lead to a fine of $87,500 fine and two years' imprisonment.
