Marc Wilmots has told his players they can 'write history' against Argentina, as Belgium aim to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1986.

Belgium have won all four of their games so far in Brazil, and now head to Brasilia to face Lionel Messi and Co in the last-eight on Saturday.

'We can write history,' Wilmots told BBC Sport. 'We're going to play our own game.

'We won't just defend. We play compact football and we don't leave a lot of space. We have to attack and defend together.'

The Red Devils beat the USA 2-1 after extra time on Tuesday to progress beyond the second round for just the second time in their history.

And 28 years ago in Mexico, when they last achieved the feat, it was an Argentina side inspired by Diego Maradona who eventually brought their run to an end.

Wilmots called Maradona: 'The player that struck us down and gave us bad memories.'

This time round, Argentina possess another little wizard by the name of Messi, who, like Maradona in 198686, has almost single-handedly helped his side reach the quarter-final stage.

But Wilmots is more confident about his country's chances this time round.

He added: 'You should only think of one thing: make the final. That Belgium didnâ€™t use to have that frame of mind is not my problem.'

One of the men who will be tasked with stopping Messi is captain and veteran centre-back Daniel van Buyten, who said: 'If he gets past one player, he will have to get past a second player, because another will help out.

'We will have to show our big heart.'
