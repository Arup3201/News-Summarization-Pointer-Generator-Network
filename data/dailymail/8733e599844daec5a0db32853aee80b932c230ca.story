One New York City cop gave the sweater he was wearing to a homeless man who was dressed only in a thermal undershirt Friday when temperatures dropped to 23 degrees.

Officer Carlos Ramos, 29, was assigned to look for suspicious activity near the United Nations in midtown Manhattan when he spotted Robert William sitting on a sidewalk outside the Robert Moses Park dog run.

William was sitting barefoot because his shoes had gotten soaked, and had taken off his other shirt to try and wrap it around his freezing cold feet.

Warm heart: NYPD Transit Bureau officer Carlos Ramos stopped and gave Robert William a sweater off his back in the frigid New York morning on Friday

Grateful: Robert Williams' shoes were wet and he had only a thermal undershirt on

'I saw he was in need and it was my job to help him,' Ramos told the New York Daily News.

'I saw he had no coat,' he said. 'It was a very cold day, because I was very cold even bundled up.'

He offered the thick, navy blue Champion sweatshirt he was wearing under his uniform and coat to William, who initially refused.

'My concern was for him - his concern was for me staying warm,' Ramos told the Daily News.

Ramos finally convinced William to take the sweatshirt.

'He gave it to me. He said, "Donâ€™t worry about it,"' William told the New York Post.

'I felt good about having it.'

Makeshift: After Ramos left, William, wearing his new sweater, tore up his shirt to wear as socks

The warmhearted officer told the Daily News that he regularly helps people out, especially when the weather is cold.

'A nice cup of coffee, a tea, whatever seems appropriate,' he said.

Ramos has been a NYPD officer since 2007. He works in anti-crime and counterterrorism for the Transit Bureau.

William told the New York Post that he doesn't know how long he's been homeless for, but that he used to live uptown at West 163rd and St Nicholas Ave before an argument with a roommate saw him turfed out onto the streets.

Good Samaritan: Larry DePrimo won a host of fans last November when a photograph of him kneeling down to give a pair of boots to a homeless man in Times Square went viral

As winter sets in and temperatures drop below , the plight of homeless people who make their beds on the streets of New York City becomes critical.

Ramos' warm-hearted deed comes almost exactly a year after New York police officer Larry DePrimo won fans after buying Jeffrey Hillman, 54, a homeless man, a pair of boots.

Hillman was sitting barefoot in Times Square with blisters on his feet from the cold.

DePrimo bought Hillman a $100 pair of Sketcher's boots from a nearby store after Hillman told him he was fine - and that he'd never had a pair of shoes.

DePrimo was recently promoted to detective.
