Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has claimed his players are the best in the world at competing for turnovers.

The former rugby league star, whose side beat Scotland on Sunday, believes the likes of Sam Warburton and Jonathan Davies are more potent at the breakdown than Richie McCaw’s All Blacks. The tackle area is a fundamental part of Test rugby and Edwards was full of praise for his side’s efforts after their victory at Murrayfield.

‘I was very impressed with our post-tackle work,’ said Edwards. ‘We turned them over six or seven times and it’s something we excel at. I think we are the most proficient side in the world at turning teams over on the floor.’

Edwards’ claims may seem punchy, however Wales have topped the turnover statistics in their recent Tests against England, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. 

Much of the breakdown work comes down to the referee’s interpretation and Wales got on the right side of New Zealand official Glen Jackson in Edinburgh.

‘The best part of our game was Dan Biggar, Jamie Roberts and Leigh Halfpenny being fearless and leaping in the air,’ said Edwards. ‘Dan Biggar has got such guts. He is fearless.’ Biggar is Wales’s first-choice No 10, with Gareth Anscombe and Rhys Priestland his main rivals. 

There have been strong calls for the inclusion of Leicester’s Owen Williams ahead of the World Cup but the 22-year-old was yesterday ruled out for nine months after knee surgery.

‘It’s massively disappointing news for Owen,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill.
