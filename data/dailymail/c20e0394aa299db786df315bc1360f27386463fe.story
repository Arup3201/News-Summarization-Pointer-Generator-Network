Patients will have to sacrifice accident and emergency wards if they want seven-day medical care, NHS bosses have declared.

After finally accepting proposals for supermarket-style opening hours in general practices, health leaders have sparked fresh conflict by claiming it will mean a trade-off with fully-functioning hospitals.

Critics have blasted the announcement as a contradiction that could serve to make the state of health care even worse.

Compromise: After finally accepting seven-day care, NHS leaders have challenged patients to sacrifice A&E

The warning, laid out in a proposal released yesterday, criticised supporters of round-the-clock surgeries for naively expecting 'all-singing, all-dancing care'.

Norman Williams, author of the British Medical Association report, told The Times: 'There is no question: for a smaller hospital at the moment, it will be very difficult to deliver that all-singing, all-dancing seven-day care.

'That's why you have to take into consideration a degree of centralisation. We're probably not being bold enough.'

Rural towns would be wise to forego 'super deluxe' 24-hour care in favour of necessary emergency services, Mr Williams advised.

Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, blasted the 'mind-boggling' warning that forces taxpayers to plan illnesses around office hours.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Isaby said: 'It is mind-boggling that the BMA should suggest that a seven-day GP service cannot be provided as well as fully-functioning hospitals.

'Taxpayers who are forking out considerable amounts in tax to fund the NHS cannot plan illnesses around office hours on weekdays and should expect a decent service seven days a week, not merely when it is most convenient for doctors.

U-turn: Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, has accepted research showing death rates peak at weekends when senior doctors are off-duty. He encouraged hospitals to implement Tesco-style opening hours

'There is no reason why the service cannot be improved to serve patients better, particularly if considerable amounts of waste across the health service are exposed and cut.'

Calls for more flexible quality medical treatment stretch back years, as research shows death rates spike at weekends, when senior doctors are off-duty.

Having repeatedly lambasted the campaign as 'utter folly', Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, shocked many by proclaiming it is no longer acceptable for surgeries to be tailored to staff convenience, leaving patients to suffer.

In a newly published position paper on seven-day services, the BMA acknowledges that studies show death rates are higher among patients admitted to hospital at the weekend.

It also notes that an inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily in one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory, found that patients felt vulnerable at the weekend.

The statement says: ‘Improving care quality for patients means more staff, especially senior doctors, on site at weekend and evenings.’

BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter denied the organisation had made a ‘Damascene conversion’ and added: ‘Patients should have greater access to high-quality care throughout the week and doctors should be part of the solution.’

But the proposed compromise has sparked yet another round of conflict, with critics warning specialist units would have to be cut so that seven-day centres can afford necessary services such as blood tests, scans, investigations and surgery.
