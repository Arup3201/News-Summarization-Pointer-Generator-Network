A 17-year-old girl who faces several serious charges after allegedly tying an elderly man up to a table and stealing his credit cards to go shopping, is blaming the date-gone-wrong on her twin sister. 

The defense attorney representing New York teen Shalaine Foster, says it was her twin sister Shaina who met victim Paul Aronson, and led the plan to bind the 85-year-old up and steal his credit cards to go on a shooting spree while he lay helpless for 20 hours.

'There’s always that story of the good twin and the bad twin, who goes right and who goes wrong,' defense lawyer Brian Kennedy said Wednesday, as both sisters pleaded not guilty to a handful of charges related to the October incident.

'My client Sh​alaine was always going right but it seems she got caught up in something that was not of her making.'

When she was first arrested last month, Shaina took full responsibility for the incident in an interview with police. 

'He asked me to do things that I wasn’t going to do,' Shaina said at the time. 'He’s ugly, old and disgusting. I tied him up. I took his money and left. He was starting to creep me out. I brought the zip ties in case of a situation where I needed them. Don’t get my sister in trouble. I brought her there.'

Both sisters pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault, and grand larceny on Wednesday and were remanded in jail. They face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted of kidnapping. 

It was Shaina who allegedly met Aronson, a retired lawyer, on the website SeekingArrangement.com, which pairs older, wealthier men, with young women looking for 'sugar daddies'. 

17-year-old Shalaine pleaded not guilty to charges related to the incident on Wednesday, blaming her twin who met Aronson on  'sugar daddy' dating website SeekingArrangement.com and invited her along for the dinner date

When Aronson invited Shaina to dinner, she asked her sister to come along and after the meal the threesome went back to the older man's luxury townhouse on East 38th Street in Manhattan. 

Aronson then offered the underage sisters more alcohol before the night took a sour turn and he found himself on the floor, bound to his coffee table.

'Defendant Shaina Foster zip tied informant’s leg to a coffee table while defendant Shalaine Foster zip tied informant’s hands behind his back,' according to court files. 'The informant fell onto the floor and could not get up and laid on the ground for approximately 20 hours.'

Meanwhile, the girls stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before going shopping for make-up, it was claimed. 

Aronson was eventually found by a friend who freed him and called police.  

The girls, who both have criminal records, were held without bail in a Manhattan Criminal Court after their arrest. Previously, they lived in two separate foster homes.  

The New York Daily News spoke to the girls' brother outside the courtroom when they were first arraigned last month and he said: 'The story sounds f****ed up'.

The sisters stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before leaving him tied to a coffee table at his luxury townhouse on Manhattan's East 38th Street. Aronson lay helplessly on the floor for 20 hours until he was discovered by a friend 

'But it’s also an 85-year-old wealthy man who basically has these young girls like they’re in a candy store,' he said.

'We know he bought them liquor and intoxicated them and took him back to the house.'

Reporters also spoke the twins' mother who is denying all accusations against her daughters.

'These are 17-year-old girls ... college-bound, upstanding citizens,' said their overwhelmed mother.

'They’re not sleazy girls at all, whatsoever. It’s going to ruin their lives forever.'

'I don’t know what to say other than this is horrible,' she said.

Shaina has one felony arrest for possession of a sealed instrument (alcoholic beverage) plus one sealed arrest. Shalaine was arrested last April for introduction of prison contraband in addition to two sealed arrests.

While the age of consent in 17 in New York, the website Seekingarrangement.com states that all members must be over the age of 18. 

The site defines a sugar daddy as, 'Successful men and women who know what they want. They’re driven, and enjoy attractive company by their side. Money isn’t an issue, thus they are generous when it comes to supporting a Sugar Baby.'

A sugar baby is described as, ‘Attractive people looking for the finer things in life. They appreciate exotic trips and gifts. Sugar Babies get to experience a luxurious lifestyle, and meet wealthy people on a regular basis.’

Last month, MailOnline contacted Seeking Arrangement to inquire about how they regulate the safety of their members and ensure they are of legal age.

In an emailed statement Seeking Arrangement speedily replied, 'We require individuals to be 18 years or older in order to use our site. We rely on self-reporting which is the same age verification process all other dating websites and social media platforms use. 

'Unfortunately, there are some people who lie about their age. If we have any reason to suspect that a member is underage, we take immediate action and ask for proof of identity before that member will be allowed to continue using our site. If they cannot provide proof then they are suspended and removed from the site.' 

 In regard to background checks and ensuring the safety of their members they said: 'SeekingArrangement.com goes to great lengths to protect the integrity of our site, and our members. Not only do we vet every member before a profile is approved, we also are one of the only online dating sites that offer background verification. While this is not a requirement, we encourage all members to only date those who have been background verified.'

That being said, members on any dating site or online should proceed with caution before meeting in person.
