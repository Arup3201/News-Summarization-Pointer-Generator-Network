In school playgrounds across the Black Country this week, a new fad may briefly emerge.

When the imaginary goal line between the jumpers is breached at lunchtime, there may be the temptation to do a 'Berahino'.

Teenagers, come to think of it, should find it particularly easy. You may even say the pouting sulk, the refusal to smile, will come naturally to the majority of West Brom supporters aged between, say, 12 and 15.

Unfortunately for Saido Berahino himself, however, he is likely to find that this is a phase, unlike adolescence itself, that doesn't actually last very long.

Even the most ardent teenage football supporter knows that fake misery may look good on the disco dance floor but on the football field it just looks a little, well, fake.

The joy of football is to be found in scoring goals. It is the purpose of the game.

In football, happy will always trump sad and if you are unable to look pleased when you score then it won't be long until people start to wonder if there is just something rather wrong with you. 

This is the predicament young Berahino finds himself in today.

Berahino's fourth signalled West Brom's seventh against Gateshead, easing them through to the fourth round

Despite scoring four of his side's seven goals, Berahino did not crack a smile during the game on Saturday

At the start of a transfer window that at one stage looked likely to feature a clutch of high-profile enquiries about his availability, the 21-year-old is beginning to attract attention for the kind of reasons that have a habit of sending burgeoning careers in to a rather dramatic reverse.

For those without access to televisions, radios, newspapers or the internet, it is worth pointing out here that Berahino scored four times for West Brom in the FA Cup on Saturday but failed to crack anything resembling a smile at any point.

In one of the terrific Ian Hodsgon photographs carried in these pages on Monday, the centre forward actually looks as though he is, quite literally, about to take his ball home.

By all accounts, a young player gifted enough to be called up by England earlier this season is upset that talk of a new contract at the Hawthorns has faded. He remains, much to his chagrin, on a deal that pays him in the region of £12,000-a-week, low in modern terms.

Eric Cantona was the master of the moody celebration for Manchester United, but he was different

He may also be upset at the fact he is facing a drink driving charge serious enough to carry a threat of a six-month prison sentence. Whether he has yet made the connection between fact one – the contract slow down - and fact two – the subsequent criminal charge – only he will know.

Whatever the case, when he was placed in front of reporters on Saturday evening to talk about his impressive feats on the field, he did offer an explanation regarding his apparent lack of enjoyment and job satisfaction.

'I was just handling business and acting professionally and that's it,' he said.

'I just didn't want to celebrate and that was it.'

Berahino is within his rights to mark the scoring of a goal in any way he sees fit, of course. No footballer's contract contains a 'smile' clause and maybe he is dealing with an issue personal to him that we don't know about.

Mario Balotelli is another footballer who has celebrated with nonchalantly after scoring a goal

However, he must be careful not confuse carrying a face liked a slapped backside around a football field with professionalism for they are not the same. Sadly for him, managers at other clubs admiring of his undoubted talents will know this and will now look at his name and recognise the rather worrying signs of a flashing red light.

There have been other players over the years who have trodden this solemn, joyless path, of course.

Mario Balotelli tried it at Manchester City but he just looked stupid, largely because he couldn't even do it properly. It's hard to look moody and interesting when the corners of your mouth are beginning to twitch upwards.

Farther back there was Nicolas Anelka and, of course, Eric Cantona. King Eric was brilliantly, undeniably, different, though.

The Frenchman affected an air of gladiatorial indifference when he scored, as though he found the whole thing rather beneath him, a little too easy.

In its own, strange way, there was joy to be found in that and the crucial difference here is that the whole routine made Manchester United supporters like him a whole lot more, not less. As for the rest of the country, he simply didn't care.

Cantona also had the benefit of being a recognised world star, a phenomenon. He was weird but you could argue that he had earned the right to be.

Berahino is still at the start of his own journey and it is to be hoped he doesn't ruin it. It would be a shame, for him and for England, if he did.

Back in the playgrounds of the West Midlands, he may indeed have a new fan club for the moment, a group that feels the best way to celebrate is by not celebrating.

It won't last, though. Not in the long term. One wonders whether Berahino will.
