A builder training company's television ad has been slammed by Australia's advertising watchdog for depicting hazardous workplace behaviour.

The character in the Builders Academy Australia ad is represented as an action hero, rather than a builder, as he throws a chisel like a knife and jumps from the roof to the ground, running with firing guns in both hands. 

The 30 second video has the builder named Bob act out Matrix-style moves.

The ad went to air in September and has since had a complaint made against it to the Advertising Standards Bureau, suggesting the promotion encourages dangerous behaviour among builders.

'The building and construction industry has a serious problem with safety caused by ‘cowboys’ leading to serious injury and death, and promotion of this behaviour I find objectionable.

'This ad blatantly promotes and encourages the most dangerous of behaviours that can actually kill people — things like throwing a sharp and dangerous chisel like a throwing knife or firing nail guns or trying ridiculous gymnastics in a workplace.

'This ad is supposed to sell a service that teaches young builders and apprentices how to build homes safely yet this ad shows the complete opposite, glorifying dangerous and stupid on-site behaviours that have killed too many people in the industry already.'

But Builders Academy CEO Mark McCoach said the ad was perfect for the audience, despite it being far from a normal workplace.

'The ad is really different to anything else in the industry. It’s edgy, but it aligns perfectly with our audience. Our aim was to grab attention. I have full confidence it will generate many enquiries,' Mr McCoach said.  

'It is a fantasy — our character is a superhero and the environment is a fictitious space constructed for the purpose of the ad.

'The comparison is Batman and Gotham City — a fantasy built on aspects of reality. The final scene, with Bob standing on a pedestal, confirms the surreal environment.

'The actions depicted are not dangerous to our character — because he is obviously not real. He is a superhero, and can therefore do things normal people can’t, such as defy gravity and shoot nails into beams of wood over distance.'

The claim made against the TV ad forced Builders Academy to remove shots of the nail gun being fired incorrectly, promoting a slightly safer workplace environment for builders.
