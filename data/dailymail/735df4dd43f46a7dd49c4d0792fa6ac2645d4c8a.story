When two glamorous women departed The Strand Theatre in London on 28 April 1870 after a show, passers-by were startled to see them being arrested by police officers.

The women, who had been flirting openly with male members of the audience all evening, had also, unbeknown to them, been the object of the officers' attention throughout the play.

Producing a warrant card and apprehending the ladies, the arresting officer said: 'I'm a police officer from Bow Street, and I have every reason to believe
 that you are men in female attire and you will have to come to Bow 
Street with me now.'

The officer was correct in his belief. The 'women' were Fanny and Stella, a pair of
 middle-class gentlemen with a predilection for cross-dressing - and their subsequent court trial for being transvestites scandalised Victorian England.

And now their extraordinary tale has been chronicled in a new book by writer Neil McKenna, author of The Secret Life Of Oscar Wild, entitled Fanny & Stella and published by Faber on 7 February.

Fanny and Stella's real names were Frederick Park, 22, and Ernest Boulton, 21.

And on the night in question they were charged with both having sex with each other 
(homosexuality was a criminal offence until 1967) and also with several 
counts of conspiracy.

It even emerged police had had their 'dressing-up 
flat' under surveillance for a year - and that the home secretary 
himself was encouraging the attorney general to prosecute.

Frederick was the elder of the two, the youngest in a family of 12 children and the son of Judge Alexander Park. His brother Harry had already left England and escaped to Scotland after being arrested for homosexual offences.

Ernest, just 20, was the more naturally beautiful of the pair, and very attractive in his feminine guise. The son of a shipping broker, Ernest had a wonderful soprano voice and was determined to be a singer until his father pushed him into a career as a banker.

His most famous lover was Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, son of the Duke of Newcastle and godson of Prime Minister William Gladstone.

The day after their arrest, Fanny and Stella arrived sensationally at Bow Street magistrates court where nearly 1,000 people gathered to watch them be taken inside.

The two men spent four months in jail awaiting trial, and if convicted, their sentence would be between 10 years and life in prison.

Regardless, the pair did not flee when they were released from prison before trial, and the case arrived at Westminster Hall court in May 1871 for a huge state trial with the lord chief justice as judge and the prosecution led the attorney-general with the assistance of the solicitor-general.

The trial of Fanny, right, and Stella, left, was considered Britain's first great legal squabble with homosexuality, but was forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation

But because of a very weak prosecution case - and the fact that the two men were charged with conspiracy with six others who had, between them, fled, died or didn't even know each other - the trial failed and the men were acquired.

Boulton's mother Mary Ann had, crucially, testified to say that it was no secret his son's nickname was Stella and that he enjoyed dressing as a woman - which made the case look more silly than sordid and sinister.

Neil McKenna, who has written a book about the notorious Victorian transvestites entitled Fanny & Stella, told the Daily Express: 'The irony is that if they had just been charged with sodomy the medical evidence would have meant they would probably have been convicted, sent to prison and died there.'

McKenna explains that the furore surrounding the trial of Fanny and Stella can be put down to Victorian society 'having one of its periodic anxiety attacks' about homosexuality - which had recently become a term to describe an identity rather than just a fleeting behaviour - sexually transmitted disease, death and the effeminisation of a previously masculine Britain.

After the trial - which was considered Britain's first great legal squabble with homosexuality, but forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation - Frederick Park went to America with his banished brother Harry and died in New Jersey in 1881. Ernest Boulton changed his name to Ernest Byne and toured as a female impersonator with his brother Gerard. He died in England in 1903.

Fanny and
 Stella were hard to fathom. They had behaved with such lewdness in 
their box in the stalls as to leave not the faintest shred of doubt in 
even the most disinterested observer that they were a pair of hardened 
and shameless whores.

And
 yet, close up, Stella was revealed as a beautiful, almost aristocratic,
 young woman who showed flashes of an innate, and most decidedly 
un-whorelike, dignity and grace. One newspaper said later that she was 
‘charming as a star’, another christened her ‘Stella, Star of the 
Strand’. And despite all the opprobrium that would later be heaped upon 
her, despite all the mud that would be slung at her and all the mud that
 would stick to her, she never lost the mysterious aura of a great and 
stellar beauty.

Mrs
 Fanny Graham, too, was clearly a woman of some education and breeding, 
and was certainly very far removed from your common-or-garden whore. 
Here in the saloon bar, it seemed harder to reconcile their obvious 
quality with the ogling, tongue-waggling, chirruping lasciviousness of 
the stalls. They spent half an hour or so in the refreshment bar.

Before
 they left, Mrs Fanny Graham, unaware that she was being watched, betook
 herself to the Ladies’ Retiring Room and asked the attendant there to 
pin the lace back to the hem of her crinoline where she had trodden on 
it. At a quarter past ten, Mr Hugh Mundell had been despatched in 
ringing tones by Mrs Graham to go and call for her carriage and soon 
afterwards the remainder of the party made a leisurely progress to the 
foyer and pushed their way through the noise and confusion of an 
emptying theatre to the waiting conveyance.

Just
 as the carriage was about to depart, one of the men who had been 
shadowing them all that evening jumped up and swung himself in through 
the door.

'I’m
 a police officer from Bow Street,’ he said, producing his warrant card,
 ‘and I have every reason to believe that you are men in female attire 
and you will have to come to Bow Street with me now.'
