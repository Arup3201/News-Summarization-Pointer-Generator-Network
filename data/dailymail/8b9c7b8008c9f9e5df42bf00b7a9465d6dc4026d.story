It was billed as one of Britain's cheapest house, a three-bedroom home with a spacious living room and kitchen, put on the market with a starting price of just £1.

Estate agents predicted the house in South Terrace in Newcastle would appeal to property developers and was likely to generate a lot of interest.

And the experts were proved right as the house sold for almost 20,000 times more than its starting price and was bought for £19,125 after an exciting auction.

The dilapidated property, complete with broken windows, missing floorboards, peeling walls and a garden buried under a sea of weeds and discarded tools, generated a lot of interest. 

Cupboards have been left discarded in the mid-terrace house which will need a lot of work done before it is possible to recoup its value

The large bay window of the property in Newcastle was seen as one of its key features as buyers battled to get the house at auction

It was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder after eager buyers battled it out to get the bargain mid-terrace house which had been listed for £1 because there were no initial reserve bids. 

Before the sale predicted the right person with experience of redevelopment could get themselves a bargain.

The new house will certainly be a project as it needs extensive work done to most of the rooms to make them habitable. 

Plaster on walls in the bathroom has come off, while the bath has been pulled out and left lying on its side.  In another room flooring has been torn up and all the windows have been boarded up. 

However the property does have a number of redeeming features - including an impressive fireplace and large bay window. 

It is estimated that once the property has been developed inside it could be rented for £340 to £370 a month - netting the owner around £4,000 a year in rental income.

Uprooted flooring, broken carpets and furniture as well as peeling wallpaper and boarded windows feature throughout the property 

A developer will need to do a lot of work to restore the doors and the bathroom (right) which has a bath lying on its side on the floor

The marble fireplace is one of the key features of the property which experts think could attract interest from future buyers and renters 

Richard Francis, principle auctioneer at Agents Property Auction (APA), which sold the house, said: 'it needs work, but it has so much potential'. 

The home was described as having a spacious entrance hall, living room, kitchen and bathroom/WC to the ground floor, along with three good sized bedrooms to the first floor.

The house, which had broken door frames and a patched up front door, until recently appeared to have one tenant - a robin. And people looking inside it have had to take careful steps around debris, broken doors and falling plaster. 

However the house is not alone in fetching a price based on its potential. This week a shed in a patch of scrubland in Chelsea in London sold for £550,000 - despite not being accessible by car and tucked behind a row of terraced houses.
