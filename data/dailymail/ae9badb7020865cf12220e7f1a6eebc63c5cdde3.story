The Abbott government spent $24,000 on flowers for a reception for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the G20 summit in Brisbane last month. 

Contract documents on the government's AusTender website showed Melbourne florist, Flowers Vasette, was paid $23,760 to decorate a post-G20 banquet in Mr Modi's honour, Fairfax Media reports.

The bill for the floral arrangements is roughly six times higher than the average wage in India.

The banquet for Mr Modi was hosted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on November 18, with Indian cricketers Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and VVS Laxman attending.

Other details of spending during the $400 million G20 summit were released this week on the government's AusTender website.

A cocktail reception for world leaders was held at the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art and set the government back $586,000.

The Queensland parliament was paid $300,000 to host a leader's retreat and $368,000 was spent on luxury hotels - making the total accommodation bill more than $13 million.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended the price of hospitality arguing it's what Australian leaders would receive overseas. 

'While the government is always at pains to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, G20 was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to showcase our nation to the 4,000 delegates and 3,000 international media in Australia for the conference,' the spokesman said. 

'The arrangements for our guest of government visits were commensurate with the importance Australia places on our relationships with international partners.'
