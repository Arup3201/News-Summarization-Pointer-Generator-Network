He counts a who's who of showbiz and fashion among his biggest fans, but will we catch Kanye West, Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian wearing the boned corsets and face jewellery unveiled by Riccardo Tisci at his Paris fashion week show?

The Givenchy head honcho, known for setting trends and dressing the most esteemed stars, unveiled his autumn/winter 2015 collection before his famous fans in the French capital on Sunday - and it was a dark story.

Inspired by the Chola girl gangs in South America, his collection also had a hint of Victoriana (a trend we've seen in all four fashion capitals this season).

Tisci's models donned boned corsets over fitted jackets and feminine, bustier dresses with peek-a-boo cut outs. 

Skirts were velvet and voluminous and came in moody hues of brown and black.

Although Givenchy no longer shows a couture collection, Tisci used Sunday's presentation as a showcase of his exquisite tailoring skills.

As for the face jewels, models rocked nose rings, faux cheek piercings and decorative chandelier earrings. 

Want to get the look? Tisci revealed that some of the items seen on his models' faces would be hitting stores. 

Beautywise, the girls - and front rower Katy Perry - rocked gelled down curled hair slicked into a circle on their foreheads.

This isn't the first hint of Victorian influence we've seen over fashion month. Design duo Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their AW15 show in London.

The relentlessly alluring theme of Gothic romanticism seeped throughout the collection - named Persephone - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age.

Frills were rife, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear.

Silk blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway, followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter’s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette.

There were similar scenes at Giles, with models sent down the runway with black lips, pale complexions and ruffled collars with silk bows galore.

We've seen plenty of quirky beauty trends being trialled backstage at fashion month but for spring/summer 2015, there's lots to be excited about.

Eyeko, for one, is a brand bringing a world first to beauty shelves. The company, which is headed up by Nina and Max Leykind and counts Alexa Chung as an ambassador, have just launched BESPOKE - a personalised mascara service exclusively at Harvey Nichols.

Beauty buffs can book in or drop into the store and be assigned a 'mascara editor', who will advise and prescribe the perfect mascara custom-made for your eyes only for £28. 

From the brush you want (there's countless options from fat bristles to slim ones), right down to the exact formula you so desire (lengthening, boosting, curling), there's over 100 combinations to help you create your dream mascara. 

Each Bespoke Mascara is made on-site and instantly. Taking bespoke to the next level, the box will be monogrammed and wrapped in luxurious couture packaging.

Speaking about the service, Nina Leykind said: 'Eyeko was born out of a need to create the perfect mascara which led us to design our unique no waste squeeze tube packaging and develop botanical formulas with bristle brush designs to maximise mascara application culminating in the ultimate creation of our new Bespoke Service at renowned London store Harvey Nichols where our story first began.'
