With a collection of watches worth almost £500,000, many would assume they belonged to a Russian oligarch.

But Russian president Vladimir Putin has a collection of timepieces worth almost six times his official annual salary of £72,000.

One of the watches - made from platinum with a crocodile skin strap - sells for more than £300,000 alone.

It is called Tourbograph and is made by German watchmaker A Lange & Sohne.

The revelation has raised questions about how the Russian president can afford such a lavish collection.

Details
 of Vladimir Putin's watches were revealed in a video produced by the 
Russian opposition group Solidarity and posted on YouTube.

The
 video, titled 'Watches of a Kleptocrat' shows Mr Putin saying he would 
continue with his battle against corruption in a video from 2007.

It goes on to contrast the Russian president's watch with a £225 watch that President Obama has been seen wearing.

The video alleges that Russia's political and religious leaders have an obsession with expensive timepieces.

Patriarch
 Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Ramzan Kadyrov, 
leader of Chechnya, are shown in the Kremlin wearing expensive-looking 
watches.

As well as his £300,000 Tourbograph masterpiece, the president has a £6,450 Flyback also made by A Lange & Sohne.

He is also seen wearing a £39,000 Patek Philippe Perpetual Calendar.

And remarkably he is on his fourth £7,000 Blancpain watch called Leman Aqya Lugn Grande Date.

He gave away two in demonstrations to a shepherd and a locksmith. The third was dropped in wet foundations at a building site.

The watches are worth at least 22million rubles, Solidarity claimed, while is salary is listed as 3.6million rubles.

Boris Nemtosov, the Solidarity leader, told a blog in a tongue in cheek remark: 'Putin, it seems, did not eat or drink for six years to acquire this collection.'
