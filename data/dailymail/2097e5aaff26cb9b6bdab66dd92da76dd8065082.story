One in six travellers suffers a mobile phone bill shock after using their handsets abroad.

Consumer champion Which? warns today that mobile networks are cashing in on the fact many travellers are in the dark about the cost of using handsets on holiday.

A new cap on call costs comes into effect at midnight tonight that will offer some respite for British families travelling to other EU states.

However, the reduction in charges will only apply to EU states, which means travellers to other popular destinations such as Turkey, the US, Australia and the Far East will continue to suffer punishing bills.

The Which? research found that many people did not understand that caps on mobile phone charges only apply when travelling within the EU.

A spokesman said: ‘We found one in six people who have taken their mobile on holiday abroad in the past year have been shocked by a high mobile phone bill, of these one in four were charged more than £40 over their usual monthly usage.

‘Worryingly nearly half – 45per cent - of mobile users who have been abroad in the last 12 months said they didn’t know that the price caps don’t apply to the whole of Europe, with 48 per cent believing that they do.’

The new cap on what are called roaming charges come into effect on July 1. These put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls, which equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers.

The cost of sending a text is capped at 6¢ plus VAT, which equates to 5.76p for UK families. The figure is 20¢ plus VAT – or a total of 19.2p – for one MB download of data.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Capping EU mobile roaming charges is welcome news for millions of travellers, especially those who have faced expensive charges for data roaming when their mobile hasn’t even left their suitcase.

‘Consumers travelling within the EU should now be much clearer on the charges they have to pay.’
