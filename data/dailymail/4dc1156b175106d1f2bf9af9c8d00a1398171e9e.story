Sony was today putting the finishing touches to what could be the most important product launch in its history.

The PlayStation 4 console is set to be unveiled in New York at 11pm tonight.

The struggling electronics giant hopes the next generation console will help it regain market share against Microsoft, who is yet to reveal plans for its new Xbox console - which is also expected to be on sale in time for Christmas.

Touch me: This apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated PlayStation 4, which Sony is expected to announce at an event to be held in New York City next Wednesday

Although no details have been confirmed by Sony, the PS4's main features are believed to include:

The unveiling will excite millions of 
computer games fans across the world, and further fuel the on-going 
battle between Sony, Xbox 360 manufacturers Microsoft and Nintendo, the 
makers of the Wii system.

Experts say the event is critical to Sony's future.

'For Sony, they have to come out and make this PlayStation event the 
definitive statement of why gamers need to adopt the PlayStation 4 or 
PlayStation Orbis or whatever they end up calling it,' said Greg Miller,
PlayStation executive editor at video game site IGN.com.

'Their focus is on establishing a beachhead for the next generation 
of consoles, and that's what Feb. 20 is all about," said P.J. McNealy, 
CEO and founder of Digital World Research.

'The reality is they have been playing catch-up.'

Since the first PlayStation console launched in December 1994, Sony have
sold over 310 million home consoles worldwide, and 2.9 billion games.

Pictures allegedly showing the new PS4
controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into 
the middle of the familiar DualShock layout.

It has also been rumoured the console will cost £270 in an attempt to undercut rivals.

Electronics giant Sony is holding an event in New York, during which it promised to reveal 'the future'.

But the games manufacturer has refused to confirm widespread rumours that the latest version of the console will be launched.

Leaked photographs which have emerged online appear to show a prototype controller with a touchpad alongside the classic DualShock-style controls have fuelled the speculation.

The touchscreen is at the front, where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of PlayStation controllers.

The image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added L2 and R2 buttons have also been remodelled and improved.

Pushing ahead of Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo Co Ltd's new Wii U could help Sony revive an electronics business hurt by a 
dearth of hit gadgets, a collapse in TV sales and the convergence of 
consumer interest around tablets and smartphones built by rivals Apple and Samsung.

Tablets and smartphones already account for around 10 percent of the 
$80 billion gaming market.

Those mobile devices, analysts predict, will 
within a few years be as powerful as the current slew of game-only 
consoles.

Sony has slashed the price of its struggling Vita handheld games console in Japan in a bid to spur sales of the device.

The
maker of Playstation consoles trimmed the price of its 3G Wifi version 
by 10,000 yen ($110) to 19,980 yen, with all other models also reduced, 
it said in a statement.

Sony
this month trimmed its forecast for handheld sales, including the Vita 
and older PSP, to 7 million machines in the year ending March 31 
compared with an estimate of 16 million at the start of the business 
term.

Sony has kept its cards close to its 
chest regarding the expected launch, so far only officially releasing a 
teaser video via YouTube announcing date of the event and calling on 
gamers to 'be the first to know'.

The
video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video
game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming 
event.

Asked about the 
purpose of the event, Masaki Tsukakoshi, a spokesman for the company 
said only: 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business.'

Console rival Microsoft is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the Xbox 360, which is codenamed Xbox Infinity, though it is understood the Windows giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the E3 show in June.

Observers expect both systems to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market.

It has been more than six years since Sony launched the 70million-selling PS3, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept.

The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console.

Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2.

Rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective.

Sony paid $380million for Gaikai in June last year.

At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences.

'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.'

As well as the touchpad controller, 
the new console is expected to have an eight-core x64 AMD processor 
(codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports 
that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard 
drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs.

Specs
for the next-generation Xbox are rumored to be comparable, with 
insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors 
and USB 3.0.

However, video 
gamers have been horrified by rumours that the Microsoft machine will 
only work with the Kinect sensor plugged in and that it will only run 
games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only 
second-hand games but also games borrowed from friends.

The co-founder of Xbox has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft for 'five years of failure' - and claimed that Apple could ‘kill them’ at any given moment.

Former Xbox engineer Nat Brown - who came up with the console’s name (albeit spelled xBox) - slammed Microsoft for failing to capitalise on innovations such as Kinect and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device.

The attack follows reports that Microsoft are likely to announce their Xbox 360 successor, codenamed Durango, at E3 in Los Angeles in June this year.

Writing on his blog ilike.code, under the title ‘Stupid, Stupid xBox’, Brown said: ‘The past 5 years, and the last year in particular, have been simply painful to watch.

'Coasting on past momentum. Failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like Kinect. Touting strategic and market success when you’re just experiencing your competitor’s stumbling failure (yes, Sony, Nintendo – you are, I’m afraid, stumbling failures).

'A complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room.’

The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper.

The Asahi Shimbun reported that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270.

However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325.

Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain.The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006.

The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20.

If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date.

Microsoft's console, which could be named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming conference, held in Los Angeles in June.

Observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony.

The launches are important for both companies, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 débuted.

More and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform.

Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years.

Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs.

Last hurrah: The Garnet Red PS3. Sony are still actively marketing the console, and are releasing it in two different colours tomorrow

Azurite Blue: The 500GB 'super-slim' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware

Despite next-gen rumours and stiff competition from mobile devices, Sony are still actively marketing the Playstation 3.

The company today released the console in two different colours.

The new limited edition Garnet Red and Azurite Blue 500GB 'super-slim' units seem to represent one last push of their current generation hardware.
