After a prank pulled by Banksy got a homeless man kicked out of his longtime home in a Los Angeles water tank, the secretive British street artist made amends by giving the man enough money to live for a full year.

The trouble began after Banksy turned Tachowa Covington’s makeshift Pacific Coast Highway home into a piece of art by spray painting along the side of the bus-sized tank ‘This looks a bit like an elephant’ and it only got worse when collectors who covet the elusive artist’s work bought Covington’s squat to sell to collectors.

Though Banksy painted the joke on the homeless man’s home with its occupant’s approval, it left him without a roof over his head. Now, it has been revealed just how swiftly Banksy made amends with Covington and the high regard in which he now holds the controversial artist.

Accident: When elusive street artist Banksy made a visual joke on this Los Angeles water tank, he inadvertently got a homeless man kicked out of his home of seven years

‘There ain’t no better man than Banksy,’ Covington told The Independent. ‘He was an angel to me. He helped me more than anybody helped me in my life.’

Covington, 54, has lived an eccentric life. He once made money by wearing a suit of armor and Rollerblading around Venice Beach to entertain tourists. He’s also, at various times, worked as a Michael Jackson Impersonator, choreographer, Chippendales dancer, and male escort.

‘Most of my life I’ve been a performer,’ Covington said. ‘I never had a real job.’

Covington has lived without what most people call a home for many years, since after what he calls a string of bad relationships. 

Tank man: Covington sits in his extraordinary tank home, which in its prime featured an electricity generator, television, an address and even mail service

On his throne: Covington spent seven years working on his tank before Banksy's influence, and his art world adulation, pulled the red carpet out from under Covington

While living on a hillside above a stretch of Pacific Coast Highway between Santa Monica and Malibu, Covington noticed a water tank being abandoned.

It was initially park of a failed effort to build a park.

‘I watched it for a month or so,’ Covington said. ‘Eventually, I climbed inside and saw that it was empty. I thought, “Wow. This would be a cool place to make a house.”’

So for years, that’s what he called the metal tank. He refinished the inside with discarded building materials found in the surrounding affluent beachside neighborhoods and became a staple in the area.

Homeless again: Covington perches atop his tank just before it was removed in 2011. After Banksy spray painted his joke on the tank, an art collector purchased it and hauled it away, leaving Covington homeless again

Police left him alone despite neighbor complaints. In its heyday, Covington’s tank had a generator, television, security camera, and its own address complete with mail service.

Then, one day in 2011, he heard some people outside.

‘I looked out of the hatch, and there were two guys there,’ he said.

The guys said they were making a joke as they spray-painted the vaguely elephant-shaped tank. Covington didn’t stop them, he thought it was funny, too.

Eccentric: Covington says he has always been a performer and at various times has worked as a Michael Jackson impersonator, a male escort, and armor-clad rollerblader

‘This looks a bit like an elephant,’ the tank now read.

One of the men introduced himself as Banksy. ‘I didn’t know who he was, so I didn’t think twice about it,’ said the oblivious Covington.

Unfortunately, other people weren’t quite as out of the loop and news quickly spread about the secretive graffiti artist’s Los Angeles cameo piece.

Soon after, an LA-based art organization bought the tank and not long after that, they hauled it away.

Covington was devastated.

Like an elephant: A regretful Banksy gave Covington enough money to live for a year. He says he'll never forget what the artist did for him. 'There ain¿t no better man than Banksy'

But before Covington had a single day to despair, Banksy righted his wrong.

'He helped me so fast': Covington says he'd never been treated as nicely by anyone before Banksy. 'It was like a miracle'

Back on his feet: Though the money from Banksy has run out and Covington is back living on the hill sans tank, he's now on a waiting list for government-funded housing

‘He helped me so fast, I didn’t have 
to spend a single day more on the streets,’ Covington told the 
Independent. ‘It was like a miracle.’

Banksy gave him money to get settled in an apartment and pay bills for a year.

Though
that  money has now run out, Covington continues to think highly of the
artist and has even decided to revisit his glory days as Rollerball, 
the skating armored man.

Since
his eviction, Covington has also become the subject of a what some some 
Texas-based filmmakers hope will become a documentary on his unwitting 
role in the world of high art called Something from Nothing.

And this week, a play based on Covington and his elephant tank called Banksy: The Room in the Elephant begins a run at the UK's Edinburgh this Wednesday.
