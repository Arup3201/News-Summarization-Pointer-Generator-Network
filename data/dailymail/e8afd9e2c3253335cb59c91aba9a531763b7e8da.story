Sexsomnia: Actor Simon Morris, 42, pictured, who is accused of raping a teenage girl told Cardiff Crown Court that he had no recollection of the alleged rape

An actor who claimed he had 'sexsomnia' to try and wriggle out of accusations that he raped a teenage girl has been jailed after a jury refused to believe his story.

Simon Morris, a bit-part actor who appeared in a film with Michael Caine and in the 
TV soap Hollyoaks, attacked the 15-year-old after she drank cocktails at
a birthday party.

Morris, 42, was found guilty of raping the drunken teenager after helping her to pour champagne for guests.

Hours later her sneaked into her room at 6am after she collapsed.

When arrested he initially refused to believe that he had sex with the girl until police presented him with DNA evidence, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

He told jurors: ‘I have a history of sleepwalking, checking my phone, gyrating against door frames and having sex with partners in my sleep. It’s quite embarrassing but I once engaged in sexual activity with a recent ex-girlfriend.

‘I climbed on top of her in the middle of the night in a blank state. I have also had partial sex with my current partner and gyrated against her leg.’

He told the court he had undergone tests at a sleep clinic in Edinburgh to ‘try to understand’ his condition.

Morris was examined at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre to discover if he has sexsomnia - the medical condition where people engage in sex acts while still asleep.

Psychologist Chris Dzikowski, director of the centre, told the court: 'I placed electrodes on his head to monitor his sleep patterns in the laboratory.

'He sat up and moved unusually, grinded his teeth and had noticeable and sharp hand movements.

'I found that the features were consistent with sleepwalking.

'It is a possibility that in this case he was suffering from sexsomnia - I cannot exclude it.'

But Morris was found guilty of rape by a majority of 10-2 and unanimously guilty of assault by penetration.

Judge Daniel Williams told him: 'You have been convicted of two very serious offences and you are facing a substantial custodial sentence.'

Sue Ferrier, prosecuting, called his sexsomnia claim a ‘feeble excuse to escape the inevitable’.

She said Morris met the teenager in September 2011 at a birthday party, where she had been given two glasses of champagne when she arrived.

‘Morris took an interest in her – winking at her, helping her pour drinks and even offering her to stay with him in London,’ said Mrs Ferrier.

‘The girl got drunk on cocktails and her father put her to sleep in an upstairs room. Morris then checked on her after she was sick and carried her into another bed.

‘The girl’s father tried to wake his daughter at 6am to go home, but as she was fast asleep he left her in the bed for the night.’

The girl’s statement to police described how she woke soon afterwards to see Morris standing in front of her, touching her sexually.

He had sex with her before leaving, when the ‘full horror’ hit, her statement said.

Court: Morris is accused of raping the teenager at a party after she had been put to bed by her father. The prosecutor told the court that Morris had winked at the girl and asked her to stay with him in London during the party

Morris told how he was ‘petrified’ to 
be handcuffed and arrested later that morning. He said: ‘I’m too much of
a gentleman, I wouldn’t even do this to my worst enemy.’ He added that 
he did not believe they had even had sex until he was presented with the
DNA evidence.

Morris’s 
current girlfriend, Helen Cole, is standing by him and told police he 
once tried to have sex with her while he was asleep.

Morris appeared with Michael Caine and Andy Serkis in the 2000 film Shiner and on Hollyoaks in 2001.

He also appeared on the West End stage during his acting career, which lasted between 1996 and 2006.

He later set up a consultancy firm which has since folded and he has also acted as an escort to celebrities.

Morris blew a kiss to his girlfriend as he was led to the cells. He will be sentenced in the New Year.
