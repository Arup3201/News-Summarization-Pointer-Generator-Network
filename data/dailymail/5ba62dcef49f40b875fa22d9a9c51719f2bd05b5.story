Owners of a nursery school have installed a CCTV system so worried parents can check their children are happy while they are at work.

Munchkins Kindergarten in Holland-on-Sea, Essex, gives parents a login address and password so they can view their children's room for up to five minutes at a time to reassure themselves that their children are OK.

The webcams can be accessed from a computer or smartphone, and while parents are not subjected to police CRB checks, they can only log in on days that their children are in nursery.

Reassuring: Parents at Munchkins Day Nursery in Holland-on-Sea in Essex can check up on their children via webcam - here student Ellie-May Lucas, four, shows how the system works

The nursery caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11-year-olds, who use the after-school club

Sisters Liz Makins and Jo Callaghan, who run the nursery in Holland-on-Sea, in Essex, say the babycam is there to give parents peace of mind.

Mrs Callaghan, 50, who also runs two other nurseries in Essex and one in Kent, said all her parents are delighted to have the chance to check up on their children.

She said: 'I have three children of my own and Jo has four so we are quite qualified on the parenting side of things and understand that there is nothing more precious to a parent than their child.

'It is a huge thing for them to leave their children with us because after all we are strangers at the beginning, so this enables them to log on and watch their children having fun.'

Access to the webcam footage automatically shuts off after five minutes, to avoid parents leaving it playing on their work computer and wandering off, allowing others to view it.

And staff at the nursery, which caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11 years in the after-school club, regularly monitor parents' usage of it to make sure no-one is accessing it particularly often.

All-seeing eye: Staff at the nursery say they forget the cameras are there - nappies are changed off-camera

Mrs Callaghan said she first installed a babycam at one of her other nurseries three and a half years ago.

She said: 'We haven't had one parent complain or say they don't like it, and why would they?  We have nothing to hide.'

And she said she didn't ask parents for CRB checks before allowing them access 'for one very good reason - all nappy changing, and clothes changing, if necessary, is done off camera.'

'We haven't had one parent complain or say they don't like it and would they?  We have nothing to hide.'

She said her staff had never complained that the cameras meant they couldn't slack off, and said everyone forgets the cameras are there.

Mrs Callaghan said many nurseries had private CCTV systems, visible only to nursery bosses, for security reasons, but insisted allowing parents to view it as well was only a good thing.

She said: 'There is the occasional squabble that a parent might see and they might ring us up about it but that is rare - I would say it happens only about once a year in all of our nurseries as the children are so happy and busy.'

The first nursery webcams allowing parents to view their children from outside computers were introduced in Britain at the beginning of the century.

Researchers said they were popular as they allowed parents to feel they were 'protecting' their children, but critics said they were taking the concept of Big Brother too far.
