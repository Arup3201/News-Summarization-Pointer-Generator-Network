Caroline Wozniacki won her first title of 2015 with victory at the BMW Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur.

The Dane had won just four WTA events since losing her No 1 ranking in 2012 but took her career total to 23 with a 4-6 6-2 6-1 victory over Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru.

The top seed could not find her rhythm in a rain-interrupted first set and an upset looked on the cards as Dulgheru moved ahead in her hunt for a first title since 2010.

Denmark's Wozniacki lost the rain-interrupted first set but dominated the second and third for victory 

But that seemed to spur Wozniacki into life and she cruised to the next two sets without conceding a break point as she claimed victory in an hour and 50 minutes.

Wozniaki was quick to express her delight on Twitter after the win in her second final of the year with a celebratory selfie. 

'Woohoo!!Title #23, couldn't be happier! First ever trophy selfie. Thank you Malaysia for a great week!' the Dane said.
