A cattle farmer went above and beyond to save a freezing calf by spending an hour with it in a hot tub.

Dean Gangwer, 46, from Cutler, Indiana, came up with unusual hypothermia remedy after spotting the animal barely breathing in the snow last week.

He told ABC News that he hauled the cow, named Leroy, to his backyard and jumped with it into his heated bath full-dressed.

Indeed, photographs show Gangwer sat with the creature in the water with his T-shirt on and his spectacles slightly steamed up.

In a bid to stop the young cow from drowning, Gangwer is seen supporting his head above the surface.

After about 60 minutes the animal was apparently warmed up.

Gangwer then carried it into his home and bundled it up in a pile of heated electric blankets.

The third-generation farmer says that Leroy's mother wandered away from the herd and gave birth in a snowbank.

Sense of humor: Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot-tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass'

But in freezing weather, the decision to go off alone almost proved fatal for her young.

Luckily Gangwer got to the scene just in the nick of time. Leroy is now fully-recovered from the chilly ordeal and has started to nurse.

Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass.'

He says luckily his wife loves animals as much as he does and she has cleaned the house after Leroy's impromptu visit.

However, Gangwer added: 'She is leaving the hot tub for me to deal will. You never know what you might have to do when you live on the farm.'

Many people have applauded the farmer's quick-thinking antics, with one commenter noting in jest: 'You could have just thrown some potatoes, onions and carrots in the hot tub and had dinner.'
