Vindictive: Reece Grove, 19, was fined £500 for killing his neighbours' cherished tree

A vindictive thug who was annoyed with his neighbours poisoned a tree the couple had planted 20 years earlier to mark the memory of their dead unborn baby.

Reece Grove, 19, accused Sara, 47, and Martin Coogan, 49, of making too much noise and taking up too many parking spaces.

He waited until they went on holiday and then tipped weedkiller over one their flower beds - killing the cherished plant.

They discovered that Grove was responsible when the yob posted pictures of himself posing with weedkiller on Facebook.

Mr and Mrs Coogan were initially prepared to forgive the attack as a mishap and accept a face-to-face apology from Grove organised by police.

But they then insisted on prosecuting him when callous Grove admitted doing it on purpose - and sent them a letter explaining why.

In the letter he listed all the reasons he saw that justified his actions.

He has now been fined £500 after admitting destruction of property at Medway Magistrates court.

Mrs Coogan, an admin assistant of 
Strood, Kent, told Medway Magistrates: 'The loss of the tree has now brought back the 
memories of losing the baby and made those feelings open sores when they
were healing.

'I could not go out into the garden because I would feel myself start to cry. My heart is breaking.

'If it was a damaged gravestone it could be replaced as the grave is still there, but my plant is gone, died, forever lost.'

Withered: Mr and Mrs Coogan were distraught when they discovered this damage to their much-loved garden and a tree the couple planted in memory of their dead unborn child

Mr
Coogan said the plant had stood for 20 years as the couple’s only 
lasting memory to the child they lost just 11 weeks into pregnancy.

The
retired firefighter said: 'We had a family vicar come and bless the 
plant nearly 21 years ago so it meant a lot to us obviously.

'Me and Sara were out of the country at the time and had left our son in charge of the plants.

'He watered them every day but they started to die and he was racked with guilt for about two weeks after.

'We did not want to give this guy a criminal record, we would have been content with a face-to-face apology.

'His letter was trying to justify his actions and that was enough for Sara to contact the police.'

Insult: Reece Grove sent Sara and Martin Coogan a letter apologising for killing their 'sentimental flower' then attempted to justify his actions

He
added: 'There is no price to put on that sentimental plant. It wasn’t 
that expensive it’s dead now and there is nothing we can do about it 
now.'

Medway Magistrates in Kent heard how the 
Coogans, who have two children, found more than £200 worth of plants 
destroyed when they returned from holiday.

Grove had accused Mr Coogan of revving his motorbike too loudly, taking up too many parking spaces and making too much noise ‘through the night’.

Grove, a KFC worker, wrote: 'If you 2 could take this into consideration what I have said and action these points it would be much appreciated.

'Once again sorry for the killing of your plants.'
