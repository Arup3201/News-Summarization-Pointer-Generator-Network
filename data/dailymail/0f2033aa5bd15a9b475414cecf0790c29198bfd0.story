From the front, her short summer dress looked like a perfectly suitable choice for a star-studded day at the polo.

But
 this unfortunate woman might have done well to take a twirl in front of
 the mirror before she stepped out into the sunshine with the 
royals… because from the back, it was a rather different story.

The
 mystery blonde showed off slightly more than she intended when her 
dress rode up as she walked with Prince Harry through Coworth Park Polo 
Club in Ascot.

Oops! The mystery blonde reveals more than intended as she accompanies the prince to the trophy presentation following the annual charity polo event

Sharing a joke: The woman chats and laughs with the princes at the polo event in Ascot, Berkshire

Star supporter: ame Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Queen in the 2006 movie of the same name, shared a joke with Harry, 29

The mishap 
occurred yesterday as she accompanied the prince to the trophy 
presentation following the annual two-day Audi Polo Challenge charity 
event.

But if she realised 
what had happened, she took it in her stride, laughing and joking with 
the royals.

And while Prince William headed off soon after the event 
finished – possibly to attend to the absent Kate and George – Harry was 
happy to linger and chat to the young lady.

In
 one of their first public appearances together since Guy Pelly’s 
wedding, the princes put on a good show, winning yesterday’s match and 
losing just 5-4 in the last few minutes of what was described as a 
‘nail-biting’ game on Saturday.

The two-day event is expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for three charities including the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in Chelsea

And
 while the Queen may not have been present to watch them compete, they 
had the next best thing in the form of their on-screen grandmother.

Dame
 Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Queen in the 
2006 movie of the same name, shared a joke with Harry, 29, and William, 
31, before cheering them on from the sidelines.

Also among the 300 attendees at the exclusive invitation-only event were Anna Friel, Nick Ferrari, Will Young and Ben Fogle.

It
 raises tens of thousands of pounds for charities which are close to the
 princes’ hearts, including the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in 
Chelsea, the youth training charity Skillforce and the HIV fund 
Sentebale.

Prince 
William is the president of the Royal Marsden and the Royal patron of 
Skillforce, while Harry founded Sentebale with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.

Both princes wore polo tops emblazoned with the Sentebale logo in blue, showcasing their support for the cause.

The 
African nation has the third-highest HIV infection rate in the world - a
 third of its children are orphans and more than 37,000 children under 
14 are living with the disease.

So the 
princes' appearance was no surprise - last year, it was the Duke's 
first public day out after the birth of Prince George, and he was rewarded with a baby mallet.

The event is one of the princes' 
first appearances together since attending friend Guy Pelly's wedding in
 Memphis earlier this month.

The
 Duchess of Cambridge and son Prince George didn't make it to Ascot, 
so its no surprise that William, 31, dashed off straight after the 3pm match 
at around 5.10pm.

On the other hand Prince Harry, 29, mingled with guests and left a little later at around 5.45pm.

An array 
of A-list stars were in attendance, including Fast & Furious series 
stars Michelle Rodriguez and Luke Evans, who two were in high spirits as
 they watched the men on horses battle to score in each other’s goals.

The pair wore stylishly in-sync outfits: accents of white, cream, 
beige, and brown - but they weren't the only chic 
stars to make it.

The match is played every year and went on for around an hour, with the event expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for charity

The annual event was in aid of three charities in which the princes hold senior roles and has raised more than £1.5m over the last 10 years

While their grandmother famously declines to wear a helmet when she is out riding, the faster-moving princes were more cautious

Sharp suited male stars include actor Clive Owen, who made an appearance in a sharp
 suit and wayfarer sunglasses, and Mr Selfridge star Jeremy Piven, who sported a neat beard, baby blue double breasted suit jacket and white trousers.

Ex-Pussycat
 Doll Kimberly Wyatt and her model husband Max Rogers headed to Ascot 
too, to watch the princes mount their trusty steeds for charity.

Tom Hardy 
and fiancée Charlotte Riley were at the polo too, having had an early 
start on Wednesday for the 6am premiere of Edge Of Tomorrow.

Sam Claflina and wife Laura Haddock also joined the host of celebrity guests at the charity game.

Yesterday,
 the princes were pictured joking around with their on-screen 
grandmother, actress Dame Helen Mirren, who was there to watch with 
husband Taylor Hackford, director of An Officer and a Gentleman.

The invitation-only event was tinged with disappointment for the 300 guests, who also included the actress Anna Friel, comedy star Nick Frost and explorer Ben Fogle, as the princes' team lost the nail-biting clash 5-4 in the last few minutes.

is played every year and went on for around an hour, with the event 
expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for charity

To mark the occasion last year, Audi's British director Martin Sander presented him with a baby polo mallet.

Last year William's Audi Quattro team won a respectable 8-7 against competitors Audi Ultra.

This year's unusual prize is some silver wine coolers in the shape of polo helmets.
