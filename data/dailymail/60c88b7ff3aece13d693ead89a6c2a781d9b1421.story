One of the country's top schools is planning to open a sixth-form academy which will aim to offer pupils from poor backgrounds a route to Oxford and Cambridge.

Westminster School and the Harris Federation have joined forces to open the academy, which will give priority to teenagers entitled to free school meals and to children in care.

Applicants hoping to gain a place however will be required to pass a tough entrance exam and interview and achieve A* or A grades at GCSE.

While entry standards will be similar to those for Westminster School, offers will not just be based on results but will also take potential into account, The Times has reported.

Sir Daniel Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris Federation, said he hoped half of the academy's students would go on to study at Oxford or Cambridge, which would make it the country's most successful state-funded school.

He said: 'We have around 1,600 or 1,700 sixth formers at Harris academies and are targeting Russell Group universities. We want to get more A* and A grades at A level and Westminster has that expertise.'

Westminster head master Dr Stephen Spurr said: 'We are best at teaching academically gifted children and we believe that there are plenty such young people with the ability and potential to make the most of such a sixth form and go on to the best universities in this country and elsewhere.'

The academy, which will be set up through the Government's free schools programme, is expected to start recruiting in June if it receives its formal approval next month.

The academy's full capacity will be 250, although its first intake will be of 125 students in autumn next year.

Westminster, which charges fees of between £23,583 and £31,350 and each year sends about 90 pupils to Oxford and Cambridge, will shape the academy's curriculum, according to The Times.

Lord Adonis, former Labour Schools Minister, has welcomed the plan, describing it as an 'immensely exciting and important venture'.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'This sixth form is a unique collaboration between two leading lights of UK education. By combining their skills and experience they will be able to create a world-class sixth form for teenagers from all over London.'

It is hoped hoped half of the academy's students would go on to study at Oxford or Cambridge. Pictured is Christchurch College, Oxford University
