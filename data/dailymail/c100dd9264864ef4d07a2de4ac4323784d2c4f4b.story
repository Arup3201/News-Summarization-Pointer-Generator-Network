ARE THEY FRIENDS OR FOES?

Best of enemies? It didn’t look that way when Ronald Koeman and Louis van Gaal shook hands before kick off at St Mary’s. The pair previously worked together at Ajax and Barcelona, and much of the build-up to the game centred on their apparent feud. But there was a cordial exchange between the technical areas when the teams made their way out on to the pitch.

CHRISTMAS DAY TRUCE REMEMBERED 

Respect to the Football Remembers initiative between the Barclays Premier League and the FA because it has been warmly received by supporters up and down the country over the weekend. Southampton and Manchester United players stood together before kick off, just the way it should be at this time of year.

Before the game, as with all matches over the weekend, the players paid respect to the Christmas Day truce

ROY OF THE ROVERS 

Southampton's cheeky programme editor recreated a Roy of the Rovers-style comic strip of the infamous afternoon when United were 3-0 down in their grey shirts at half-time down at the old Dell. They changed to blue at the break after United players complained they couldn’t make each other out. They still lost 3-1.

SMALLING JOINS INJURY LIST 

Chris Smalling's 19th minute injury means he joins Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael, Phil Jones and Jesse Lingard in the bulging treatment room at Old Trafford. Smalling’s injury means Jonny Evans, who replaced him on Monday, will start against Liverpool on Sunday.

TOUGH FIXTURE LIST 

The fixture list has certainly been cruel to Ronald Koeman and his team, but the Premier League will maintain that successive games against champions Manchester City, FA Cup winners Arsenal and Manchester United in the league is random. Whatever it is, it hasn’t suited Southampton.

Southampton's fixture list has proved difficult, and Monday night was no different as they lost 2-1 to United
