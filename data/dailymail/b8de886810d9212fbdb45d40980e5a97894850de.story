Arsenal legend Gilberto Silva could be the latest member of the Invincibles to head back to the Emirates Stadium to take up a coaching role.

Arsene Wenger hinted last month that the club's record goalscorer Thierry Henry would be welcome back as a coach, and now it seems Gilberto has had a similar offer.

In an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte, Gilberto confirmed that he has had an invitation from the club to return, and that he would one day like to go into management.

Gilberto was not as flashy as team-mates Robert Pires or Thierry Henry, but was a vital part of the side

'I have had an invitation, yes,' he said. 'Anything is possible, it makes me happy when you have these invitations, people see you with a different profile, you can contribute. 

'It makes me happy and motivated, and it makes me want to learn from others, seek knowledge and develop my own style.'

However, the Brazilian World Cup winner insisted that he still wants to continue playing for the time being, despite being 38 years old, and without a club.

Given Arsenal's lack of presence in central midfield, Arsene Wenger must wish his former midfield general was a few years younger.

During his time at the club Gilberto won the Premier League and two FA Cups
