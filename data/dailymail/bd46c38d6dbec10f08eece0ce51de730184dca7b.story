Smiling killer: Ensar Gol, 22, was found guilty of murdering his new bride and mother-in-law in a horrifying attack

A Turkish man, who knifed to death his new bride and mother-in-law in a prolonged and vicious attack, was today jailed for 36 years.

Ensar Gol, 22, grinned in court again as he was jailed to two life sentences a day after he smirked at being told he would be going to prison for a long time.

There were cheers in court when he was told of his fate by High Court Judge Mr Justice Supperstone.

Gol repeatedly stabbed Michala, his 
wife of six months, as she lay sleeping in their bed in Thame, 
Oxfordshire, because he was unhappy in the marriage.

Michala's mother Julie Sahin, who was watching television downstairs with a friend, rushed up to find Gol perched over her daughter repeatedly plunging the knife into her neck.

As she tried to pull Gol away, she slipped to the floor where she was set upon in a frenzied attack. A post-mortem examination revealed the two women had been stabbed around 70 times.

After murdering the two women Gol scooped up his three-year-old daughter and carried her through the streets, the kitchen knife still in his hand and his jeans splattered with the blood.

Mr Justice Supperstone said: 'I have no doubt that you intended to kill your wife Michala and your mother-in-law Julie,” said the judge to a nodding Gol.

'These brutal murders were planned and pre-meditated.'

'You say you were unhappy here and didn’t get on with your mother-in-law,' the judge told Gol during the sentencing at Oxford Crown Court.

'I totally reject any suggestion that anything she said or did provides you with any mitigation.'

Relatives of Julie and Michala cheered as Gol was told he would serve 36 years for each murder and 12 years for the attempted killing to be run concurrently.

A jury sitting at Oxford Crown Court heard how he had been unhappy in his marriage, feeling forced to wed Michala in March 2011.

They had two children together after meeting in the Turkish holiday resort of Bodrum in 2007.

Bearded Gol smiled and nodded as the jury gave their unanimous guilty verdict for the killing of Michala on September 4 last year.

Victims: Michala Gol, (left) 28, and her mother Julie Sahin were stabbed 70 times. Mrs Sahin had rushed to her daughter's aid after Gol attacked her as she slept in their marital bed

As
the public gallery cheered the verdict, Gol, dressed in a black v-neck 
tee-shirt, stood still and stoney faced as he was also convicted of the 
murder of Julie Sahin and the attempted murder of her friend Casey 
Wilson.

High Court Judge Mr
Justice Supperstone said he would adjourn Gol’s sentencing until the 
following day although it was agreed by both prosecution and defence 
that he would serve at least 30 years.

As
he was led from the dock Gol broke out into a huge grin, laughed and 
pointed at himself with two fingers, mouthing 'me, me, me'.

The
jury previously heard how just hours before the double murder Gol 
bragged on Facebook that his English bride and her mother 'would be 
cut'.

He had even had sex 
with another woman before he went on the murderous rampage after he fell
out with bride Michala and mother-in-law - who disliked the way that 
Gol treated her beloved daughter.

During the seven day trial Gol had 
denied the vicious killings, even callously claiming that it had been 
Julie who had attacked him, and that he had only acted in self defence.

'I’ve never been scared that much in my life,'unshaven Gol told the jury while giving evidence.

However a jury of seven men and five women decided that Gol had been guilty of killing 28-year-old Michala and 50-year-old Julie, as well as trying to kill Casey, who is now 20-years-old.

Aftermath: Gol is pictured on CCTV clutching his three-year-old girl in one hand with the knife in the other just minutes after the killing at his home, in Thame, Oxon.

Maniac: Gol is later seen on CCTV chatting on his mobile phone as he 
strolls through the streets with the murder weapon still in his hand

Arrest: Police officers apprehend Gol as he lies on the street in Thame, Oxon.

Before the killing spree, Gol wrote on
Facebook: 'Have a look, all the English papers will talk of me 
tomorrow. The crazy wolf Kurdish Turk who covered London in blood.

'The knife is ready, you know I’m handy with a knife, good with knives.'

Just hours later Gol returned to his marital home in Thame, Oxon., and stabbed his sleeping wife.

Miss Wilson had described to the 
court how she and her friend had rushed upstairs to help.She said: 'I 
could see she had her hands up and one of her legs up.'Ensar had his hand up over her.'

Miss Wilson managed to pull the 
Turkish-born restaurant worker off her friend but was herself stabbed 
four times, one of the wounds missing her pulmonary vein by just a 
millimetre.

She managed to flee but tragically petite Julie was trapped in the house with her knife-wielding son-in-law, and eventually collapsed through a lack of blood at the foot of the stairs, curled in the foetal position and inches from the front door.

A post mortem examination revealed both women had died from the blood lost from their numerous stab wounds, most of which were dealt to their necks and chests.

Both women also had defence-type injuries to their hands.

Gol walked from the house into the town centre with the knife still in his hand and carrying his three-year-old daughter.

He went to a pizza restaurant just minutes after the killings in the early hours of September 4, last year, where Julie’s husband Mehmet Sahin was working and chillingly told him: 'You didn’t believe me but I did it.'

Gol had only been living in the UK for a month before the killings, but had wanted to return to Turkey.Michala had even bought him a ticket back to his homeland the week prior to her death, but then asked him to stay.

He had already moved back to Turkey on several occasions during the short marriage but always returned because of the two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
