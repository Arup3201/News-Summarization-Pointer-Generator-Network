He's got his clothes, his boots, his motorcycle and a whole lot more besides.

Meet the world's number one Arnold Schwarzenegger superfan - celebrating his muscle-bound idol’s 67th birthday by showing off his incredible $80,000 memorabilia collection for the first time.

Randy Jennings, 42, from Sacramento, California has been hopelessly hooked on Schwarzenegger films since sneaking into the cinema to watch Conan the Barbarian when he was 11-year-old.

The children’s book illustrator, who is married and has a five-year-old son, dedicates hours every day managing his Arnie 
fansite which currently attracts around 45,000 new followers every month.

The dedicated fan, said: 'My first introduction to Arnie was when I snuck into a showing of Conan the Barbarian when I was just eleven years old,' said Randy.

'It was exciting to see swords clashing and heads flying - he had huge muscles and didn’t say much.

'He was the ultimate action man who I wanted to become someday.

'I went from fan to superfan when I was 19 year-old. Terminator 2 had just been released and I started collecting all the memorabilia.

'A couple of friends and I decided to go and see Arnie at his home in Los Angeles.

'We waited until he rode out of his home on a Harley Davidson motorcycle just like the one in Terminator 2.

'Except, he had the lettering of the latest film he was promoting – Kindergarten Cop – written on his back.' 

Mr
 Jennings has collected over 40,000 Arnie-related objects for his 
Schwarzenegger man cave, has all Arnie films on video and DVD and has 
travelled over 30,000 miles in 17-years to promote Arnie to other fans.

Mr
 Jennings, who even has a Conan The Barbarian-inspired Arnie tattoo on 
his body, described the first time he ever spoke to his idol in 1992.

'I visited Arnie’s restaurant, Schatzi on Main, and saw him there with his wife Maria and two daughters.

'I had a drawing I made of Arnie as Conan the Barbarian and asked the waitress if she could take it over to him to sign.

'She insisted I go and ask him myself so I gathered the courage to go up to him.

'Both he and Maria really liked my drawing and the girls asked if I wanted to sit with them and colour with crayons.'

Since then Mr Jennings has spotted Arnie 60-times and struck up conversation with the 'Austrian Oak' as he is known, roughly twenty-times.  Arnold now knows him by name when they run into each other several times each year.

Mr Jennings has even penned a 180-page book called Arnold's Army about his Schwarzenegger encounters and about the entire fan community.

While he doesn't talk much about Arnold with his wife Sherry, Randy hopes his son, Winston, 5, will one-day take on the mantle of being the ultimate Arnie superfan.

'From the constant new hits my Arnie website generates, I know that his popularity is only increasing,' he said

'There is a new generation of fans discovering his movies and falling in love with them.

'I’m just glad to be a part of that.'
