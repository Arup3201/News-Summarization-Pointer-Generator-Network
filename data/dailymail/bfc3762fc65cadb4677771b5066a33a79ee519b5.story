Brendan Rodgers said this week that Steven Gerrard is 'arguably the best player who's ever played in the Premier League', but the Liverpool captain didn't make his manager's all-time XI in 2012.

Rodgers, who dropped Gerrard for Saturday's 1-0 win over Stoke, confirmed that the veteran midfielder has been offered a new contract at Liverpool and told reporters: 'I love working with Steven Gerrard, he's arguably the best player who's ever played in the Premier League.'

In April 2012 though, appearing as a guest on Match of the Day 3, Rodgers picked Paul Scholes and Roy Keane as his midfield duo in his all-time Premier League XI, with Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola playing slightly in front of the Manchester United pair.

Brendan Rodgers' all-time Premier League XI

Clarifying his selection, the then-Swansea manager said: 'I went for a sort of triangle in midfield with Scholes, who is one of the best passers of the ball in the duration of the Premier League.

'A wee bit of bite in there with Roy Keane: win it, give it.

'And I guy who invented for me what I call the Zola zone - that space in between the midfield and the front line. (It was a) tough choice between him and Bergkamp.'

Gerrard didn't get a mention.

Two weeks later, Rodgers brought the subject up again in an interview, heaping more praise on Scholes.

He told the Daily Star: 'I’ve loved watching him (Scholes). I’ve got such admiration for his game. He is a wonderful example of a British player.

'I was asked to pick my best Premier League team and he was the first player I picked – I can’t compliment him any higher than that.'

Less than a month after that interview Rodgers had left Swansea to take the job on offer at Liverpool.

Liverpool finished seventh in his first season in charge and second in May, coming agonisingly close to winning the title before Gerrard's unfortunate slip gifted Chelsea victory in a crucial game at the end of the season.

Clearly, Gerrard has done enough in the last two-and-a-half years to convince his manager that he should have been in that original XI.
