Investigators found two oxygen cylinders in the vehicle, one inside with the passengers and the other in the trunk.

Barnham was taken to Richmond hospital where he was treated and released. Brooks was transferred to another hospital where she remains in critical condition.

One of the survivors told police the interior of the vehicle caught fire after another passenger lit a cigarette.

'It was a pretty intense fire,' Wayne County Sheriff Jeff Cappa said.

He said the vehicle was so badly burned investigators could not get the vehicle identification number off it or even read the license plates.

The fire closed westbound lanes of I-70 near Centerville for around three hours on Sunday.

Indiana State Police assisted the Wayne County Sheriffâ€™s Office in the investigation, which is still ongoing.
