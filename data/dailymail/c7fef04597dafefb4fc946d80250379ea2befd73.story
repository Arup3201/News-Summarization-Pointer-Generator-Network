The World Health Organization (WHO) has admitted it botched attempts to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus and has pinned the blame on some of its own staff.

In a draft internal document, the WHO said it should have recognized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in West Africa because the health systems on the continent were broken.

In a blunt assessment of their own failings, the document said: 'Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.'

Dr. Peter Piot, co-discoverer of Ebola, said WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa office

It also said the heads of WHO country offices in Africa are 'politically motivated appointments' made by the WHO regional director for Africa, Dr. Luis Sambo, who does not answer to the agency's chief in Geneva, Dr. Margaret Chan. 

WHO is the U.N.'s specialized health agency, responsible for setting global health standards and coordinating the international response to disease outbreaks.

Dr. Peter Piot, the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, agreed  that WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa operation.

'It's the regional office in Africa that's the front line. And they didn't do anything. That office is really not competent,' Dr Piot said.

Dr Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also questioned why it took WHO five months and 1,000 deaths before it declared Ebola an international health emergency in August.

'I called for a state of emergency to be declared in July and for military operations to be deployed,' Dr Piot said. 

Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak of the deadly virus 

But he said WHO might have been scarred by its experience during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, when it was slammed for over-hyping the situation.

In late April, during a teleconference on Ebola among infectious disease experts that included WHO, Doctors Without Borders and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, questions were apparently raised about the performance of WHO experts, as not all of them bothered to send Ebola reports to WHO headquarters.

WHO said it was 'particularly alarming' that the head of its Guinea office refused to help get visas for an expert Ebola team to come in and $500,000 in aid was blocked by administrative hurdles. 

Guinea, along with Sierra Leone and Liberia, is one of the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak, with 843 deaths so far blamed on Ebola.

The Ebola outbreak has already killed 4,484 people in West Africa and WHO says within two months there could be new 10,000 cases of Ebola every week unless more measures to fight the outbreak are taken.

Ebola is a serious infectious illness which often proves fatal - It can take up anything from two to 21 days for humans with the virus to show symptoms

Other experts said it was impossible to predict that the initial Ebola cases in Guinea would spark the biggest-ever outbreak of the lethal disease.

'There were a lot of mistakes made by WHO but a lot of the best public health minds would have thought we could handle this in July,' said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.

'By the time we realized how bad things were, the genie was already out of the bottle,' he said.

Osterholm said the U.N. health agency was far from the only organization to blame.
