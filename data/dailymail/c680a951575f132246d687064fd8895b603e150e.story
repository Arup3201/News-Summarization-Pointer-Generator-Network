A group of Syrian children narrowly escaped a shell blast that exploded inches from where they were standing as they spoke about the horrors of living in a warzone.

The heart-stopping footage of the explosion in rebel-held Jobar, a suburb of Damascus, proves how close children come to death as research show thousands have been killed by shelling. 

The young children were talking about the horrible injuries they had seen and how they were used to bombs when the missile landed without warning.

The children in a Damascus suburb told the interviewer the horrific injuries they had seen and how they had become used to bombs moments before a shell landed centimetres behind them

The young children raise their hands and then dive to the ground as the shell explodes

The three youngsters - two boys and girl - were thrown to the ground as rubble and dust was sent flying into the air. 

The camera then shows two other young boys diving down and crawling away from the blast site behind them. 

The shocking video comes as politicians in Turkey and Iran call for a ceasefire in Syria before scheduled peace talks in January.

More than 11,000 children have now been killed in the three-year Syrian civil war according to a report by The Oxford Research Group think tank.

It said most were killed in explosions but some were tortured and then killed. 

The manner in which the children in the 
amateur video, filmed by the Baynetna organization, talk about death and
 explosions show how common they have become.

The footage begins with one of the children telling the interviewer about the bombs he has seen.

According to a translation by Channel 4 News, the boy in the cap says: 'We were walking the demonstration when a bomb fell on us and wounded a small boy.

'He was about the size of this girl.'

She then says: 'When we were at school, they used to show us lots of martyrs, one had his guts hanging out.'

Moments before the blast, the boy in 
the cap says: 'At first, the bombs scared us, but then we got used to 
it. I saw one persons head fall off. On another, it was his hand.'

The
 missile then strikes just behind them and as the camera shakes, two 
young boys are seen diving to the ground as rubble and dust is blasted 
into the air.

Fortunately all the children survived and are interviewed later inside.

One little boy dives to the ground while the other runs. All the children in the video survived

Their bikes that they had been playing with moments earlier are left behind as they run for safety

One little boy who had been seen leaping to the ground said: 'I dived to the ground. I don't know how.

'Like in a swimming pool. But a stone hit my hand and my cheek hit the pavement, and then we went inside.'

The boy in the cap was then asked what his mother did when she found out.

He replied with a smile: 'She started to cry.'

Today,
 Turkey and Iran's foreign ministers called for a ceasefire in Syria 
before peace talks scheduled in Geneva on January 22.

Turkey's
 foreign minister Ahmad Davutoglu and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad 
Javad Zarif held a news conference in Tehran today.

The six children were interviewed later on and asked about their escape from the blast

This little boy said he dived to the ground 'like in a swimming pool' when the shell landed close to them

Mr
 Zarif said: 'All our efforts are to end the conflict and for a 
ceasefire if possible, even before the Geneva 2 conference takes place.'

Mr Davutoglu said: 'We should not wait for this two months' before the peace conference convenes. 'The Syrian people are in a worsening situation.'

Iran and Turkey support opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, but the joint ceasefire call suggests the regional rivals are now more willing to work together.

Iran, which along with Russia is the main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has said it is prepared to take part in the Syria peace talks in Geneva if invited.

The Syrian government has said it will attend the talks but will not bow to Western demands for Assad to step aside.

Assad's opponents are divided over the peace talks. General Salim Idriss, who commands the rebel Free Syrian Army, said his group would not take part in them and would fight on regardless.
