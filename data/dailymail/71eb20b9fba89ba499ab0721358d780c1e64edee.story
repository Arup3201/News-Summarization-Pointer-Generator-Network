Questions have been raised over whether former NFL star Brian Holloway exaggerated damage caused by teenagers who held a party in his New York vacation home to help pay for repairs.

Eight people were charged and more than $20,000 of damage was alleged to have been caused at the rural retreat during an illegal Labor Day party.

But the former Patriots' Save the 300 campaign set up in the aftermath of the party is alleged to have been a way to raise money to repair the property before it was sold at a foreclosure auction.

Auction: Brian Holloway's New York vacation home was auctioned for $400,000 after damage caused by partying teenagers was repaired

In an article on Grantland, it is alleged that Holloway failed to clearly distinguish between damage caused by young party-goers, and wear and tear on the Stephentown property he had bought in 1981.

The 54-year-old was also accused of being uncaring about the online abuse teenagers at the party on his 200-acre property received after he shared details of their social media profiles online.

'It's not my responsibility. It's their parents' responsibility to get that handled. I would not want anyone to get hurt. And unfortunately, they put themselves in harm's way,' he told Grantland.

Holloway, who played offensive tackle for
the Patriots and Raiders in the 1980s, gained national attention by 
reposting party pictures the teenagers had put on social media websites.

He told Mail Online the allegations were 'nonsense, but expected,' and added that the campaign 'is growing in response to the global outrage from all over the world'.  

He
said he posted pictures of the teenagers involved on helpmesave300.com in an effort to 
get them to come forward, take responsibility for their actions and
change their behavior.

The motivational speaker also collected 
donations for theHMS300 campaign, named after the number of 
teenagers who allegedly partied at the property, and a breast cancer 
charity.

Damage: Holloway power washes graffiti in a barn. Some of it was allegedly painted on by friends of the footballer's children when they lived there

Dirty: Holloway arrived home to find his floor covered in booze and urine

Campaign: After his home was damaged Holloway encouraged the teenagers and other young people to help repair the damage

'Although there were many people who wanted the money to be directed to help repair some of the damage, because no kids or parents stepped up, we wanted to direct all the donations that came in to HMS300,' Holloway said, adding that he paid for all the repairs.

The father-of-eight wants to work with 
students around the U.S. to prevent flash parties from happening and to 
develop software that can help parents monitor their teenagers' social 
media activity.

'I have to take a stand against the urgent undertone of destruction that's happening in our communities,' Holloway said.

When the house was sold for $400,000 at a foreclosure auction at the end of October, and reports in local media claimed Holloway owed more than $1 million to the bank, concerns were raised that funds may have been used elsewhere.

The party-damaged home became a national story, but photos of graffiti, a smashed window, some of the damage to floorboards and a hole in the barn were later claimed to have been long-standing damage.

While some graffiti was done at the party 'The walls of the barn had been something of a running guestbook for the Holloway family - kids who visited the home would spray paint their names on the wall,' Grantland reported.

Holloway hit back at the allegations that he had used the party as a way to get help with repairs, saying he was 'totally blindsided by Berkshire Bank' when it refused to move back the auction date as he tried to come to terms with the break in and damage at the property.

Damage: Railings on the wrap-around porch had fallen into disrepair but Grantland alleged that reports of damage caused by the teenagers was exaggerated

The website article alleged that Holloway refused to answer when questioned about why donors to the breast cancer charity were asked to make checks out to Save the 300.

'The donation add on was in response to so many people from across the country who wanted to dosomething to help out and be a part. And we've raised about $12,000,' Holloway, who lives in Florida, told Mail Online.

'We also added a link for Breast Cancer, for those people that would want to make a donation directlyto Breast Cancer,' he added.

The
footballer, who lost his mother to breast cancer, said the link used 
for donations was the same used by the national cancer organization.

For now, Holloway's focus is back on raising his family, but he said he hoped to find a way to buy back his New York home, which is filled with family memories.

He is also upbeat about the future of the 300 Campaign, and has been meeting youth groups and universities to gather momentum behind the project.

'Over the next 90 days we will see the HMS300 campaign take on it's life and direction through the many people who want to use this as a spring board to save lives,' he told Mail Online. 'I'm basically the one driving it right now [but] I've got some great people in mind to help me put together a larger strategy.'

Holloway shrugged off the scrutiny of his campaign, saying: 'I'm not someone special. I'm just anotherperson who is joining with others to make a difference.'
