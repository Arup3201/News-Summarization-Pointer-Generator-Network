Premier League clubs backed chief executive Richard Scudamore to stay in office after the sexist emails scandal, despite David Cameron suggesting he could have been sacked.

An emergency meeting involving all 17 teams —  promoted clubs are not yet members of the top flight  — voted unanimously to support Scudamore. He will face no further action after his email exchanges with TV rights  lawyer Nick West.

This came after the Prime Minister was asked if ‘someone in your team could survive that sort of thing?’

‘No, I don’t think they would,’ said Mr Cameron on Radio 5 Live. ‘People should treat everybody else with respect.’

Criticism: Prime Minister David Cameron described sexist emails sent by Richard Scudamore as 'unacceptable'

'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel. These exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football, the workplace or in general. It is something that will never be repeated.

'The Premier League Shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and I fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions.

'I appreciate that I have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who I am and what I believe. So, I will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that I will continue to do my utmost personally, and through all the Premier League’s means to help promote diversity and inclusion, develop the women’s game and support women who want be involved in football at any level.

'I am grateful for the support I have received throughout this from family, friends and colleagues, but especially the women who work with me at the Premier League.'

Scudamore has now promised to meet 
with a wide range of stakeholders to discuss equality issues.

He said: 
‘Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I
 have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel. These exchanges do 
not reflect my views.

‘I 
have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the 
game who do not know me that my work in the areas of equality and 
discrimination reflect what I believe.

‘I will undertake meetings to reassure them that I will do  my utmost to help promote diversity and inclusion.’

But
 this pledge is unlikely to satisfy bodies such as Women in Football, 
Kick It Out, and the FA’s inclusion advisory board, who have led the 
storm of protests since Scudamore’s temporary PA, Rani Abraham, went to a
 Sunday newspaper with the email exchanges.

How they were obtained might still be the subject of  a complaint by Premier League clubs to police.

The
 pressure groups are now likely to concentrate their attack on the 
Premier League’s governance process which saw Premier League interim  
chairman Peter McCormick, a shooting pal of Scudamore’s, leading the 
investigation that concluded yesterday.

Lord
 Herman Ouseley,  chairman of Kick It Out, said: ‘The process adopted by
 the  Premier League is a flawed one and there was only ever going to 
be one outcome.

Important role: Scudamore presented Man City players with their Premier League winners' medals

‘It is 
incumbent on the PL to put in place a proper, objective, fair and 
independent process for dealing with such important matters in future.

‘The Prime Minister stated he wouldn’t tolerate these comments in his own Cabinet.

‘A decision like this and the way it was made reflects the dominance, strength and culture at the top of the football pyramid.’

A meeting of the Premier League’s four-strong audit and remuneration committee had been scheduled to decide Scudamore’s fate.

Instead a meeting, chaired by McCormick, took place at their Gloucester Place offices.

McCormick
 had carried out an investigation in conjunction with law firm Harbottle
 & Lewis, specifically appointed for this. The Premier League 
investigation found no evidence of a wider discriminatory attitude or 
inappropriate language.

Pressure: Rabbatts believes Scudamore should consider his position at the Premier League

And
 Peta Bistany — the  senior female executive  nicknamed Edna in the 
exchanges — confirmed she was not then, and is not now, offended by the 
references.

A Premier League
 statement said: ‘The weight of comments made by female staff indicate 
that they find the Premier League an excellent place to work.

'In the 
light of a previously unblemished record over 15 years of service to the
 Premier League, the clubs resolved unanimously that no further 
disciplinary action is required.’
