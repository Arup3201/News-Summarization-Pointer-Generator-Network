An entertainment industry maven is being sued by his ex-mistress, who says she traveled to the U.S. to be with him after he promised to divorce his wife and take care of her for the rest of her life - then split with her.

Ted Cohen, a 65-year-old music industry icon who's worked in senior positions at EMI, Warner Bros. Records and Philips Media and is currently the managing partner of TAG Strategic met Deborah Sass in 2006.

According to TMZ, Sass, an Australian, was living in London at the time, and the two embarked on an affair before Cohen told Sass that if she moved to Los Angeles, he'd divorce his wife and care for Sass for the rest of her life.

Sass accordingly shifted her life to LA where Cohen furnished her with a home and a Mercedes Benz.

Cohen filed for divorce from his wife, as promised.

But the cracks began appearing when Sass began working for Cohen's company, TAG Strategic.

According to TMZ, she says she ran the company, pulling 70-hour work weeks but not receiving a salary.

Payday: Cohen allegedly had Sass running his company in LA but didn't pay her a salary

Cohen allegedly told her she didn't need one, because he was taking care of her.

By the end of 2012, Cohen's divorce was still not final, reports TMZ.

The pair began to argue and eventually split up in 2012.

Now, Sass wants Cohen to make good on his promise that he'd take care of her for the rest of her life.

She also wants what she is owed in income from her time at TAG Strategic.

She's suing for 50 per cent of Cohen's income, according to TMZ.

Sass's Facebook account shows that she became engaged to another man in May of this year.
