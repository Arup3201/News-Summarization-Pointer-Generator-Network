Supporters will march on the Premier League and Football League headquarters on Thursday as fury grows over the absurd cost of tickets.

A crowd of several hundred exasperated fans is expected to join representatives from the Football Supporters’ Federation as they seek to lower prices. Kevin Miles, chief executive of the FSF, claimed: ‘Nine out of 10 fans think football’s too expensive.’

Citing the Premier League’s current £5.5billion broadcast bounty, up £2.1bn on the previous agreement, Miles added: ‘Football is swimming in money, with clubs pocketing record amounts from broadcasting deals while squeezing supporters with high prices. Something has to give. Supporters have to speak up about this.’

Anger: Football supporters at the Emirates protest against the rising price of tickets

Sportsmail understands that representatives from the Premier League will meet with select supporters in London. But the authorities will lack significant power to act as prices are dictated by the clubs.

This season only Manchester United, Chelsea, Sunderland, Swansea, West Brom, Tottenham and West Ham froze their season-ticket prices, while Newcastle marginally reduced their price.

The average low-price adult season ticket in the Premier League is now £526 (an increase of 6.5 per cent) and the average top-price is now £870 (an increase of seven per cent).

A statement on the FSF website said: ‘The increase in Premier League media rights alone could have led to all 20 clubs letting in every supporter for all 38 games for free last season without being any worse off than they had been the season before.’

A Premier League statement released last night said: ‘Ticket pricing is a matter for individual clubs, many of which work hard to fill their stadiums with offers that make top-flight football accessible to large numbers of fans.’
