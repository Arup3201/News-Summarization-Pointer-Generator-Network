Like the 'selfie' or searching for one’s own name on Google, it has become something of an irresistible – and very modern – pastime.

A study claims that we have become a nation of property price junkies, increasingly addicted to checking the value of our own homes.

The phenomenon is now so widespread it has been dubbed the new ‘property porn’ – and, for some homeowners, has even become a daily obsession.

The average estate agency branch has just 42 homes to sell compared to 100 homes in 2008

Up to a quarter in some parts of the country religiously check and recalculate the value of their property every week on the internet.

In total, almost a third who own a property check its worth at least once every two months, an ICM survey found. Experts said with house prices now so variable, homeowners are becoming increasingly paranoid about getting a bad deal should they decide to move.

But for the most part, they are addicted to the thrill of discovering the price of their home has gone up.

‘Monitoring property prices is a bit like watching bamboo grow. You can see it shooting up in front of you,’ said estate agent Russell Quirk.

‘As property prices rocket, homeowners are becoming addicted to finding out how much asset-richer they are getting. It’s a new variant of property porn.’

Feeding homeowners’ ‘addiction’ are the increasingly easy methods to get a reliable indicator of values, such as property websites, smartphone apps and the Land Registry.

The National Association of Estate Agents say the housing market is being crippled by the lack of available homes to buy

This is reflected in the huge traffic to websites such as Zoopla, which attracts 20million visits per month. It and the two other biggest such sites, Rightmove and Prime Location, are used by 61 per cent of house hunters.

The survey, commissioned by online estate agents eMoov, found 30 per cent of homeowners across the UK check the value of their property once every two months.

Among male homeowners, the figure is 34 per cent. The most obsessed live in London, where 57 per cent check every two months and 24 per cent recheck the prices every week.

The next most obsessed region is the North East, where 36 per cent check the values every two months and nine per cent every week.

Research manager Robert Cross, from Forest Gate, East London, said he looks at the value of his home as often as every day. ‘I bought my three-bedroom property in 2011 for £285,000. The price has risen by about £90,000,’ he said. ‘I check every day in my lunch break. It helps me work out changes to our equity.’

Jane Holbrook, a recruiter, said: ‘We bought a two-bedroom flat in London in early 2007 for £290,000. I probably re-calculate the value every week or two. In this market it can become a bit addictive.’
