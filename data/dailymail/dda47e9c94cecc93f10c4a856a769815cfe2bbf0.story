Jose Alvarenga's much anticipated press conference in Majuro was cut dramatically short today after doctors said he was not feeling well and would have to remain in their care.

His planned flight out of Majuro to Mexico tomorrow has been postponed for at least four or five days until doctors decide he is well enough to travel.

Alvarenga said very few words through interpreter Sean Cox.

Castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga has been taken ill during a much-anticipated press conference in Majuro today. Doctors have postponed his flight home to Mexico, scheduled for tomorrow, for at least four or five days

He said: 'I thank the government of the Marshall Islands and all my friends who have helped me on the way and especially Mr Damien Jacklick', who is the head of the immigration department.

Officials said Alvarenga's paperwork had also not been finalised.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Phillip Muller said: 'The investigation is ongoing to verify the story of how he (Alvarenga) got to the Marshall Islands.

'I won't give you all the details, but we will eventually tell everybody. So far the story has been substantiated.'

His hair tamed and beard shaved, the 37-year-old had to be supported as he arrived at the press conference

He made no further comment and did not explain why an investigation was still continuing.

Officials said it was likely that Alvarenga would not be able to travel until at least Monday - and there was the added problem of finding an official to fly with him.

An official from the Mexican Embassy in Manila who was due to leave with Alvarenga tomorrow (Fri) will now have to return to the Philippines on Saturday, leaving the question open of who will travel with the fisherman.

It is understood he will fly from Majuro to Honolulu, then on to LA before flying direct to El Salvador.

As Alvarenga does not have a passport, he will need special paperwork to be allowed to enter US territory en route to El Salvador.

The man who has made headlines around the world washed up on the remote Marshall Islands, 8,000 miles from where he originally disappeared in a small fishing boat, on Monday.

He has told of starving on his broken-down fishing boat, living on the flesh of tiny fish and turtles, and drinking the blood of sea birds, turtles and even his own urine.

He said he had been drifting for 14 months, after his engine cut out in September, while he was on a fishing trip with a friend.

Wearing nothing but a pair of torn shorts, the sailor and his battered 23ft boat washed ashore, 8,000 miles from his home in El Salvador, on the remote coral Ebon atoll.

New pictures of the 37-year-old emerged, showing Alvarenga four days after he washed ashore on the remote Ebon atoll.

Despite stumbling through the surf to reach the beach semi-naked and wearing nothing but a tattered pair of shorts, four days later the father-of-one appears the picture of health.

Washed and clean, he showed no signs of a man who had endured a grueling 14 months at sea.

Yet on Monday when he was revealed to the world, Alvarenga looked, arguably, in a worse condition.

Today it emerged the Castaway fled his home on the Pacific coast of El Salvador 12 years ago after he was stabbed in a brutal bar fight.

This was one of the first pictures of Alvarenga, taken after he was revealed to the world on Monday. He washed ashore in the Marshall Islands days earlier, after surviving 14 months drifting at sea

This picture shows Alvarenga looking healthy and clean just four days after he was washed up on the remote coral Ebon atoll. He looks arguably better than when he arrived on the mainland on Monday to face the world's cameras

While out drinking in the village of 
Garita Palmera, Alvarenga got into an arguement with four men and was 
stabbed, punched and kicked to the point his family feared he would not 
survive.

After 15 days in 
hospital he made an incredible recovery. But, terrified his attackers, 
who lived locally, would target him again he fled the country, deeming 
it too dangerous for him to stay.

He left his wife Arely Barrera and the couple's 18-month-old daughter Fatima at home. Fatima, who is now 13 years old, has no memories of her father and said meeting him would be 'awkward' having spoken to him for the first time on the phone a few days ago.

After crossing the Guatemalan border by bus, Alvarenga settled in the Mexican State of Chiapas where he worked as a fisherman.

It was in September 2012, that Alvarenga set off for that fateful day's fishing with his friend's son, Ezekiel in their 23ft boat.

Speaking through an interpreter Alvarenga said: 'It broke down and we started drifting.

'We
 were lucky that we had already caught two sharks that day and we were 
able to eat them for a time but then they went bad and we had to throw 
the carcasses overboard.'

It emerged Alvarenga fled his El Salvador home after he was stabbed and brutally beaten to within an inch of his life during a bar fight. He left his wife Arely and their young daughter Fatima

Fatima has never met her father, she was a year and a half when Alvarenga left El Salvador for Mexico, where he found work as a fisherman

He said his companion, Ezekiel had died after the pair drifted for four months.

'My friend tried to drink the blood of turtles but he kept being sick because it disagreed with his stomach,' he said.

When
 it came to the time when his young friend died and he had to lower the 
body overboard, he shook his head, indicating it was a moment he did 
want to recall.

The boat's deck, he said, was triangular and on it was what he said was a large box, although he was vague when it came to describing it exactly.

He said: 'I would get under the box to stay out of the sun, but it was also there that I prayed. I prayed and prayed to be saved. I am not a Catholic but I do believe in God. He sent food to me all the time.

'I caught small fish by putting my hands in the water and wriggling my fingers. This attracted the fish and I was then able to grab them.'

In what he said was a sign from God, after the many months at sea he woke one morning and saw a bird sitting on the edge of the boat.

The 23ft fishing boat Alvarenga claims to have lived on, surviving 14 months drifting through the Pacific

The family of Alvarenga's companion Ezequiel Cordoba, who died after four months at sea. Alvarenga said Cordoba starved to death as he was unable to stomach their diet of turtle's blood and raw fish

The family of Ezekiel Cordoba have demanded answers as to how the 24-year-old died. His brother Romeo Cordoba, pictured, has called for Alvarenga to be brought back to Mexico to be quizzed

'I crept very quietly to it and I was able to catch it. I broke off its head to drink its blood as I had been doing but as I was doing that, as I was tilting my head back, I saw land. It was the first land I had seen.'

He was able to half swim, half stagger, through the shallow water and collapse on the beach. 'It had taken me a long time to reach the beach and it was then early evening. I fell asleep immediately.'

But the family of Ezekiel Cordoba have demanded more answers as to how the 24-year-old perished.

His brother Romeo Cordoba, 29, has called for Alvarenga - nicknamed La Chancha - to be brought back to Mexico to answer questions.

He told The Telegraph: 'We ask the authorities to bring the shipwrecked man, La Chancha, back here or take some of us to meet him, so we can find out was it really our brother who he is talking about.

'If it is, why did he die? Why wouldn't he eat raw fish and birds? What did he do with his body? There is a lot of confusion and we want to hear it from La Chancha.

'It's a miracle that La Chancha survived at sea for 14 months, and we feel no anger towards him. We understand this was an accident and how dangerous the sea can be.

'But we need confirmation from him before we can accept his death.'
