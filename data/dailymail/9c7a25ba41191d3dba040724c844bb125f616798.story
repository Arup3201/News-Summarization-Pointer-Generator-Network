A dedicated animal lover has set up a unique business baking cakes for dogs.

Rio Sopp, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, bakes a mouth-watering array of sponge cakes, cookies, muffins and cupcakes specifically designed for man's best friend.

While standard human cakes made with sugar and chocolate could be harmful to our dogs and other animals, these cakes look like the real deal but with pet friendly ingredients - and dogs everywhere can't stop drooling over them.

Rio bakes sponge cakes, cookies, muffins and cupcakes and has even tried most of them herself

Rio, 22, says she was inspired to set up her business when she struggled to find a birthday cake for her pet horse - and realised thre was nothing that looked like a birthday cake but was safe to eat

And it's not just dogs that have gone barking mad for Rio's creations - the cakes are suitable for most animals including cats, rabbits, horses, and incredibly, humans too.

Rio even uses her fussy Great Dane, Shi, as the number one taste tester for all her products.

Rio, 22, said: 'I love making cakes for animals. It's really challenging to find all the right ingredients, but as soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you've slaved over, it makes it all worth while.

'I always test out the products on my dog, and I take some down to the local animal rescue centre too - they're very honest critics.'

The mother of one set up Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery after struggling to find suitable birthday treats for her pets.

'It was my horse's birthday and I was trying to find a birthday cake for her.

'I was looking around for ages and there just wasn't anything available that would look like a birthday treat, but be safe for him to eat.

After its initial success- with both pets and owners, Rio is now planning to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes

Since launching her business Rio has been inundated with orders for personalised birthday cakes

Though Rio has tried most of what she makes, she confesses she has not plucked up the courage to try her chicken and cheese cookies

After posting a picture of the cake on Facebook, Rio began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too

'In the end I decided to make one myself and after searching online I found a recipe for a yummy equine meadow cake.

'It was basically just the same as a carrot cake but with a few extra types of fruit and other pet-friendly ingredients.

'I remember thinking how easy it was to make and I wished that there were more products out there.'

After posting a picture of the cake on Facebook, Rio began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too.

'That's when I realised that there was obviously a demand for these types of treats, so I set up Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery' said Rio.

'When I told my partner, Chris, about it he was really supportive, although he definitely thought I'd gone a bit mad.

'My family are all as animal mad as me though, so they thought it was a great idea.'

Soon word got around about Rio's innovative new business, and the order started rolling in for personalised birthday cakes, doggy cookie platters and Easter hampers for pets.

The Old MacDonald's bakery will bake nearly anything an owner desires for their much loved furry friend

You can order a platter selection of goodies, should you chose to throw a party for your canine companion and invite his friends

'It was really exciting when people started ordering things, and now I get lots of commissions every week.

'The most popular thing at the moment is the hampers for the dogs which include cakes and biscuits but I'm always experimenting with new ideas.

'I tend to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits.

'So far my dog seems to think the carrot cake is the best, but she turned her nose up at the apple cake - that was a bit of a disaster.'

Rio has to be especially careful that none of the ingredients are harmful for the animals, as well as keeping them healthy.

Rio says of her venture: 'As soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you've slaved over, it makes it all worth while'

Rio says she tends to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits to get many different flavours and varieties

Any chocolate that I use to decorate products is 100 per cent dog-friendly and I always have my long list of things that are poisonous to animals close by to ensure every item is safe.

'For example dogs can't eat raisins or grapes so they're never included in the things I bake.

'The treats are really healthy too. I don't put any sugar in them because you can use fruit to make the cakes and cookies sweet, and all the butter is unsalted.

'The icing is all made out of fat-free soft cheese with food colouring.

And as any good chef does, Rio tries out all her products to ensure they're just right for her pampered pets.

The cookies might be favoured by dogs, but they would also suit a human dieter as they contain no sugar- with all the sweetness coming from the fruit

Judging by the reaction of these two customers, it is easy to see why Rio's bakery has gone from strength to strength

'I have tried the horse cake, dog cake and dog muffins, which were fine for humans, too - just not as sweet as ours.

'The only thing I haven't tried are the chicken and cheese cookies - although they're my dog's favourite.'

Rio now plans to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes.

'The next thing I'd like to try is pet friendly pastry. I want to start making cheese straws and sweet pastry too.

'It's really exciting, I can't wait to see how the new recipes turn out.'More information about Old Macdonald's Pet Bakery can be found at https://www.facebook.com/OldMacdonaldsPetBakery
