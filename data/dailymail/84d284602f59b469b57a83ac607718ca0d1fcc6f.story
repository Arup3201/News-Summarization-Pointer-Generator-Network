Four-time Formula One world champions Sebastian Vettel visited Red Bull Racing's factory in Milton Keynes to say his goodbyes having joined rivals Ferrari for next season.

The 27-year-old visited their base to make a speech to staff and thank those who made his four consecutive world titles victories between 2010-13 possible.

Vettel took time out to chat with members of staff at the team factory and signed numerous autographs, having announced his departure towards the end of last season when he relinquished his title to Lewis Hamilton.

Vettel received a pair of red Speedos and one of his championship-winning cars amongst his leaving presents.

With the official expiry of his Red Bull contract last Friday, Vettel has since wasted no time in integrating himself into Ferrari's world. 

But the four-times champion still had his goodbye bash to attend with Red Bull, which in true German style included large pretzels and hot chocolate.

After speeches from team principal Christian Horner and chief technical officer Adrian Newey, and several rounds of applause, Vettel said: 'You're not making this any easier.'

Vettel added: 'The last six years have been incredible. What we've achieved, the work that's gone in.

'So much passion, so much dedication. It will always stay in my heart. Big, big thank you to everyone.

'In the end we had the better car because we were the better team.

'Thank you really doesn't really describe enough what I feel. There's a lot of happy memories from this place that I'm holding onto.

'It's been a great journey and I'm very grateful for what all of you did for me - I'll shut up now!' 

The German has signed a three-year deal with Ferrari to replace the departing Fernando Alonso next season.

Vettel spent the weekend at Ferrari's base in Fiorano on their private circuit, driving the 2012 model car and completing over 100 laps.

Ferrari finished a dismal fourth overall this season, their first since 1993 without a race victory, and will hope the arrival of Vettel will signal a return to their glory days.
