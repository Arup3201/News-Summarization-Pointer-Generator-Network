Thirty-something men invest more in beauty products than any other age group, spending three times more on anti-ageing beauty and indulgent treatments than going the gym.

These metrosexual men spend more on male grooming products than those in their 20s and 50s combined, research reveals today.

Pressures to maintain their looks paired with the influence of well-groomed celebrities such as Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt are thought to have led to the recent increase in spending habits.

The average 30-something man now admits to spending over £100 per month on expensive eye creams, luxury moisturisers and trips to the spa, which is three times as much as a standard gym membership.

Of the 1,000 British men surveyed by Debenhams, those aged between 20-29 spent on average £35 per month on grooming products.

The figure doubled for males in their 40s who spent an impressive £70, while those in their 50s seemed to have a more relaxed approach to male grooming at around £45 per month.

The survey also revealed that men in their 30s were willing to spend up to £50 on a moisturiser and up to £40 on wrinkle busting eye creams.

Clinique's Age Defence for Eyes, Elemis Deep Cleansing Facial Wash, Clarins Moisture Balm and YSL's Touche Éclat were rated as the most wanted beauty products.

Women, in turn, reportedly spend just £11.12 on a moisturiser on average, according to a Superdrug study from September.

Male respondents to the latest research also confessed they would purchase a male grooming product if it was endorsed by a celebrity with David Beckham, 38, ranking the highest in terms of influence.

'Our survey shows there is a steady increase in male grooming spending habits over the years.' said a spokesperson for Debenhams.

'In
 your teens, grooming consists of a splash of water with a hint of soap -
 if you're lucky. The introduction of electrical shavers and on the spot
 treatment products in your mid-late twenties means there is a definite 
increase in spending.

'But
 it's all change as soon as you hit your 30's when the focus shifts to 
products that maintain and prevent and money is no object. The spending 
cycle declines at 50, almost returning to the amount spent in your 20's 
as grooming takes a back seat and is seen as less of a priority and more
 of a necessity.'

The male UK skincare market is worth an estimated £600m and beauty experts at Debenhams believe this figure is set to rise as the festive season approaches and men scramble to look their best for office Christmas parties.

'The stigma associated with male grooming has finally disappeared and men are not only willing to spend money to maintain their looks, they are also recommending products to one another and frequently visiting salon's and spas, sometimes in groups'

'With the festive season drawing near, you will see a definite shift in the way men present themselves, look out for extra groomed eyebrows, glowing, flawless complexions and manicured nails.'

British men are spending more time and money glamming up this party season than women.

According to a new study by Travelodge, out today, men will be splashing an average £78.24 on grooming, clothing and beauty products for their festive night out - including make-up. Women are spending just £72.72 in turn.

Men confessed they will also invest one hour and 28 minutes sprucing themselves up ahead of their big Christmas night out, whilst women will take just one hour and 16 minutes.      

One in ten men will wear make-up and 70 per cent of those will be using concealer

The study surveyed 2,500 British adults and found as 76 per cent are set to party this December - with the average reveller going to three Christmas dos.

British men will be spending £35.49 on beauty products and treatments, more than women who will be forking out £34.15. 

More than one in ten (11 per cent) of British men are planning to wear make-up at their Christmas party this year - with 70 per cent of these men reporting that they will be using concealer.

Another 61 per cent of make-up wearing men reported that they will be using lip gloss or balm.

More than half (51 per cent) of make-up wearers will be using eyeliner in order to look good.

Over a third (34 per cent) of men surveyed reported that they will be using a fake tanning product or have a spray tan to help them look healthier during the Christmas party season.         

The research also revealed that Northern men are the vainest when it comes to looking good at the Christmas party.

Newcastle males will be spending the most money this party season, splashing an average £89.68 to look good for their Christmas party, and spending over an hour and a half getting ready.

When it comes to spending time in front of the mirror, men in Manchester are the fussiest, taking one hour an 41 minutes to get ready. Mancunian men are also the most likely to wear make-up, with 14 per cent saying they will use some form of make-up this Christmas.
