A U.S. soldier flew halfway across the world from Afghanistan to New York to surprise his daughter at her graduation.

Ruby Robinson burst into tears as she was congratulated by her father Captain Keith Robinson following his last minute dash from his station in the Middle East to Columbia University.

Dressed in his army fatigues and carrying a bouquet of flowers, Capt Robinson hugged his daughter in front of the cheering crowds during the ceremony.

The touching moment was captured on video, as Capt Robinson told his daughter 'I am so proud of you' and kissed her on the forehead.

Computer science graduate Miss Robinson, 22, told an interviewer from Columbia University: 'To have him here in the flesh means so much to me.

'I didn't expect it at all, I didn't think it was possible so I'm so happy about it.'

Capt Robinson, who has been deployed in Afghanistan for the last six months, had told his daughter about two weeks before her graduation that he would not be able to make it.

He said: 'We talked about two weeks ago and I think we came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to make it.Â

'And then about a week ago when my 
general went to work and started to try and make this happen for me 
everything happened really fast.'

Capt Robinson had to take a 14 and a half hour flight from Kuwait to Washington D.C., another three and a half hour flight to Denver before a quick turnaround and a flight to New York the following day.

He said: 'I haven't had time to stop and think about it myself but when I saw her it was all worth it.'
