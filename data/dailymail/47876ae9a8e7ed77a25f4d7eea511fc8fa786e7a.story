Icebound: The ship will be stuck until the ice thins but experts claim the situation was 'easily predictable'

An experienced polar explorer has accused climate scientists who hired a ship now trapped in Antarctic ice of endangering passengers and crew – by carrying out the expedition ‘on the cheap’.

Dozens of scientists, journalists and tourists were evacuated by helicopter from the stricken Russian vessel Akademik Shokalskiy on Thursday after it became stuck on Christmas Eve.

The ship was being used by the expedition to follow the route taken by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson in 1912.

The team intended to repeat measurements taken by Mawson and so study environmental change over the past century.

But their ship is classed as ‘ice-strengthened’, which means it cannot break ice sheets and can operate only in light ice.

Robert Headland, of Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute, blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘easily predictable’ sea ice.

Mr Headland, who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going, said: ‘The expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks.

‘The team were in an area where it is common for ice to suddenly build up and instead of using an icebreaker, they used an ice-strengthened ship, which is totally unsuitable.’

It is estimated the rescue, after several failed attempts, will have cost £220,000, a bill which is likely to be paid by Australian taxpayers.

The 22 Russian crew members are still on board after the remaining 50 tourists were rescued on Thursday

The 22 Russian crew are still aboard and have to wait until the ice thins before they head home.

An expedition spokesman said that it ‘involved two years of planning, with excellent preparation. Any risk to lives was minimal’.
