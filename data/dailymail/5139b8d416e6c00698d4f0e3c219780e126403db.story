Kell Brook is ready for his return to the ring just six months on from the machete attack that threatened his life - and he has eyes on the winner of the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao mega-fight later in the year.

Brook was left needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after an unprovoked attack in Tenerife last year but is now suitably prepared to defend his IBF welterweight championship on his hometown return at the Sheffield Motorpoint Arena on Saturday.

And Britain's most recent world champion showed off his scars in the ring as he counts down the days to his comeback appearance against Romanian mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan.

Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, or that he would be unable to walk ever again

Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, with blood spurting from his leg - and later admitted that he believed that he may not have been able to walk again.

Now, once Brook has completed the first step in his comeback, he intends to take on the winner of May's Mayweather-Pacquiao contest after watching them go head-to-head at Las Vegas' MGM Grand.

He has ruled out fighting fellow Brit Amir Khan in order to focus on facing the winner of the fight of the century. 

Brook says a fight with Amir Khan is not appealing to him now, and he wants to take on a 'massive name'

'I think the Amir Khan fight is gone for this year,' Brook said. 'I'm the world champion and I will fight some other massive name. I'm not interested in what he does next now.

'It makes sense to do a unification fight. No contact has been made yet with either of them (Mayweather or Pacquiao) and I'm just focusing on my mandatory challenge at the moment, but I want to be involved in the big fights.'

Brook had previously talked up the chances of fighting Khan at Wembley Stadium but with all eyes on the Mayweather-Pacquiao contest, which Brook will be attending, his attention has been diverted elsewhere.

'I want Mayweather,' he said. 'I want the best pound-for-pound fighter that everyone has titled him as. I want to fight the very best - I'm in my prime, I'm unbeaten, I'm world champion.'

Brook had won his world title with a win over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles just weeks before the attack
