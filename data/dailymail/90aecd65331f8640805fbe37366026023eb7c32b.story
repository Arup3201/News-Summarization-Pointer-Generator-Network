Former Newcastle favourite Steve Harper has called on the club’s fans to give rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick a rousing welcome when he makes his full home debut in Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby.

The 21-year-old has been passed fit for the visit of Sunderland after injuring his shoulder during Wednesday’s 4-0 defeat at Spurs.

Alnwick was to blame for two of the home goals but Harper feels criticism is the last thing the young stopper needs ahead of such a mammoth match.

‘Rather than criticism, Jak Alnwick needs a proper Geordie reception when he runs out to give him a lift,’ said Hull keeper Harper, who made 199 appearances for the Magpies.

‘Get behind the young lad by singing his name to pick him up and watch him grow in response to it.’

Had Alnwick been injured, Newcastle would have made an application to the Premier League to sign a goalkeeper on an emergency loan deal.

But midfielder Moussa Sissoko says the squad have every faith in the academy graduate.

‘It (mistake at Spurs) was nothing,’ he said. ‘We are not worried about it – anybody can make a mistake in a game. It’s okay, we have to forget about this. Jak is strong, he will be fine for Sunday.’

Meanwhile, Sissoko has made a point of assuring fans that the players are aware of the fixture’s importance, despite having lost the last three.

‘We know Sunday is a big game for us and for the city,’ he said.

‘You have to forget the 4-0 defeat against Tottenham and try to be ready for the Sunderland match because it is massive for us.

‘We know that we haven’t been good enough in the recent games against them.

‘I can assure the supporters we know what it means. Every player is ready.’
