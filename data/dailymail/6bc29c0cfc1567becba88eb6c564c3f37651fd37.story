A 66-year-old grandmother has admitted to setting 18 fires across southern Maine, saying she started the blazes because no one paid attention to her.

Carol Field, from Standish, Maine, set off on an arson rampage two years ago. Her targets included a 177-year-old historic church, empty structures, abandoned houses and 'fires on piles of twigs and brush,' according to her lawyer.

The Maine senior citizen said she started the 
fires because 'nobody cared about her or paid attention to her,' 
Cumberland County Assistant District Attorney Angela Cannon told the 
Portland Press Herald.

Guilty: Carol Field, 66, pleaded guilty to six counts of arson in connection to a string of 18 fires set 
over the past two years

No injuries resulted from the multiple blazes but structural damage to the church was valued at over $200,000. The impact from the smaller fires was not known.

Gasoline was used in all the arson attacks, and caused an explosion at one fire she started at a barn, with ammunition stored inside.

She pleaded guilty to six counts 
of arson this week but has not yet been sentenced.

Police began investigating the mysterious string of fires in 2010, when they first started, but did not get a lead until September 2011, when Ms Field's car was spotted driving away from one of the fire scenes and a witness provided police with her license plate.Â 

The elderly woman was arrested in September. She had initially maintained her innocence but later changed her plea to guilty.

Her lawyer claimed his client suffered 
from mental health problems but after a psychiatric evaluation, doctors 
gave her a clean bill of health.

They did say she suffer from anxiety and depression and she participated in therapy while incarcerated.

'She spent her life as a caregiver here,
so it's pretty hard for me to believe she would ever have any intent to
harm anyone,' her attorney, J.P. DeGrinney, said when she was arrested 
in 2011.

Field, formerly a nurse, most recently had worked at a sandwich shop.

Her criminal record includes a 
conviction for shoplifting, providing alcohol to a minor and 
impersonating a police officer, over 30 years ago.

Arrested: Carol Field was arrested in September 2011

Despite her guilty plea in the fire case, her attorney expects she may 
only be jailed for two years since no one was injured in the attacks.

Field's most damaging attack occurred in July 2011 at the Raymond Hill Baptist Church, a beloved, historic church in Raymond, Maine.

The fire began at the back of the structure and destroyed an electric organ and damaged the back of the sanctuary.

'For me, it's a house of prayer, a 
place of refuge. It's history,' church member Florence Whittemore said 
after the summer fire at the church, which only holds Sunday services in
July.

'So many people have loved this old church,' she added about the devastating impact.
