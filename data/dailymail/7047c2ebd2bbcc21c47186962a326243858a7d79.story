Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome was awash with colour with music blaring and sequins, feathers, glitter and skin in abundance as Carnival's main event defied a tropical deluge and other dramas gripping the nation.

Although the skies opened up about an hour ahead of the start of the all-night extravaganza, drenching revellers and performers and flooding streets around the arena, Rio's Mecca of Carnival.

Wildly costumed performers from six Samba schools packed the Sambadrome, where tennis ace Rafael Nadal was a star guest of the parade clad in a clear waterproof poncho.

Nadal, in town for the Rio Open tournament, was mobbed by the press during his 20-minute stay at the event where he showed some fancy samba-style footwork of his own among the performers with Spanish compatriot David Ferrer and Brazil's own former French Open winner Gustavo 'Guga' Kuerten.

The year's five-day-long Carnival celebrations, which also include some 450 alcohol-soaked street parties, or 'blocos,' comes as a welcome respite from the recent avalanche of bad news afflicting Brazil. 

In addition to near-constant reminders of the stalled economy, Brazilians are coping with a snowballing corruption scandal at the state-run oil giant Petrobras as well as the worst drought in 80 years in the southeast, which includes Rio and the country's industrial and business hub of Sao Paulo.

Some Carnival celebrations in smaller cities have even been cancelled because of the drought so Sunday's rains in Rio were widely welcomed, even if they were a hindrance to the city's biggest party.

Even with the skies opening up with torrential rain about an hour ahead of the start of the all-night extravaganza, the show went on

'It hasn't dampened the performers' spirits, and at least it's not so hot with the rain,' said Helio Abreu, a 53-year-old doctor taking shelter with his wife at a concession stand. 

'I know we need it, but to tell you the truth I really wish it had started on Ash Wednesday,' the last day of Carnival.

In Paraty, a colonial jewel of a city between Rio and Sao Paulo, Carnival was scaled down after a deadly shooting on Saturday night. 

One person was killed and nine others injured, including three tourists from Sao Paulo, in the shootout which erupted in the midst of a crowd of revellers in the historic downtown, according to local news reports.

Six samba schools were parading in Rio's Sambadrome on Sunday night, with each group required to get their thousands of participants and giant floats across the roughly 730 meter-long runway in under 82 minutes. Six other schools will perform on Monday, with all 12 groups vying for the title of the year's best.

Mangueira and Salgueiro were the biggest-name samba schools parading Sunday. 

Last year's champion, Unidos da Tijuca, is the last parade Monday, with the winning school announced later in the week.
