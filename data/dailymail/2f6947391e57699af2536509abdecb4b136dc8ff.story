The Yorkshire Building Society's 36 deals mean borrowers will need to save a deposit of £8,500 to buy a home at £170,000

The number of 95 per cent  mortgage deals on the market will surge today when one of  Britain’s biggest building societies unveils 36 different offers.

The Yorkshire Building Society’s deals mean borrowers will need to save a deposit of just £8,500 to buy an average-priced house at £170,000.

However, such loans are controversial because experts believe they contributed to the credit crunch by allowing people to borrow more than they could afford.

Banks stopped offering them during 
the financial crisis, forcing first-time buyers to find a deposit of 
around 20 per cent – or £34,000 for the average house.

Until today, Yorkshire insisted on a minimum deposit of ten per cent after scrapping 95 per cent mortgages in April 2008.

Last
 night, experts said the move would encourage more banks and building 
societies to offer the deals. Rivals HSBC, Santander and Barclays are 
already set to launch 95 per cent mortgages within weeks.

David
 Hollingworth, of independent mortgage adviser London & Country, 
said: ‘They are making quite a splash. They are not just dipping their 
toe into the market.’

In August 2007, the month that the credit crunch struck, there were 986 mortgage deals requiring a deposit of only five per cent, according to financial information firm Moneyfacts. Last month, there were just 42. Yesterday, there were 64 and today there will be 100.

The move by the Yorkshire comes weeks after the Government launched its Help to Buy scheme, which allows people to buy a home with a five per cent deposit, with the Government providing a guarantee to the lender of up to 15 per cent of the loan.

Two banks bailed out by the taxpayer, 
Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, have signed up. Until today, the best
 95 per cent deal was with RBS, which owns NatWest, which has a 
two-year, fee-free, fixed-rate mortgage at 4.99 per cent.

The new deals are available through various Yorkshire subsidiaries: the building society itself, Barnsley Building Society, Chelsea Building Society, Norwich & Peterborough and Accord Mortgages.

Yorkshire, which is Britain’s second-largest building society with 3.5million customers, has not joined the scheme and chief executive Chris Pilling said: ‘Our fundamental role as a building society is to support as many people as possible to achieve their aspirations to buy their own home.’

He said it was vital that loans were made in a ‘responsible and prudent way’.

However, Duncan Stott, from the campaign group Priced Out, said: ‘Small deposits mean huge amounts of debt need to be taken out to afford the UK’s sky-high house prices.

‘This is the last thing that Britain needs. The danger is that this will cause even more debt to flow into the housing market, pushing house prices up even further.’

Estate agents Savills has predicted that house prices will rise by a third over the next five years, in part because of the Help to Buy scheme and critics warn it is dangerous to push up prices by helping people on to or up the housing ladder without a dramatic increase in the number of homes being built.

The Yorkshire Building Society brands' deals add to the increasing competition in the 
low deposit mortgage market, writes This is Money editor Simon Lambert.

This has been opened up both by the Government’s 
Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme and cheap money being pumped through banks and building societies to borrowers through the Funding for Lending scheme.

Potential homeowners planning to take advantage of any of these new deals need to remember that both the Bank of England base rate and mortgage interest rates are at historically low levels.

Both will rise over the life of their home loan - making monthly payments more expensive.

Despite the renewed competition, rates on small deposit mortgages remain high compared to those where homeowners can put down a big deposit.

The lowest two-year fix for a five per cent deposit in this range is Yorkshire BS' 4.69 per cent deal, whereas HSBC will offer a borrower with a 40 per cent deposit a rate of just 1.49 per cent.

Yorkshire BS will offer a 5 per cent deposit borrower a five-year fixed rate mortgage at 5.09 per cent, which compares to its own rate of just 2.69 per cent for a borrower with a 35 per cent deposit.

But compared to the still relatively limited number of 5 per cent deposit mortgages on offer, the Yorkshire BS brands rates look good. They beat the Help to Buy rates offered so far by Halifax and RBS / NatWest across two and five year fixes.

However, hopeful homebuyers tempted by the idea of a 5 per cent deposit mortgage will welcome the extra choice, they may find themselves somewhat baffled by the bewildering array of rate and fee combinations and features such as cashback across the Yorkshire brands.
