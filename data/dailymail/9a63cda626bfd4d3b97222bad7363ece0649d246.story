Arrested: Luke McCullough, 18, who was captain of Manchester United's Academy squad, was caught on CCTV having sex with a young woman

A rising Manchester United star has been arrested for ‘lewd behaviour’ after allegedly having sex with a teenage girl in a doorway.

Luke McCullough, 18, who was last season's Academy captain, was seen on CCTV with the woman at 5am on Monday after a night out.

The Northern Irish defender - said by Old Trafford bosses to be the new Jonny Evans - allegedly got ‘overly amorous’ with the blonde.

The incident in Concert Square, a popular bar and restaurant district of Liverpool, will infuriate the club's senior manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.

He expects high standards of his young players and just last week banned all of his under-23s from driving flashy sports cars from new club sponsors Chevrolet.

During the incident, the smooching pair allegedly initially moved into a doorway semi-clothed, only for police to send a car to the scene.

The couple were spoken to, did up their clothes and walked away - but just a few yards away went into another doorway and carried on, police said.

Officers went back the scene and arrested both for public order offences. The woman received a police caution after admitting the incident.

The Northern Ireland youth captain and centre-back was held in police cells for several hours before being issued with a caution and sent home.

'They were all over each other and they 
just couldn’t help themselves. Officers told them to move on and they 
agreed but they didn’t get very far before they were at it again. We had no choice (but) to arrest them'

A police source said: ‘The pair of them were spotted on CCTV in a virtual state of undress but it was only when they move to a doorway we had to send a patrol out.

‘They were all over each other and they just couldn’t help themselves. Officers told them to move on and they agreed but they didn’t get very far before they were at it again.

‘We had no choice (but) to arrest them because all and sundry would have seen what they were up to. Why they didn’t just get a room is beyond us.’

A Merseyside Police spokesman confirmed an 18-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were arrested in Liverpool early on Monday morning.

He said: ‘Both were taken into custody and spoken to by officers before receiving a formal police caution for a public order offence.’

Manchester United call McCullough an ‘accomplished defender who is building his reputation as a powerful, commanding presence. ‘

The Portadown teenager joins a collection of Northern Irish players now at the club's Carrington training ground after arriving from Dungannon Swifts.

He was compared with Belfast-born United first-team player Jonny Evans after he became captain of the Academy side in the 2011/2012 season.

He was shortlisted for the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, in memory of the ex-United assistant manager from the Busby Babes era.
