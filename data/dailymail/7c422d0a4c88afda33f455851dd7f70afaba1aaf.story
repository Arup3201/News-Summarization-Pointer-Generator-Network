Sharing a kiss, this loved-up couple look to capture their happiness for the camera.

But their joy soon turns to absolute terror as two masked and bloodied men emerge from behind a photo booth curtain, shouting and screaming at the pair.

The couple suddenly become wide-eyed, with looks of absolute horror on their faces.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Scary: A TV station in the U.S. has carried out a prank on innocent members of the public who were trying to get their pictures taken in a photobooth

Frightened: As the couple kissed and prepared to have their pictures taken, two masked men appear either side of the both from behind the curtain, shouting and screaming. Cameras capture the couple's reaction

Prank: The girl screams in terror as the masked men shout at the pair

Thankfully, however, they were in no real danger.

They were the victims of a prank by an American TV station which targeted members of the public trying to get their pictures taken in a photobooth.

As reported by Peta Pixel, the innocent victims are filmed from inside the booth as they enter it to have their pictures taken.

As they begin to pose for the camera, the two masked men appear either side of the booth.

Posing: These two girls happily posed for the photograph, completely unaware of what was about to happen

Horror: But after the two men appear, their expressions completely change

Worried: They are pictured banging on the wire fence as the masked men shout at them

Joke: This is the photobooth which the pranksters used for their stunt

Gory: This image shows one of the pranksters in a blood-stained T-shirt

In some cases, they can be heard screaming 'Do you want to die'. They also prevent the occupants from escaping by placing a wire fence around it.

Understandably, the booth's occupants react with absolute terror - with many jumping up and down and screaming.

And the moment is captured on camera, showing how people react at a moment of absolute terror.

Innocent: This man entered the booth on his own, thinking he was about to have a photo taken

Terrified: But as the masked men appear, he jumps from his seat in terror. The pranksters block the occupant from escaping by placing a chain fence around the booth

Stunt: This picture shows how the men either side of the booth surrounded it with the fence. They even had what appear to be blood stains on their tops

Perhaps the best example from the prank shows a young man and his friend inside the booth.

As the two men approach from either side, the man is completely overwhelmed with fear.

His female friend quickly realises it is a prank, however, the boy jumps up and down screaming in fear of his life, completely unable to calm down for some time.

Good mood: These friends entered the booth happily, looking forward to having their picture taken

Hilarious: When the masked men appear, the young girl quickly seems to realise it is a prank. The boy, however, reacts rather differently

Funny: As the men push against the wire fence, the youngster jumps up and down, screaming hysterically

Upset: At one point, the boy is completely inconsolable
