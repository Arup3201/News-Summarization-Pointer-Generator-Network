Lurking: An alarming number of people take secret photos of good-looking strangers

Next time you are sitting on the train and the passenger opposite you gets their phone out, you might want to look the other way.

New research has suggested that nearly ten per cent of UK adults engage in the rather disturbing habit of surreptitiously photographing attractive strangers using their mobile phone.

And the locations for the these secretive snaps are diverse - ranging from the train carriage to the coffee shop to the doctor’s surgery.

The poll also found that seven million people have taken revealing pictures of themselves, putting them at risk of having their photos broadcast on the internet.

The research was carried out mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, who asked 2,076 Britons about their mobile habits.

Thomas Messett, head of digital marketing for Europe at Nokia, said: ‘Our research has given us a real insight into the ever-changing quirky habits of the British public.

‘It would appear that wiping your mobile phone pictures is a typical part of the digital break-up and gone are the days when people would burn photos of their exes.'

The research revealed that more than eight per cent of UK adults have photographed attractive strangers on public transport, in the park, in a coffee shop and even in the doctor's surgery, a new survey, according the a report int The Independent.

It also found that more than 90 per cent of people erase all photographs of their exes from their mobile phones to 'achieve closure'.

The survey also claimed that almost seven million Britons have admitted to taking an intimate picture of themselves and storing it on their phone, leaving themselves vulnerable to social media mishaps, researchers said

The survey also claimed that almost seven million Britons have taken an intimate picture of themselves and continue to store it on their phone, leaving themselves vulnerable to an accidental social media broadcast of the image.

Despite this relaxed attitude to taking intimate pictures, almost five million did admit to being worried that the embarrassing pictures could end up on their Facebook page.

More than a third of those questioned said they were more likely to take an intimate photograph of themselves because of the increased rise of smartphone cameras and improved picture quality.

A quarter, however, of those surveyed said they refuse to let their partners see the pictures on their smartphones.
