A nanny who worked next door to actor Stephen Collins and Faye Grant in the late 1990s has come out to describe the couple's 'odd' behavior

A Massachusetts woman who worked as a nanny in New York in the 1990s, in the same building as accused child molester Stephen Collins, has come out to tell of his strange daily visits in pajamas and reading his 'semi-pornographic novel'. 

The woman named Ilene called into Boston radio station  Mix 104.1 Wednesday morning, just after it was revealed that the  actor famous for his role on 7th Heaven had sexually abused at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13.

Ilene says she worked as a nanny for a family who lived next door to Collins and his estranged wife Faye Grant, when they lived in a 'beautiful' and 'affluent' Upper East Side Building in the late 1990s.  

'He used to come over for breakfast every morning, and have breakfast next door with us. Not too sure why, but he would show up in his striped pajamas.'

While Collins and his wife always seemed to be having problems, Ilene says they appeared to be loving and protective parents of their daughter Kate.

'I knew things weren't great between him and Faye... they were always in therapy and always threatening to leave each other. 

'But for their daughter - they were always there for her.'

When she read about Collins taped confession, released by TMZ yesterday, Ilene found it 'creepy' since she knew him as a father and family man.

'It was weird to me that he did that to other little girls as well and he was so close with his own daughter,' Ilene said. 

Ilene describes Collins and Grant as 'very nice parents' but 'very odd'. 

However, she says he never displayed any inappropriate behavior while she was around. 

'Your would never have known anything was going on,' she said.  

One thing that struck her as strange about Collins was the sexual nature of his two novels, which were quite a departure from the image he created playing Rev Eric Camden on 7th Heaven for more than a decade.

Ilene says she was given the opportunity to read his book Eye Contact before it was published and she found the writing to be 'semi pornographic'.  

I always thought it was weird that he wrote a pretty graphic novel. I thought that was a little odd because he didn't seem like that type of person when you knew him, but when you read the book you were like "wow this is pretty dirty,"' she said. 

Collins has written two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact (left) and Double Exposure (right). Both appear to have a sexual nature, according to summaries online

Collins has penned two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact and Double Exposure. 

Eye Contact is about a New York actress 'whose best performances are off-screen, in her dangerous relations with men' 

Meanwhile, Double Exposure brands itself as a novel about the private life of a TV critic who  has a 'five-year-old daughter, an angry ex-wife, and a very-soon-to-be-ex-fiancie, not to mention a come-hither co-anchor, and a beautiful brand-new neighbor who's alluring, available . . . and much, much more than meets the eye'.

Collins is currently under investigation by the NYPD in response to tapes released yesterday, in which he confesses to exposing himself and even touching at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both New York and Los Angeles. 

The LAPD is collaborating with New York authorities, but they initially closed their own investigation into Collins two years ago after receiving the tapes themselves and finding 'no verified victim'.

Collins is best-known for his rule as the Rev Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven. Pictured with the case above at the TV Guide Awards
