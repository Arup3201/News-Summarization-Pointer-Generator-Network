A group of lifeguards are being investigated for joking on Facebook about a young girl nearly drowning - with one even complaining she had to get her hair wet to save her.

One of the lifeguards at Basildon Sporting Village, Essex, posted a status update on her personal Facebook page to tell her friends how a little girl had nearly drowned three times in a single swimming lesson earlier that day.

But rather than sounding concerned about the child's welfare, the lifeguard moaned about how she had been forced to get her hair wet when she had to jump in to rescue her.

Her colleagues then left a series of comments on the post about the 'funny' incident - with one writing: 'Laugh, I’ve still got a smile on my face. 

Investigation: Lifeguards at Basildon Sporting Village in Essex are being investigated for allegedly joking about a young girl nearly drowning three times in a swimming class

'Our faces when we realised she was going down for the third time. Omg, best straddle jump I’ve seen in a while from you!! I’m laughing now, you made my day. What a giggle.'

Management company Sports and Leisure Management (SLM), which runs the pool under the name Everyone Active, has launched an internal investigation into the online chat.

The conversation on the social networking site starts with one member of staff writing how she never gets her hair wet unless swimming for her own fitness before boasting how she had managed to keep it 'bone dry' throughout the club's swimming lessons.

She then tells her friends how one of the pupils 'starts strugglin a bit too much' and she orders another member of staff to pull her out - presumably so she doesn't have to get wet herself.

But when the child nearly drowns a second time, she then complains that she was forced to intervene.

She wrote: 'Down she goes again but now I can see her eyes lookin at me under the water so in I go fully clothed and get me f** hair wet [SIC].'

Describing the moment the child sank for a third time, the same employee wrote: 'We give her a float off to the middle of the land she goes and sinks back in... We lift her out this kid aint goin in again nd I certainly aint f**** jumpin in again [SIC].'

The lifeguard adds that when she got out the pool, the other staff were laughing because she got wet, adding: 'im glad i gave you lot of f***** something to laugh about [SIC]'.

Facebook post: A female lifeguard posted details about the incident on her Facebook page - but appeared more concerned about getting her hair wet than the child

Her colleagues then left comments telling the lifeguard: 'I can’t believe the same girl was fished out three times lol [laughing out loud].'

A female pool worker then added: 'Absolutely fantastic rofpmsl [rolling on the floor p****** myself laughing].'

Another wrote: 'It's one of those moments that will make me chuckle when I close my eyes tonight and go to sleep. Definitely made my day.

'Makes me laugh that as swimming teachers we hate getting wet, and you end up soaked and hair wet twice in 5 minutes, classic'.

The pool, opened in 2011 as an Olympic training facility, was voted one of the top 50 places to swim in Britain in July 2012 by the Independent.

Children’s swimming lessons at the pool cost £45 for 12 weekly classes.

Olympic swimmers from Japan trained in the pool for three weeks last summer ahead of the London 2012 Games.

The Olympic Torch was carried through the interior of the swimming pool when the flame passed through Basildon last July.

Basildon Council said SLM was investigating the comments.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of a disciplinary issue following some comments by SLM staff on a private Facebook page and are satisfied SLM are dealing with it appropriately.'

A spokeswoman for SLM confirmed the probe was on-going.

She said: 'These matters are currently under internal investigation by the leisure centre.'
