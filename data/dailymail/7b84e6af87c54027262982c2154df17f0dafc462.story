Alan Pardew will invite Manuel Pellegrini for a post-match glass of wine in a bid to make peace with the Manchester City boss.

It was at St James’ Park last season that the Newcastle manager called the 60-year-old Chilean a ‘f***ing old c**t’.

Pardew was subsequently warned about his touchline conduct by the FA and vowed to punish himself by working in the local community.

The 53-year-old comes up against Pellegrini for the first time since on Sunday, and he said: ‘Do I have regrets? Of course, absolutely. Will I shake his hand? Absolutely.’

Pardew will offer his opposite number a drink in his manager’s office but believes modern-day media commitments will not allow them the time to do so.

‘He’s absolutely invited for a glass of wine afterwards, but those day are going, the time is so slim now with the number of jobs we have to do after the game with the media,’ he said.

‘Managers rarely see each other now. The staff have a drink (instead)’.

Pardew, though, has seen his media duties cut back by owner Mike Ashley, who is instructing his manager to only do what is contractually obliged.

That being the case, there may well be time for the pair to enjoy a glass of Chilean red on Sunday night just yet.

Best of pals: Pellegrini and Pardew may have a drink after Sunday's match but time constraints may dominate
