Vladimir Putin is to be challenged by one of Russia's richest tycoons in the Kremlin presidential election scheduled for March.

Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov - his country's most eligible bachelor - could present a real threat to the strongman premier if he can enlist the support of voters furious over ballot rigging claims in last week's parliamentary elections.

This came yesterday as the Kremlin's pollster abruptly stopped issuing figures for politicians' ratings, amid suspicions that Putin's showing has suddenly slumped.

'Society is waking up,' said the 6ft 8 inch businessman worth £11.5 billion of dramatic people power protests led by the disillusioned middle classes.

'I have made the most serious decision in my life. I am running for president.'

Fraud allegations: Russian PM Vladimir Putin's authority has been dented

The one-time street jeans-seller backed many of the anti-Putin slogans voiced at the demonstrations, he said.

Prokhorov, the 46 year old owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, declared he would run as Putin slapped down a fresh parliamentary poll, the key demand of tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets across Russia at the weekend.

Often seen with attractive women, Prokhorov was arrested at a French ski resort in 2007 on suspicion of making prostitutes available to guests. He spent several days in jail but was later cleared of all charges.

His big cash windfall came in selling the world's largest nickel mine in Norilsk.

Putin aide Dmitry Peskov claimed that the fraud allegations touch less than one per cent of the vote so " it will in no way affect the legitimacy of the election".

But the strongman faced more problems yesterday as his former trusted finance minister Alexei Kudrin threatened to set up a new right-of-centre political party - and to campaign against Putin.

In another blow, at least one regional governor quit in protest over the handling of the elections.

And the Public Opinion Foundation - one of Russia's main pollsters - abruptly stopped issuing ratings for politicians.

'We continue to conduct surveys on a weekly basis, but the results are not being released to the public,' amid claims it is due to a further slide in Putin's ratings, already down from 80 per cent to just over 50 per cent.

Prokhorov - like most business figures - used to be reluctant to cross Putin.

But he is furious after his bid to set up a political party Right Cause several months ago ended in failure after it was blocked by Putin crony Vladislav Surkov.

The tycoon said at the time: 'In this country there is a puppet master who long ago privatised the political system, who has long misinformed the Russian leadership about what is going on in the political system, puts pressure on the media, and tries to manipulate citizens' opinions. This puppet master is named Vladislav Surkov.'

Yesterday he said he had decided to become Surkov's boss by beating Putin and becoming president.

'It is not in my nature to stop halfway,' he said.

million signatures" to register in the race.

'We have a parliament that is 
completely leftist,' he said, vowing to build his programme "on a 
complete lack of populism" and call for reforms that would strengthen 
Russia's middle class.

Asked if he feared the fate of the 
last billionaire to challenge Putin - Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was 
jailed on corruption charges - he said:

'I am not doing anything illegal. I am going in with my head held high and am not afraid.'
