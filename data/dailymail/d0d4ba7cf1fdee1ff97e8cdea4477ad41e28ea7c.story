Gold Coast meter maid Marki Stibi has told of the girl's biggest fan who follows them down the Surfers Paradise strip

It seems the meter maids that stroll the tourist strip in Surfers Paradise in their gold lycra bikinis have found their biggest fan.

In an interview with the Gold Coast Bulletin meter maid Marki Stibi revealed that the girls get a lot of attention, but the majority comes from one particular man.

'He comes every Thursday and Sunday, he’ll just run up to us around 3pm and literally follow us around the whole time - sometimes we’re like "Cameron, back up, please",' she told the publication.

Cameron reportedly stalks and takes photographs of all the meter maids each time he sees them and owns all the merchandise the women sell.

He even wears photos of the girls around his neck, and is the self-proclaimed biggest fan of the meter maids.

Since 2003 Cameron has been visiting the girls every week without fail, but despite how it may seem the maids describe him as funny, seemingly undeterred by his obsession.

The man reportedly has albums upon albums full of photos of all the girls past and present.

Ms Stibi also revealed how appreciative people are of their services, despite the evolution of the job since its beginnings nearly 50 years ago.

The meter maids have been a fixture on the Surfers Paradise strip since 1965 when they were brought in to combat the negative image the Gold Coast was branded with after the introduction of parking meters.

The original women strutted down the street in golden full-piece swimsuits and tiaras feeding coins into expired parking meters and leaving calling cards on windshields.

Now, the full-piece suits have been replaced with shiny bikinis and the meter maids don classic Australian akubras on their heads in lieu of tiaras.
