Tim Cook has revealed that the rumors about Apple's vaulted privacy are true and they do hide their new products from employees using blacked-out windows and hidden rooms.

'There's black drapes and numerous locked doors and many other things,' Cook said Friday.

'We believe fundamentally that people love surprises.'

They also take precautions to make sure that anything that does make it out from behind the locked doors stays within the building as employees are forbidden from talking to their families about what they are working on.

Happy anniversary: Tim Cook sat down for an interview timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the unveiling of the Mac in a Super Bowl ad in 1984

'My wife has no idea,' Craig Federighi, Apple's vice president of software engineering, told ABC News.

The interview, which will run in full tonight on 20/20, was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Mac computer, which was launched with a Super Bowl ad in 1984.

The Apple CEO, who took over the company shortly before Steve Jobs died of cancer in October 2011, said that he personally reads hundreds of emails from customers each day.

'This is a privilege,' Cook said of receiving emails from users.

'I get probably seven or eight hundred and I read the majority of those. Every day.

'I'm a workaholic, which helps,' saying that he wakes up at 3.45am every morning.

Cook was interviewed alongside Federighi and Bud Tribble, the vice president of software technology, and they talked about one of the next big things for the company will be their return to the United States.

After years of manufacturing their products internationally, Apple announced in December that they will be building the Mac Pro in Austin, Texas.

'It's a big deal but we think we can do more. We also announced a huge investment in Arizona. We haven't said what it's for,' Cook told ABC's David Muir.

He did confirm earlier reports that the Mesa, Arizona site will be involved in the making of sapphire crystal which is believed to be used in the touch-sensitive buttons for iPhones and potentially in the development of an iWatch.
