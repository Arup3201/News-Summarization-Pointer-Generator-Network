Alan Pardew has been named as Crystal Palace boss after being released from his contract at Newcastle United.

The former West Ham United and Charlton Athletic manager will take charge of the FA Cup tie with Dover Athletic on Sunday after signing a three-and-a-half year deal at Selhurst Park.

Palace confirmed the appointment of Pardew, a former midfielder at the south London club, on Saturday morning, for a compensation package believed to be £3.5million.

Upon taking the role, Pardew said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be the new manager of Crystal Palace.

'Everyone knows my history here, what's important now is to move the club to the next level. I believe with the backing of Steve and the board I can help achieve that and create some new exciting history for the club.' 

In a statement, Eagles chairman Steve Parish said: 'We wanted a manager with a great track record and proven experience in the Barclays Premier League. In Alan we have both these things as well as a man who has great affection for this club and shares my determination to take us to the next level.' 

Football's worst-kept secret was finally made public on Saturday morning, two days after the 53-year-old, who spent more than four years on Tyneside, sat in the stands and watched his Palace team draw 0-0 at Aston Villa.

In his first interview with the Crystal Palace website, Pardew continued: 'It's been a while since I've been here but of course it's nice to be back to a club that's close to my heart in terms of my playing career. I think it's an opportunity where I think I can help the club.

'It was difficult because I'm leaving a big club in Newcastle and it was a choice which I decided to make because I felt it was right for myself and for my family and my career.

'Every time I've come back here it's always been a lovely welcome and a nice feeling and I knew at some point I would have worked for this club because really my home is in this area. This is about as close as I can to class a club as my own club.

'We need to bring something back to those fans who are so noisy it's unbelievable. We need to give something back to those fans, particularly that little corner who just never stop, and we need to keep them because they give real power to this club.

'Without putting any undue pressure on the chairman or the board, we've had a few discussions where I feel we're going to need a player or two at least and that's what we're going to try and do.'

A statement from the Magpies said: 'Newcastle United can confirm that Alan Pardew has been released from his contract in order to be installed as the new manager of Crystal Palace. 

'John Carver and Steve Stone will be in the dug-out for at least today's fixture, the club's FA Cup third round fixture at Leicester City. The search for a head coach has begun and an announcement will follow in due course.' 

Stone and Carver will take charge of Newcastle's trip to Leciester City in the FA Cup on Saturday having already been in control for Thursday's 3-3 draw with Burnley in the Premier League. 

Speaking to Newcastle's website, Pardew said: 'It has been a privilege to manage Newcastle United and I want to thank my captainFabricio Coloccini and all the players, John Carver, Steve Stone, Andy Woodman and all the staff, all of who have been outstanding servants to Newcastle United.

'A special thanks also goes to the fans for all their support over the last four years. I must also thank Mike Ashley and the board for their unwavering support during my tenure at the Club.'

Meanwhile, Newcastle managing director, Lee Charnley, said after Pardew's departure: 'I would like to thank Alan for his service to the Club.

'Despite public perceptions, fuelled by the media, Mike Ashley had never met nor spoken to Alan before his appointment. However, what developed over the last four years was a very strong and positive relationship between all parties.

'It is these relationships that, four years later, means the Club is in a far better position, both on and off the field, and Alan has had a big part to play in that.

'During his time with us, Alan achieved two top-ten Premier League finishes, including a fifth-place finish in 2012, as well as taking us to the quarter-final of the Europa League. He goes with our best wishes and thanks.'
