Parts of Britain were lashed by 85mph winds today, with 11 teenagers hit by high seas needing to be saved by lifeboat crews.

Volunteer crews from Sunderland RNLI Lifeboat Station launched two boats to go the aid of the youngsters in 11 dinghies outside Sunderland harbour, where winds were blowing at up to 55mph.

The Pennines, meanwhile, saw the highest wind speeds in Britain, with gusts of up to 85mph according to the Met Office.

Today: A bright day with a mixture of sunny spells and showers.

Most of the showers will be across western areas, but some may spread further east at times. The showers will be heavy across western Scotland with some hail possible at times, and will fall as sleet and snow on the higher ground. The showers will tend to become more isolated later in the afternoon.

Tonight: Any remaining showers in western areas will quickly clear to give a largely dry evening across the UK with clear spells for a time.

A cold night, with a widespread frost across Scotland and eastern England. However, cloud will quickly build from the west through the course of the night, with rain pushing into Northern Ireland, western Scotland and Wales by dawn.

The young sailors had got into difficulties during a training session with Sunderland Yacht Club.

The club's own boats were unable to help as a result of the number of dinghies needing assistance and the rough weather.

They notified the Humber Coastguard who asked Sunderland RNLI to launch its inshore lifeboats, Wolseley and MyJo.

A Coastguard rescue team from Sunderland was also tasked to attend the incident to liaise directly with yacht club staff.

Paul Nicholson, Senior Helmsman at Sunderland RNLI, said: ‘After launching we immediately made contact with the yacht club's safety boat crews to establish the whereabouts of each of the dinghies.

‘It was quickly confirmed that all dinghies were accounted for, but some needed assisting to the shore due to the poor weather conditions.’

One teenager was put on board a lifeboat and carried ashore after reporting pains in her shoulder.

After a full check-up at the lifeboat station, she was allowed home, with no further medical treatment required.

The two lifeboats helped all 11 dinghies to shore.

Mr Nicholson said: ‘We regularly work with the yacht club to make sure we can work hand in hand with their own safety boat crews should an incident like this happen.

‘This meant that what could have been a very difficult incident to deal with went like clockwork.

‘It is important for all sailing clubs to have well-practised emergency plans to ensure that any escalating incident can be dealt with effectively.’
