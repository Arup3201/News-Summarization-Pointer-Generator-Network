Jose Mourinho craved a striker and, without a doubt, the Chelsea manager got one when he pulled £32million out and got Diego Costa in return.

The 25-year-old, swapping reigning La Liga champions Atletico Madrid for Chelsea, already looks the answer to the prayers that so often emerged from Stamford Bridge some 12 months ago. 

And there has been no adjustment period needed for Costa whose explosive start already trumps some of the Premier League's finest imports, including Sergio Aguero, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Didier Drogba, Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres.

Best start: Diego Costa scored four goals in three games for Chelsea in his impressive Premier League start

Thanks: Costa seems to have brought an end to the Chelsea curse but his Premier League career is young

Brace: Costa managed to score twice against Everton in the 6-3 win to bring his Premier League tally to four 

With four goals in three games, Diego Costa has made a better Premier League start than some of the most successful recent imports.

Goals after three Premier League games:

4 - Diego Costa (Chelsea) 

3 - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)

2 - Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United)

1 - Didier Drogba (Chelsea)

1 - Luis Suarez (Liverpool)

1 - Fernando Torres (Liverpool)

PS - Robin van Persie did score four in his first three games for Manchester United, but he had already been in the Premier League for eight years.

With four goals in three games, Costa looks a fine acquisition. The Spain (and former Brazil) international took just 17 minutes to get going with his debut Premier League goal against Burnley on the opening day of the season.

Was it a fluke? No. Costa netted again at Stamford Bridge against Leicester City five days later. 

What followed were reports emerging about the striker's fitness, suggesting he was out for six weeks after pulling up in training, but these proved to be hogwash. 

Costa looked fit enough when scoring twice against Everton - in the first and 90th minute -  as Chelsea made it three victories in as many games.

The curse of the Chelsea striker is something owner Roman Abramovich know all too well. 

Over the years, nearly £200m has been thrown at the problem.

Adrian Mutu, Hernan Crespo, Mateja Kezman, Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Shevchenko, Claudio Pizarro, Nicolas Anelka, Franco Di Santo, Daniel Sturridge, Torres, Romelu Lukaku, Patrick Bamford, Lucas Piazon, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto’o are among the imports. 

But now, with the returning Drogba as back-up, the £32m Costa appears the best fit.

Return: Didier Drogba's Premier League start with Chelsea saw him net just once in the first three matches

Gone: Luis Suarez nabbed just the one goal in his opening three Premier League starts with Liverpool

Proven: Sergio Aguero won Manchester City the title and scored three in three when he came to England

Offloaded: Fernando Torres enjoyed life at Liverpool better, and scored one goal in his first three matches

Vintage: Ruud van Nistelrooy nabbed two goals in three games with Manchester United in the Premier League
