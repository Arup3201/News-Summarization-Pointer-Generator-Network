Set on the edge of the Chiltern Hills within easy reach of London, Beaconsfield has attracted politicians and celebrities as a place to live for decades.

But the picturesque location comes at a cost.

Research shows its residents now pay £500,000 more to live there than elsewhere in Buckinghamshire.

The trend is repeated across the country, albeit to a lesser extent, with an average premium of £25,000 on homes in market towns, according to Lloyds bank.

Homes in such locations have risen in value by an average of £500 a month over the past ten years – and two-thirds of market towns in England have an average house price that is above average for their county.

Wetherby has the second highest premium with prices £157,000 above the West Yorkshire average, followed by Bakewell in the Derbyshire Peak District, where homes cost £147,000 more.

One in eight market towns in the survey have an average house price at least £100,000 higher than the rest of their county.

Beaconsfield not only comes with the highest premium but is also the most expensive market town in the country, with the average home now costing £823,000. 

Petersfield, in Hampshire, where homes cost £402,000, and Cranbrook, Kent, where they cost £394,000 are the next most expensive.

Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, which is in David Cameron's constituency and is home to television presenter Jeremy Clarkson, also made the top ten with an average price of £352,000.

Outside southern England, Bakewell is the most expensive market town with an average property value of £315,000, far in excess of the UK's average of £274,000, according to the Office for National Statistics.

But if buyers are intent on living in a market town, the North East may be the place to look. Three of the five least expensive market towns are in County Durham, including Ferryhill with an average price of £86,000, Crook at £107,000 and Stanhope at £128,000.

Andy Hulme, of Lloyds Bank, said: 'Market towns are important hubs of social interaction … as well as providers of employment … [They] are also, in most cases, very attractive places to live.

'This is reflected in the majority of market towns having higher property prices than their surrounding counties.

'Home buyers continue to be attracted to the high quality of life, architecture, history, setting and community spirit … and are prepared to pay a premium to live there.'

Another report revealed today the number of homes worth £1million or more, excluding London, rose by 38 per cent over the past year.
