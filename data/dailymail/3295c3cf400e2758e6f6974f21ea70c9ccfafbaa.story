Mohammed Ashrafi is accused of posing as a spiritual figure in order to defraud followers

A man has been accused of masquerading as a faith healer to dupe victims out of £650,000.

Mohammed Ashrafi, 50, allegedly posed as a devotee of Indian spiritual master Sai Baba and claimed he had powers to perform miracles, Leicester Crown Court was told.

It is claimed he convinced 18 believers they were going to win the National Lottery and persuaded them to part with life savings.

James House, prosecuting, told the jury: 'He's a clever and a sophisticated con artist and a fraudster.

'When they'd given him all they had, some borrowed from friends, even taking out loans. It exceeds £650,000.

'He assumed a persona, calling himself Kamal-Ji, claiming he could pray through Sai Baba and they would win the National or Euro lotteries.

'He demonstrated his abilities as a magician and would rub his hands together and produce prayer beads as if from thin air.

'This trick was repeated to many victims. It drew them in and they relied on it that he was connected to Sai Baba, like it was a miracle.'

Ashrafi, from Leicester, denies 14 counts of fraud involving 18 people - between January and April 2014 - by falsely claiming that in return for payments his clientele would win the lottery.

He also denies blackmailing a couple out of £50,000 last February.

The prosecution allege that the blackmail involved Ashrafi drugging a woman, who became unconscious, before making a 'compromising' video and threatening to put it on the internet.

The court heard Ashrafi convinced people they would win the lottery after pretending to have special powers

Mr House said: 'The defendant paid for tens of thousands of leaflets to be delivered, primarily within the Leicester Asian community.'

The prosecution also allege that Ashrafi placed adverts on radio stations and in newspapers.

Sai Baba of Shirdi was a Indian spiritual master who lived from 1838 to 1918

The adverts for his alleged free-of-charge faith healing and astrology service highlighted personal problems he could assist with, such as marital difficulties, ill-health, business problems and childlessness, the court heard.

Another alleged trick involved the defendant telling a devotee to make dough balls from rice flour, which Ashrafi then cooked on a portable stove.

When one of the balls was cut in half there was a piece of silver foil with a Euro ticket inside, the court heard.

Ashrafi  allegedly then put his hand to his ear, as if communicating with Sai Baba, to recite the exact numbers on the lottery ticket.

Mr House said: 'A couple who witnessed this were stunned. They were convinced he was genuine and believed his claim that they were going to win the lottery.'

When he disappeared from Leicester in March 2014, some alleged victims realised they had been conned, the prosecution said. The trial continues.
