World Cup sticker albums will cost, on average, £450 to complete, according to new research by two mathematicians in Switzerland.

With 640 stickers in the current Panini World Cup sticker album and 50p for a pack of six it should cost just £63.99 to complete the collection.

However, allowing for duplicates it is estimated that 899 packs are actually needed at a cost of a whopping £449.50.

Costly: New research has shown the real price of completing the World Cup sticker album

Straightforward: Without duplicates and swaps it could be as little as £63.99 to finish the lot

Andrew Palmer from the Economist attempted to explain the workings while taking into consideration his own personal knowledge of collecting.

He told BBC Radio Five Live: 'It's a statistical technique called the Coupon Collector's Problem. I won't go into the maths part because I don't understand it but the idea is basically that if you as an individual just bought pack after pack after pack and didn't do any swapping how long would it take you to fill your album.

'Of course the probability of getting the card that you need goes down the more slots that you fill in the album.

'So on average these statisticians from the Swiss university reckon that it is just under 900 packs which in Britain is £450 give or take, which is a horrifyingly large amount.'

Setback: But in reality that figure is likely to be closer to £450
