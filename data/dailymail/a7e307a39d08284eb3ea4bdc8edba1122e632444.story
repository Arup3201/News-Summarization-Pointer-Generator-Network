At least 14 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens more were wounded when rebels stormed their checkpoint in east Ukraine today.

It is the deadliest clash yet in the conflict in Ukraine and saw three armoured vehicles destroyed and a series of other lorries and vans burned out.

They produced an array of weapons they 
said they had seized from the soldiers, in what is the deadliest raid in weeks of fighting in the region.

But a Ukrainian commander said shortly after the attack: 'The war has started.'

The destruction of armoured vehicles 
shows that the rebels have access to heavy weaponry and are not 
lightly-armed freelance operators. It is likely to raise fears that they
 have been armed by Moscow.

The weapons haul included automatic and sniper rifles, rocket grenade launchers and bulletproof vest  

'We
 destroyed a checkpoint of the fascist Ukrainian army deployed on the 
land of the Donetsk Republic,' said the commander, who wore a balaclava 
and identified himself by his nom de guerre, 'Bes' - Russian for 
'demon.'

'The weapons you see here have been taken from the dead, they are trophies,' he said.

He
 showed several dozen items, including automatic and sniper rifles, 
rocket grenade launchers and bulletproof vests. The booty was carefully 
laid out in the courtyard of the Horlivka city police headquarters which
 is occupied by the rebels.

'People
 living in western Ukraine: Think about where you are sending your 
brothers, fathers and sons, and why you need any of this,' the commander
 said.

The claims could not be independently verified.

Associated Press reporters who arrived after the attack saw 11 bodies scattered around the checkpoint near the village of Blahodatne, near the town of Volnovakha, Donetsk.

More than 30 soldiers loyal to Kiev were wounded, some gravely, when the insurgents stormed the checkpoint, witnesses said.

Officials in Ukraine later raised the death toll to 14.

Three charred Ukrainian armoured 
infantry vehicles, their turrets blown away by powerful explosions, and 
several burned trucks stood at the scene of the battle.

Officials
 arrived at the battlefield in a military helicopter and inspected the 
area. Ukraine's defence ministry confirmed the attack but would not 
comment on casualties.

Scores
 have been killed since the Kiev government launched an 'anti-terrorist 
operation' against insurgents, who have seized government 
buildings and declared their regions independent.

Today's battle will cast a shadow over Ukraine's presidential vote this Sunday, which insurgents have vowed to derail.

The authorities in Kiev see the vote as a chance to defuse tensions and stabilise the country. But they admitted that it will be impossible to stage the vote in some areas in the east. They say election officials and voters have faced intimidation and threats from the rebels.

Many in the Russian-speaking east resent the government in Kiev, which seized power in February after mass protests toppled Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.

Eastern Ukrainians see the new regime as 'fascists' bent on oppressing Russian speakers and targeting ethnic Russians. But they are also said to be growing increasingly exasperated with the rebels after finding themselves in the crossfire of battles with the Ukrainian army.

In the village of Semenovka, on the outskirts of Slavyansk, artillery shelling that appeared to come from government positions badly damaged several houses today.

Zinaida Patskan, 80, had the roof of her house torn by an explosion, which also shattered one of the walls. 'Why they are hitting us?' she said, bursting into tears. 'We are peaceful people!'

Mrs Patskan, who wasn't hurt, said she was hiding under a kitchen table with her cat, Timofey, when the shelling came.

About a hundred Semenovka residents later vented their anger against the central government, demanding that the Ukrainian forces cease their offensive and withdraw from the region.

Speakers at the rally also called for boycotting the presidential vote.

President Vladimir Putin's order to withdraw Russian forces massed along the border with Ukraine was today being carried out, according to the Russian defence ministry. Nato said it had seen no signs of movement

As fighting raged in Ukraine, Russia's Defence Ministry said today that its forces were leaving border regions as part of a military pullout ordered by President Vladimir Putin.

It said that four trainloads of 
weapons and 15 Il-76 heavy-lift transport planes left the Belgorod, 
Bryansk and Rostov regions on Wednesday. The troops are to reach their 
permanent bases before June 1, the ministry added.

Many clients of Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian state gas company Gazprom, are ready to switch their payments from U.S. dollars to euros and yuan, CEO Alexander Dyukov said today.

Any switch away from the use of U.S. dollars as a global reserve currency could lead to massive shockwaves in the American economy.

Mr Dyukov added there could be problems borrowing abroad because of western sanctions imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March but said that Gazprom Neft had fulfilled its borrowing plan for 2014.

The announcment came as a businessman facing EU and U.S. sanctions was appointed Russia's business envoy to China. Gennady Timchenko said he expects a flurry of deals in a shift away from the West.

He said: 'You know what Putin said? He introduced me (to Chinese businessmen) by saying now Mr Timchenko is the head of our business council.

'In other words - it is my words here - he is our main man for China. From the point of view of business relations. That was yesterday.'

Nato has estimated that Russia has 40,000 troops along the border with Ukraine. The U.S.-led alliance insisted earlier this week that it had not yet seen any signs of a Russian withdrawal.

Putin scoffed at Nato's scepticism, saying yesterday that the pullout involving such large numbers of troops would take time. 'Those who aren't seeing it should look better,' he said.

He said the pullout will be clearly visible in satellite images.

The announcement went further than an earlier step by the Russian leader two weeks ago, when he said the troops retreated from the border to shooting ranges.

Putin's pullout order and his remarks welcoming Ukraine's presidential election this Sunday seemed to reflect an attempt to ease tensions with the West over Ukraine and avoid a new round of Western sanctions.

He has ignored the plea of some of the rebels in eastern Ukraine to join Russia after independence referendums dismissed as a sham by Kiev and the West.

The U.S. and the European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on members of Putin's entourage after Russia annexed Crimea in March.

Western politicians have warned that more crippling sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy would follow if Russia tries to grab more land or attempts to derail Ukraine's election.

Moscow has supported a peace plan brokered by Switzerland and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It proposes a broad amnesty and the launch of a national dialogue that focuses on the decentralisation of government and upholding the status of the Russian language.

Russia also has pushed for guarantees that Ukraine will not join Nato and has advocated constitutional reforms that would give broader powers to the regions. Some say this would maintain Moscow's clout in the Russian-speaking eastern regions that form the nation's industrial heartland.

Journalists picket the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow to demand the release of journalists working for RT and Moscow-based Life News who have been detained by forces loyal to the government in Kiev

As clashes continued in the east, the Kremlin angrily protested the detention of journalists working for Russian media outlets in Ukraine.

Graham Phillips, a British national working for state-controlled English language television station RT, was detained earlier this week by Ukrainian forces.

Two correspondents with Moscow-based Life News television are still in Ukrainian custody and facing accusations of aiding armed insurgents - a claim that Putin has dismissed as 'rubbish and nonsense.'
