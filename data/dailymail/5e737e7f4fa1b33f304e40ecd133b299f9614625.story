A Game of Thrones actor was today slammed by women for his bad train etiquette after being caught taking up too much space on the London Underground.

Richard Madden, 27, was photographed on the Bakerloo line and the image was uploaded to the Men Taking Up Too Much Space On The Train website, where a user called for him to be 'castrated'.

The commenter reportedly wrote: 'Castrate him. Maybe it would free up some of the space his c*** is desperately trying to take up.'

The Men Taking Up Too Much Space On The 
Train website exposes a world of sexual politics that will strike a 
chord with anyone who has suffered at the hands of bad etiquette on 
public transport.

Dozens of other men have been shamed 
on the Tumblr website, which has many other funny pictures posted by 
users of anyone they believe is being disrespectful to fellow 
passengers.

Even former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 
waded into the row last night, saying: 'Apparently the excuse 
that was given here was that it can be uncomfortable for men to put 
their legs together.'

She told Sky News: 'I'm surprised he isn't taking any abuse from that poor guy sitting next to him who hasn't got any room.'

One user of the website said: 'Oh, look who it is. Richard, why are your legs so d*** far apart?'.

It was a common theme to 
reference his Game Of Thrones character, Robb Stark, who was Lord of 
Winterfell and later King in the North in the HBO fantasy drama.

Moving on: Since leaving the HBO series, Richard was last seen promoting new film A Promise with Alan Rickman and Rebecca Hall

'Oh man, Robb Stark is a subway leg-spreader?! Maybe the Red Wedding was justified after allâ€¦' wrote another blogger.

However some people confused Richard Madden for 
co-star Kit Harrington, who plays his half-brother on the show, with one saying: 
'You know nothing about Tube etiquette, Jon Snow'.

But there were many comments in support of Madden, with some bloggers saying he was not actually taking up too much space, and as the 'King of the North' he was more than entitled to.

'Hey now. Robb Stark is the King of the North. He can take up as much space as he likes. When you play the game of underground seating you either win or die,' one user stated.

Another became more passionate in defence of Madden, saying: 'I hope someone just found this picture on the internet and submitted it because if you saw Richard F****** Madden on the train and took a picture because he was taking up too much room, what are you even doing?'

Since being uploaded on June 5, the image has received 520 notes by Tumblr users.

Richard - who is dating Doctor Who star Jenna Coleman - has thrown himself into film work since his time on Game Of Thrones came to an end.

He was last seen promoting A Promise with co-stars Rebecca Hall and Alan Rickman at Venice Film Festival. Madden's representative did not immediately respond to a MailOnline request for comment.
