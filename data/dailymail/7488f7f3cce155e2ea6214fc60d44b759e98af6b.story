Massimo Cellino has insisted  he will not sell Leeds United despite the danger of facing a further ban from owning the club.

The controversial Italian was typically defiant after the Football League disqualified him from running his club due to a breach of its Owners and Directors Test. 

Cellino told Sportsmail on Monday: ‘I am not selling the club. You must be joking. I just bought the club and I want to protect the fans.’

We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until 18 March 2015.

The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014.

The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. 

That could prove more difficult if Cellino faces further sanctions.

The Italian, who successfully appealed against the League’s decision to block his takeover of Leeds in April, was plunged into limbo yesterday after the Football League received detailed evidence from the Italian court in Cagliari that convicted him of tax evasion in March.

Last night, the 58-year-old indicated he would appeal within the 14 days allowed. Even if he fails to have the decision overturned, the disqualifying condition only runs until March 18 next year because the tax conviction will be declared spent under UK law.

However, Cellino faces further disciplinary action because of his non-disclosure of the information.

Cellino could escape with a three and a half month ban, but his failure to cooperate will now be reviewed by the Football Disciplinary Commission; a body with unlimited sanctions that could even see the club expelled from the league.

A further possible complication is the fact that Cellino is facing a similar tax evasion trial, again over unpaid import duty on a boat. The case was delayed because the judge, having heard the first trial, felt compromised.

Yesterday a Football League statement said: ‘At its meeting last week, the board considered the reasoned judgment of the Italian court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian courts for its full disclosure.

The board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously [with the exception of its chief executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest] that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the test.

‘Additionally, the board concluded it was appropriate to ask an independent football disciplinary commission to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course.’

Cellino was in Bahrain yesterday and will only meet with his legal representatives today.

But the Football League sanctions demand that the Leeds president reduces his personal stake in the club to less than 30 per cent from the 75 per cent he currently owns.

A statement from Leeds accused the Football League of ‘destabilising’.

League rules give Cellino just 28 days to resign as a director of Leeds and cut his ties with the Championship club.

Yesterday Cellino, who bought a 75 per cent stake of the club through a company called Eleanora Sport Limited, told the Yorkshire Post: ‘Massimo Cellino does not own Leeds. My family company owns Leeds. It is my family’s money which bought the club, not my money.’

In a separate interview with Sky he said: ‘If I am not allowed to run the club I will buy a ticket and sit with the fans but I am not going to run away.

‘I think it’s unfair and wrong. I’m surprised so much energy and so much money has been wasted to run after something that is not just. I am not a dishonest person. I I come from Italy and I love this club more than someone from Britain.’

The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test.

Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone).

In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.”

At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test.

Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public.

Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course.
