Silvio Berlusconi will tonight hold an emergency cabinet meeting to bring in reforms aimed at dealing with Italy's mounting debt crisis.

The Italian prime minister is expected to slash public spending and impose new taxes on the wealthy in an effort to slow the rate at which the country is piling on debt.

The meeting - set for 7pm local time - comes in response to demands from the European Central Bank (ECB) for urgent measures to spur economic growth and balance the budget by 2013.

European markets have swung wildly this week on rumours that indebted eurozone governments are teetering on the brink of a new debt crisis.

After days of criticism for a lack of clarity on its plans, Berlusconi's centre-right government looks set to levy a 'solidarity tax' on high earners and raise the tax level on the financial sector.

The measures were agreed in late-night discussions between Mr Berlusconi and economy minister Giulio Tremonti; but other steps, notably those concerning pension reform, remain to be decided.

The government must make €20billion of extra savings and revenue to meet its new balanced budget target and reassure investors it can control debt running at 120 per cent of gross domestic product.

Mr Berlusconi and Mr Tremonti held a series of meetings yesterday with President Giorgio Napolitano and Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi as they scrambled to nail down details of the package.

The 'solidarity tax' would take the form of an extra 5 per cent on income above €90,000 and a 10 per cent addition to tax on income above €150,000, business daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported.

The tax rate on financial income is set to jump from 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent, with the exception of income from government bonds - the sale of which are crucial to Italy's continued solvency.

Further measures could include a bid to raise the number of working days in a year by ensuring that non-religious public holidays, such as the June 2 anniversary of the founding of the Italian Republic, are celebrated on a Sunday.

The market chaos which threatened to spin Italy's borrowing costs out of control last week has eased since the ECB intervened to buy up huge chunks of the country's debt.

While Italy's budget deficit is below the euro-zone average and should shrink to around 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year, the country's sovereign debt passed the €1.9 trillion mark in June.

But the continuing fear among investors that the eurozone's third largest economy is running an insustainable course have led to sharp falls on Italian stock markets.

Stock market regulator Consob today announced a temporary ban on short-selling financial stocks in a bid to calm the volatility that has hammered Italian bank shares.

In response, the main Milan index was trading nearly 2 percent higher earlier today.

Despite its huge public debt, Italy had remained on the sidelines of the eurozone crisis until last month when doubts about the government's unity and capacity to control its finances triggered a massive sell-off of Italian bonds.

Italian media reported that Prime Minister Berlusconi was considering issuing a special video message to explain the austerity plan, which will fast-track a number of measures contained in a €48billion package passed last month.

But major disagreements remain and sensitive reforms to the pension system remain undecided, with Berlusconi's Northern League coalition partners and Italy's biggest trade union both strongly opposed to any cuts.

Yesterday, Mr Tremonti told a parliamentary committee that the ECB had demanded measures to break down barriers to competition in services and the professions and free up rigid labour market rules.

The recommendations included privatisation of local public services, more flexible employment contracts, easier hiring and firing to free up the rigid labour market and cuts to public sector pay.

Additional measures included increasing the retirement age for women working in the private sector and a change in rules on when workers can retire based on their pension contributions.

Mr Tremonti said the proposals on hiring and firing and cuts to public sector pay, both of which would raise fierce political opposition, were not in the government's plans.
