Tragic: Bollywood actress Jiah Khan was reportedly found hanged in her apartment by her mother

Star: Miss Khan appeared in her first Bollywood film, based loosely on Nabakov's Lolita in 2007

The mother and sister of the actress, whose real name was Nafisa Khan,  are said to have gone out and she was alone at their apartment when the incident happened.

They found Jiah hanged when they returned home.

Fellow Bollywood stars and fans of the actress took to Twitter to express their shock at her death.

Ram Gopal Varma, who directed her debut film Nishabd, said that she had been 'very depressed' about her career.

She reportedly wanted to pursue a career in interior design when her acting career failed to meet its early potential.

The 25-year-old actress made her Bollywood debut in 2007, playing the 18-year-old female lead opposite one of India's leading actors, Amitabh Bachchan, in a film loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's classic novel Lolita.

Filmmaker Varma wrote on Twitter: 'Never ever seen a debutant actress with more spunk and more spirit than Jiah when I was directing her in Nishabd.

'I don't know the reason what led to this but Jiah was very depressed about her career and scared for her future,' he said in another tweet.

He added: 'The last time I met her Jiah told me that everyone around her makes her feel like a failure.'

Khan, whose real name was Nafisa Khan, was born in New York and grew up in Chelsea, London.

She had been dating Suraj Pancholi, son of Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi, for around a year.

Nishabd received mixed reviews and did not do well at the Bollywood box office but Khan went on to play supporting roles in two blockbusters, the psychological thriller Ghajini in 2008 and the comedy Housefull, her last role, in 2010.

Amitabh Bachchan tweeted his shock at the death of the actress.

He said: 'WHAT ...!!! Jiah Khan? What has happened? Is this correct? Unbelievable!!!'

choreographer Farah Khan tweeted: 'Can't register that Jiah is no more... Worked with her in Housefull and she was so beautiful and such a good soul. Too young to go Jiah.'

Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor tweeted: 'Shocked n saddened to hear about jiah khan ... Very disturbing ... RIP ....may her soul rest in peace.'

According to Miss Khan's website, she was to play a part in a forthcoming Hollywood production.

As well as her Bollywood acting, she had appeared in an advert for animal campaign group PETA.

She was the daughter of Ali Rivzi Khan, an Indian-American actress who found fame in the 1980s.
