'I'm sorry': Millicent Waddell had wanted to stay in London, an inquest heard

A boarding school pupil hanged herself in her bathroom at home after leaving a note that simply said: 'I'm sorry', an inquest heard today

Tragic Millicent Waddell, 16, locked herself in the bathroom of her mother's £400,000 home before taking her own life.

Her horrified mum, Louisa-Kate Foster, discovered her body after breaking into the room when her daughter failed to respond to her knocking on the door.

The inquest at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, heard Millie had become unhappy after moving from her father Robert Waddell's home in London to her mother's house in Somerset.

But Tony Williams, coroner for East Somerset, said there was 'no prior indication' that the teenager would harm herself.

Reading a statement from Millie's mother, who did not attend the inquest, Mr Williams said: 'Millicent had wanted to stay in London but things had not worked out and so Millicent came, in early April, to live with her mother.

'Millicent was in the process of deciding whether she wanted to go to college or find a job.

'She was angry with her situation. She wanted to stay in London but there was no indication that she might self harm in any way.'

Millie attended Sexey's School in Bruton, Somerset, a Church of England state boarding school which charges up to £8,400 a year.

Mrs Foster's statement told how she returned to their home in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, at 5.40pm on the day of Millie's death, May 29 last year, but did not see her daughter.

She later heard the shower running in the bathroom and knocked on the door at 7.20pm but did not receive a reply.

The mother left home for a meeting and returned at 9.15pm - when she found the door still locked.Mr Williams added: 'She decided she would need to force the door.'

Ms Foster forced her way into the room and found her daughter hanged, he told the court.

'A note was found at the property in Millicent's handwriting that simply read: "I'm sorry",' he added.

Robert Waddell, Millie's father, provided a statement confirming there had been no concerns that she would harm herself before her death.

Police attended the £400,000 detached home but could not save Millie.

A toxicology report later showed she had 79mg of alcohol per 100ml - the maximum for driving is 80mg.

No prescription or illegal drugs were found in her system, the inquest heard.

Pathologist Dr Robert Blahut, at Yeovil District Hospital, confirmed the cause of Millie's death as hanging.

Mr Williams told the inquest at East Somerset Coroner's Court: 'There is no evidence to suggest third party involvement.

'I take into account the note that was left by Millicent with two words explaining her actions.

'Millicent knew while she was in the family home she would not be disturbed while she was in the bathroom. My formal finding is that Millicent took her own life.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.
