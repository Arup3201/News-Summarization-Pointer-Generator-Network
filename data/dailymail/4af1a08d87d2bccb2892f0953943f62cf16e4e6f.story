Two of the biggest clubs in the Aviva Premiership on Saturday night distanced themselves from Saracens’ call to scrap the salary cap and admitted they could not afford it.

Saracens, who are facing a Premier Rugby investigation into alleged breaches of the £5.5million cap, claimed to have the support of six other clubs.

But Leicester and Northampton, two of the most financially viable clubs, made it clear they are not interested.

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘The cap’s a good thing because it keeps the league competitive.

‘Sides like ourselves, Gloucester, Saints pay our own bills and have a sound financial structure that means we spend what we can afford to. That’s a good model to be part of. You’d like it to be loosened a bit for Europe but if you have a couple of sides that can spend £15m it makes the league uneven.

‘We can only afford to spend what we’ve got. We’re not in debt and that’s how we want to stay.’

Northampton boss Jim Mallinder said: ‘We couldn’t go up to £10-15m. I’ve no interest in scrapping it. You’d have to asked the chief executives if they’d be prepared to spend more money. I’d guess the answer is “no”.’

Saracens chief executive, Edward Griffiths, has called for an end to the salary cap in the Aviva Premiership
