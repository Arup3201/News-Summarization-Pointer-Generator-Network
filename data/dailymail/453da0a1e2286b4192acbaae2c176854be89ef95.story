Pot plants are to be judged alongside tomato plants and marijuana brownies will compete for blue ribbons in cake categories at Denver County Fair.

Organizers say the marijuana
 categories will add a fun twist to the already quirky fair,
 which includes a drag queen pageant and contest for dioramas made 
with Peeps candy.

Despite Colorado relaxing its drug laws, there won't be any marijuana at the fairground. Judging will be done off-site, with photos showing the winning entries. 

And, in the live joint-rolling contest during the three-day show that opens on August 1, pot will be replaced with oregano.

'We thought it was time for us to take that leap and represent one of the things Denver has going on,' said Tracy Weil, the fair's marketing and creative director.

The nine marijuana categories include live plants and clones, plus contests for marijuana-infused brownies and savory foods. Homemade bongs, homemade roach clips, and items made with hemp round out the categories.

Judges will look only at plant quality, not the potency or quality of the drugs they produce, and the winners will take home $20 and a blue ribbon.

The entries will be shown in a Pot Pavilion, which will be open only to those over 21. Even the photographs of the winning 
plants will be on display only to adults.

Organizers said they didn't want young competitors in the popular rabbit and goat contests wandering by a pot 
display.

Twist: The Denver fair prides itself on making traditional events like pie eating contests more hip

Hog the limelight: Visitors to the fair can be entertained by a troupe of performing pigs

'We have a lot of families and kids at the fair, of course, and we wanted to be respectful of that,' Weil said.

Prizes will be given for speedy joint-rolling, though fair organizers insist there won't be any marijuana consumption on-site. Competitors in the live Doritos-eating contest, hosted in the same pavilion, will have to acquire their munchies elsewhere.

Other entertainment in the Pot Pavilion will include Grateful Dead karaoke and tie-dye competitions.

The Denver Fair, which has been running since 2011, has always tried to bring hip elements to traditional favorites like a Ferris wheel and cotton candy.

It has a speed text-messaging contest, a rodeo that uses bikes instead of horses, and a popular hog show starring a troupe of performing pigs. 

Denver is likely to be the only Colorado fair to feature pot after officials in Routt County voted last year to ban marijuana from its shows.

Organizers of the state fair have also shown no interest in adding marijuana competitions.
