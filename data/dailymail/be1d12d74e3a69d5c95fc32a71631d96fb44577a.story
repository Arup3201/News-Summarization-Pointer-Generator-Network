On trial: Francesco Schettino, captain of the cruise ship Concordia, tried to orchestrate a cover up in which the company would blame the tragic shipwreck on a power cut, a court in Italy has heard

The captain of the cruise ship Concordia tried to orchestrate a cover up in which the company would blame the tragic shipwreck on a power cut, a court in Italy has heard. Captain Francesco Schettino was in command of the giant cruise liner when it hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, killing 32 people. The 52-year-old, who allegedly caused the crash by ordering an ill fated ‘salute’ to the island of Giglio, is currently on trial for mass manslaughter and abandoning ship. Giving evidence at the court in Grosseto, Tuscany, head of the crisis unit Roberto Ferrarini said that the former captain asked him to help cover his tracks, by telling the authorities that a power outage had caused the collision. Emergency manager Ferrarini said: ‘Schettino asked me to tell the maritime authorities that the collision was down to a blackout on the ship. But I strongly objected. ‘That was a different false account compared to what he had said before, namely, that he had hit a rock which caused the ship to flood.‘I remember I got quite angry-and I shared that reaction with my colleagues.'

Ferrarini, a key witness, was also to stand trial for his part in the disaster but through a plea bargain negotiated a two year two month suspended sentence before proceedings began.

Four other Costa employees received lesser sentences.

The giant ship carrying 4,000 people sank after colliding with sharp reef as officials made a late turn while passing the island of Giglio.

The Concordia has now been hoisted from the sea bed but remains an eyesore in the once pristine sea alongside Giglio port.

This summer the vast ship is finally set to be towed away for scrap. Schettino accepts partial responsibility for the accident but claims that the victims did not die in the collision itself but after the failure of a backup generator and water-tight compartments that flooded during the evacuation.

He denies abandoning ship, insisting he fell into a lifeboat as the ship tipped up.
