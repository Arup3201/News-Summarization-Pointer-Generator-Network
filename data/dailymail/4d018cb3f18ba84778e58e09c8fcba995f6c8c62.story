A cross-dressing male housekeeper, known as Ms Puppy, has pleaded guilty to beating to death a gay couple from Denver.

Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty Friday to counts of second-degree murder.

Rasmussen was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and 13 other charges against him – including first-degree murder - were dismissed.

Guilty: Daryl Rasmussen, 58, known as Ms Puppy, was sentenced to 30 years in prison as part of a plea deal in the double murder of a gay couple

According to prosecutors, Rasmussen bludgeoned to death Ronald Ford, 63, and his long-time boyfriend, 56-year-old Ramiro 'Rome' Sanchez, in their Denver home in late January 2011.

The cross-dresser also stole the slain couple's 1997 Dodge Caravan and used their credit cards and identifies. 

The victims’ bodies were discovered a week apart in mid-February. Both are survived by a number of grown children.

Rasmussen, aka Ms Puppy, had been homeless when the Denver couple hired him in 2010 to be a housekeeper and caregiver to Sanchez, who was disabled.

Sanchez and Ford were killed in their home in the 120 block of Stuart Street in Denver with blows to the head, according to court documents.

Gruesome discoveries: Ronald Ford's body was found inside the couple's Denver home February 11, 2011, and Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement

Ford's body was found inside the house February 11. Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement under a pile of bags.

Before Sanchez was found dead, it had been suggested that he and Rasmussen may have run away together.

Speaking to The Denver Channel in February 2011, Heidi Coleman, one of Ford's four children, said that it was a relief to know that her father's partner of 18 years did not play a part in his murder.

Denver Post reported that Daryl Rasmussen fled after the murders but was arrested six months later in Palm Springs, California, after a patron in a local bar overheard him introduce himself as Ms Puppy. 

In court Friday, Daryl Rasmussen spoke very little, only saying he was sorry for what happened, CBS Denver reported.
