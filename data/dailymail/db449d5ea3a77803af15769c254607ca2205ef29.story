After being deaf for more than 50 years a father finally heard his daughter sing for the first time.

Ken Stehle, from St. Peters, Mo., has recently been fitted with a new technology that allows him to hear the world around him.

But he had never heard his daughter Ashley sing with her choir at Villa Duchesne High School until last weekend.

Fresh lease on life: Ken Stehle, from St. Peters, has recently been fitted with a new technology that allows him to hear the world around him

Mr Stehle received a new hearing aid that requires him to wear a receiver around his neck.

The new technology also requires Ashley to wear a special microphone, reported KSDK.

Her voice is then picked up by Ken's receiver and transmitted to his hearing aid.

The pair were not sure it would work, but tested it out at the school's Christmas concert where Ashley sangÂ  Daddy Please Come Home For Christmas as a surprise to her father.

'He was just closing his eyes and listening to my voice,' Ashley told the news channel.

'He didn't really care if he was seeing me because he has always seen me. He wanted to hear me and that was just awesome.'

There has been a surge of such clips in recent years as scientists have developed ever more ingenious ways of helping deaf people to hear.

Many are given surgically implanted cochlear implants, which provide a sense of sound to people who are deaf or severely hard of hearing and are often referred to as 'bionic ears'.

A video of an eight-month-old baby hearing for the first time using the electronic implant went viral, with viewers describing the moment as 'magical'.

Another moving video showed 29-year-old Sarah Churman hearing fully for the first time using the implant.

The American woman, who had been wearing hearing aids from the age of two but was only able to hear very quiet noises, was able to talk about it to a fascinated world.
