The U.S. Navy's submarine bases are some of the most high-security installations in the world, but one of the most important is located at a lake in landlocked Idaho.

The Navy's Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD) at Bayview, Idaho, has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years.

Although located some 375 miles from the ocean, it has been called ‘the U.S. Submarine force's most important body of water" by Admiral Edmund Giambastiani, who once headed the Navy's submarine warfare group.

ARD is located on the banks of Lake Pend Oreille, which provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean, reports FoxtrotAlpha.

At about 1150 feet, the lake is deeper than Loch Ness, while its large size, clear water and quiet conditions - provided by steep tree-lined shores and a flat muddy bottom - mean it has been a key testing location for the Navy since WWII. 

The lake also stays remarkably calm for its size and maintains a constant chilly temperature under 100 feet.

Much of the testing is done using a large network of extremely sensitive hydrophones placed in key locations on, or tethered to, the bottom of the lake.

The main testing area is called the Intermediate Scale Measuring System which is a 1,000 foot diameter circle of hydrophones mounted on the bottom of the lake or suspended via buoys.

It is a controlled environment created to evaluate a vehicle's signature and sensors.

The Buoyant Vehicle Test Range is used to measure the sound that the forward sections of a submarine design, mainly its bow, makes while moving through the water.

It allows for better bow sonar acuity and quieter subs.

The Large Scale Vehicle Range is where 1/4 scale submarines, which usually closely resemble operational subs of both past and present, go out and run through their paces under their own power.

This allows for a wide variety of items to be tested, such as a boat's wake signature, new sail designs, propeller noise, new sub-scale propulsion concepts and propulsor configurations and a design's active handling capabilities.

There are two known Large Scale Vehicles currently in service at ARD Bayview.

The LSV-1 Kokanee is a 1/4 scale model of the Seawolf Class of American subs. It is 90 feet long by ten feet wide and can travel at 3,000hp.

The second, known as LSV-2 Cutthroat, is the largest unmanned submarine in the world at 110 feet long. She was designed to be modular in nature and can travel at up to 6,000hp.

Over the years, ARD Bayview has helped save the Navy billions of dollars as they seek to develop more advanced submarines.
