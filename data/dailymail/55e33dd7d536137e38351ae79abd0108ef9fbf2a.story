Manny Pacquiao has laid the gauntlet down for Floyd Mayweather, claiming the American star is the one who 'refuses' to agree to a fight.

A bout between Mayweather and Pacquiao has already been billed as the Billion Dollar Fight, but the eight-time world champion claims he won't be angry if it never happens.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Pacquiao said: 'I'll never be frustrated if the Floyd fight doesn’t happen.'

'Though I'm ready to fight him anytime, anywhere - it's him who refuses. I’ve made it clear that I want to fight him - it’s up to him now.

'It's obvious he is avoiding a fight with me. He always makes excuses. Just make the fight and stop talking.'

Pacquiao, who faces American Chris Algieri in Macau on Saturday, also hit out a Mayweather's tendency to flash his cash on various social media sites.

The 37-year-old's most recent Instagram video showed Mayweather in a pair of boxer shorts, watching 10 scantily-clad women dance in front of him.

Alongside the video, Mayweather wrote: 'If GOD made anything better than a woman, I don't want it' #mrmylifeisthes*** #tmt #tmg''.

Pacquiao added: 'I pity him because all he thinks and does reflects the worldly aspects of life. He seems to have forgotten his spiritual nourishment.'
