The ban was introduced in case girls damaged the vehicles they were working on, leading to the possibility of compensation claims

Britain's Girl Guides are at the centre of a sexism row after being told they can no longer wash cars to raise funds.

The ban was introduced in case girls damaged the vehicles they were working on, leading to the possibility of compensation claims against the organisation. 

But Scouts are still encouraged to clean vehicles in return for payment, as they have done for decades.

Former Guides expressed their surprise at the decision, saying there should be no distinction between the sexes.

TV presenter Sue Cook said: ‘I’m amazed to hear that car washing is prohibited for Guides. I can’t think what the rationale for that can be in this day and age. My daughter earned money in the school holidays as a young teenager by car washing. If it’s OK for the boys, how can it not be OK for the girls?’

The Guides’ website lists other activities in which its members cannot participate – even though Scouts can – such as bungee jumping, paint-balling and laser games.

It even says the 550,000 members of the Girlguiding organisation, whose motto is Be Prepared, should not be involved in shooting at human or animal-shaped targets, and includes a veto on fights with water pistols.

The website states that the banned activities are deemed to be either too dangerous or go against the spirit of the organisation.

Under a section headed Car Washing: Prohibited Activity, it says the ban is ‘due to the insurance implications to Girlguiding regarding the possible damage to vehicles.’

The Guides declined to comment in more detail, despite repeated approaches by The Mail on Sunday for more information.

Girlguiding spokesman Kim Sanders said: ‘We don’t allow car washing for purely insurance reasons. Thousands of girls and women take part in a variety of activities in Guiding safely every year.’

Ironically, the insurance the Scouts have does allow them to clean cars – even though a quarter of their members are now girls.

Unity Insurance does admit on its website, however, that it has faced claims from ‘irate’ drivers. The company says that in some cases, Scouts have been to blame for causing damage, citing one occasion when ‘a bucket of water was placed on the bonnet of a car and pushed across the shiny surface’.

Yesterday, Scout leader Chris Foster, who works with youngsters in North London, said: ‘Car washing is one of our main fundraising events and will help pay for us to go to the Scout jamboree in Japan next year. We identify activities that young people want to do and whether it is appropriate to do them.

‘It’s a case of learning life qualities. We might get the Cub Scouts to do the wheels and tyres, as that’s what they can reach and do safely. The older Scouts would do the bodywork because they are able to focus more and are taller.

‘Our organisation is becoming very popular with girls because of all the exciting activities we do.’

Part of the membership fees for the Scouts (£21 a year) and the Guides (£11.80 a year) goes towards paying the annual insurance premiums for their activities.

The Guides were founded in 1910 after a group of girls gatecrashed a Scouts rally and begged the founder of the organisation, Lord Baden-Powell, to let them set up their own, similar, movement.

Those aged 15 years and over have been allowed to join the Scouts since 1976, while girls of any age have been welcomed since 1990.
