Prosecutors have withdrawn a plea deal to a Florida teen accused of having sex with her underage girlfriend after it emerged last week that the 19-year-old may have violated a court order by having sex with her 14-year-old victim as recently as two weeks ago.

The deal was still on the table as recently as Friday when details of Hunt’s continued relationship with the unnamed teen had only just been reported, along with intimate details of the contents of some 20,000 text messages the two shared following Hunt’s arrest in February.

While the deal offered Hunt the chance to avoid jail time and being branded a sex offender, the Sebastian, Florida teen could once again face both. Hunt goes to court on Tuesday where a judge will rule as to whether she must return to jail for the alleged violation.

Revoked: Kaitlyn Hunt had a plea deal on the table until investigators accused her of violating her bond terms with continued contact with her 14-year-old lover

Prosecutors in the case are pushing for an immediate arrest, though it is unlikely that will happen before the emergency hearing.

But if she’s found to be in violation of her bond, she’ll likely be led from the courtroom in handcuffs according to WPTV.

The family hopes a new lawyer, William Korman, who the Hunts have just flown into Vero Beach from Boston, Massachusetts, will help avoid that.

Court documents accuse Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, of Sebastian, Florida, of 'covertly contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it.

Almost had it? Prosecutors in the underage sex case left a second, jail sparing plea deal on the table for Hunt for days after the sordid details of her continued relationship with the girl were revealed but have now revoked it

Some of the explicit messages contain footage of Hunt 'masturbating while moaning' and the state claims Hunt and the girl had sex as recently as two weeks ago. Meanwhile, her mom Kelley Hunt Smith may have helped her daughter cover her tracks.

Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the plea deal when news of the renewed accusations broke.

According to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend recently told detectives about the illicit contact they had while Hunt was out of jail on bond awaiting trial and that Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact.'

The new evidence indicates Hunt and the girl, until recently, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High School in March.

Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded 20,000 text messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt

Criminal? Hunt could be hauled away from an emergency hearing scheduled for August 20 in cuffs if a judge finds she violated her court orders to stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend

'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told the girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.'

'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.'

The state claims to possess over 25 lewd photos the defendant sent to her lover's iPod, photos which show her fully nude and sometimes pleasuring herself.

New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her

The girl's parents have remained adamant, from the time they first brought charges against Hunt earlier this year, that she should be prosecuted as a sex offender.

The case garnered nationwide attention after Hunt's father Steven Hunt and mother Kelley Hunt Smith took the case public with social media campaigns and television appearances in support of their daughter, who had just turned 18 when her relationship with the girl began.

On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship.

'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 
'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you 
snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. 
Bye.'

The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.'

Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July

The
defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court 
documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith 
tried to help her daughter cover her tracks.

'Delete
EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete 
everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.'

Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing.

'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.'

To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.'

Ms.
Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents
make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest 
revelations.

Worldwide support: Thousands of people have protested against the prosecution of Hunt as a sex offender. But will they support her if she broke the terms of her bond with the aid of her mother?

Thousands have signed petitions in 
support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged 
with lascivious battery of a minor. But while she and her parents gave 
national interviews maintaining her consensual relationship was 
innocent, Hunt was breaking court orders that she stay away from her 
14-year-old girlfriend and could now lose a plea deal offer and face 
additional felony charges. According to the documents:

February 17, 2013: A Vero Beach court gives 'no contact' order banning Hunt from 'direct or indirect' contact with the girl

March 1:
On Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High, she slipped an iPod into 
the girl's locker and kept in almost daily contact for months and 
eventually exchanged 20,000 messages with the device

May 25: Hunt messages the girl, warning her to 'Keep the f**k' quiet

May 29: 'If my mom finds out we're talking,' wrote Hunt, 'I'm blaming it on you.'

But
Hunt's mother knew already, it seems. Back in March, documents indicate
Kelley Hunt Smith contacted the girl herself. 'PLEASE delete 
everything,' Smith wrote, 'and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken 
to Kate at all.'

'It is 
apparent that the conduct of both the defendant and Kelley Hunt Smith is
severely threatening the integrity of the judicial process,' read the 
documents.Hunt had in just 
the past month been urged to accept the deal which would have traded a 
jail time and a lifetime as a registered sex offender for probation.

The
glut of publicity included interviews in where her parents claimed 
their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 
people had signed an online petition to have the charges against the 
teenager dropped. 

If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the two original charges of lewd or lascivious battery alone.

She is now likely to face additional charges for breaking the terms of her bond.
