They may not be considered the most fearsome of creatures, but try telling this angry squirrel that.

This photograph shows the incredible moment one ground squirrel grabs another by the neck and pins it against a rock.

The series of images, taken in Jasper National Park, Alberta, northern Canada, mirrors scenes from The Simpsons in which Homer grabs his son, Bart, by the neck, shouting: 'Why you little!'

The wildlife scene mirrored the behaviour of Homer Simpson, seen here strangling his son, Bart

Fortunately for the squirrel in Bart’s position, it managed to escape the grasp and ran off.

The photographs were taken by engineer Gilles Baechler, 27, who spent a day in the park with his girlfriend.

‘My girlfriend certainly thinks they resemble Homer choking Bart but fortunately the squirrels are friends,’ he said.

‘They are just playing - not trying to kill each other.’He added: ‘The squirrels were running after each other the whole time.

‘The action went by very fast and I was happy to see how the photos turned out.’

Ground
 squirrels are typically found in western areas of Canada and the United
 States at altitudes above 3,280 feet (1,000 metres).

They hibernate from October to May and transport food in their large cheek pouches.

With
 predators including bobcats, coyotes, foxes and hawks, the omnivore’s 
do not usually live beyond the age of four, according to Switch Zoo.

Unusually, these rodents are able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect for prolonged periods of time.
