It is the genteel radio quiz show that pits amateur brainboxes against each other.

But the final of Radio 4’s Brain of Britain has been thrown into controversy after the inclusion of a ‘professional quizzer’.

The BBC has received a number of complaints after Barry Simmons qualified for next week’s final.

The 64-year-old has appeared in dozens of TV and radio quiz shows, including the BBC series Eggheads for which he makes regular, paid appearances.

Complaints: The BBC has defended Barry Simmons (third right) after complaints that he should not have been allowed to compete in Radio 4 quiz Brain of Britain. The star of tv's Eggheads is shown with his fellow panel members

He has been described as a ‘professional’ having earned tens of thousands of pounds in prize money.

His critics argue that, as such, he 
should have been barred from the show which they say should be for 
amateurs only.

The general knowledge quiz, which is in its 60th year, 
sees 48 contestants from around the country whittled down to four who 
compete in the final to win a silver salver and be declared Brain of 
Britain.

After Mr Simmons’s semi-final victory,
Robin Goundry from Bromsgrove in the West Midlands complained: ‘He is a
very experienced media broadcaster and inevitably with his ability and 
natural professionalism he dominated the whole contest and won.’

Another
listener asked the BBC’s Feedback programme on Radio 4 why a 
‘professional quizzer’ had been allowed to compete for the Brain of 
Britain title.

But Mr Simmons said: ‘If a show is 
attempting to find the Brain of Britain then it would be strange to 
exclude people who can contend for the title.’

The father of two who lives in Leeds 
with his wife Janet, a retired teacher, gave up his job as an IT 
consultant eight years ago and makes his living from taking part in 
quizzes. He declined to say how much he has earned.

Barry Simmons vented his frustration and disbelief at being criticised 
for entering radio quiz Brain of Britain. 'If a show is attempting to 
find the Brain of Britain then it would be strange to exclude people who
can contend for the title,' he said.

Nice earner: Mr Simmons appeared on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? where he won £64,000

He has appeared on a wide range of TV 
and radio programmes including Mastermind and Who Wants To Be A 
Millionaire? where he won £64,000. He even reached the final of Brain of
Britain once before, in 2009.

In 2008, he won the BBC show Are You An 
Egghead? and is now paid to record between 130 and 160 episodes a year 
of Eggheads as a member of the panel of quiz champions who are pitted 
against members of the public.

He was also a member of a team of four
that won £40,000 on the BBC show Come And Have A Go If You Think You’re
Smart Enough. The BBC has received ﬁve ofﬁcial complaints about his 
appearance in the Brain of Britain ﬁnal.

But the show’s producer, Paul Bajoria,
said: ‘It is exciting that, even after 60 years, Brain of Britain is 
seen as a prestigious enough title that people who have won quizzes all 
around the world and have got the kind of CV that Barry has got, still 
want to win and still want to take part.’
