A boy has been killed after picking up and eating a lollipop coated in rat poison that had been thrown into the yard where he was playing.

Xiao Li, six, had found the sweet lying in the front yard of his house in Liuzhuang village in eastern China's Shandong province when he picked it up, unwrapped it, and put it in his mouth.

He then went out to play hide and seek with friends and was found shortly afterwards unconscious.

Deadly: This is the lolly that Li ate, reportedly

Tragically, the lolly was covered in a substance 100 times more toxic than cyanide.

His pals ran to get help and found Li's dad Jin Hsueh, 45 who discovered his son, still unconscious, was bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth.

He said: 'They told me that Li was lying behind a bush where he had been hiding from them during a game.

'When I got there he was hardly breathing and I knew something terrible had happened.'

Li was rushed to the nearby Jining Affiliated Medical School Hospital, where medics quickly realised the condition was critical.

The lolly that Li put in his mouth was covered in TETS, or tetramethylenedisulfotetramine.

It's an odorless and tasteless poison that's fatal for humans in quantities of just 7 to 10mg and above.

It is 100 times more toxic than cyanide and there is no known antidote.

It was banned around the world in 1984 but still finds its way into China in rat poison, as it's very easy to produce. 

A hospital spokesman said: 'His internal organs had been destroyed by the poison and his blood had turned black.'

Doctors fought to save him for two days before little Li succumbed to the poison and died.

Tests carried out on the lollipop which the boy still had on him showed that it had been coated in TETS, a highly lethal neurotoxin found in rat poison.

Its use worldwide has been banned since 1984 but is still readily available in China, although illegally.

Now police suspect someone close to the family may have been responsible for his death.

A police spokesman said: 'We have checked the location of where the lollipop was in the family's yard and we found a couple more.

'The only way they could have got there is if someone walked in and put them there as it is impossible to reach from the road.

'And if they had been thrown over the wall, they would have broken. We are looking into who would have a motive to do this.'
