Mitchell Johnson has become only the second man after Ricky Ponting to claim the ICC Cricketer of the Year award twice after being named as the winner on Friday.

The Australian fast bowler tore England to shreds in last winter's Ashes series Down Under, claiming 37 wickets - including three five-wicket hauls - as Alastair Cook's men were thrashed 5-0.

Johnson, 33, was also given the ICC Test Player of the Year award for his remarkable achievements, which he continued against South Africa during 2014.
