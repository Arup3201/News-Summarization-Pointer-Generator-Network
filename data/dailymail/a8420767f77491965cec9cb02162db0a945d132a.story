Joyce Brothers, the 'mother' of pop psychologist who pioneered the television advice show in the 1950s and enjoyed a long and prolific career as a syndicated columnist, author, and television and film personality, has died. She was 85.

Brothers died Monday in New York City, according to her longtime publicist, Sanford Brokaw. 'She passed away peacefully and in her home ... with her family all around her,' said her daughter Lisa Brothers.

Brothers first gained fame on the iconic game show 'The $64,000 Question' and went on to publish 15 books and make cameo appearances on popular shows including 'Happy Days' and 'The Simpsons.' She visited Johnny Carson on 'The Tonight Show' nearly 100 times.

'I was a very big fan of hers,' said TV psychologist and author Dr. Phil McGraw on Monday to USA Today.

'I started studying psychology back in 1968 or 1969 and she was a very present force at that time.

'I truly think she was a pioneer. Here comes a woman who was articulate, educated and very credible.

'She talked about these things and took them mainstream and laid a lot of important groundwork for those to come later,' said McGraw, host of the Dr. Phil show.

'She wasn't some pop psychologist. In her advice column and her television work, gave clear analysis and advice.'

The way Brothers liked to tell it, her multimedia career came about 'because we were hungry.'

It was 1955. Her husband, Milton Brothers, was still in medical school and Brothers had just given up her teaching positions at Hunter College and Columbia University to be home with her newborn, firmly believing a child's development depended on it.

But the young family found itself struggling on her husband's residency income. So Brothers came up with the idea of entering a television quiz show as a contestant.

'The $64,000 Question' quizzed contestants in their chosen area of expertise. She memorized 20 volumes of a boxing encyclopedia — and, with that as her subject, became the only woman and the second person to ever win the show's top prize.

Brothers tried her luck again on the 
superseding '$64,000 Challenge,' answering each question correctly and 
earning the dubious distinction as one of the biggest winners in the 
history of television quiz shows.

She
 later denied any knowledge of cheating, and during a 1959 hearing in 
the quiz show scandal, a producer exonerated her of involvement.

Her celebrity opened up doors. In 1956, she became co-host of 'Sports Showcast' and frequently appeared on talk shows.

Mrs. Brothers appeared as a color commentator on CBS for a boxing match 
between Carmen Basilio and Sugar Ray Robinson, but her expertise in 
psychology became her focus once again a short time later.

Two years later, NBC offered her a trial on an afternoon television program in which she advised on love, marriage, sex and child-rearing.

Its success led to a nationally telecast program, and subsequent late-night shows that addressed such taboo subjects as menopause, frigidity, impotence and sexual enjoyment.

She also dispensed advice on several phone-in radio programs, sometimes going live. She was criticized by some for giving out advice without knowing her callers' histories.

But Brothers responded that she was not practicing therapy on the air and that she advised callers to seek professional help when needed.

Mrs. Brothers was noted for two on-air incidents in which she prevented 
troubled people from committing suicide – once in 1965, and once on 
radio in 1971.

In the latter incident, Mrs. Brothers comforted a woman 
who had overdosed on sleeping pills, and kept her on the line for three 
and a half hours, the Paley Center recalled.

Despite criticism of the format, the call-in show took off, and by 1985, the Association of Media Psychologists was created to monitor for abuses.

For almost four decades, Brothers was a columnist for Good Housekeeping. She also wrote a daily syndicated advice column that appeared in more than 350 newspapers.

A constant presence during on the small screen during the 1960s and beyond, Brothers hosted her own nationally syndicated television shows which included, 'The Dr. Joyce Brothers Show', 'Ask Dr. Brothers' and 'Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers.'

Later, Brothers branched out into film, playing herself in more than a dozen movies, including 'Analyze That' (2002), 'Beethoven's 4th' (2001), 'Lover's Knot' (1996) and 'Dear God' (1996).

She was also an advocate for women. In the 1970s, Brothers called for changing textbooks to remove sexist bias, noting that nonsexist cultures tend to be less warlike.

The quiz show scandal of 1958-59 was one of the biggest scandals in the history of television.

It erupted in 1958 when it was revealed that quiz show producers had been rigging the outcome of some shows, including 'The $64,000 Question,' by giving favored contestants the answers in advance.

Brothers was one of a number of big winners who told an Associated Press survey in November 1959 that they knew nothing of any cheating.

At a House hearing that month, associate producer Mort Koplin also said Brothers was among those not involved in cheating.

But he also described how contestants, who were carefully interviewed in advance, could be affected unknowingly as producers tried to manipulate the outcome of shows by tailoring questions to benefit favored ones and oust less-favored ones.

According to the testimony, Brothers applied to be a '64,000 Question' contestant as an expert in home economics and psychology.

The producers, looking for an audience-pleasing oddity, suggested the pretty young woman try boxing as her specialty.

She learned the subject so well, Koplin said, she kept on winning even after the producers 'threw the book' at her with tough questions aimed at eliminating her.

Born Joyce Diane Bauer in New York, Brothers earned her bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia.

She wrote numerous advice books, including 'Ten Days To A Successful Memory' (1964), 'Positive Plus: The Practical Plan for Liking Yourself Better' (1995) and 'Widowed' (1992), a guide to dealing with grief written after the death of her husband in 1990.

Brothers is survived by sister Elaine Goldsmith, daughter Lisa Brothers Arbisser, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
