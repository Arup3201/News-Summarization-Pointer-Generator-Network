Law-abiding citizens are being given the chance to follow in the footsteps of some of history’s most infamous criminals - as the wooden dock from one of the country’s busiest courts goes on public display for the first time.

Members of the public can stand in the dock from Bow Street Magistrates' Court for the first time, after it was put on display following the court’s closure in 2006.

Some of the country’s most famous criminals passed through the court room since it opened its doors in 1739 - including the Kray twins, Oscar Wilde, and more recently, Pete Doherty and hate preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri both appeared there.

Defendants passed through the busy court room before they transferred to the Old Bailey - where some, including notorious murderer Dr Crippen, were sentenced to death.

The dock was also stood in by suffragettes Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, in 1908 - when they were charged with involvement in incitement to ‘rush the House of Commons’ and jailed.

The dock is currently on display at the Galleries of Justice museum in Nottingham, where it is proving a hit with visitors.

The wooden dock - which has five seats behind it - was removed from the famous court building when it was closed down in 2006.

Bow Street served as the magistrates’ court in London from 1739 and the Bow Street Runners, the earliest professional police force, were founded there by Henry Fielding in the 1740s.

When the Metropolitan Police Service was established in 1829, a station house was sited at numbers 25 and 27 - just doors away from the court, which stood at number four.

Bow Street Magistrates' Court is located near Covent Garden in Central London
