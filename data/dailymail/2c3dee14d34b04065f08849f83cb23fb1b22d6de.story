Three Australian men who are believed to be fighting for the Islamic State after joining the Syrian conflict, have been identified as previously living in Brisbane and Melbourne.

Their identification comes as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that the government is considering sending military support to US troops in Iraq, while Britain raised their terror level to 'severe' and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced more police will patrol the streets.

Brisbane man Abu Yusseph, also known as Zia AbdulHaq, left his ex-wife and child in Brisbane before joining up with the Islamic State in Aleppo, the Weekend Australian has revealed.

Yusseph, aged in his 30s, was known to be a strong supporter of the Islamic State before he left Australia, and claimed to have been taught to fight by one of the groups' members from Gaza.

The Islamic extremist actively shares his activities over social media including photos of himself and other jihadists – some from Canada and France - being trained to use firearms.

'Every #IS #Mujahid need to carry a big knife for slaughtering the enemies. It's more fun to slaughter,' one post from Yusseph on August 18 stated.

'All foreign forces coming to Ash-Shaam and Iraq to fight #IS , our advice to them, bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers,' another post form the extremist read.

Melbourne man, Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, is another Australian man revealed to be actively participating in Islamic State activities, according to the Weekend Australian.

The Fijian and Cambodian man has previously appeared in jihadist propaganda videos, with plans for him to have a central role in a future video.

His Twitter page frequently describes Islamic State activities in real time, including the capturing of an air base, and encourages others to join the extremist group.

'Heavy Clashes in tabqa, fireworks is the agenda tonight! Please done forget the brothers in your duas (prayers)!' he posted.

Furqan, which was linked to a series of terror-related raids in 2009, was also among the pages 'liked' by Mr Raad.

A second Melbourne man, Mounir Raad, has also associated himself with the Islamic State, claiming he is in Aleppo, Syria.

He is believed to have travelled to the country alongside teenager Adam Daham who killed five people in a suicide bombing. 

At least five people suspected of being jihadists and attempting to leave the country to join the Islamic State in Iraq or Syria, have been stopped by authorities at Australian airports in the last month.

They were found to have 'large sums of cash and the possession of objectionable material,' Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said.

'Two such persons were intercepted, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, in the past week alone and I'm advised that at least five national security interceptions have now occurred.'

In Parliament on Thursday, Mr Abbott credited American President Barack Obama's authorised air strikes over Iraq. 

'If we were asked for military assistance, there would be the standard approvals process that would involve Cabinet decision making and consultation with the opposition,' he said. 

He added: 'No-one in this Parliament, I am sure, no human being anywhere, would wish to stand by and watch the preventable slaughter of innocent people. None of us would wish to see a preventable slaughter of innocent people'.Two other well documented Australians who have joined the fight in Syria include Khaled Sharrouf, who shared a picture of his son holding a decapitated head on social media, and Mohamed Elomar.
