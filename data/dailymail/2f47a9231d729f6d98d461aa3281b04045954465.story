Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Cristiano Ronaldo is in line to make his comeback from injury against Atletico Madrid on Saturday and has rubbished claims suggesting Diego Simeone's team are violent.

Ronaldo was struggling with a knee injury at the end of last season and picked up a hamstring strain last month but has been passed fit by Real Madrid's medical team.

'He is on top form,' said Ancelotti. 'He has been training very well these past three weeks and he does not have any problems.

'He is in optimal condition. He doesn't have a chronic injury. Last season he had one injury and now another. It's nothing chronic.'

Saturday's game is a rematch of the season-opening Spanish Super Cup and a chance for Real to avenge their 2-1 aggregate defeat to their city rivals, the current La Liga champions.

When asked by Spanish newspaper AS if Atletico Madrid were too aggressive, Ancelotti replied: 'No, they’re not a violent side; they are intense and aggressive but not violent. Football is a man’s game, it’s not a game for wimps.'

It is also a chance for Real's new signing Javier Hernandez to make his debut since joining on loan from Manchester United and Ancelotti said the Mexico forward may come off the bench at some point.

He is competing with France forward Karim Benzema for a place in the starting line-up.

'We are very happy with Chicharito. He won't play from the beginning on Saturday but he will be of use during the game.'

Another of Real's new signings, James Rodriguez, has so far failed to reproduce the scintillating form that won him the golden boot award at the 2014 World Cup with six goals.

Ancelotti said it was normal for a player to need time to settle in at a new club and Rodriguez, who joined the European champions from Monaco, was no different.

'It's clear that a new player needs time to adapt,' Ancelotti said.

'I am pleased with what he has done so far. It's normal that he might have the odd problem at the start.'

Real's arch rivals Barcelona are the only team to have won both their opening games and host Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
