Paddy McNair has signed a new contract with Manchester United that will run until June 2017 and has the option of a further year.

The 19-year-old made his first-team debut under Louis van Gaal against West Ham last September and has made 12 appearances in all competitions.

McNair told MUTV: 'I'm very happy. It's a boyhood dream [to be in the first team]. I never would have expected this 12 months ago but it just shows how fast football can change.

McNair has emerged as a key first-team player under Van Gaal at the Old Trafford club this season

'It's great to be playing in the first team most weeks, playing at Old Trafford and going to different stadiums, playing against some of the best teams in the world.'

Van Gaal added: 'Paddy has risen through the ranks to become an integral part of the first-team squad. He has all the attributes to develop into a top player.

'Promoting youth players is very important both to myself and to the club and I am delighted Paddy has signed a new contract.'

The Dutchman even hinted at the weekend that McNair's future could be at right-back where United have been looking at right-sided centre-back Marquinhos of PSG and Barcelona veteran Dani Alves.

He added: 'It is not only Paddy McNair who has impressed with his development, as I have given a lot of chances to younger players. But Paddy McNair has developed himself very well, not only as a central defender but now we are giving him the chance to develop as a fullback and he did it very well.

'He has done it already in the second team [Under-21s] and has done it now at a higher level in the first team. Maybe he shall be the right fullback of Manchester United for the next 10 years, you never know. He has the chance.'
