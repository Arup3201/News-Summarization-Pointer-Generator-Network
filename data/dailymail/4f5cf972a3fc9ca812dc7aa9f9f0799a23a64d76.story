For a group of professional athletes Southampton's players demonstrated some remarkably amateur skiing skills during their trip to the Alps.

Ronald Koeman took his side to the Switzerland for a mid-season break, and the Saints tried their hand a number of different activities, although not all with great success.

Captain Jose Fonte, though, said the experience had helped bring the players closer together and relieved some of the pressure ahead of the Premier League run-in.

Jose Fonte said the trip had brought the squad together and taken some of the stress of the season away

When asked about the trip, Fonte said: 'Amazing, especially today, it was fantastic. We tried skiing - it was great. I would definitely come back, I think I fall in love with it.

'Obviously the boys like the beach, like the heat, but as soon as the decision was made we embraced it and it has been a very pleasant experience for everyone. We've tried many different things.

'We already have a great team spirit and this trip came to emphasise that and take the stress and mind away from the pressure we have every week so I think that was achieved, now we come back fresh for the 10 next finals.

'The coach's idea was the air's good, it helps recovery. Lying on a sunbed maybe isn't the best thing at this time.' 

Fonte revealed that the players had tried a number of different activities but not with much success 

The players said that it had been manager Ronald Koeman's idea to go to Switzerland instead of a hot country
