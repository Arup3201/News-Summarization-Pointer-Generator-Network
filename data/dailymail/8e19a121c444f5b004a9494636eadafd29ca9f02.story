Unhappy: French actresses Lea Seydoux, left, and Adele Exarchopoulos, right, star in Blue is the Warmest Colour. They claim its director forced them to engage in humiliating acts of sex and violence

Two young actresses who star in one of the  most successful films released this year have claimed they were forced to engage in humiliating acts of sex and violence by its director.

Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux both say they will never work with Abdellatif Kechiche again following their experience filming Blue is the Warmest Colour.

Their comments are threatening to overshadow the release of the three-hour film - which won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival for its steamy and graphic portrayal of a lesbian love affair.

Critics hailed the Franco-Tunisian director as a master following the release of the film.

But now the two French actresses have painted a picture of him as over demanding during the filming of some of their no-holds-barred sex scenes.

Speaking to The Daily Beast, Exarchopoulos, 19, claimed she was expected to play out graphic lesbian sex scenes under the gaze of the director.

'Most people don't even dare to ask the things that he did and they're more respectful,' she said.

The actresses also claimed that Kechiche ordered them to spend 10 days - mostly naked - filming a sex scene which last just ten minutes in the film.

It is also claimed the two stars shot their first encounter scene - which lasts 30 seconds -  more than 100 times in one day.

As reported by The Times, Exarchopoulos said the most difficult scene to film came when the two characters had a fight after arguing with each other.

Seydoux claims the director told her to slap her co-star for real, which left the two actresses resenting their treatment at the hands of the director.

Exarchopoulos claims Kechiche 
screamed repeatedly for Seydoux to hit her co-star. She said: 'You can 
see that we were really suffering.'

In May, the film won the prestigious Palme d’Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, which was described as the most sensational win at Cannes in years.

One scene includes a no-holds-barred twelve minute erotic sex scene between the two women that leaves nothing to the imagination.

Despite the controversy surrounding the film - it has been hailed as a classic because of the performances of its two young stars.
