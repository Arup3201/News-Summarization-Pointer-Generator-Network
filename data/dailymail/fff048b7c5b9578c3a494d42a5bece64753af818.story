He owns a £7million home, earns £1.2million a year running a bank bailed out by the taxpayer and reluctantly bowed to pressure and declined a £963,000 bonus.

But Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester says ‘life is not about money’.

Mr Hester told pupils at a South London school that life ‘is about doing things that make you feel valuable, not necessarily measured by money’.

Controversial: Stephen Hester, 51, who hates this picture being used, has been criticised for his fat-cat pay

But he added: ‘Like it or not, money is one of the things that motivates people.’

Mr Hester, 51, has become a lightning rod for anger over fat-cat pay, attracting criticism for his lavish lifestyle despite presiding over a bank that was bailed out with £45.5billion of taxpayers’ money.

Last month he invited the public to see the manicured 350-acre gardens of his £7million home, just outside Banbury in Oxfordshire.

In January, after weeks of holding out, the controversial bank boss waived his bonus for last year after intense media and political pressure.

Asked by a pupil at Dunraven School in Streatham whether he declined his bonus because he thought it was immoral, Mr Hester replied: ‘I want to be paid well – I have no hesitation about saying that.

‘There’s no morality involved and it allows me to pay a large amount of tax for other things to be done.’

Mr Hester branded criticism of his pay ‘unfair’ and said he ‘came within inches of quitting’ during the row over his bonus.

Pendragon, have faced rebellions from shareholders over boardroom greed

He added: ‘We are in a time of high emotion, people looking for things to blame.

‘If you have a high-profile job as I have, at times you get caught in the swirls of politics.

‘It was a tsunami at the time, I think it caught me unfairly, but nevertheless I’m a volunteer in this job; you have to deal with what it throws you.’

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says RBS should lend small businesses money so they can employ young people

RBS, which is 82 per cent owned by taxpayers and plunged to a £2billion loss last year, will face its shareholders at its annual meeting later this month.

Asked whether the reputation of bankers could be restored, Mr Hester said: ‘People have hated money lenders for thousands of years.’

The RBS chief’s unapologetic words resulted in a fresh salvo from his critics.

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘What would make small businesses feel  valuable is if RBS could lend them the money so they can employ young people.’

High Pay Centre chairman Deborah Hargreaves said: ‘It’s a bit rich of Hester to say this when he employs eight gardeners to keep his 350-acre landscaped garden.

‘He should remember he is talking to people who won’t earn in a lifetime what he earns in a year. He makes a strong case for cutting pay across the board.’
