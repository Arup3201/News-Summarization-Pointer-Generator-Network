Barack Obama danced his way into Tanzania today on the final leg of his tour of Africa - and while he is there he is set to be welcomed by a familiar face.

The President's predecessor George W. Bush will also be in the the country addressing a conference on African women, and the two men are planning to meet at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam tomorrow.

Mr Obama and Mr Bush will lay a wreath to commemorate the embassy bombing which killed 11 people in 1998.

The current President has flown in from South Africa after first visiting Senegal in a trip to promote ties between the U.S. and Africa's leading democracies.

The biggest events on the scheduled trip are his multiple meetings with the president of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, as well as a number of American and African business hoping to boost trade in the region.

In his toast at the state dinner, President Obama marked the way that increased security through the past half century have changed the nature of American political visits to Tanzania, as he said that Robert Kennedy was able to ride in an open-top truck when he visited the African nation but President Obama was forced to ride in his fortified 'Beast' limousine.

'When Kennedy came, it was a public holiday here. I apologize to Tanzanians that you all had to work today,' Mr Obama said at the dinner.

He went on to praise President Kikwete's vision for progress throughout the country, saying hat he has 'shown wisdom and strength in seeking reforms so that more Tanzanians can enjoy progress, more opportunity'.

They decided to forgo superstition and cheers with water during the dinner held at the state house in Dar Es Salaam.

Tomorrow morning he will link up with Mr Bush at the embassy before delivering a speech on electricity in Africa, and will then fly back to Washington.

The presidents' brief meeting highlights how the U.S. philosophy on relations with the developing continent has evolved since the time when Bush was in office.

Obama praised Bush's funding for AIDS treatment in particular during a news conference with President Jakaya Kikwete, shortly after his arrival to teeming crowds cheering along his motorcade route.

'I think this is one of his crowning achievements,' Obama said of Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

'Because of the commitment of the Bush administration and the American people, millions of lives have been saved.'

But Obama said he wants to change the approach.

'We are looking at a new model that's based not just on aid and assistance, but on trade and partnership,' he said.

For example, he said he doesn't want to just provide food aid but help for Tanzanians to grow their own.

'Ultimately, the goal here is for Africa to build Africa for Africans,' Obama said. 'And our job is to be a partner in that process.'

His Republican predecessor is attending a conference organised by the George W. Bush Institute.

The two men's wives, Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, will team up at the conference for a discussion on promoting women's education, health and employment.

Mr Bush has focussed much of his charitable work on Africa since leaving office, and is remembered fondly on the continent for his work there while he was President.

On Sunday, Mr Obama publicly praised him for saving millions of lives with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

Obama's motorcade to slow at times as it sped along a main thoroughfare that's been permanently renamed 'Barack Obama Drive'- a sign that the visit from America's first president of African descent has resonated deeply with Tanzania's people

'The United States has really done wonderful work through the PEPFAR program, started under my predecessor, President Bush, and continued through our administration,' he said in Cape Town.

By contrast, Mr Obama has only visited Africa once before during his presidency, and has not prioritised the continent despite the fact that his father was from Kenya.

Last week he blamed the fiscal squeeze and domestic politics for his apparent sidelining of Africa, claiming that Mr Bush had a lot more freedom of movement.

'Given the budget constraints, for us to try to get the kind of money that President Bush was able to get out of the Republican House for massively scaled new foreign aid programs is very difficult,' Mr Obama said.

'We could do even more with more resources. But if we're working smarter, the amount of good that we can bring about over the next decade is tremendous.'

Foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes said that having both leaders in one African country at the same time 'sends a very positive message that both political parties in the United States share a commitment to this continent'.
