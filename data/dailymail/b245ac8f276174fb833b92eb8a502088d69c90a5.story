ITV has ducked a head-to-head news battle during Baroness Thatcher's funeral by choosing to pit Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby against David Dimbleby.

The BBC will run a three-hour special from a studio overlooking St Paul's Cathedral this Wednesday but ITV still plan to run Daybreak and This Morning, cutting away to events as they happen.

ITV bosses have shown faith in the This Morning team after a series of scandals in recent months.

Head to head: The BBC has chosen to have a three-hour special hosted by David Dimbleby but ITV will cut to and from Phllip Schofield and Holly Willoughby's This Morning during Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday

In November Mr Schofield and ITV today agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name.

Will you be watching Baroness Thatcher's funeral on BBC or ITV?

Tory peer Lord McAlpine was subjected to lurid online claims falsely linking him to sexual abuse at a north Wales care home which Schofield attempted to bring to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning.

McAlpine's lawyer Andrew Reid said the incident has 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client'.

Three months later they were forced to make another grovelling on-air apology after pictures showing the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in her bikini were shown to millions of viewers.

There has also been criticism of Holly Willougby's abilities as a presenter, which will be tested during the Iron Lady's final journey.

Criticism: Agent Jon Roseman, who represented Jill Dando and Natasha Kaplinsky, questioned Holly Willoughby's abilities as a presenter this week

Super-agent Jon Roseman, who represented Jill Dando, Anne Diamond, Natasha Kaplinsky and Fern Britton described her as a 'bimbo' this week.

'Just in case you ever wondered what was so wrong with television today, you need look no further than presenter Holly Willoughby and the news that she is on her way to amassing a £10 million fortune,' he said.

'How has she done it? Not by showing a single flicker of talent, that’s for sure.

'Every word that drops from Holly’s finely formed lips proves just how ill-equipped she is to be a television frontwoman. Indeed, the fact she’s got the job at all, let alone that she’s so well-paid, shows just how far female presenters have sunk today'.

74-year-old Dimbleby has been the mainstay of state occasions for the BBC, covering the funerals of Princess Diana and the Queen 
Mother.

Lady Thatcher's funeral will be particularly significant for him as 
his father Richard commentated on Winston Churchill's in 1965, before 
dying himself a year later.

He was said to be shocked and upset that Huw Edwards was given the honour of hosting the BBC's royal wedding coverage, ahead of David Dimbleby.

Edwards was chosen despite his older rival having been the voice of most state occasions in recent decades.

Dimbleby was widely expected to front the broadcast, having covered Princess Diana's funeral and the Queen's golden jubilee, but it was reported that he will have no involvement as he is now seen primarily as a political anchor.

ITV and the BBC will both be covering Baroness Thatcher's funeral, but in very different ways.

State occasion stalwart David Dimbleby will commentate for the Corporation during a three-hour special from St Paul's while ITV will cut to it during its normal shows, including This Morning presented by Holly Willoughby.
