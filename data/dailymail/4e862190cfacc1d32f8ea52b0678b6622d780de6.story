A gang that trafficked Hungarian women into the country where they were forced into sham marriages with Pakistani men has been jailed for more than 
13 years.

Hungarian Sandor Orsos, 48, and Pakistani Shahbaz Khan, 26, were the ringleaders in a criminal circle that trafficked three women into the UK through the port of Dover.

While in the country, the women were the forced into the sham marriages in early 2013, in Bury, Greater Manchester.

The gang were caught and arrested in August and October, following a Home Office criminal investigation into the marriages.

The three young women have now returned to their home country.

A third gang member, Amjad Khan, 33, was found guilty of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration after a trial at Bolton Crown Court

Orsos and Shahbaz Khan pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration, with Khan also pleading guilty to trafficking.

A third gang member, Amjad Khan, 33, was found guilty of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration after a trial at Bolton Crown Court.

Shahbaz Khan, 26, of Bury, was jailed for six years and three months.

Orsos, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was jailed for four years and six months. Amjad Khan, of Bury, received a three-year sentence.

The three men will be subject to automatic deportation orders at the end of their sentences.

Nick Wood from Home Office Criminal Investigations said: 'These women were given false promises and trafficked for the sake of taking part on sham marriages.

'We have worked closely with our partners in Europol and the Hungarian National Police service to successfully stop these criminals who have actively targeted and manipulated vulnerable young women.

'Trafficking is an abhorrent crime and this case sends a clear message to those involved that we will track you down and bring you to justice.'Â
