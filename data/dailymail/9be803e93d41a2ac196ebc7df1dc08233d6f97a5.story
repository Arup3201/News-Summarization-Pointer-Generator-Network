New Yorkers were mystified on Tuesday after spotting what appeared to be skinned goat heads dangling from a lamppost at a busy intersection.

The skulls dangled over Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street in Park Slope until just before noon when an employee at the nearby business Continental Car Service knocked them down and chucked them in the trash.

Prior to their removal, another unidentified man tried to knock down the hanging carcasses with a metal rod but he quickly gave up.

Animal heads: New Yorkers were mystified on Tuesday after spotting what appeared to be skinned goat heads dangling from a lamp post at a busy intersection at Ninth Street and Fifth Ave in Park Slope

Failed attempt: One man tried to knock over the animal heads with a metal pole but he eventually gave up 

Police were called at around 11:00 on Tuesday and an investigation is ongoing to find a suspect.

The MailOnline spoke to an employee at Continental Car Service who said he's baffled by the incident.

'I haven't seen anything like this in the 17 years I've been here,' he said.

The dangling animal heads surrounded by a swarm of flies in the posh residential area has some wondering whether or not voodoo may be involved. 

'Maybe it's some of those wackos who go for Santeria or voodoo," said local resident Louis Katenzakes to DNAinfo.

'It's the occult. They do rituals. They kill animals.

A butcher at Aloor Halal Meat Market nearby, Lorenzo Hernandez, said that the heads definitely belonged to goats and that they appeared to be jaggedly cut by hand instead of by machine.

He told DNAinfo that he sells goat meat at his shop everyday but that people generally use the meat for food,.

Trashed: The mysterious animal heads were chucked in the trash after being spotted dangling from a lamppost in Brooklyn 

'Most people use it for food,' Hernandez said.

'The head especially, for soup.'

Mohamad Almerdie whose family owns the building on the corner where the heads were found told DNAinfo that he's seen many goat heads but not on poles.

'In my country... You take the head off, then you put it in the oven. It tastes good. It's expensive, too. They say it's good for the body," said Almerdaie who is from Yemen.

'Over here, I don't know what it means,' he added.

Gothamist spoke to some Brooklynites who stopped to stare at the strange sight.

'That's disgusting—I got to show my sister,' said Mickey Guzman as he snapped some photos of the lamppost.

'That's messed up,' said 9-year-old Aiden Rahieb.

'That's some sick s**t. I don't want no part of that s**t. You see those bottles with names and oils in them at Prospect Park? Don't ever touch them. We got witches out here,' said J.C. Rivera.

This isn't the first time dead animals have been found in Brooklyn, either.

Severed goat heads and rooster heads were found in Prospect Park in March.

The New York Post reports that severed heads also found in Prospect Park in 2010 were linked to Santeria.
