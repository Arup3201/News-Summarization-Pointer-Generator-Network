A banker and his wife waged a ‘sinister and devious’ campaign of harassment against a vulnerable neighbour to try to increase the sale value of their home, a court heard yesterday.

Church warden Sandra Saxton, 69, was attacked and injured by retired City financier Peter Bayliss, who falsely told police and social services she had gone mad to try to get her put in a mental hospital.

Bayliss, 62, and his artist wife Kim, 53, wanted the deaf pensioner out of the way after they clashed over a 12-inch strip of land at the back of their gardens, which gave Mrs Saxton right of way behind their property.

Retired City banker Peter Bayliss and his wife Kim made a 'troubling and sinister' bid to have a deaf pensioner sectioned under the Mental Health Act so they could boost their property's value, a court heard

The dispute was over a tiny strip of land behind a cottage belonging to Mr Bayliss' mother in Westerham, Kent

The couple were angry at losing a court battle with her over the right of way in Westerham, Kent, in 2009, and began spreading lies about her.

Yesterday Judge Nigel Gerald made a stinging attack on the couple, saying they had destroyed what was once a ‘happy little community’. They will have to pay damages and costs of £338,000 – more than the value of the home they were trying to sell.

He condemned the ‘sheer awfulness’ of their attempts to have Mrs Saxton sectioned under the Mental Health Act, saying: ‘She suffered and suffers from no mental health ailments.

‘The purpose of the letters [to social services] were to get Mrs Saxton sectioned, to get her removed from her home so she could no longer exercise her right of way and maintain her boundary fence, leaving the way open for the Baylisses to sell, free of any adverse rights.’

Central London County Court heard that in 2008 Mr Bayliss’s mother moved into a care home, leaving her son in charge as the sole heir to her £315,000 home.

Victim: The court heard that Mrs Saxton had never had any mental problems at all and had used the right of way for more than 20 years when the older Mrs Bayliss lived next door without any trouble

Mrs Saxton had used the right of way for 20 years, but it soon became an issue with Mr and Mrs Bayliss, described as ‘dishonest, devious and manipulative’ by the judge. They wanted to stop access along the strip of land and absorb it into their garden, making it bigger, thinking they would get a better price and an easier sale, it was alleged.

The court heard Mrs Saxton, a carer for the disabled, suffered whiplash when she was violently grabbed and shaken by Mr Bayliss as she tried to use the right of way in July 2009.

He also wrote letters to Sevenoaks Council, falsely claiming Mrs Saxton had attacked him and ‘could not be safely let out on her own, due to her rapidly deteriorating mental health condition’.

One letter said: ‘We consider that we are at risk of further physical assault by her ... we request you formally to arrange her removal from her property to a home.’

The judge said that what had been a 'happy little community where neighbours helped each other' changed

On another occasion the couple reported Mrs Saxton to police and falsely accused her of assault after an altercation when the couple glued shut the access gate.

The judge said: ‘The campaign combined physical obstruction and assault with direct and indirect mental manipulation and abuse designed to destabilize Mrs Saxton and turn her neighbours against her.’

He ordered the couple to pay Mrs Saxton £25,000 damages for harassment, £1,750 for nuisance, plus £10,000 exemplary damages. Mr Bayliss alone was ordered to pay £2,000 for assault. He also told them to pay costs, estimated to be in the region of £300,000.
