A gang of armed robbers dressed up as firefighters as a ruse to gain access to safe rooms before holding up shops at gunpoint.

Darren Lloyd, 35, was the mastermind who led the group as they repeatedly raided cash-in-transit deliveries in east London, using stolen cars and false number plates.

The robbers, who included a former police officer, were being watched by Flying Squad detectives as they staked out targets throughout the summer and autumn of last year.

Today Lloyd was facing years behind bars after being found guilty of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob.

Six other men had already admitted similar offences.

By December the gang changed their strategy by deploying a robber inside shops, dressed in the distinctive maroon firefighter's uniform and yellow helmet to gain access to safe rooms.

Lloyd planned 12 separate raids which netted at least £43,000. Some of them were cancelled at short notice.

London fireman Russell Williams, 39, 
was recruited to supply bona fide uniforms to ex-police officer Gary 
Griffiths, 42, who wore the distinctive kit and armed himself with a 
pistol to threaten shop staff and demand cash.

Griffiths was caught after a detective spotted the 'distinctive features' of his former colleague on CCTV.

Weapon recovered: An imitation firearm found in December last year as police arrested ringleader Darren Lloyd

Darren Lloyd was arrested by armed officers in December last year when he was caught red-handed as he scrambled from the wreckage of a high-powered Volvo getaway car, having crashed in to a garden during a police chase.

Two imitation handguns he had discarded were found nearby and a shop till was still inside the vehicle.

Lloyd's capture ended a year-long Flying Squad operation to round-up members of the robbery team, who had been committing crimes just a few streets away from their own homes in east London.

Prosecutor Michael Shaw said: 'They were a pretty close-knit bunch and generally robbed locations close to where they lived, venues they were familiar with and knew how to get away from.'

The robberies were clustered around Dagenham and Chadwell Heath in London.

Lloyd, from Dagenham, Essex, was 
convicted of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob between July 1 and December 
14 last year and four counts of having an imitation firearm with intent,
after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey.

Five
others - Griffiths, Joshua McEvilley, Ben Garforth, Jason Stacey and 
Peter Henderson have all admitted their involvement in the conspiracy 
and will be sentenced alongside Lloyd on a date to be fixed.

An
eighth man, Russell Williams, a firefighter, 39, from Cheshunt, 
Hertfordshire, had previously pleaded guilty to assisting an offender.

The court heard Griffiths, 42, was captured on camera inside Premier Foods in Dagenham, Essex, posing as a firefighter on December 5 last year and stealing £2,000 in takings.

Griffiths could be seen asking to be directed in to a back room where he brandished an imitation firearm and took the cash.

Shop assistant Sivavakeethar Sivakumaran said: 'He asked if there was a fire alarm going on and said they had some alarm on their system.

'He was in uniform and I didn't even think about it. I just thought it was a fireman. Then he came to the office and pulled a gun on me and asked for the safe.'

On that occasion Lloyd, the second robber, wearing a distinctive patterned bandana across his face, waited at the front door of the shop to make sure they were not disturbed.

Both men then fled in a black VW Passat which was waiting outside.

Detective Constable Andy Burrows later spotted Griffiths, who he first met when he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1994, on the footage.

'When I began I was based at Bethnal Green police station,' said Det Con Burrows. 'I met Gary Griffiths there. We both played rugby for the station side and I played against him in Sunday matches.

'He is known to me as an associate and from looking at the CCTV the person wearing the uniform is Gary Griffiths.

'There are several points in the footage when his face is directed towards the camera and it is from these shots of his face that I can recognise him.

'His face has distinctive features, especially his nose, which is broken in a few places.'

After the verdict, Detective Superintendent John Kielty, from the Flying Squad, said: 'These men made a lucrative career of carrying out robberies and were a highly organised and violent team. They carefully planned their actions and targets using disguises and firearms during offences.

'The Flying Squad began a proactive operation against these armed criminals to make sure they were held to account for the fear they subjected their victims to during these robberies.

'The gang were responsible for a significant number of crimes in Dagenham and the surrounding areas and I'm very pleased at today's convictions which bring an end to this complex investigation by the Flying Squad.'

Dave Brown, Assistant Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade's Operations and Mobilising, said: 'If members of the public have any concerns about the identity of our staff they should ask to see their ID card. If people are still unsure they can call the number on the card to verify the identity of the firefighter.'
