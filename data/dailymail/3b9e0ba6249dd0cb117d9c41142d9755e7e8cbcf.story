The clocks may be going forward this weekend, but the weather is set to take a step back into winter - with rain, gales and even snow.

Heavy rain and wind is set to move in tomorrow with gusts of up to 65mph expected in some parts of the North of England and Scotland.

But the stormier weather is also set to drive in milder air with temperatures in some areas of the South reaching 14C (57F) on Saturday morning.

Heavy rain is set to sweep in across the South and heavy winds gusting up to 65mph could hit parts of the North on Saturday along with wintry showers on higher ground

It will be much colder in the north with wintry showers expected to bring snow over high ground and the Met Office has issued a yellow warning of wind across Scotland and northern England on Saturday.

Forecaster Dan Williams said: 'It is not looking like a nice weekend at all with some strong winds especially in the north.

'There is a continuing risk of gales into the start of next week with gusts of 65mph and heavy rain for most parts of the country. It is going to be fairly mild in parts though.'

Strong winds are expected to continue to hit the country on Sunday and into Monday, with heavy rain, particularly in the west. Temperatures will be milder in the south but it will feel cold in the wind.

Wind and rain is set to sweep across Britain from early tomorrow morning - although it could clear by later in the afternoon when it will feel much cooler

The wind will start to die down on Tuesday, but temperatures are expected to dip to 10C in London. Showers are also expected, which could turn wintry in the north and snow may settle overnight.

Wednesday is set to see blustery showers in the north, which could become wintry in the north east. There will be cloud and rain in the south and west and a risk of overnight frost.

'People should make the most of the weather today,' said Nicola Maxey, of the Met Office.

'It is going to be an unsettled weekend, with gale force winds in the north, cloud and rain.'
