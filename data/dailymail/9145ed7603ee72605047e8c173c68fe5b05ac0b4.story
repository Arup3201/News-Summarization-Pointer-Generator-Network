A high school freshman has been caught on video allegedly punching his substitute teacher and putting him in a headlock, because he said he couldn't go to the bathroom.

The vicious attack on part-time faculty member and football coach Ron Santavicca at Gorton High School in Yonkers, New York, was recorded on a cell phone by another student in the hallway.

The 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, is seen hitting the teacher and swearing as he grabs his head.

Horrifying: The attack on teacher Ron Santavicca at Gorton High School in Yonkers, New York, was recorded on a cell phone by another student

Screaming: The 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, is seen hitting the teacher and swearing during the altercation that took place in the corridor 

Witnesses described how the teacher told the student he could not leave after asking if he could use the restroom - prompting him to react violently. 

Senior Rocio Vidao told CBS New York: 'The teacher was, like, telling him, "Don’t leave," and then the kid came out of the classroom, and the teacher went after him, and that’s when the kid attacked the teacher.

'It’s not supposed to be like that, you know. When a teacher says no, it’s supposed to be a no.' 

Police were called in to investigate the incident, but the student has not been arrested or charged.

Yonkers School District have however suspended him for five days and have arranged a superintendent's board meeting, according to NBC New York. 

Jairo Veras, a teacher at another school in the area, told the station the attack was troubling.

'I don't see any respect for the teacher, the authority in the school,' said Veras. 'It's a really, really bad situation.' 

Mr Santavicca was not injured during the alleged attack and will not be allowed to teach at a school in Yonkers during the investigation.
