A married couple who identify as polyamorists have opened up about their unconventional relationship, revealing how an active sex life boosts their mood and keeps them fit.

Kamala Devi and Michael McClure, aged 38 and 49 respectively, swore off monogamy from day one. They have up to a dozen different lovers each - some to themselves and some who they share.

Six months ago they welcomed 27-year-old bisexual Rachel Rickards into their home in San Diego, California, and now the three of them enjoy each other's company - and bodies.

'One of my favoroite things since we 
all lived together is actually the fact that we do more exercise. It's 
so improved my live,' Ms Devi told ABC News, while Mr McClure 
interjected: 'And your butt.'

They
 say that Ms Rickards also provides a helping hand when it comes to 
raising their six-year-old son, Devin. He was educated about his unusual
 family set-up from a young age.

Addressing concerns about how he might be effected by the situation Mr McClure said: 'He understands the word "polyamory."

'He understands what that means. He doesn't really know what sex is yet.'

'He has so much love and he has so 
many aunties and uncles,' Ms Devi also said in a previous interview, likening her lovers to family 
members.

Indeed, Devin appears to enjoy having 'two mothers' around the house.

In one frame during the ABC News interview the youngster says: 'I'm so grateful for this loving family that lives here.'

'When he goes to school and in ten years brings dates home, this is probably going to be a little complicated for him'

For those who maybe confused as to 
what polyamory is, Dr Karen Stewart, a sex therapist in Los Angeles, 
said: 'Polyamory is not about being swingers. It's not about the one-off
 weekend with the couple we met at the bar.

'It's about forming long and lasting and loving relationships.'

However, she admitted that Ms Devi and 
Mr McClure's son might find their polyamorous relationship hard to 
understand later in life, especially when he realizes that friends' 
situations are different.

'When he goes to school and in ten 
years brings dates home, this is probably going to be a little 
complicated for him,' she said.

Spreading the word: Ms Devi works full-time as a sex and relationship coach and has published books

'I'm not sure if the parents are thinking down the road about that.'

But Ms Devi believes by the time Devin is a teenager polyamory will be 'a new paradigm'.

'It is quite normal already. It's just not out of the closet,' Mr McClure added.

'Polygamy is actually quite normal already. It's just not out of the closet yet'

It was originally his decision to have Ms Rickards move in, after he met the pretty brunette on holiday.

Ms
 Devi, a full-time sex and relationship coach, approved the arrangement 
because she saw her husband so 'happy' – not because she was worried 
about losing him to a younger model.

In
 fact, she 
had been dating another woman named Roxanne for two years anyway and 
only saw it fair that Mr McClure pursued someone of interest too.

Ms
 Rickards, who also divides her time between two boyfriends and a 
girlfriend, isn't the first person to have lived with Ms Devi and Mr 
McClure.

Tahl Gruer and Jennifer Gold, who have been married for nine years and practicing polyamory for three, cohabited with the couple for two years.

During their time together the foursome enjoyed exploring meditation, yoga and Tantric sex.

In one YouTube video, the four are seen cosied up on a sofa giving tips on how to have 'sizzling sex'.

'Polyamory is not about the one-off weekend with the couple we met at the bar. It's about forming lasting relationships'

And
 photos of them on Facebook show them partner swapping, with Mr Gruer 
planting a kiss on Ms Devi's cheek in one shot and touching Mr McClure's
 clothed thigh in another.

Ms Devi and Mr McClure say the three rules they live by are, 'safe sex', 'no drama' and 'honesty'.

'That first rule is really about making sure that we've created the space to have the conversation,' Ms Devi explained.

This kind of 'polyamorous' relationship is becoming increasingly common, experts say.

Future ambition: The couple's (pictured center) aim is to continue growing their polyamorous community and 'potentially even get a hotel'

"The divorce rate in the United States is
 over 50per cent. People are not staying nearly as faithful they 
used to,' said Dr. Stewart.

'The
 world has become a much smaller place. We can seek out connections, 
there's dating sites on every street corner. You can go anywhere to meet
 someone now.'

Ms Devi and Mr McClure, who have been married for 12 years, say their aim is to continue growing their polyamorous community and 'potentially even get a hotel' where they can stay with all of their lovers combined.
