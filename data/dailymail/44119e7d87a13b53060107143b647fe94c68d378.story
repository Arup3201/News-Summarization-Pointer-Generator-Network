Black market gangs are marauding across the countryside and cashing in on one of the best mushroom crops in years after 'perfect' growing conditions this summer.

They are stripping fields of tons of mushrooms which are sold in cut-price deals to traders supplying top hotels and restaurants - leaving the cupboard bare for families who want a few fungi as a mealtime treat.

The gangs - many thought to be Eastern Europeans - are making a fortune because top London restaurants will pay over £50 a kilo for mushrooms.

Gangs are stripping forests of mushrooms before selling them for up to £50 a kilo to traders on the black market

The gang behaviour means that the cupboard is bare for families who want to pick their own mushrooms. In a year where there has been a bumper harvest

Professional picker Nick Weston, who runs a foraging school in Sussex to teach people what is safe fungi and what is potentially deadly, said "Gangs are going into places like Epping and Ashdown forests.

"They employ a mycologist - a mushroom expert - and strip every fungus in sight.

"Everything not declared edible is then just chucked. It needs more governance."

The Forestry Commission allows people to pick up to 1.5kgs of fungi at a time.

After one of the wettest winters and 
coldest springs on record, the countryside is displaying one of the most
abundant wild harvests seen in years.

But experts warn pickers to beware because many fungi are poisonous and could even kill if they are eaten.

They say families should arm themselves 
with guide books and leave well alone if they are not 100 per cent 
confident that a fungus is edible.

Under the law you are not stealing if you
go into someone's fields to pick mushrooms although the landowner can 
turf you off for trespassing on private property.

Provided you immediately leave and don't act in a threatening or provocative manner, you are not likely to be prosecuted
