Liberia is facing an excruciating choice - deciding which handful of Ebola patients will receive an experimental drug that could prove either life-saving or life-threatening.

ZMapp, the untested Ebola drug, arrived in the West African country late yesterday.

Liberia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Augustine Ngufuan, couriered the two boxes of Zmapp himself on a commercial flight from the U.S. to Monrovia, where it was unloaded at a VIP terminal.

Important delivery: The drug will be taken to a hospital in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, and administered to Zukunis Ireland and Abraham Borbor, two Liberian doctors who caught Ebola virus while treating patients

An airport worker carries the Zmapp from the plane: With only around 10 to 12 doses of Zmapp available, and no knowledge about the drug's potential side effects, there are difficult ethical questions to be considered

The drug is unloaded: The doctors will be the first Africans to receive the treatment, though it has already been given to a Spanish priest who later died and two U.S. aid workers who are reportedly showing signs of recovery

Assistant health minister Tolbert Nyenswah said three or four people would begin getting it today. The government has said two doctors will receive the treatment, but it was unclear who else would.

These are the last known doses of ZMapp left in the world. The US-based company that developed it has said it will take months to build up even a modest supply.  

West Africa's Ebola virus outbreak has overwhelmed the region's already strained health systems and sparked an international debate over the ethics of giving drugs that have not yet been tested for safety or efficacy to the sick.

The charity group Doctors Without Borders, which is running many of the Ebola treatment centres and whose staff have tussled with whether to provide ZMapp, said such choices present 'an impossible dilemma'.

Now Liberian officials are facing those questions. The first Liberian patients expected to be given Zmapp will be Zukunis Ireland and Abraham Borbor, two doctors who caught Ebola virus while treating patients.

'The criteria of selection is difficult, but it is going to be done,' said Dr Moses Massaquoi, who helped Liberia obtain the drug from Mapp Biopharmaceutical.

'We are going to look at how critical people are. We are definitely going to be focusing on medical staff.' Dr Massaquoi said people who were past the 'critical phase' and looked likely to survive would not be treated with it.  

The World Health Organisation told Reuters only around 10 to 12 doses of the drug have been made and this raises difficult ethical questions about who should get priority access.

The worst-ever outbreak of Ebola has already claimed the lives of 1,069 people and there are 1,975 probable and suspected cases, the vast majority in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the UN health agency.

The doctors will be the first Africans to receive the treatment, though it has already been given to a Spanish priest who later died and two U.S. aid workers who are reported to have shown signs of recovery.

Authorities are also concerned that ZMapp's unproven status could leave them open to the charge that humans are being used as guinea pigs.

'This is not the panacea to the problem. It is at the risk of the patient,' Liberia's Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah told journalists at Monrovia's main airport.

Information Minister Lewis Brown told Reuters the drug merely offered a 'glimmer of hope' and its use was little more than a gamble.

Even so, the clamour for it is strong given that the contagious haemorrhagic disease is killing more than half of its victims and there is no known cure or vaccine.

'I welcome it. It is very good. Our nurses are dying. If you bring them the medication it will make them stronger to fight Ebola,' said stationery seller James Liburd, in Monrovia.

But highlighting the dilemma, Melvin Korkor, the first Liberian doctor to survive Ebola, said he would not have used ZMapp when he was fighting for his life because U.S. authorities said they were not responsible for any adverse effects.

'Any drug that has not been approved by FDA should not be administered,' he told Reuters.

And doctors treating a Sierra Leonean physician, Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, defended their decision not to give him the experimental drug, saying today they feared it was too risky.

Calling it 'an impossible dilemma,' Doctors Without Borders explained in detail last month's decision in response to a New York Times story on the case.

It would have been the first time the experimental drug was tried in humans but at the time that the experimental treatment was being considered for Dr Khan, his immune system was already starting to produce antibodies suggesting he might recover, Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.

Dr Khan was also due to be transferred to a European hospital that would be more capable of handling problems that might arise, it said.

One of the epidemic's most tragic consequences is the toll on health care workers who have become infected themselves due to inadequate protection or diagnoses of patients that came too late or were inaccurate.

The World Health Organization said this week that 170 health care workers had been infected and at least 81 had died. Another Sierra Leonean doctor, Modupeh Cole, became the latest medical practitioner to die of Ebola, a health ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.

He contracted the disease after treating a patient who later proved to have the virus and died.

His death followed that of Dr Khan, Sierra Leone's leading Ebola doctor, who was offered Zmapp, only for medics from Doctors Without Borders to decide no to give it to him. 

The experimental drug, ZMapp, is designed to boost the immune system to help it fight the virus. Since Dr Khan's body was already producing an immune response, the doctors may have feared that any boost would kick it into overdrive.

In the end, the treating physicians decided against using the drug. They never told Dr Khan of its existence because they felt it would be unethical to tell him of a treatment they might not use.

Shortly after their decision, however, Dr Khan's condition worsened, the statement said, and the company providing the medical evacuation decided not to transfer him. He died a few days later, on July 29.

'Every day, doctors have to make choices, sometimes difficult, about treatment for their patients,' said the Doctors Without Borders statement.

'Trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult decision, particularly in the light of the "do no harm" principle.'

Meanwhile, eight Chinese health workers are in quarantine in Sierra Leone because they may have contracted Ebola, according to the spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Freetown, Xu Zhou. 

The seven doctors and one nurse treated patients at two Chinese-run hospitals in Freetown who later died from Ebola. One of the doctors has emerged from quarantine after a 21-day observation period, Mr Zhou told Reuters.

Despite the stir caused by ZMapp, preventive public health measures will be crucial to containing the outbreak, according to the U.N. health agency.

As a result, West African and other governments, including some which have seen no cases of the virus, have taken measures intended to prevent the spread of the disease.

Guinea-Bissau has decided to close its frontier with eastern neighbour Guinea, Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira told a news conference. Germany on today urged its nationals to leave Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, though the request did not apply to medical workers or German diplomatic staff, a foreign ministry spokesman said.

The outbreak has brought fresh attention to efforts to find a cure. Scientists in the U.S. studying Ebola say they have found how it blocks and disables the body's ability to battle infections in a discovery that should help the search for potential cures and vaccines.

The scientists found that Ebola carries a protein called VP24 that interferes with a molecule called interferon, which is vital to the immune response.

'One of the key reasons that Ebola virus is so deadly is because it disrupts the body's immune response to the infection,' said Chris Basler of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, who worked on the study.
