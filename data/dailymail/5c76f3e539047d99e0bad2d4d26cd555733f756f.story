Warning: Jacqui Cheer, the chief constable of 
Cleveland Police, said society was becoming 'quite intolerant of young 
people' in public spaces

A top police officer has called for more tolerance of antisocial yobs because much of their boisterous behaviour is just part of ‘growing up’.

Jacqui Cheer, the chief constable of Cleveland Police, said society was becoming ‘quite intolerant of young people’ in public spaces.

She said detectives had to decide whether annoying or noisy behaviour in a small group merited police action that could ‘antagonise’ teenagers.

And she warned that new legislation against yobs could lead to childhood behaviour that was tolerated in previous generations being criminalised.

Under Home Secretary Theresa May’s new antisocial behaviour bill children as young as ten can receive injunctions for ‘causing nuisance’, and older children can be jailed for breaching such injunctions.

The chief constable, who speaks for police chiefs on children and young people, said: ‘What’s antisocial to one person is just what I did and what many young people do.

‘We’ve closed down a lot of places that people are allowed to go to.

'We’ve fenced off school grounds, I get it, but where do people collect? When you’re in a crowd of three or four it can get a bit noisy, is that antisocial?

'When you’re walking down a street and might be having a bit of a laugh and joke, is that antisocial?’

Jacqui Cheer was speaking to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between children and the police.

She added: ‘I’m not saying that we will tolerate behaviour that is harassing, that is making people feel fearful, that is preventing other young people from going out because they don’t want to walk down that street or through that park.

‘That is our job. We are here to protect everybody. But we need to be careful where the line is.

'I think we are too ready as a society - as the police and particularly with some legislation coming up on the books - to label what looks like . . . growing up to me as antisocial behaviour.'

The police recorded 2.3million incidents of anti-social behaviour in 2012-13, down from 3.7million on a year earlier.

However HM Inspector of Constabulary 
has warned that there is wide variation in the way different forces 
treat offences, with some recording crimes wrongly as anti-social 
behaviour while others over-report minor incidents.

Campaigners have warned that the Government's Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will criminalise more youngsters.

The ASBO introduced by Labour will be replaced, with a much lower test to prove anti-social bejhavour.

Offenders will only have to commit conduct 'capable of causing nuisance and annoyance' rather than being likely to cause 'harassment, alarm or distress'.

Hilary Emery, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, predicted that the antisocial behaviour bill would have perverse and harmful consequences.

She said: ‘We are concerned that children and teenagers will get into trouble with the law just for being annoying, and that it will penalise them from doing things that all children do as part of growing up – playing in the street, kicking a ball around in a public space or hanging around with their friends.

‘It threatens to further increase the divide between generations, alienate children and divert the police from fighting genuine crimes.’

Home Office ministers say new ‘streamlined and flexible’ measures are needed to replace antisocial behaviour orders, more than half of which are breached at least once.

Other measures have proved ineffective or inadequate.
