More than a quarter of a million Cadbury Eggheads are being delivered to National Trust properties ahead of the annual Cadbury Easter Egg Trails.

Taking place over 3rd-6th April at National Trust venues across the country, egg hunters will have the opportunity to follow clues and discover chocolate in some of the UK's most beautiful surroundings.

Weighing in at 21.5 tonnes, the eggs in their thousands prove tricky to store with properties having to get creative to perfect the art of egg hiding.

With temporary locations inside grandfather clocks, pianos, vases, bookcases and even using wheelbarrows to move them around, National Trust staff are poised and ready for one of the busiest weekends in the calendar. 

There will be trails at over 300 locations across the UK, aiming to introduce both children and adults alike to National Trust properties.

Spring woodlands and coastal trails, to historic homes and castles will be opening their doors for the family days out.

Jon Ducker, Visitor Experience Manager at Tyntesfield, Bristol says: 'It's great to see everyone running around exploring the estate. We get the same families coming back year after year and they spread the word to all their friends.'

Studland Beach in Dorset - situated near Studland village, the inspiration for Toytown in Enid Blyton's Noddy books - is one of the  seaside venues where the egg hunt will take place, and hunters will have the opportunity to follow Easter Bunny prints through the dunes.

The Wimpole Estate in Cambridgeshire is another venue opening its doors. Visitors will be hunting for the Wimpole Goose's feathers, spelling out a magic word and leading egg hunters to their chocolate prize.

In Cumbria Wray Castle will see visitors come to its Lake Windermere location, where they will follow a trail through  the castles turrets and quirky rooms.

Every trail will start at Base Camp where they will receive their 'Eggsplorer Trail Journal' containing their  trail map and clues so they stay on track.

After successfully completing the trail, each 'Eggsplorer' will be rewarded with a Cadbury Egghead. 

Each and every visit to a National Trust venue helps support the charity's work caring for special places for future generations. 

Every penny raised from the Cadbury Easter Egg Trails goes into looking after National Trust properties.
