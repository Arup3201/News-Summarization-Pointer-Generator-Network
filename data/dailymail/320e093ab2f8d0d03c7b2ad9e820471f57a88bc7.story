A Connecticut grandmother who allegedly shot and killed her two young grandchildren before shooting herself also suffered from mental health problems, it was revealed today.

The body of 47-year-old Debra Denison was discovered alongside her grandchildren, brothers Ashton, six months, and two-year-old Alton Perry late last night. She was supposed to be taking them to their mother's for Alton's birthday party.

Denison's daughter, Brenda Perry, wrote on her Facebook page early today: 'Thank you for your prayers... My boys are in an amazing place, we've got a few great angels watching over us,' adding that 'my mom was sick.'

Earlier Tuesday, Denison had picked up the brothers from their daycare in Danielson and was supposed to take them to Alton's birthday party, where family members were waiting to celebrate.

Debra Denison is believed to have shot to death her two-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren before turning the gun on herself. Here she is pictured with Alton, who was found dead in the car alongside his little brother Ashton and his grandmother

Family members said that the boys’ maternal grandmother suffered from several mental health issues including depression, while other family members said she had bipolar disorder and split personalities.

Those who saw the grandmother at the daycare said she was friendly and talkative when she picked up her grandchildren, and added that she didn’t give any indication of something wrong, according to Nikki Salaun, director of the Kidds & Co. daycare center in North Stonington.

Ms Salaun and daycare center co-owner Christine Hare said the boys' mother worked at the daycare center herself a couple years and had mentioned that the grandmother had a history of mental health troubles.

They said they keep going over the pickup in their minds but there is nothing they could have done differently.

'Brenda obviously put her on the list thinking she would be okay,' Ms Hare told the Associated Press. 'We go with the parents. We can't override their wishes. Obviously if she had come here obviously distraught, we would have intervened.'

Police are officially calling this a murder-suicide after finding a suicide note left by Denison.

In her note, she said in part that God was watching over her own 13-year-old son, who was not hurt in Tuesday’s tragic events. However, the motive for the murder-suicide remains under investigation.

The family knew something was wrong yesterday afternoon, and called state police at around 4pm after Denison and the boys failed to show up for the party. An Amber Alert was issued for Ashton and Alton.

In the Amber Alert, state police said Denison is 'bipolar and has medical conditions'.

Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic depression) is a mental condition that causes mood swings between overactive, excited behaviour known as mania to deep depression.

There are often periods of stability between these highs and lows. However, some people also hallucinate or have delusions. It can also cause suicidal thoughts.

State police troopers and detectives were called in to aid in the investigation, and area police agencies were notified and given the descriptions of Denison and the children.

Brenda, the mother of the pair, posted: ''God has two beautiful angels helping him now'

At about 9.30pm, police received a 
report of a suspicious vehicle parked near the Lake of Isles golf course
with three injured people inside, two of whom appeared to be children.

The two boys and their grandmother were pronounced dead at the scene.

Mother Brenda Perry, married to father Jeremy since October 2010, posted  'God has two beautiful angels helping him now', after the Amber Alert was called off.

She today posted on Facebook: 'Thank you for the prayers. I ask for you to also pray for my brother and sister. They lost three people last night.

'My boys are in an amazing place, we got a few great angels watching over us. Love you Ashton and Alton.'

WaterfordPatch, quoting Connecticut 
State Police, reported that she shot and killed the children with a 
.38-caliber handgun before turning the gun on herself.

Officers also confirmed that Denison, picked up the baby and toddler and drove off with the children and the gun in a 2002 White Chrysler Town & Country minivan with a CT registration of 445-ZAZ.

State police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance told the New Haven Register: 'The car was found about 9.30pm.

'The woman and the two kids are both dead.'

Denison suffered from bipolar disorder and has a history of mental issues, according to family members gathered at the boys' parents home.

Denison left the family a note, but they did not reveal the contents. It is now in the hands of officers.

Connecticut State Police issued an Amber Alert when the family grew concerned. Officers were alerted to their bodies later in the evening

Investigation: Police cars blocked off Lake of Isles Road, where the car and bodies were found

According to the Connecticut Judiciary website, Denison has a criminal 
conviction for reckless driving from 2003, but no other convictions.

Last night, state police blocked the entrance to Lake of Isles Road, and the Eastern District Major Crime Squad responded to the scene to investigate.

An autopsy will be performed by the Chief States medical examiner to determine the manner and cause of death today.
