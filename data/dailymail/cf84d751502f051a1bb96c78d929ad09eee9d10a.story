Marks and Spencer's autumn/winter womenswear range was given a resounding thumbs by fashionistas when it was unveiled last week - even winning over the Daily Mail's fashion critic Liz Jones.

Now the menswear collection has been revealed and the British High Street brand will be hoping for positive feedback leading to a boast in sales.

Aiming for a younger audience, the collection is modelled by rising star Oliver Cheshire from Hertfordshire.

Dapper: Bold colours and classic cuts feature in the 'Best of British Collection' from M&S

'Fantastic value': This Savile Row style suit costs £800

The chiseled cheekboned 24-year-old has already helped tills ring at M&S by modelling their swimwear and also boosted sales at Superdry when he became a face of the brand.

Now the boyfriend of popstar Pixie Lott lends his effortlessly cool image to the M&S range that aims to celebrate the best in British design and manufacture.

The brand say the 'Best of British Collection' 
- made entirely using British designers, fabrics and manufacturers - 'combines our rich heritage with modern styling to create an edit of 
timeless pieces with an emphasis on true British craftsmanship and 
quality.'

The garments have been made from fabrics such as Scottish cashmere through to Yorkshire cloths.

Bold yellow, blue and red jumpers brighten up an autumnal look when combined with grey suits while crisp white shirts can be dressed up for a smart work look or down for a geek chic appearance.

Something for everyone: Head of menswear design Tony O'Connor said they hope the collection appeals to a younger audience as well as older customers

As with the womenswear, coats are a key element of the collection with checked overcoats, tweed and fitted styles allowing wearers to be suave as well as warm.

Head of menswear design Tony O'Connor told GQ that the jewel in the crown of the collection is a Savile Row quality suit for £800.

'I love the idea of a young guy wearing 
one of our Harris Tweed jackets with jeans and brogues whereas your 
classic guy is going to wear it with a lambswool and cords'

He said: 'The great thing with the company at the moment is what they can offer 
quality-wise is incredible. There are some pieces that are fantastic 
value for what they are. Even though the £800 Best Of British suit is 
our most expensive suit... to give the chap that accessibility to a suit that would 
normally off the peg in Savile Row cost £2,000 for £800 is something!'

He added that in aiming for a younger market the brand don't want to alienate their older fans but instead believe they can offer something for everyone depending on how an item is worn.

He said: 'In terms of the brand itself we have a broad church of classic customers, but what we're seeing increasingly is a growth in the under 35 market: people appreciating what we're doing with quality and I'm really trying to push the style aspect further.

Seal of approval: Cheshire described the collection as 'perfect' and 'on trend' in his blog

New looks: The British brand hope to have successful sales with their revamped women's and men's ranges

After his modelling gig, Cheshire gave the collection his own seal of approval.

Writing on his blog, I Wear The Trousers, he said: 'Is this range of menswear from high street giant Marks and Spencer the best they have ever produced? That's a big fat yes in my eyes, and it's not just because I'm face of the campaign. 

'Every item in the Best of British collection is perfect, massively on trend and very wearable and that's not to mention the quality of the material and cuts of suits. The stand out pieces are their beautiful double-breasted, Prince of Wales-checked overcoats, and their grey speckled suits - they wouldn't look out of place in any of the biggest runway shows around the world!

'M&S has so stepped up to the mark and way beyond it with this range and I feel very honoured to be part of this fashion history.'

'Marks & Spencer are showing that a mainstream, high-street retailer can return to producing in Britain if they want to. Returning to their St Michael roots, the collection offers the best of the British Isles, most notably tweeds and knitwear. While some may think £800 for a suit is expensive, it is actually good value. For something comparable with a designer name and made in the UK, you would be looking at least double, if not triple the price.' Marcus Jaye, founder & creative director, TheChicGeek.co.uk

'It's rare that you actually say to yourself, I want everything in the collection, but on this occasion, that's actually how I feel. M&S have pulled it out of the bag, it hits the exact right balance of being directional, stylish and completely wearable and if that wasn't enough all the range is produced to the HIGHEST of quality, right here in Blightly!' Anthony McGrath, editor in chief Clothes-make-the-man.com

'What I like about this collection is 
that M&S has resisted the temptation to play safe with middle-aged 
grunge. What I saw is a collection of beautifully-made classics, for 
both men and women, interpreted in a snappy and very contemporary way.' Men's style blog Grey Fox
