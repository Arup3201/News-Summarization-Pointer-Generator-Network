Jeffrey Hillman was catapulted to worldwide fame when a photograph of him being given a pair of shoes by a kind police officer sprung to instant popularity online this week.

But the homeless man says he cannot even wear his new shoes for fear they could be stolen - or even get him killed by an envious fellow beggar.

And his sudden celebrity has apparently done little to improve his prospects, as he continues to panhandle on the streets of New York and complains, 'I want a piece of the pie' from the touching photograph.

Popular: This photograph of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo giving a new pair of shoes to beggar Jeffrey Hillman has spread around the world in the past few days

The New York Times tracked down Hillman, who is again shoeless, despite the good deed

Mr Hillman's fame stems from an image of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo handing him a new pair of $100 boots after finding him sitting barefoot and desolate on the street in Times Square.

The photograph was featured on numerous news sites, and captured the hearts of millions as a symbol of unfeigned generosity and a public servant going beyond the call of duty.

But when the New York Times tracked down the recipient yesterday, he claimed he had not benefited from his newfound recognition.

The Times revealed that Mr Hillman is a 54-year-old veteran who has lived on the streets of Manhattan for the best part of a decade.

Gift: But Mr Hillman says he cannot wear his new $100 boots for fear he will be robbed or even killed over them

He grew up in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and after high school he signed up to the Army in 1978.

After being honorably discharged from the military, he worked in catering in his home state - and he says he does not know how he ended up homeless.

He told the paper he remembered his meeting with Mr DePrimo and said he was grateful for the officer's gift, adding: 'I wish there were more people like him in the world.'

But during his interview with the Times he was once again barefoot, saying: 'Those shoes are hidden. They are worth a lot of money. I could lose my life.'

Family: Mr Hillman's brother Kirk and sister-in-law Tish say they hear from him around once a year

Mr Hillman also suggested that he should gain financially from the furore surrounding the viral image: 'I was put on YouTube, I was put on everything without permission. What do I get?'

He added, 'This went around the world, and I want a piece of the pie.'

However, he also took the time to thank those who had taken an interest in him, saying, 'It meant a lot to me.'

Earlier it was revealed that his family had no idea he was living on the streets, as his sister-in-law Tish said she and her husband heard from him only around once a year.

The panhandler also two children, 24-year-old Jeffrey Jr and Nikita, 22, but he is no longer in regular contact with them.
