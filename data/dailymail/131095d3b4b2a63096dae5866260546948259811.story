Making headlines: Kidd was big news on Thursday ago when he signed with the New York Knicks. Now it's his mugshot that 
is being published

'I can’t believe Jason Kidd actually 
survived that. When I see an accident that bad, I expect at least 
serious injury, if not death,' a police officer told the New York Daily News.

The newspaper reports that Kidd was 
served a constant flow of red wine and Malibu Red cocktails at a gala 
party Saturday night before hitting a trendy nightclub and drinking so 
heavily he had to be helped out to his truck early Sunday.

The crash occurred just a mile and a half from the $6million summer home he owns in the Hamptons.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist 
reportedly told police he didn't remember the wreck early Sunday and 
didn't feel any pain, even though he received minor injuries and had to 
be hospitalised when he smashed into the telephone pole and skidded 25 
feet into the woods.

In a criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post, police said: 'Defendant did not know what had happened in accident. Defendant arrested for [driving while intoxicated] transported to hospital for injuries... Defendant refused in hospital to chemical test.'

An officer noted he had watery, 
bloodshot eyes and was unsteady on his feet, and reported smelling 
alcohol on his breath, though Kidd refused to breathalyzer test.

The complaint stated that Kidd was still in his SUV as police arrived at the scene.

Police allege the NBA guard blew 
through a stop sign in the upscale village of Water Mill on Long Island 
on his way home and crashed into a telephone pole, snapping it off at 
the base.

His lawyer said he will plead not guilty.

The arrest came just three days after he
signed a contract to become the Knick's newest guard - the biggest star
to sign on for the team in the off season.

While Kidd has gotten slammed in the New York press since the arrest, his mother-in-law has got his back.

'He was tired. He’s not a drunk!' Denotra Coleman, his wife's mother, told the New York Daily News.

She said that Kidd has been a good father an a good husband to her daughter Porschla - Kidd's second wife.

She
said Kidd just fathered his fifth child with Porschla and that he never
would have driven home drunk with a small child at home.

The latest Knicks recruit signed a three-year, $9.5million deal with the baseball team on Thursday.

Prior to that he had played for the Dallas Mavericks since 2008, and also led the New Jersey Nets to two NBA Finals appearances.

He also has Olympic two gold medals - playing for Team USA in 2000 and 2008 - and won the NBA finals with Dallas in 2011.

In
2001 he pleaded guilty to a domestic violence charge involving his 
ex-wife, Joumana. He is now married to Porschla, a former model.

New photos released on Monday reportedly
show Kidd, his shirt stained with sweat, dancing at a trendy nightclub 
prior to his arrest.

He left after breaking a light fixture 
when he tried to swing from it. Witnesses say he had to be supported by 
friends to make it to his SUV.

The pictures, posted by Barstool Sports,
were sent in by a reader who said, 'My buddy’s wife was at last night 
(sic) where Kidd was partying. Said he had to be carried out by security
at the end of the night because he was so wasted.'

Before his wild clubbing, Kidd, 39, attended an upscale gala in the Hamptons thrown by rapper Ne-Yo's Compound Foundation, which provides money to 'empower and inspire youth in foster care.'

The event was in honor of Star Wars creator George Lucas. Kidd tweeted a photo of himself and his wife looking respectable with the legendary filmmaker.

From there, he went on to the SL East club, where he began drinking vodka and dancing. At some point during the night his wife went home and left him alone in the club, the Daily News reported.
