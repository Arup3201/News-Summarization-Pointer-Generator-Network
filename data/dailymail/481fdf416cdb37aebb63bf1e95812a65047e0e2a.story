She stormed to victory in this year’s The Great British Bake Off with her spectacular edible creations. Now Nancy Birtwhistle has designed a Christmas showstopper bake — and shares the recipe exclusively with the Mail so you can make it at home.

This stunning Angel Cake comes complete with a caramel halo and wings, a piped-icing skirt, hands clasped in prayer and long blonde hair.

On Bake Off, the 60-year-old was dubbed Gadget Gran because she used a series of homemade implements to construct her bakes, each one lovingly crafted by her husband Tim.

Nancy Birtwhistle (pictured), 60, who won this year’s The Great British Bake Off, has designed a Christmas showstopper bake - and shares the festive recipe exclusively with the Mail so you can make it at home

And true to form, he has devised an ingenious wooden tool to help affix the angel’s caramel wings.

For those who fear that assembling the ingenious cake may be beyond them, Mrs Birtwhistle has friendly words of advice.

She said: ‘I hope people will improvise and use their own creativity. It doesn’t matter if you cheat a bit, or do things a different way. You might come up with a better solution than me. The main thing is to have fun while you are making it.

Ready, steady, cook: Gather all the ingredients you need to start baking the spectacular Angel Cake recipe

‘I don’t like the Heston Blumenthal school of cookery, where everything is complicated and takes ages. Food should be enjoyable to make and eat.’

The grandmother-of-eight, from Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, said her Angel Cake has been designed to appeal to all the family.

The head is made from a ball of Rice Krispies, chocolate and marshmallows, which will keep sweet-toothed children happy on Christmas Day.

Finishing touches: Ms Birtwhistle uses a piping bag filled with royal icing to create the angel's lacy skirt

Now, on with the head: Stick a dowel into the angel's head and then attach it to the body section of the cake

The body is a traditional Christmas cake baked in a 4 in tin. And the skirt is a homemade panettone stuffed with Christmas spices and fruit, which can be toasted and eaten long after New Year.

Mrs Birtwhistle said: ‘All the components of the cake will keep for ages, and they are easy to make.

‘But if people want to use a ready-made panettone instead of making their own, that’s fine by me. They are cheap and readily available.’

Call in Gadget Grandad: Create a wooden frame - and use it to fix two dowels to the molten caramel wings

If bought from scratch, all of the ingredients for the Angel Cake should cost about £60, although many people will already have most of the staple ingredients in their cupboards. Home bakers should start making the cake the day before so the panettone can rise overnight. The Christmas cake can also be made at this stage as it takes between five and six hours to bake.

The following day, the skirt, body and head should be decorated with runny icing, shop-bought coloured fondant icing, ready-to-roll marzipan and edible lace.

The parts are then stacked one on top of the other using wooden rods on the inside to hold them together — although knitting needles would do equally well. The wings and halo are made from caramel mixed with edible gold glitter to catch the light.

Be precise: Make another tool with two dowels the right width apart and angle in order to create two holes 

Mr Birtwhistle, 63, devised an ingenious method for attaching the wings to the angel’s back with two wooden dowels. The rods should be fixed into the caramel while it is still molten, using a wooden frame to hold them at a 30 degree angle until it cools. Meanwhile, a corresponding pair of holes must be made in the angel’s back, also at 30 degrees.

Then, with a bit of luck and a steady hand, the wings can be slotted in place to give the cake a special lift.

Mrs Birtwhistle said her creation is meant to be a ‘fallen angel’, adding: ‘Her halo has slipped over one eye, and although she is doing her best to pray you can tell she is the naughty child in angel school.’

Heavenly: Attach the wings to the angel's back using the holes you have created - now you're nearly finished

She and her husband have five children and eight grandchildren between them and will host the entire family on Christmas Day.

She said: ‘I enjoy all the traditions, so we will have roast turkey that we have reared in our back garden, pigs in blankets, sprouts, stuffing and all the rest.

‘We go to midnight mass the night before, then have a big lunch on Christmas Day before opening our presents by the tree.

‘I always prepare most of it well in advance so there is a minimum of fuss, and I don’t get stuck in the kitchen while everyone else is having a drink.’

Final adjustments: Make sure the angel's wings are secure and - now stand back to admire your work!

In the Bake Off final in October, Mrs Birtwhistle made a spectacular windmill cake designed to look like the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris. To mould the caramel roof, she used a gadget made by her husband — a retired GP — from an old drainpipe.

But he refused to take any credit for her victory, saying: ‘I don’t get involved in the kitchen, but I like making things in my workshop. So if I can invent something that helps her construct her showstopper cakes, I will. She is the brains of the operation.’

My angel showstopper cake comprises a panettone which forms the skirt. The body is my traditional Christmas cake and the head is made of a Rice Krispie mix — the children love it!

PANETTONE SKIRT

Mix flour, salt, sugar, yeast, milk and eggs for 10 minutes on low setting until dough is smooth. Add butter and mix for further 10 minutes until soft.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover and leave in the fridge overnight. Stir in the fruits, zests, spices and Cointreau, cover and leave overnight.

Next morning, mix contents together. Grease the Bundt tin then dust with flour. Shape the dough into a sausage then place in tin, and leave at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 180 c and bake for 20 minutes; then 150 c for 25 minutes. Invert tin on to a cooling rack.

CHRISTMAS CAKE

Soak fruit in the Cointreau for several hours. Cream butter and sugar together then beat in eggs. Then fold in the flour and spices and add soaked fruit. Spoon into greased and lined 4 in tin. Bake at 100 c for 5 to 6 hours.

FOR THE ANGEL'S HEAD 

Melt butter in saucepan then add marshmallows. As they melt, add Rice Krispies and chocolate and mix. Spoon into two small greased sphere tins. Leave to go cold, then push the two halves together to make a ball.

TO ASSEMBLE THE ANGEL

Mix egg white and 300 g icing sugar to make a smooth, stiff piping icing. Mix a quantity of runny icing, using lemon juice and 300 g icing sugar and drizzle over the panettone. Leave to set.

Using 125 g marzipan, cover the cake and place on a 6 in board. Cover with ready-to-roll fondant. Using pink ready-to-roll fondant, cover the head. Other colours for hair, eyes etc.

Use edible lace for the angel’s sleeve and collar. I then used cake dowels to fix the head on to the body and the body to the skirt. The finishing piped icing to the skirt and sleeve edges etc was done with the royal icing.

Wings and halo made with edible gold glitter and a caramel made from 300 g sugar and water.

To make the caramel, put the sugar into a pan with just enough water to dampen it. Gently stir the sugar, without boiling, until the grains have all disappeared.

Use a pastry brush dipped in water to get rid of any crystals of sugar clinging to the sides of the pan. Once clear, add the edible glitter and bring to a boil until the syrup begins to thicken and turn golden brown.

Shape it into wings and a halo on some greaseproof paper and allow to cool. Fix dowels to wings with hot caramel then insert to back of cake.
