An orchestra stuck on board a delayed plane decided to pass the time with an impromptu performance - much to the delight of their fellow passengers.

Members of the Philadelphia Orchestra found themselves stuck on the tarmac for three hours while they waited for their flight from Beijing to Macau.

So four of them decided to treat their fellow-passengers to a movement from a string quartet by Dvorak.

Scroll down for video

No strings attached: The quartet offered fellow-passengers 'a musical surprise' to raise their spirits after they had been stuck for hours on the tarmac

In an announcement to the rest of the passengers on a plane, a spokeswoman for the orchestra said: 'The Philadelphia Orchestra is on tour in China and on the way to Macau and our musicians would like to offer you a musical surprise.'

The four then gave a rendition of the finale of Dvorak's American Quartet as their audience stood up and filmed them on phones and tablets.

Despite the cramped conditions, and half way through, one passenger's phone ringing, the four raced through the movement's energetic phrases flawlessly.

First class entertainment: The four played to a sea of mobile phones, one of which went off midway through the performance

Fellow-passengers held the music for them in the absence of music stands.Â 

At one point the cameraman rotated the device the four were being filmed on, and the picture did not auto correct.

At the of the performance the captive audience responded with cheers and rapturous applause.

Now watch the video
