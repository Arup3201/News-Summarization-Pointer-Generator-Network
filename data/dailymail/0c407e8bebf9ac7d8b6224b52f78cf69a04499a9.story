Lookalike: Transgender model Connie Fleming on front cover of world's first transsexual style magazine, Candy

A striking transgender model made up to look like Michelle Obama being sworn into office has been put on the front cover of a U.S. magazine.

Luis Venegas, publisher of the first transsexual style magazine Candy, said he put model Connie Fleming on the front cover because he was inspired by the idea that a black, transsexual woman could one day be president of the Unites States.

The split front cover shows New York model Fleming being sworn into office and waving a U.S. flag accompanied by the headline 'The Candydate'.

Fleming is dressed in typical First Lady fashion, down to the pearl 
necklace. Even the hair style is reminiscent of the President Barack 
Obama's wife, Michelle.

Publisher
 Venegas told Dazed Digital that he was inspired by the idea that a 
'black, transsexual woman' could someday be president of the United 
States'.

'I especially love the cover story, which for the first 
time isn't a super-popular star, but a fabulous, beautiful black 
transwoman channeling a politician who looks pretty much like Michelle 
Obama.

'I remember back in early 2007 when the Democratic Partyâ€™s 
nominees were narrowed down between two 'controversial' stereotypes 
never before seen for presidency: a black man, Barack Obama; and a 
woman, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

'At that time, I thought, 'when will the 
time come when these archaic walls break down and the White House will 
be occupied by, for example, a black, transsexual woman?'

The Winter 2012 Connie Fleming front cover will be the magazine's fifth issue, having already dressed James Franco, Chloe Sevigny and Andrej Pejic in drag for previous covers.

James Franco arguably one of the most famous young actors in 
Hollywood today was unrecognisable during his shoot for Candy. Wearing heavy eyeshadow and lipstick he was shot in dresses 
as well as T-shirts and jeans for the pictures taken by renowned 
photographer Terry Richardson.

The magazine describes itself as being 'completely dedicated to celebrating transvestism, 
transsexuality, cross dressing and androgyny, in all its manifestations.

'CANDY is a magazine for everybody. A space for individual freedom, 
and a publication that pushes people to take on the persona of what they
 always wanted to be.'
