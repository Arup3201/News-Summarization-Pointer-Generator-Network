An Atlanta couple have donated their daughter Tamara's cancelled wedding reception to the homeless.

Carol and Willie Fowler were surprised when the lavish wedding they'd paid for was called off. But they decided to make the occasion joyous for a whole different group of people - 200 homeless individuals and their families.

While its unclear what exactly put the brakes on the blessed union, Tamara attended the impressive event that was once supposed to be all about her in high spirits.

Bountiful: The Fowler Family called Atlanta's Hosea Feed the Hungry and together they hosted more than 200 deserving individuals

Venue: Carol and Willie Fowler donated their daughter's cancelled wedding reception at Villa Cristina, pictured, in Atlanta to the homeless

'We're very pleased that she's 
handling it so well,' Mrs Fowler told WBUR. 'She was also very delighted
to see and know that others had an opportunity to enjoy something, 
rather than just allow it to go to waste.'

Mrs Fowler contacted Elizabeth 
Omilami, the head of Hosea Feed the Hungry, and Atlanta-based homeless 
charity, after her daughter Tamara's nuptials fell through.

Omilami said she thought Mrs Fowler was 
joking when she first told her the generous offer to give the less 
fortunate a four-course meal at the upmarket Villa Christina restaurant,
complete with gold plates and crystal glasses.

Mrs Fowler said her family learned 40 
days prior to Saturday's event they'd spend thousands on that there 
would no longer be a wedding. That's when they called Mrs Omilami.

'At first, I thought it was a prank call because it was such an amazing offering,' Omilami told WBUR.

'It was my husband's idea,' she told WBUR. 'We prayed about it. And when he woke up the next morning, he said, we're going to call Hosea Feed the Hungry and ask if we can donate it to the needy. I immediately looked up the number and called and spoke with Mrs Elisabeth Omilami, and in doing so, we partnered. And it was such a wonderful feeling.'

Adorable: Omilami said she wanted to focus on children - as 70 per cent of Atlanta's homeless are kids

Mrs Omilami said she wanted to focus on children - as 70 per cent of Atlanta's homeless are kids.

She also thought a fine-dining experience would give them an opportunity to learn etiquette, which could come in happy as they get older.

'The passed hors d'oeuvres were very interesting because the children were wondering, could we take the whole tray or do we just take one off of the tray?' she said.

New traditions: The family named the event the First Annual Fowler Family Celebration of Love and are planning to host another one next year, getting sponsors involved

'So this was an educational opportunity as well because now they all know how to eat a four-course meal and the etiquette involved in that.'

Mrs Fowler encouraged others do follow their example if for some reason they find an event they planned gets called off.

'Events are canceled, and sometimes for unknown reasons. Do not allow that opportunity to go to waste. Call up your favorite charity. Give them an opportunity to use that for people that will not have an opportunity perhaps in life,' she said.

This is my story.....and some of your comments have me fighting back tears. I, we never wanted anything more than to turn lemons into lemonade. The whole idea helped me get through a very difficult time. And now the world sees it. I never would have imagined, just doing something good for another person would be such a story to tell. I didn't even tell everyone in my life, because i didn't think it was important enough. Thank you for all the positivity...be blessed!
