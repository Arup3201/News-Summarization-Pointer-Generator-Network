A marketing ploy launched by Malaysia Airlines in an effort to win back customers has backfired after it was deemed insensitive in light of two air tragedies that killed more than 500 people.

The struggling airline has changed the wording of its ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ contest – promoted just months after the twin air disasters – after it was widely criticised for the word choice.

‘Bucket list’ is a term that refers to the things a person wants to experience before they die.  

Insensitive: Malaysia Airlines has been criticised for a free flight giveaway named 'My Ultimate Bucket List'

The ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ free flight giveaway was offered to customers in Australia and New Zealand, but the campaign turned into a disastrous public relations move for an airline that is desperately trying to revive its image.

Malaysia Airlines’ ill-conceived contest asked customers who had already booked flights to submit an entry and, in 500 characters or less, explain which destinations are on their bucket list for a chance to win one of 12 economy class return tickets to Malaysia or an iPad.

It said: ‘What and where would you like to tick off on your bucket list, and explain why?'

The state-owned airline has pulled references of ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’ off its website, with links now directing to error pages. The contest still exists but it is now asking customers to describe their ‘ultimate to-do list'.

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, the airline confirmed it has altered the contest's name and it did not intend to offend anyone.

It said: ‘Malaysia Airlines has withdrawn the title of a recent competition running in Australia and New Zealand, as it is found to be inappropriate at this point in time.’

‘The competition had been earlier approved as it was themed around a common phrase that is used in both countries.

‘The airline appreciates and respects the sentiments of the public and in no way did it intend to offend any parties.

‘The initiative of the competition is designed to inspire and encourage travellers to dream, plan and book their next holiday with Malaysia Airlines.’

People were quick to criticise the airline for its word choice.

Twitter user Neil Cotton wrote: ‘Malaysia Airlines calls their new promotion “My Ultimate Bucket List” – SERIOUSLY! U know what that means, right?’

A user named M. Gaston said: ‘This is a sick, sick joke, right?! Marketing/PR needs to be fired.’

Mike Chin wrote: ‘Can there be a worst competition name than Malaysia Airlines (MAS)’s “My Ultimate Bucket List” competition’. [sic]

In addition to giving away free flights, the cash-strapped airline has slashed prices on certain routes after being hit by plunging ticket sales following the tragedies. Photos posted on social media have shown nearly empty cabins on some flights.

The airline was already struggling with financial woes when the disasters occurred, and last week it announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs as part of a £1.1 billion overhaul that is expected to lead to some routes being eliminated.

In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam.

And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March.

No wreckage has been found and the plane is thought to have crashed some 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast.
