Trailblazer: Megan Knowles-Bacon, whose act combines tricks with ballet, has been voted in as secretary at the top of the elite magic organisation

Magician Megan Knowles-Bacon, whose captivating act combines tricks with ballet, has become the first woman elected to be an officer in the Magic Circle.

She was voted in as secretary, one of four voluntary roles at the top of an organisation that has represented magicians for more than a century.

Miss Knowles-Bacon is one of just 100 women invited into magic’s inner sanctum since it opened its doors to them 30 years ago. There are around 1,500 members in total.

She is also the youngest person to ever be elected as an officer in the Magic Circle. 

Fellow magicians voted for her based on a pitch that was sent out in October, and she has spent the last seven months in a contest for the role with an older, male candidate.

And now the 22-year-old, from Eltham, south east London, said that she wants to use her new role to encourage more women and young people to join the body.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'It has always been very male dominated and I think that has been very daunting to a degree.

'Women joining the Magic Circle is a bit like a boy doing ballet - it isn’t the norm. I would hope that we can talk to some more girls and try to get more of them involved.'

She added: 'Changes are happening with the Circle now and I hope more women get roles. It feels nice to be part of history.' 

Miss Knowles-Bacon's appointment comes two months after Katherine Mills was announced as the first female magician to front her own television show.

Ms Mills, 31, became interested in magic as a teenager but gave it up when she went to university – she studied social psychology at Loughborough. 

But a chance meeting with TV’s magician of the moment Dynamo was to turn her life around. And now she has her big TV break with her own show, Katherine Mills: Mind Games. 

She admitted it’s a strange career choice; there were no female trailblazers before her. 

Both women are now fighting against a stereotype: that women in serve as assistants to male magicians.
