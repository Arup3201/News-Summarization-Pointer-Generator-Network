A toy lover has spent a decade recreating his favourite Transformers characters in Lego - and results are impressive.

Alex Jones, also known as Orion Pax, has painstakingly created a Lego G1 Transformers series that couldn't be further away from Lego's simple trademark look.

The Transformers fan from Germany has constructed, among others, an incredible replica of Optimus Prime complete with the Prime truck.

Alex Jones, also known as Orion Pax, has spent the last 10 years working on a Lego G1 Transformers series

Transformers were created in 1975 by Takara Tomy.

The premise behind the design was that an individual toy's parts can be moved to change it from a vehicle, a device, or an animal, to a robot action figure.

The toys were promoted through a comic book by Marvel Comics and an animated series.

The animated series was outlived by the comic, but it was the series that truly captured the imagination of children throughout the world.

A number of Transformers science fiction action films were created by Michael Bay in 2007, 2009 and 2011.

Over the past decade, he has made a number of different versions of Optimus Prime, Blaster, Starscream and Soundwave.

Mr Jones is a self-confessed perfectionist and each version has improved design and functionality.

He claims he’s always on a quest for the right technique in order to get every transformation, 'every little feature and detail of every character right.’

When working on Hound he said he had 
to wait years until the colours were available in order to finish the 
build to his high standards.

Even now he claims that he can hear the figures calling ‘improve me, improve me again, NOW!!’

Mr Jones’ creations can all be found on his Transformers site, Orion Pax.

The
Lego artist has also built a number of other creations out of Lego, 
including a bat mobile, a New York Yankees New Era cap, and a custom 
Nikon FE 2.

'It upsets me hunting me down into my deepest dreams at night if anything doesn't work out the way I want it to be,' Mr Jones writes on his website.

'To get the build right is (was / will be / has ever been) always a quest for the right technique.'
