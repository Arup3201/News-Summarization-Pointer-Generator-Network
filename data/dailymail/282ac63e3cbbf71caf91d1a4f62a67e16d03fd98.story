Photographs of rainbow lorikeets who usually feed on seeds eating meat has puzzled bird experts.

A series of pictures snapped at a Elimbah home - north of Brisbane - owned by a man only known as Bill shows the Australian icons feasting on mince, the ABC reported.

Griffith University's Darryl Jones has been studying bird for about 20 years, taking a particular interest in bird feeding, and says he has never seen a phenomena like this before.

This photo of lorikeets eating mince meat was snapped in Elimbah - north of Brisbane in Queensland

'I've not ever heard of lorikeets, who are seed eating birds, eat meats,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'What on earth are lorikeets eating meats for?

'It's not unusual for animals to eat bad food, humans do that every single day - we eat fat and sugars.

'I can't imagine it could be good for them. I don't recommend people feeding them meat.' 

Professor Jones shed some light on why he thought lorikeets had taken a carnivorous turn.

He said they must have acquired a taste for proteins when people put out food for other birds. 

Griffith University Professor Darryl Jones has expressed shock at seeing these seed-eating birds chow down on meat

'Although you really shouldn't feed birds, there are a huge number of people who do anyway,' Prof Jones told Daily Mail Australia.

'Magpies, butcher birds and kookaburras are meat eating birds and people put out chopped up sausage and ham for them.'

Since expressing his views on the photos, Prof Jones said he had been inundated by emails from people claiming it was more common than he had thought.

Lorikeets are normally birds that favour a diet of seeds. Prof Jones does not recommend feeding them meat

'I've had 188 emails coming in, saying it happens... so it's not as rare as what I was thinking,' he said. 

Wildlife carer Fran Sanders - who has been taking in animals for 25 years in Brisbane - told the ABC she had also never seen this kind of behaviour from lorikeets.

'I'm absolutely amazed and horrified,' she said. 

'I've never heard any of them [people she had helped] talk about lorikeets coming down and eating mince.'
