It’s billed as an ‘oasis of comfort’, with a Jacuzzi, rainforest shower, and silk pillows – step inside the $8,400-a-night (£5,000) suite Michelle Obama currently calls home.

The first lady is staying at the five-star Westin Hotel in Chaoyang, just outside Beijing, during her week-long trip to China with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson.

During her trip, described as a 'person-to-person' soft diplomatic tour, the family will be staying in the Jinmao Presidential Suite at the hotel, near the US Embassy.

The hotel is 25 minutes from Beijing Capital International Airport and ‘within the popular Sanlitun entertainment area’, the hotel’s website explains, putting guests ‘in the midst of a thriving district of office towers and embassies, international boutiques, restaurants and clubs’.

Boasting 550 guest rooms, Michelle Obama is occupying the presidential suite, a 3,445sq-ft area, which boasts a separate lounge, kitchen, a sauna and steam room as well as an honour bar. 

In a description of the room, the hotel adds: ‘Every element of the Jinmao Presidential suite is designed to please and pamper.

Good night's sleep: The Westin's presidential suite boasts a king-size bed with 'ten layers of comfort'

Luxurious hotel: The Westin also boasts an in-house fitness studio, a spa, and 25m indoor swimming pool

‘Gorgeous furnishings in neutral tones are stylishly tailored—including corner sofas with silk pillows, stunning original artwork, and three levels of lighting—for meetings, reading, and evening entertaining. 

‘The suite's floor-to-ceiling windows frame views of the East 3rd Ring Road, including Beijing’s modern central business district and diplomatic communities.

‘Whether you are here for business or sheer pleasure, you will find this suite is an oasis of comfort, complete with 24-hour private butler service.’

And relax... The Westin features a Heavenly Spa offering massages and facials

Heated pool: The Westin's 25m pool also boasts a bar serving cocktails

Facilities: The luxury five-star The Westin also caters for weddings and dinner parties

And perhaps something more of interest to Barack and Michelle Obama’s daughters, the suite also features a surround-sound entertainment system, and a 52-inch flatscreen, interactive TV.

Although the suite costs $8,400 a night, it has not been declared whether America’s First Lady’s has been given a discount for the taxpayer-funded trip.

The king-size bed boasts ‘ten layers of comfort’ and is designed ‘for a deep, undisturbed sleep that energizes your body and brain’. 

The Obama family will also have access to the Westin Executive Club Lounge, the in-house fitness studio and spa, as well as the 25m indoor swimming pool, with a poolside bar serving cocktails.
