Porn star Cameron Bay has come forward to confirm her HIV diagnosis in an announcement that has sent shockwaves through the porn industry.

The 29-year-old actress has been told by doctors that her blood sample has tested positive for HIV - prompting a moratorium on the making of porn films in the industry hub of San Fernando Valley in California.

Cameron revealed she shot her most recent sex 
scene with Xander Corvus, the man who played Anthony Weiner alongside the New York mayoral candidate's latest online mistress Sydney Leathers.

Sydney made her porn debut Weiner And Me which was released yesterday - sparking fears she may have been exposed to the virus.

MailOnline can today reveal Cameron Bay has a wrap sheet of more than 17 charges to her name, some of which were dismissed. She also spent more than a year in prison in Arizona 2007.

Porn Star: Her arrests range from traffic violations to forgery and even assault

Her charges range from traffic violations to forgery and aggravated assault.

Cameron Bay is not the porn star's real name. MailOnline knows her true identity, but has chosen not to print it.

Cameron
 has worked under names including Ashton and Ryder, but before she 
embarked on a career in porn she appeared on VH1's Tool Academy in 2009.

The
 show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in 
order to save their unions. The season ran for eight episodes, and 
Cameron along with her boyfriend of 10 years, Clarence - who had 
nicknamed himself 'Celebrity' - were eliminated in the third episode.

Just
 two years before her reality TV debut, Cameron spent a year and six 
months in prison for an unknown offense in Arizona. She was released in May 2008.

Her latest arrest came in February, where she was arrested for criminal damage and disorderly conduct.

She was also arrested in October last year for criminal damage, disorderly conduct and interfering with judicial proceedings.

While in August, she was arrested for failing to show her driving license or identification.

Cameron Bay spoke to Adult Video News to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production.

Cutting Edge Testing lab told Bay on Wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for HIV.

She told AVN that she was 'obviously extremely distraught and in 
disbelief', and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the
 result.

According to Bay, she received her last clean bill of health on July 27.

Just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called Public Disgrace. Her male partner was Xander Corvus.

Gawker reports he and Leathers also had unprotected sex for the Vivid.com movie.

In a statement to the site, Leathers 
said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and 
both were deemed 'healthy'.

However, the presence of STDs sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure.

It
 takes the body two-to-eight weeks to make antibodies against HIV - 
known as the window period. Tests done immediately after the exposure or
 within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false 
negative result.

The CDC
 recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been 
found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three
 months.

Leathers released a further statement this morning: 'I do not have HIV and have not been exposed to HIV regardless of the reports out there saying otherwise.

'I was not contacted by the Free Speech Coalition to re-test, I reached out to them to see if I should re-test and was told I did not need to.

'I took all the necessary precautions before and after my scene for Vivid and acted responsibly and therefore was able to protect myself from exposure to anything.

'As an added precaution I retested 2 days after my shoot and again yesterday and was negative.'

Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated.

'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers 
testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set
 transmission,' Duke said.

'The current situation would bring the number
 to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but 
nationwide.'

The industry briefly put a similar 
moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were 
infected during a syphilis outbreak.

Word
 of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn 
industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the 
AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to 
adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most 
porn films.

'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases — including HIV, which is not curable — before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement.

Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation.

Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.'

'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said.

The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.
