An Iraqi policeman has claimed he was strangled, beaten with a rifle butt and told he would be murdered by an undercover SAS soldier during an interrogation.

The officer is one of nine people who say they were tortured by Special Forces troops trying to track down the killers of six British military policemen – known as Red Caps – in Iraq.

Ahmed Al-Maliki and his colleagues, who are claiming damages from the Government for their physical and psychological injuries, have spoken for the first time about their alleged ordeal.

But their bid for compensation has also caused dismay. Iraq War hero Colonel Tim Collins last night described lawyers representing the policemen as ‘a cynical bunch of ambulance-chasers’.

Mr Al-Maliki, 41, described how on June 30, 2003, about 20 SAS soldiers who were posing as Red Caps and wearing their traditional berets entered the police station in the southern Iraqi town of Majar al-Kabir.

The soldiers, armed with automatic rifles, allegedly attacked the police officers after their questions about who killed the Red Caps went unanswered.

Mr Al-Maliki said: ‘During the incident I was violently beaten with a rifle to my back and legs.’

He added: ‘A soldier placed his hands around my neck and applied great pressure. He said, “Provide me with information or I will kill you.” The soldier was very tall and strong. He was white-skinned and clean-shaven. Even after 100 years, I would still recognise him.

‘He held my neck for around 30 seconds 
and I was strangled two more times with so much pressure I couldn’t 
breathe. Afterwards, another soldier, who was wearing a red cap, applied
a scarf around my neck. I was then dragged along the floor by my neck –
all because I could not tell them what they wanted to hear.’

Mr Al-Maliki says he suffered serious injuries to his throat, back and legs that required medical treatment. He later left the police force. He has pledged to co-operate with a criminal investigation launched by Ministry  of Defence police. The soldiers could face jail if found guilty of abusing the policemen.

Mr Al-Maliki said: ‘For ten days, I couldn’t swallow properly and I was drinking through a straw. I want to know why this happened to me and who was responsible.’

The top-secret SAS operation was launched hours after the six Red Caps, led by Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, were executed by an Iraqi mob at the Majar  al-Kabir police station. The Iraqi policemen they were training fled the gun-toting protesters.

Another policeman, Mustafa Jbara, 31, pleaded with the SAS soldiers that he knew nothing about the Red Caps’ deaths.

He claims that during his ordeal he was forced to maintain painful stress positions – an interrogation technique banned under UK law since the Seventies.

He said: ‘I was lying face down in the corridor of the police station with my colleagues. The soldiers kept stepping on our backs. I was also made to squat down, placing my hands on my head. When I tried to link my fingers so I could balance better, a soldier struck my hands with the butt of his rifle. It was very frightening.

‘I was kicked hard, punched and beaten with rifles. I could hear my colleagues screaming and the soldiers laughing. It was painful and humiliating. Afterwards, we were made to do sit-ups and tied together with plastic cuffs.’ The nine policemen were eventually released. Some underwent X-rays although no fractures were found and no surgery was carried  out. However, according to medical reports, the policemen suffered internal injuries and severe bruising.

Dr Adnan Mohammed, head  of medicine at Majar al-Kabir  hospital, who examined the men, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Most of the patients were suffering from hypotension. They had bruising and evidence of trauma to the back, neck and legs. Some had bruising around their wrists.

‘I have never seen policemen attacked like that. A lot of people changed their attitudes towards the British as a result of that day.’

However, Col Collins, who served as an SAS officer before the Iraq War, said the soldiers were within their rights to adopt a robust approach.

He said: ‘If the policemen did get pushed around, I’m not surprised because this incident took place in brutal circumstances.

‘Lives had been taken and there was potential for more lives to be lost. This was rough handling, not torture. Whatever it takes to get information is acceptable, so long as no permanent damage is done. What we have here is a cynical bunch of ambulance-chasing lawyers going after compensation.’

The MoD has already paid millions of pounds to claimants who alleged abuse in southern Iraq, where UK troops were based between 2003 and 2009.

Anna Crowther, of law firm Leigh Day & Co, which is representing the nine men, said: ‘The recent disturbing revelations regarding the involvement of the SAS in this incident puts more pressure on the British Government to provide proper answers as to who was involved in these assaults and at what level this was sanctioned by the UK.’

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are committed to investigating all cases of alleged abuse by UK service personnel  in Iraq.

‘We are currently investigating these specific allegations so it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’
