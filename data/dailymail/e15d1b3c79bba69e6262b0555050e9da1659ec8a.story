Tens of thousands of people have come to the defense of a grocery store cashier with Asperger's Syndrome after he was yelled at by an impatient customer because he was checking her 'too slow.'

Chris Tuttle, a seven year veteran and beloved member of staff at the Wegmans in Clay, New York, was serving the unnamed woman on Saturday when she flew off the handle, complaining to his manager and making him so shaken he dropped a candle.

Upset and still stressed 10 hours later, Tuttle told his sister, Jamie Tuttle-Virkler, about the incident, and she enlisted the help of her Facebook friends to lift his spirits.

However, the Internet was so touched by the story, Vickler's post has now received more than 82,000 'likes' and garnered more than 13,000 encouraging comments for her little brother who regular customers and even strangers agree is one of the happiest, most helpful people around.

'Do you know this guy Chris Tuttle?' Virkler asked, alongside a photo of the two of them. 'If you do, I need you to give him a shout out!'

She acknowledged Tuttle could be slow but said he wasn't usually a cashier though sometimes steps in to help out when Wegmans is busy, as was the case Saturday.

'Luckily the manager took him off 
register immediately because clearly he was upset,' Virkler wrote. 'The 
customer's problem? Chris was checking her out...TOO SLOW and she was 
furious. She yelled at him, the manager and anyone else who would 
listen.'

She said her brother took it to heart and had trouble moving on when someone criticized him.

'To
hear him tell the story, your heart will break,' she explained. 'He 
doesn't understand why someone would be so nasty to him and for him, he 
takes it personal.'

So she posted a simple request.

'Chris deserves better and if he's ever put a smile on your heart, could you let him know?' Virkler wrote. 'Could you leave a comment or the next time you go to Wegmans, could you tell him? I want him to have a better day.'

But she could never have guessed the impact her note, and Tuttle's story, would have.

People from all around the country responded with loving comments, calling him an inspiration and urging him to keep up the good work. Other people with Asperger's even voiced their support.

'Chris I don't even know you but I want you to know that you are wonderful and I love you for who you are!' one woman commented.

Another man wrote: 'You Rock Chris. She is the one with the problem, not you.'

On Monday, Virkler expressed her gratitude to everyone who wished her brother well.

'Amazing how much love and support... Thank you so much to everyone, I just wanted to brighten his day and WOW you have done more than that!' she wrote.
