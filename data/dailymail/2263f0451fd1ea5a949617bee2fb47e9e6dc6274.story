A man who was sexually abused by paedophile weatherman Fred Talbot has spoken of the torment of watching his abuser  on television for decades before seeing him brought to justice.

The former ITV presenter was convicted of a string of offences yesterday after jurors heard how he coerced young boys into simulating naked orgies on school trips in the 1970s and 80s.

He was remanded in custody after being found guilty of two sexual assaults against two boys and faces up to ten years in jail when sentenced next month. 

Another 20 alleged assaults, said to have taken place in Scotland, are being investigated.

One of Fred Talbot's victims has spoken of how he used to 'pray' the weatherman would fall into the water while presenting on ITV's This Morning from his floating map at Liverpool's Albert Dock

Now one of his victims has spoken of the horror of having to see the 65-year-old enjoy national acclaim as the once-beloved face of This Morning's weather for years after enduring his depravity. 

The man, now in his fifties, is one of five to have had their cases heard at Manchester Crown Court.

Just a young boy when he was attacked by the former teacher, he has told of watching a seemingly care-free Talbot hop between the floating platforms of his weather map at Liverpool's Albert Dock for years before seeing him prosecuted. 

'If I ever caught him on TV I prayed he would fall off that floating map into the water,' he told the Sun's Lauren Veevers. 

'I felt sick by the sight of him...everyone thought he was a fun weatherman.

'But I had this shocking secret I knew.' 

During the trial, in which jurors dismissed another eight counts of indecent assault, it was revealed Talbot abused boys while supervising school trips on boats.

On one occasion he told a group to strip naked and simulate an orgy while he took photographs.

The attacks were documented in a personal diary kept by Talbot, with the days on which each took place marked with an asterisk.

In a separate incident, Talbot told one boy to 'leave room for him in the middle of the bed' as there weren't 'enough bunk beds to go around'. 

The boy, who told jurors he was around 14 at the time, said it was then the former teacher performed a sex act on him. 

'He said this is natural and this is how men touch other men, because I didn't know what was going on.'

Later, he told the boys never to speak of what had happened on the trip and that it was 'their secret'.

Another victim was abused on another barge trip in similar circumstances.

He said that boys would take turns to sleep in Talbot's bed during the trip and when it was his turn the defendant 'started talking to me about sexual stuff'.

Talbot then began to indecently assault him and the schoolboy told him to stop, the court was told.

The complainant - who thought he may have been aged 14 at the time - said the defendant persisted and he kept pulling Talbot's hand away.

He said: 'I was a very naive child and I couldn't really understand it.'

The complainant said when he was aged in his late 20s he wrote to ITV Granada to tell them Talbot had abused him.

He said: 'I wrote an anonymous letter to Granada Reports but obviously they could not act on it.

'It was just to say that I had been sexually assaulted on an occasion by this man. I think I was a bit angry at the time'.

Talbot's perverted tendencies were spurred on by alcohol, he claimed in is diary, writing: 'I must drink less as the situation is getting out of hand. 

Paedophile: Talbot was said to have been 'obsessed' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and 'could not help himself' around them when under the influence of drink

When questioned by police, Talbot claimed the asterisks stood for panic attacks. 

The diary entries were used as evidence in the trial, brought to a dramatic pause when the paedophile gashed his forehead after falling over. 

Among witnesses testifying against the disgraced teacher was Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, one of his former pupils. 

Recalling his time at the school where Talbot taught, he said: 'Very early at school, I would not have been there a long time, Mr Talbot asked all the class if any of us had ever masturbated.

'He went on to explain how to masturbate, how you should masturbate and the following lesson he asked who had masturbated.' 

Yesterday Talbot was remanded in custody as the jury found him guilty of two counts of indecent assault against two boys. 

He was cleared of another eight, but told by a judge that his crimes were so serious he would be held until sentencing. 

It comes as police are investigating fresh claims of abuse said to have been carried out by the man in Scotland. 

It was revealed that one of his victims had reported him to police several times in the 1990s though nothing was done.
