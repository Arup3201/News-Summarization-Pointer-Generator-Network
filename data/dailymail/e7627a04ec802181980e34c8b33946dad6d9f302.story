The parents of a school official who went to the police over individuals who were stealing money from the district to buy methamphetamine have demanded that the FBI open an investigation into his suicide.

Alex Heitman, the school district’s supervisor of business services, reported the thefts to the Oak Ridge Police Department in Tennessee in April 2011.

Three months later in July, Mr Heitman, 29, was reported missing by his elementary school teacher wife Kristie, who was eight months' pregnant at the time.

Alex Heitman, a school district business services supervisor, reported  to police that people were passing fraudulent checks to buy meth. A few months later he was dead. His death was ruled a suicide

He
 was found dead on July 25 from a gunshot wound to the head in a rural 
part of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home. Two of Mr Heitman's own 
guns were found at the scene.

The death of Mr Heitman, who was also pursuing a doctorate degree, was ruled a suicide.

His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, remain extremely dubious that their son took his own life.

Mr Heitman, who is originally from Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, had bachelors and masters degrees from the University of Wisconsin, and an accounting certificate from the University of California-Berkley. 

The St Louis Cardinals fan had worked for the American Cancer Society and UNICEF before taking a job with the Oak Ridge School District.

He married Kristie Kasperski, a teacher, on June 28, 2008 in Waunakee, Wisconsin.

Oak Ridge police chief James Akagi refused to confirm Mr Heitman's original complaints of theft today

Mr and Mrs Heitman told Tennessee Watchdog that other than an autopsy report they have received no information from Cocke Country Sheriff's Department to support that their son committed suicide - no ballistics report,  coroner’s report, medical examiner’s report or undoctored crime scene photos.

The Heitmans were also initially told by a Cocke County Sheriff’s detective that their son's death did not seem consistent with suicide.

The Heitmans have now formally requested that the FBI investigate their son's death.

An anonymous source in the FBI’s mail room in Washington, D.C. told Tennessee Watchdog on Wednesday that a letter had been received from the family requesting an investigation.

MailOnline was awaiting a request for comment from the FBI field office in Knoxville, Tennessee.

The contents of the letter is also published on the family's website.

Oak Ridge Police Department's Chief of Police James T. Akagi told MailOnline today that Mr Heitman had been reported to his department as a missing person in 2011.

He refused to comment on whether Mr Heitman had filed reports with the police department, saying he was not familiar with the case.

MailOnline has requested Mr Heitman's police reports in the school district from the county clerk.

Cocke County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication. No one was available for comment at the district attorney's office on Thursday.

Seven people were prosecuted
 in relation to Mr Heitman's reports. Five pleaded guilty and were 
jailed, another suspect's charges were waived to the grand jury. The 
seventh suspect was not indicted.

At the time of his death, Oak Ridge superintendent Tom Bailey told Oakridger.com that his death was a 'terrible loss'.  Mr Bailey added that he was 'passionate about his work... intelligent and committed'.

Mr Heitman was responsible for business services in Oak Ridge School District. He suspected that people were stealing from the school district in 2011
