Kelly Percival, 32, locked the 43-year-old victim into her flat at which point a male and female accomplice jumped out and demanded £100

A honeytrap mother-of-one lured a lonely man to her flat with promises of a drunken romp before two thugs burst in and demanded cash.

Kelly Percival, 32, lured a 43-year-old to her flat for a 'sexual encounter' in April last year, but once he was inside he was set upon by a man and woman who said: 'Give me £100 or I will cut you up.'

Despite being punched several times in the head, he managed to escape, before calling the police who arrested Ms Percival.

Prosecutor Jolyon Perks told the court Pervical had started chatting to the victim over dating site Badoo, using the name 'Jess' on her profile.

Mr Perks said: 'This culminated in the complainant being invited to visit 'Jess' for what the victim believed would be effectively a date, a sexual encounter.

'He travelled to the address in a taxi, having bought vodka and cigarettes.'

The court heard when the victim arrived at the upstairs flat he was led by Percival, who by then had told him her real name, into the living room.

Mr Perks added: 'The complainant sat down on the settee and it was at that point a male and female burst into the room.

'The male immediately said "give me £100 or I will cut you up".'

The court heard the victim was also threatened by the female before he tried to get out and realised he was locked in the flat.

The male attacker demanded the victim's mobile phone when he saw him trying to contact the police before opening the door to let him out.

Mr Perks added: 'He was punched by the male to the head a number of times, which knocked off his glasses.'

The victim showed police his dating profile and messages and Pervical. Officers then used this to track her down as she had used pictures of herself as her profile images.

Mr Perks said: 'The defendant fully admitted agreeing with the others for the victim to go to her flat and they they would then effectively 'tax' him, get money by force.'

The man and woman who threatened the victim escaped, and have never been caught.

Percival was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years, with a supervision order.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that, despite being repeatedly punched in the head, the man managed to escape from the flat and call police, who arrested Percival

Judge Jeremy Freedman told her: 'He believed you were willing to engage in sexual relations with him on April 6 when he wnet to an address you had given him.

'When he arrived he was confronted by two other people who burst into the room and demanded £100 and threatened to cut him up.

'Your role was as a facilitator, you lured him to the property, knowing what was to happen.

'There was a plan afoot, it was not sophisticated but you had obviously agreed with the two others that is what you would do in order to rob him of a sum of money.

'I am satisfied, once he had been lured to the flat, you took no further role in the offence.

'Nevertheless, but for your involvement, the robbery could not have and would not have happened.'

The judge said the ordeal must have been a 'terrifying' experience for the victim, who has been left traumatised by what happened to him.

Vic Laffey, defending, said mum-of-one Percival got involved in the scam to feed her drug habit, which she is now handling.

Mr Laffey said: 'Her circumstances, at least for the moment, have taken a turn for the better. She appears to be getting some help and handling the drug problems. She is far better than she was.'
