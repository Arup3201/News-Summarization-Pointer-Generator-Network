The main worry for Nigeria over the past week has not been how on earth they're going to deal with Lionel Messi and Co in Group F, but that Kenneth Omeruo might succumb to a knee injury.

A collective sigh of relief was breathed all round when the 20-year-old Chelsea youngster was confirmed fit to start for the Super Eagles in their World Cup bow against Iran.

Although set to win just his 18th cap for Nigeria on Monday evening, Omeruo’s assured performances at in the middle of defence have seen him emerge as a crucial element to their plans.

Only ten days after his international debut last year, Omeruo made his name by performing admirably in every match in Nigeria’s acclaimed run to winning the African Nations Cup.

Since then, he’s been a mainstay in the side, helped immeasurably by his loan spell at Middlesbrough last season, able to operate at centre-half or right-back.

Far from being forgotten about while in the north east, parent club Chelsea awarded him a new contract last month to keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2018.

Plucked from Standard Liege by the Blues in January 2012, Omeruo had to wait until two years – via a loan spell at Dutch side ADO Den Haag – for his debut in English football.

Boro used manager Aitor Karanka’s Real Madrid connection with Jose Mourinho to secure the services of Omeruo on loan until the end of the season.

Once the Nigerian got his chance, he became a regular fixture for the mid-table side, often featuring alongside fellow Chelsea loanee Nathaniel Chalobah.

His uncomplicated style, strength and a level composure belying his lack of experience make him a solid presence at the back, particularly when dealing with the rigours of Championship forwards.

These qualities are underpinned by a great pace, leading many to think he has what it takes to step up to a higher level.

The World Cup will test that on the biggest stage imaginable. With the Iran clash the least troubling of the opening matches, few expect Nigeria to reach the last-16 at the expense of Bosnia or Argentina.

In players like Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic, Omeruo will face the biggest test of his career on Saturday, at least until Wednesday week, when he’ll be tasked with keeping the world’s best attacking talent at bay.

Even if Nigeria don’t make it through, Omeruo’s performances will be watched carefully by club boss Jose Mourinho.

With Tomas Kalas – so assured in his Premier League debut at Anfield – joining the hordes of Chelsea players on loan by signing up with Bundesliga new boys Cologne, there is a place at centre-half available in Chelsea’s squad for next season.

If Omeruo continues his rise in Brazil, Mourinho will find his designs on the spot hard to ignore.
