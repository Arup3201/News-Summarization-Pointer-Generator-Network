Almost 20 passengers got off a Malaysian aircraft as it was about to take off after they heard the pilots arguing in the cockpit, it has been revealed.

The loud argument scared the passengers as the plane, owned by Malaysia-based Malindo Air, was minutes from take-off at Penang Airport for a scheduled one-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.

After an apology from the pilot, many of those who had disembarked agreed to get back on board, but seven refused to take that flight.

The plane finally took off with the remaining 52 passengers after a 50 minute delay.

Almost 20 passengers got off a Malindo Air plane on Thursday after the pilots were heard fighting 

Small incidents, such as strange engine noises on planes have worried numerous Malaysians in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17.

The Star Asia News Network reported on Saturday that it had learned of the latest 'walk off' incident through a Facebook post, supposedly written by a friend of one of the passengers.

Later, one of the passengers, identified only as Mr Kee, said they had all heard a loud yell from the cockpit when a stewardess opened the door to come out.

Mr Kee said the pilot and the co-pilot were apparently having a 'serious fight.'

The flight was leaving from Penang Airport headed to Kuala Lumpur

He told The Star: 'It was so loud that all the passengers were shocked.

'A foreigner sitting on the front row then stood up and asked for permission to leave the aircraft. About 20 of us followed him.

'We went into the airport building and after a while the pilot came down from the plane to apologise to us and invited us back on board.'

Mr Kee said that while most of the passengers chose to go back, he and six others, including the unidentified foreigner, believed both the pilot and co-pilot were unfit to fly due to their emotional condition.

He told the newspaper that he and the others lodged a report at the airport police station.

The plane took off when most of the passengers returned to the flight, but seven refused to fly

Mr Raja Sa'adi Raja, public relations director for Malindo Air, apologised for the delay and the misunderstanding, claiming the situation could have been misinterpreted.

'The captain was instructing a third observer-trainee pilot in a stern manner as he and the co-pilot prepared for take-off,' said Mr Raja.

He told The Star that on hearing the loud instruction a passenger decided to get off due to reasons unknown and about 18 others followed.

Mr Raja said the pilots apologised 'for the uncomfortable situation that could have been misunderstood by a handful of passengers.'
