The family of a 27-year-old woman who vanished without a trace in 1975 has finally received some closure after the state medical examiner's office identified her body.

Priscilla Blevins’s sister, Cathy Blevins Howe, said Detective Lee Tuttle of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department knocked on her door on October 19 and told her, 'We found your sister'.

As it turns out, the remains of the North Carolina woman had spent more than 20 years locked away in a storage facility, with her loved ones left wondering what had happened to her.

Missing for decades: Priscilla Blevins, a native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was last seen by her roommate at their home on Tyvola Road on July 7, 1975

‘It was equal parts of relief, surprise, sorrow and joy at the opportunity to finally bring my sister home,’ Howe told the Huffington Post.

Ms Blevins, a native of Winston-Salem, was last seen by her roommate at their home on Tyvola Road on July 7, 1975.

Ten years later, a woman's body was found near Interstate 40 in Haywood County and taken to the Medical Examiner's Office in Chapel Hill.

However, the skeletal remains lacked any identifying characteristics and officials did not have the necessary technology at their disposal to make a positive match. 

And so the victim labeled as Jane Doe had remained locked away for more than 20 years.

The search for Ms Blevins got under way immediately after her mysterious disappearance, but the trail had quickly gone cold.

Initially, her parents, Bob and Sadie Blevins, led the effort to find and bring their daughter home, but after their deaths in 2001 and 2002, respectively, Ms Howe got involved in the cold case investigation along with Detective Tuttle.

‘As I got older and had a daughter of my own, my curiosity about this continued and it just never let up,’ she said. ‘I just decided that I wanted to see what I could find out.’

In 2009, Ms Howe provided her DNA to investigators, which was matched against samples collected from unidentified bodies by North Carolina officials and entered into the FBI’s national database, the Charlotte Observer reported.

The mitochondrial evidence combined with dental records confirmed that it was Ms Blevins' body which was found in Haywood County, about 150 miles from her home.

Ms Howe declined to comment on the investigation into her sister's death or whether she thinks foul play was involved, but she said she doubts that Blevins allowed herself to be taken to Haywood County, which is on the Tennessee border.

‘I don't think it was her own will that she was found on the side of the road,’ Ms Howe said.

Ms Howe said she was planning a business trip to Namibia when Detective Tuttle told ‘out of the blue’ her that her sister had been positively identified.

She decided to go ahead with her trip because ‘I gave myself time to absorb this shocking news.’

Ms Blevins graduated from Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem in 1966, according to her sister. She graduated from Wake Forest University in 1971.

Ms Blevins taught English in Bogota, Colombia, and was aspiring to become a translator for the United Nations. She had quit her job at Ivey's department store in Charlotte before she went missing.

In the late 1970s, Ms Blevins's disappearance drew the attention of then-U.S. Senator Jesse Helms and U.S. Rep Steve Neal, who put several federal agencies on alert for any sign of her.

Ms Howe said she is planning for a ‘memorial homecoming’ for Ms Blevins to be held November 17 in Wait Chapel at Wake Forest. The 27-year-old woman will be laid to rest beside her parents.
