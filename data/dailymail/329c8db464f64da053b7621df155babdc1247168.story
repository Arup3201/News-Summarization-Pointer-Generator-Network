An extraordinarily unlucky little boy has finally had a stroke of fortune.

Dexter Heffernan, 3, from the NSW South Coast town of Kiama Downs, was born with cerebral palsy on Friday the 13th, the legendary day of misfortune.

It has been a real struggle for little Dexter and his parents, mum Lenice and dad Andrew.

The infant has spent eighteen months - nearly half of his life - in hospital. He can't sit, stand, walk or crawl without help. He can only see on some days because of a vision impairment. And he has even battled liver cancer.

But the family are about to get a massive helping hand after a blog post calling for help went viral at the weekend.

The post, written by Mrs Heffernan's sister, Carol Laverty, explained how the family needed to renovate their single-level three bedroom brick home to make it disability-friendly for their little fighter.

Their home needs to be modified, for instance, so it is wheelchair accessible, and so Dexter can independently access the bathroom from his bedroom.

Mrs Heffernan, 34, thought the post was a 'crazy' idea and never expected the outpouring of support the family have received.

They have been deluged with pledges of support to fix up their home at 'mate's rates'.

'It's so overwhelming and amazing,' Mrs Heffernan told the Daily Mail Australia.

'I kind of put it down to a bit of a crazy idea that my sister had... I let her run with it and I said 'OK' and then it's all happened.'

His mother described him as a 'very cheeky boy'. 'But he's also very serious. He tries so hard,' she said

In the blog post, Ms Laverty said the young family were very deserving of help from the community.

'If we could cut a few costs of Lenice and Andrew on their house renovations, we would be giving them a huge helping hand.

'Even while penny-pinching for Dexter, Lenice and Andrew are quick to support others, and other charities. They do so quietly. They do so, because they know who hard it is.'

'These two people are 'givers', and it is not easy for them to be seen as 'that family that needs help'.

'But they are family and they do need help'.

When the blog was placed on social media it received more than 32 Facebook shares, a retweet from The Block Fans V Faves winners Chantelle Ford and Steve O'Donnell and several offers of support, including roofing, bathroom, tiling and glass work assistance.

It comes as a relief for the couple, who hold down jobs and are paying off a big mortgage, all while constantly taking Dexter to therapy and medical sessions, caring for his little sister, 19-month-old Charlotte, and preparing for the imminent birth of another little girl.

'He is a very, very cheeky boy, always has been,' Mrs Heffernan told Daily Mail Australia. 'But he's also very serious. He tries so hard.'

'There's something about him - people meet him and they tend to just fall in love with him.'

She and her husband never thought too much about the unlucky symbolism of Dexter being born on Friday the 13th. If anything, she thinks it was a very lucky day.

'Dexter probably shouldn't have survived the first couple of weeks of his life. He certainly shouldn't have survived other things - surgeries and what not. But he's still here.

'(Friday the 13th) has got to be a lucky number.'
