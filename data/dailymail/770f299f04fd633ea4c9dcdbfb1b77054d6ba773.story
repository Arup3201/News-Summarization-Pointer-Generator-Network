An incredible insight into how a major earthquake changed the landscape – down to a few inches – has been made possible thanks to cutting edge LiDAR scanning technology.

It stands for 'light detection and ranging' and involves bouncing a stream of laser pulses off the ground, which gives scientists an incredibly detailed image of the landscape.

Luckily for a team of U.S, Mexican and Chinese geologists, a LiDAR scan had already been made of an area in Mexico hit by an earthquake, giving them the opportunity to create the most comprehensive ‘before and after’ image of such a disaster zone ever created.

‘We can learn so much about how earthquakes work by studying fresh fault ruptures,’ said Michael Oskin, geology professor at the University of California, Davis, and lead researcher.

The team, working with the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, flew over an area near Mexicali, northern Mexico, that was hit by a magnitude 7.2 event in April 2010 and scanned it with LiDAR.

The researchers were able to make a detailed scan over about 140 square miles in less than three days, Oskin said.

Oskin said that they knew the area had been mapped with LiDAR in 2006 by the Mexican government.

When the earthquake occurred, Oskin and Ramon Arrowsmith at Arizona State University applied for and got funding from the National Science Foundation to carry out an immediate aerial survey to compare the results.

But the LiDAR survey further reveals warping of the ground surface adjacent to faults that previously could not easily be detected, Oskin said.

For example, it revealed the folding above the Indiviso fault running beneath agricultural fields in the floodplain of the Colorado River.

‘This would be very hard to see in the field,’ Oskin said.

Team members used the ‘virtual reality’ facility at UC Davis's W. M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences to handle and view the data from the survey. By comparing pre- and post-earthquake surveys, they could see exactly where the ground moved and by how much.

The survey revealed deformation around the system of small faults that caused the earthquake, and allowed measurements that provide clues to understanding how these multi-fault earthquakes occur.

The 2010 Mexicali earthquake did not occur on a major fault, like the San Andreas, but ran through a series of smaller faults in the Earth's crust. These minor faults are common around major faults but are ‘underappreciated,’ Oskin said.

‘This sort of earthquake happens out of the blue,’ he said.

The new LiDAR survey shows how seven of these small faults came together to cause a major earthquake, Oskin said.

Ken Hudnut, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper, made the first use of airborne LiDAR about 10 years ago to document surface faulting from the Hector Mine earthquake.

But ‘pre-earthquake’ data were lacking. Since then, NCALM has carried out LiDAR scans of the San Andreas system and other active faults in the western U.S, thereby setting a trap for future earthquakes, he said.

‘In this case, fortunately, our CICESE colleagues had set such a trap, and this earthquake fell right into it and became the first ever to be imaged by ‘before’ and ‘after'‘ LiDAR.

It is a thrill for me to be on the team that reached this important milestone,’ Hudnut said.
