Eight-hour battle: Forty-stone Russell Parkin was rescued from his flat days after Britain's fattest teen Georgia Davis (pictured) was freed in similar cicrumstances in a £100,000 operation

Seventeen firefighters and paramedics battled for eight hours to free a 40-stone man after he fell ill at home.

Russell Parkin, 41, was dragged downstairs from his second-floor flat in a giant bowl-shaped 'sledge' by 15 men before being lifted into a reinforced ambulance.

Two doors had to be removed so he could be squeezed outside, screened by a tarpaulin for privacy.

Paramedics were called to Mr Parkin's home in New Eltham, South East London, at around 8pm on Saturday, but had to draft in the fire service for extra help.

It wasn't until 4am when neighbours said they were woken by the sound of the sled bumping down the stairs.

A neighbour told The Sun how the former security worker had ballooned recently after living on a diet of Indian takeaways and food delivered by Tesco.

They said: 'He struggled to get anywhere. He needed a five-minute rest after climbing the first of two flights of steps to his flat.'

Another neighbour said the emergency workers weren't sure how to get Mr Parkin out, adding: 'They wanted to remove his front window and have him lifted out.

'But they said they'd need to remove the brickwork underneath too as it would be impossible to lift him over that.'

Mr Russell, who lives with his girlfriend Lorraine Ward, 41, was yesterday believed to be in a nearby hospital, although his condition was unknown.

The rescue comes days after 63st Georgia Davis was freed in a £100,000 operation in which the walls of her home had to be knocked down.

Georgia, dubbed Britain's fattest teen, was winning her fight for life yesterday after a spate of medical problems brought on by her weight.

Huge resources: The operation to free Georgia from her home in Aberdare, South Wales, is thought to have cost around £100,000

The 19-year-old is in a 'stable condition' after doctors gave her emergency treatment for a series of obesity-related ailments.

After four days on a specialist ward, she is recovering well and getting over the trauma of being cut from her bedroom.

Her mother, Lesley, 57, and stepdad Arthur Treloar, 73, have been feeding her fresh fruit at Prince Charles Hospital, in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales.

And she been inundated with messages of support from well wishers around the world who are urging her to beat over food demons.

A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals.

'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'

Today, it emerged that she had moved away from home in a desperate bid to lose weight.

She started a new life on a healthier diet by sharing a flat with a friend.

But a friend said Georgia returned home to look after her sick stepfather.

Friend Jade Tarrant, 19, said Georgia was just 18st after going to fat camp and how she wanted to have more control over her diet away from home.

Jade said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again.

'She’d came to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step dad got so stressful.

'She just wanted a break - she wanted to some girly time. She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it.

'But she missed her mum and stepdad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

Georgia is suffering from complications including diabetes, kidney failure, and problems with her spine, joints and skin.

Doctors and obesity experts have put her on a 2,000 calorie a day diet in desperate bid to help her shed the pounds.

And the teen, who has a Body Mass Index is 142.3 - people with a BMI of over 30 are classed as obese - is said to be recovering well.

A friend of the Georgia's family said: 'I just hope that she gets better and that I'm thinking of her.

'I know a lot of people feel the same as me you can just see the support from all the letters she's had.

'We really want to help her get through this, to get her out of bed and back on the track to a normal life.'

It is said that Georgia had been struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend.

Britain’s fattest teenager Georgia Davis moved away from home in a desperate bid to lose weight - but returned to her parents to balloon from 18stone to 63stone.
