Old money: Lady Jacqueline Killearn's bid to sell her stately home has been blocked after opposition from her son

When her husband was Britain’s wartime ambassador to Cairo, she rose to the pinnacle of society, entertaining Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and King Farouk of Egypt.

And at the age of 102, despite dwindling funds, Lord Killearn’s widow Jacqueline still wishes to be maintained in the style to which she long ago became accustomed.

But when the centenarian baroness tried to quickly raise £1.65million by selling her Jacobean mansion – ‘significantly’ below its market value – she started a row with her son and grandson which had to be resolved in the High Court.

The judge barred her from selling the 17th century Haremere Hall and its  surrounding 100 acres of grounds near Etchingham, East Sussex.

It is a humiliating dispute for Lady  Killearn, who also owns a £10million mansion in Harley Street, London, to become embroiled in – but not the first.

Three years ago the Mail revealed that her butler Paolo Sclarandis was taking her to an employment tribunal, claiming unfair dismissal.

Mr Sclarandis, 67, who worked for Lady Killearn at Harley Street, said she lived amid squalor and behaved like a despot, calling him a ‘selfish prat’, a ‘toad’ and a ‘monster’ and hurling walking sticks at him during 67-hour working weeks.

The butler, of Hammersmith, West London, won £2,000 in compensation.

authorisation to sell 17th century Haremere Hall, in Etchingham, East Sussex,
which is held in a family trust

He said at the time: ‘Lady Killearn still thinks she’s living in the glory days of the British Empire.

‘But she lives in squalor, with 
dangerous wiring, piles of clothes in her cramped bedroom and her 
bathroom falling to pieces. And she treated me like a slave.’

The latest case against her was fought by her son Lord Victor Killearn, 68, and grandson Miles Lampson, 33.

Haremere Hall – bought by the late 
first baron Killearn after he returned to Britain from his key Second 
World War ambassadorship in Cairo – is currently held in a family trust.
Seven years ago it failed to sell when put on the market for £4million.

Lady Killearn recently lodged an 
‘urgent’ application with the High Court seeking a judge’s authorisation
to sell the mansion, built in 1612 and which boasts 13 bedrooms, to a 
purchaser who had offered her £1.65million and the right to remain in an
apartment there for the rest of her life.

Her application was blocked by the 
current Lord Killearn, of Lower Swell, near Stow-on-the-Wold, 
Gloucestershire, and his son and heir Mr Lampson. They claim the 
property had been ‘significantly undervalued’.

Lady Killearn’s barrister, Peter John,
told the court a speedy sale of Haremere Hall with leave to remain 
living there would give her peace of mind and security, and accused her 
son of acting unfairly by obstructing the sale.

He told Judge Jeremy Cousins QC the 
family trust was ‘to all intents and purposes insolvent – with no assets
beyond Haremere Hall’.

Lady Killearn had ploughed much of her
limited funds into maintaining the ancient house – where bills reach 
£80,000 a year, and full repairs would cost almost £2million – and the 
trust now owed ‘substantial sums’ to her, he told the court.

Mr John said she was entitled to 
‘enjoy the final period of her life – however long that may be – in a 
bit more luxury than she has at the moment’.

Lady Killearn was ‘eking out her life 
from a small amount of money paid out from another family trust, and her
widow’s pension’, he added.

The £1.65million offer represented a 
realistic price, argued Mr John, given the slump in the country house 
market, the scale of repairs needed, and the mansion’s status as a Grade
I listed building which  will demand attention from specialised 
craftsmen.

He added: ‘It is simply quite unfair for Lord Killearn to stand in the way of his mother in this last period of her life.’

The judge was also told Lady Killearn 
is reluctant to spend much of her time at her Harley Street residence 
because her limited funds mean she has to let rooms to doctors. Judge 
Cousins, however, rejected Lady Killearn’s bid to sell the house, which 
he described as a ‘truly splendid’ building.

He accepted arguments from Lord 
Killearn, who went to Eton, and was a captain in the Scots Guards before
working in the City, that even if the historic house needed to be sold,
it should be  marketed properly and put up for sale at a much higher 
price.
