Hatem Ben Arfa has joined the growing list of footballers to pen an open letter to fans on leaving a club.

Angel Di Maria was at it when he left Real Madrid for Manchester United before French playmaker Ben Arfa, who departed Newcastle for Hull after four years on Tyneside, said his goodbyes, wished the club well, thanked them for the memories, blah, blah, blah.

We've heard it all before and frankly, we'd be happy if we never heard it again.

So, scroll down for an open letter we've written to players everywhere.

And he's off: Hatem Ben Arfa wrote an open letter to Newcastle fans after leaving to join Hull City

Write move: Angel Di Maria also penned a message for fans of his old club when he joined Manchester United

Dear departing footballer,

The time has come for us to say goodbye. Thanks for the memories and all that - it's been emotional.

As you set out on the next stage of your career, we wish you well but would ask just one more thing of you.

Don't worry, we won’t expect you to take it easy when we play against your new team.

No, our request is that you don't write an open letter to the fans. Please, please, please don't write an open letter to the fans. Whatever you do, DON'T write an open letter to the fans.

There's no need to tell us about the special journey you've been on over the past (insert number here) years as we were there, right with you, every step of the way.

We paid (lots) for the privilege, making our own way there on planes, trains and automobiles - not luxury club coaches and private jets. With this in mind, we know we are fantastic supporters. So, no need to remind us of that fact either.

Don't bang on about us all being part of one big family. Granted, we shouted at you on Boxing Day one year but let's be honest, we'll never sit down for Christmas dinner together and Gran wouldn't know you from Adam.

We know you'll have many happy memories from your time with us, probably millions.

And you know the bit about the 'special place in your heart' that you were going to put near the end of your message? It can't be that special as almost every player making a move during the recent transfer window claims to have the same place.

Anyway, hope this finds you well.

Best wishes,

MailOnline Sport, on behalf of the fans

And another thing - nobody writes letters these days.
