A leading Cambridge University professor has called for an end to the 'self-deprecatory' English psychology that is causing politicians and the media to attack academic excellence.

Professor Robert Lethbridge said the top universities go to great lengths to counter the 'toff' public image, akin to Brideshead Revisited, which he says 'bears no resemblance' to the reality.

Lethbridge, the Master of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, and Provost of the Gates Cambridge Trust, said the universities reach out to applicants from all walks of life - in fact they couldn't 'try any harder'.

The professor's comments come as it's revealed students at Oxford University voted against spending funds on a painting of the Queen to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee - because they felt it was supporting elitism.

Undergraduates at Keble College wanted to spend £200 on a picture of Her Majesty but college members, whose alumni include the Duke of Kent’s grandson Edward Windsor, voted 54 to 17 against it.

The Government has also repeatedly claimed that Oxbridge universities fail to admit enough applicants from state schools, with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg warning they institutions had a duty of care to 'ensure British society of better reflected'.

Lethbridge said universities such as Oxford and Cambridge had been forced to go to such great lengths to counter the elitism image.

'I think we need to constantly stress that, at the very top of our education system, we are utterly meritocratic,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'We need to counter the self-deprecatory dimension of Englishness and we need to no longer retail the Brideshead Revisited, toff image of Oxford and Cambridge which some uninformed people find as a lazy target.'

Lethbridge raised his concerns as he unveiled that the multimillion pound Bill Gates Cambridge Trust had reached a 1,000-student milestone.

The £210 million scholarship has helped students from 94 countries since 2011, completing research in a range of academic disciplines. This month sees the 10th anniversary of the first graduations.

The 'toff' Oxbridge image appears to only exist in the UK, holding back some bright school-leavers, he said. Overseas, however, applicants clamour for places at the universities.

'I suspect again that it is a problem of image, perception and prejudice and also a mindset which doesn’t want anyone to fail,' he told the Telegraph.

Politicians in particular brandished inaccurate statistics about the universities' admissions, suggesting 'social immobility and inherited privilege,' he said.

However, new student joining the institutions are 'absolutely astonished that it bears no resemblance to what they saw on TV and we have got to change that image,' he said.
