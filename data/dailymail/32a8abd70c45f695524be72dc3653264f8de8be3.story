Families of demonstrators killed or wounded on Bloody Sunday are to be paid compensation, it was disclosed yesterday.

Ministry of Defence officials have written to lawyers for victims’ families promising payments and the ministry said it intended to deal with claims as quickly as possible.

The payments – which are likely to total about £10million – may at last bring to an end the expensive legal wrangling over the killing of 14 people in Londonderry by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment in January 1972.

Bloody Sunday became a spur to IRA recruiting over the 25 years of violence that followed.

David Cameron apologised for the shootings last year after the publication of the Saville inquiry report into Bloody Sunday.

The report, which took 12 years and £200m to produce, found that ‘out-of-control’ paratroopers had engaged in an indefensible shooting spree.

In the 15 months since the Prime Minister’s apology, prosecutors in Northern Ireland appear to have made no progress towards any prosecution of the soldiers involved, and a criminal trial is widely regarded as an impossibility 40 years after the event.

The MoD indicated its intention to pay compensation in a reply to law firm Madden and Finucane, which represents many of the families.

The firm asked what the Government was doing to compensate victims’ families ‘for the loss of their loved ones, the wounding of others, and the shameful allegations which besmirched their good name for many years’.

There was no indication of the likely scale of the payments yesterday.

One pointer may be the amount of compensation paid to the family of solicitor Pat Finucane, founder of Madden and Finucane, following his murder by loyalist gunmen in front of his wife and three children at their Belfast home in 1989.

According to documents later published by the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Finucane’s widow Geraldine was paid £500,000 under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

1972 Bloody Sunday massacre where civilians were killed by soldiers of the 1st Parachute Regiment during a civil rights march in Londonderry1972 Lord Widgery's inquiry heard testimonies from the soldiers, who claimed they had been shot at, while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed. Lord Widgery produced a report that took the army's side. 1998 Tony Blair said a new inquiry would be held2000 The Bloody Sunday Inquiry opened properly in 2000 when formal public hearings began at the Guildhall in Derry. The Inquiry held public hearings on 116 days over the year, clocking up more than 600 hours of evidence. 2004 Judges retired on 23 November 2004. They reconvened once again on 16 December to listen to testimony from another key witness.2010 The Saville Report was handed to government lawyers on 24 March 2010, twelve years after the inquiry was established.2009 The chairman of the inquiry, Lord Saville, revealed that the inquiry would be handed to the government in March 2010, some 9 years after the first evidence was heard; a delay which Lord Saville admitted was 'extremely disappointing'. 2010 The report of the inquiry was published on 15 June 2010 and thousands of people walked the path that the civil rights marchers had taken on Bloody Sunday before they were shot at.

Payments at a similar level would suggest a compensation bill to taxpayers totalling around £10m – a small sum compared with the cost of the Saville inquiry.

Swift compensation payments could also avoid political rows which might threaten to upset Northern Ireland’s fragile peace.

But yesterday, sisters Linda and Kate Nash, whose teenage brother William was among those who died, said they found the idea of compensation ‘repulsive’ and would refuse any payment.

Linda Nash added: ‘Not under any circumstances will I ever accept money for the loss of my brother.

‘I find it repulsive taking anything from the MoD.

'I've already told 
my legal team I want to go forward with prosecutions.'

Miss Nash noted that Britain in the early 
1970s had offered her mother a cursory compensation payment of £250.

'She didn't take it then and I will be 
doing the same,' she said.

Bloody
Sunday changed the course of the violence that erupted in Northern 
Ireland in the late 1960s and helped to make 1972 the deadliest year of 
the 'Troubles'.     

Troops 
opened fire after a march descended into rioting in the Bogside, a 
nationalist area of Londonderry.

They killed 13 people and wounded 14 
others, one of whom died later.               

Unionists
warned last month against 'rewriting the history of the Troubles' by 
portraying British forces as the only guilty party during the 
conflict.

The 
Bloody Sunday Inquiry, authorised by former Prime Minister Tony Blair in
the immediate build-up to the Good Friday peace accord of 1998, was 
empowered to find the truth behind the British Army's worst act of 
violence in Northern Ireland. Families of the dead had demanded such a 
probe for decades.

The investigation produced a 5,000-page report based on evidence from 921 witnesses, 2,500 written statements and 60 volumes of written evidence.

Lord Saville gave the ex-paratroopers, now in their 60s and 70s, broad protections from criminal charges as well as anonymity in the witness box, citing the risk that IRA dissidents might target them in retaliation.

But legal experts say wiggle room remains for prosecutions and, more likely, civil lawsuits against the retired soldiers, particularly those who were found to have lied during their testimony.
