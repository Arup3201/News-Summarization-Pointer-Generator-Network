The world's most expensive Toyota has been sold for a staggering $1.2 million.

For the same price - around Â£80,000 - car enthusiasts could pick up a sleek brand new sports car like the British Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

But one buyer was more than happy to break the record for the highest amount of money ever paid for a Toyota as this left-hand drive 2000GT was dubbed Japan's first ever supercar in the 1960s.

And, unlike the company's famous advertising slogan, it's unlikely you will spot one of these in front of you as only 62 were ever built and only a handful were ever exported out of Japan.

In top condition: The interior of the 45-year-old 2000GT, which has just 62,000 on the clock, has been restored to high standards

Unique: The two seat hardtop coupe was first displayed to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1965

The sale of the sports car which boasts a top speed of 135mph was handled by Canadian-based RM Auctions.

An RM auctions spokesperson Megan McGrail explained why this six-cylinder car fetched such a high price.

Ms McGrail said: 'The 2000GT was the Japanese E-Type, a car that could run against the best that Europe had to offer.

'This car is without a doubt the finest and most authentic 2000GT to come to market in recent years.

'It has been credited with establishing the Toyota name as a force to be reckoned with in the automotive world.

Collectible: Experts believe the 200GT Toyota is the most desirable Japanese car ever manufactured

'As its wonders have begun to achieve recognition in recent years, surviving examples have become highly sought-after.

'Today, the 2000GT is universally described as the most collectible, desirable, and valuable Japanese automobile ever produced.'

The Toyota was sold by the Texas-based Don Davis Collection, who bought the car from another Texas car collector.

Ms McGrail added: 'The car had been previously restored to high standards.

One of a few: Only 62 left-hand drive 2000GT Toyota cars were ever built and only a handful were ever exported out of Japan.

Packing quite a kick: With a 2.0litre engine, the 2000GT can reach top speeds of 135mph

'But during its time in the Davis Collection it has undergone significant work to improve the restoration's authenticity.

'This includes painting the inside of the headlamp buckets black, applying the correct grey finish around the side window surrounds, finishing the wheels the correct colour.

'The Toyota was taken down to bare metal and re-spraying the body its original Bendix Yellow.

'The reading of 62,000 miles is believed original, as demonstrated by the excellent condition of the unrestored gauges, dash, console, and seats, which are all in highly original condition.'

Bidding war: The sale of the car, which had already been restored to high standards, was handled by Canadian-based RM Auctions
