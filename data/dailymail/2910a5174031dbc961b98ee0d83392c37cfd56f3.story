A smuggler  tried to sneak 94 iPhones into China by strapping and concealing them around his torso - but was foiled when customs officers noticed his 'weird walking posture'.

Embarrassing pictures show the man standing with his trousers down as officers reveal the startling number of mobiles attached to his body.

He was seized at Futian Port, an immigration port of entry on the border between mainland China and Hong Kong.

Foiled: A smuggler was caught trying to sneak 94 iPhones into China by strapping and concealing them around his torso

Customs officers grew suspicious after seeing a male passenger with 'weird walking posture, joint stiffness and muscle tension', reports the Huffington Post. 

Smuggling under Hong Kong law, where this man was said to be caught, can warrant a seven-year prison sentence and a fine as high as  $2m (£171,000).

According to the report, so-called 'mobile armor' is a fairly common tactic for phone smugglers. 

All of Apple's iPhones are actually made in China under contract before being shipped to countries around the world -but purchasing one in the country can be a challenge.

Not long ago, the only way to do so was through the black market.

Recently, deals can be agreed to with legitimate providers such as China Mobile but supplies of the latest models are usually limited.

And contracts and handsets are expensive compared to the devices made by Chinese manufacturers.

According to the FT, an unlocked 16GB iPhone 6 is around £577. At around 18 per cent of the annual salary in China, it's a costly buy. 

As a result, buying new or second-hand handsets outside China and smuggling them into the country can be a lucrative business.

Most of the devices in the pictures appear to be the iPhone 5S but there are also some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models in view.
