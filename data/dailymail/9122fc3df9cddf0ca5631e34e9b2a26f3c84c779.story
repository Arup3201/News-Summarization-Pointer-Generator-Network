An urgent review of stealth speed cameras has been ordered to determine if they should be painted yellow, roads minister John Hayes has said.

It was reported last month that the devices - dubbed 'stealth cameras' by critics - have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months on the M25 in Kent.

Unlike traditional speed cameras, the gantry devices are painted grey, making them harder to spot for drivers.

Stealth speed cameras such as the one circled have caught almost 700 drivers on the M25 in Kent in just two months

The camera technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 (pictured) and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6

But this may yet change, with a review of the initiative now underway in order to determine if they should be more clearly signposted and coloured yellow.

Mr Hayes said: 'I have been concerned about "stealth cameras" and have ordered a review as a matter of priority to look at exactly where they are, what they are being used for and how they are signed,' The Daily Telegraph reported.

'I think it's important that people know where speed cameras are. The suggestion that stealth is involved is not reasonable.'

The technology uses front and rear-facing cameras to verify a vehicle’s speed.

And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four. 

They are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance.

The camera technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6.

Motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit.

The Association of Chief Police Officers recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone.

In 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009.

Ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were in operation for 24 hours a day.

In total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £100 that year.

It was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £2,500 to £10,000.

The grey cameras being installed across Britain's busiest motorways can track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic.

Conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey.

Attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle's speed.

The same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database.

They enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed.
