Following the disastrous 7-1 defeat to eventual world champions Germany, Brazil are yet to concede under the stewardship of Dunga and have won all four of their matches since the summer tournament.

Turkey, meanwhile, currently sit bottom of their Euro 2016 qualifying group having picked up just a single point against Latvia following defeats to Iceland and the Czech Republic.
