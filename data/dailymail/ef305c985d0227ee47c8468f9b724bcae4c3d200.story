Three German families who lost relatives when Malaysia Airline Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine plan to sue for negligence.

Elmar Maria Giemulla plans to issue the suit at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg soon.

Professor Giemulla, 63, is a specialist in aviation law and claims that if Ukraine could not guarantee the safety of aeroplanes it should have closed its airspace.

“Since that didn’t happen, Ukraine is liable for damages,” he said.

He added that more families are welcome to join the suit and he is considering suing Russia as well if evidence emerges to prove its involvement.

“For this I’m dependent on the support of Western governments,” he said.

German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that Prof Giemulla wants compensation of £787,000 for each victim of the attack that killed 298 people.

Prof Giemulla was also critical of the maximum compensation of £110,000 allowed under an international treaty, claiming that its intent was to stop airlines being forced into bankruptcy not protect governments that contribute to disasters.

MH17 was shot down on 17 July over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Western leaders have said that Russia gave materiel to the rebels but there is, as yet, no evidence that Moscow ordered the plane to be shot down. Russian President Vladimir Putin (above)
