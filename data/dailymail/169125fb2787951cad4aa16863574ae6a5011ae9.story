Angry: Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, said it was a 'nonsense incident' that spiralled out of control and accused others of 'jumping on the bandwagon'

The senior PC on duty on Downing Street during Andrew Mitchell's 'toxic' 'f****** pleb' outburst said today he felt sorry for the MP and criticised Scotland Yard's handling of the case. 

Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, said it was a 'nonsense incident' that spiralled out of control.  

No-one should have lost their job over what happened at the gates of Downing Street and the Police Federation 'jumped on the bandwagon', using the incident as a 'hook to hang their grievances on', he said.

He also criticised Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe's handling of the affair: 'I was a lowly PC. I think he could have done more at the time, but who am I to say that.'

Mr Richardson also said that the Commissioner's letter in response to his complaints was 'not worth the stamp'. 

Earlier he told the High Court this week the 'Plebgate' row was 'just a quirky incident with a gentleman on a bicycle who had the hump'.

Yesterday High Court judge decided that former chief whip Mr Mitchell did call Pc Toby Rowland a 'pleb' because the officer did not have the 'wit, imagination or inclination' to invent it.

Mr Justice Mitting said he had reached the 'firm conclusion' that the 58-year-old MP used the 'politically-toxic' word in Downing Street that evening in September 2012 when he was not allowed to cycle through the main vehicle gates.

Mr Mitchell, who resigned as whip a month after the altercation, vehemently denied during his two-week libel action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) that he had said: 'Best you learn your f****** place - you don't run this f****** government - you're f****** plebs.'

He said he would never call a policeman a pleb 'let alone a f****** pleb' although he agreed he muttered audibly under his breath 'I thought you lot were supposed to f****** help us' - but not directed at the officer.

Mr Mitchell, who now faces a hefty legal bill, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' with the ruling.

Ruling: A judge yesterday rejected 'absurd' claims by millionaire Mr Mitchell that police officer conspired to discredit him - but Mr Richardson said today it was a 'nonsense incident' and he felt sorry for the MP

Battle: The policeman and the MP clashed at the gates of Downing Street and the 15-second exchange has sparked criminal and civil cases and left Mr Mitchell with a £3million bill

Mr Richardson, who heard part of the exchange and gave evidence in the High Court case, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Met should have drawn a line under the incident, which had been leaked to the press.

'I said in my evidence in chief last week that it was a nonsense incident that shouldn't have cost Mr Mitchell his job, certainly shouldn't have cost the officers who were whistleblowers or - whatever your opinion of them is, whether they were leakers or whistleblowers - it shouldn't have cost them their jobs.

'But here we are, with that. Mr Mitchell lost his sense of humour. Who hasn't lost their sense of humour at work?'

Asked if he felt sorry for Mr Mitchell, Mr Richardson said 'I very much do', but also expressed sympathy for the police officers who lost their jobs as a result of the investigations into how details of the incident were leaked.

'It was all totally unnecessary,' he said. 'I do feel sorry for Mr Mitchell, yes.'

Mr Richardson said he had written to his superior officer setting out what had happened in the hope that the Met could have put the matter 'into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there'.

But he said: 'They were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was, but I was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest to the organisation. The Commissioner had decided that a line would be drawn under it there.'

Mr Richardson said: 'It could have been said that it is a minor incident that has be leaked to the newspapers and let's all move on.

'But of course we didn't move on and we ended up all at the High Court last week and this week.

'It's a great shame and at what cost to so many people.'

Mr Richardson said the Police Federation needs 'serious reform', adding: 'I think they need to more clearly represent their members. This was not a hook to hang their grievances on.'
