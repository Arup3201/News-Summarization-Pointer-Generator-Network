Karl Lagerfeld has long been a favorite among grown-up fashionistas, and now he is set to try his hand at a whole new category - children's clothing.

The German designer, 81, has partnered with France's Groupe CWF to create a line of rock 'n' roll-inspired childrenswear, featuring apparel and accessories for boys and girls aged zero to 16 years old.

No doubt the designs will have been approved by Hudson Kroenig, Lagerfeld's adorable five-year-old godson and muse who frequently walks the catwalk in his high-fashion shows.

The children's collection will be unveiled in spring 2016, with two seasonal collections released each year thereafter and prices reportedly averaging £17.

Pier Paolo Righi, president and chief executive officer of Karl Lagerfeld, said in a release that the Karl Lagerfeld Kidswear collection 'presents a unique opportunity to share our cool, ironic, iconic DNA with a wider Karl Lagerfeld audience.'

Calling the venture a 'natural fit', he added: 'The announcement reflects the brand's ongoing commitment to newness and will allow Karl Lagerfeld to share its ironic, playful, creative vision with a young audience.' 

Lagerfeld regularly features his godson Hudson (middle, with Cara Delevingne in January 2014), the son of model Brad Kroenig, in his shows

This may be Lagerfeld's first foray into children's-wear, but it's a move that makes sense, seeing as he regularly features his godson Hudson, son of model Brad Kroenig, in his shows.

Hudson made his runway debut in the Chanel spring/summer 2011 show, and he's racked up quite the portfolio since.

The photogenic youngster has graced the pages of German Vogue, been photographed by his godfather - whom he calls 'Uncle Karl' - multiple times, and last October was chosen to model in a Chanel campaign alongside Joan Smalls.

He held hands with Cara Delevingne while his godfather took a bow at the Chanel spring/summer 2014 couture show in Paris, and he has starred in a Fendi campaign with supermodel Anja Rubik.

Before Hudson, his father Brad (pictured with Hudson at the Chanel Metiers d'Art Collection 2014/15 in Paris) was Lagerfeld's longtime muse, having first met the designer on a shoot in 2003

Lagerfeld, who does not have any children of his own, even made a four-volume book of photos, Metamorphoses Of An American, devoted entirely to Brad.

But now, it appears 35-year-old Brad has been replaced by his son, and with Hudson's impressive track record, it will come as no surprise if he is chosen to model the new collection when it launches next year.
