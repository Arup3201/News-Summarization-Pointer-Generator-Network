A barge carrying almost one million gallons of thick, sticky oil collided with a ship in Galveston Bay near Houston, Texas Saturday afternoon creating a huge oil slick.

Authorities are uncertain of how much marine fuel oil is leaking from the barge, though as of 10 p.m. Saturday local time, crews had yet to contain the spill, the Associated Press reported. 

The captain of the 585-foot ship Summer Wind called the collision into the Coast Guard at 12:30 p.m., shortly after the incident. The barge, which was being towed by the tugboat Miss Susan from Texas City to Bolivar, was carrying 924,000 gallons of fuel.

However, officials believe that only one of the barge's fuel tanks was punctured, though that tank contained 168,000 gallons of oil.

They would also not say whether one vessel hit the other, or if weather played a factor in the crash.

Marine traffic into and out of the ports of Galveston and Texas has been suspended, according to the Galveston Daily News, as crews continue to clean up the site.

A boom was set up around the collision site to prevent oil from reaching environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, crews were working throughout the night to skim oil off the surface of the bay.

However, cleanup could take some time due to the type of oil that is leaking.

The oil was described as 'sticky, gooey, thick, tarry stuff' by Jim Suydam, a spokesman for the General Land Office. 'That stuff is terrible to have to clean up.'

The oil is also known as bottom of the barrel oil since it is so thick. Because it does not evaporate quickly, the cleanup would likely take days, said Coast Guard Capt. Brian Penoyer.

The cleanup effort was helped on Saturday by favorable weather that included mild weather and calm water. However, that is set to change today as storms are set to enter the area.

The barge itself remains partially submerged in one of the bay's channels.

Six crew members on the the tow vessel were injured and were in stable condition, according to the Coast Guard.

Another concern is that the spill occurred in an area known as a popular bird habitat as the peak of the migratory season nears.
