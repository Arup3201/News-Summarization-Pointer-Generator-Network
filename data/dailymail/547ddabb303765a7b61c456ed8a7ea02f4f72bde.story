Of all the contenders to replace Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was little mentioned.

The 76-year-old reportedly received the second most votes after Joseph Ratzinger, the last pope, in the 2005 papal election.

And as a representative of South America's Catholics - who make up an estimated 40 per cent of the 1.2 billion strong church, he was widely supported on a massive scale.

He became Pope Francis after a surprisingly quick conclave winning 77 votes, or two-thirds of the 115 cardinals' votes, on the fifth ballot.

His decision to pick the name Francis evokes key Christian tenets such as simplicity and humility.

And they are fitting for a man who, spending nearly his entire career in Argentina, is known for catching the bus and eschewing the luxuries of high office.

His personal style is said to be the antithesis of Vatican splendour.

Pope Francis has been described by commentators as a voice of conscience and a reconciler.

Classed by some as a moderniser of a strict South American church, he is still conservative and an opponent of such ideas as gay marriage.

Pope Francis was born into a middle-class family of seven in 1936, his father a
 railway worker and his mother a housewife.

He became a priest at 32, nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies.

Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979.

Bergoglio's vocational success coincided with the bloody 1976-1983 military dictatorship, during which up to 30,000 suspected leftists were kidnapped and killed - which prompted sharp questions about his role.

The most well-known episode relates to the abduction of two Jesuits whom the military government secretly jailed for their work in poor neighbourhoods.

According to 'The Silence,' a book written by journalist Horacio Verbitsky, Bergoglio withdrew his order's protection of the two men after they refused to quit visiting the slums, which ultimately paved the way for their capture.

Verbitsky's book is based on statements by Orlando Yorio, one of the kidnapped Jesuits, before he died of natural causes in 2000.

Both of the abducted clergymen survived five months of imprisonment.

'History condemns him. It shows him to be opposed to all innovation in the Church and above all, during the dictatorship, it shows he was very cosy with the military,' Fortunato Mallimacci, the former dean of social sciences at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, once said.

Those who defend Bergoglio say there 
is no proof behind these claims and, on the contrary, they say the 
priest helped many dissidents escape during the military junta's rule.

But
 in the Vatican, far removed from the dictatorship's grim legacy, this 
quiet priest is expected to lead the Church with an iron grip and a 
strong social conscience.

The new Pope is an ardent fan of an Argentinian football team nicknamed the 'Saints.'

Just in case their rivals were in any doubt, the club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, tweeted a photo of Pope Francis with the team's colours yesterday.

The Buenos Aires clubÂ  - one of the country's top sides - owes its name to a Catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104-year-old team find a place to play in its early days.

Father Lorenzo Massa became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram.

There was just one condition - that they must attend mass on Sundays.

In honour of his contribution, the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman.

Almagro is the district in Buenos Aires where the team originated from.

The club now plays in the Primera Division, the top league in Argentina.

In 2010, he challenged the Argentine government when it backed a gay marriage bill.

'Let's
 not be naive. This isn't a simple political fight, it's an attempt to 
destroy God's plan,' he wrote in a letter days before the bill was 
approved by Congress.

Described
 by his biographer as a balancing force, Bergoglio has monk-like habits,
 is media shy and deeply concerned about the social inequalities rife in
 his homeland and elsewhere in Latin America.

'His character is in every way that of a moderate.

'He is absolutely capable of undertaking the necessary renovation without any leaps into the unknown. He would be a balancing force,' said Francesca Ambrogetti, who co-authored a biography of Bergoglio after carrying out a series of interviews with him over three years.

'He shares the view that the Church should have a missionary role, that gets out to meet people, that is active.... a church that does not so much regulate the faith as promote and facilitate it,' she added.

'His lifestyle is sober and austere. That's the way he lives.

'He travels on the underground, the bus, when he goes to Rome he flies economy class.'

He is described as a solemn man, deeply attached to centuries-old Roman Catholic traditions.

Since rejecting a comfortable archbishop's residence, he has lived in a small apartment outside Buenos Aires where he spends his weekends in solitude.

In his rare public appearances, Bergoglio spares no harsh words for politicians and Argentine society, and has had a tricky relationship with President Cristina Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner.
