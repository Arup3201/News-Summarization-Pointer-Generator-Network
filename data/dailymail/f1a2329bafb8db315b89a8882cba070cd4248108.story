Princess Diana had become an 'embarrassment' it has been claimed

The former SAS soldier who claims Princess Diana was murdered by his old regiment will face police within days over the allegations.

The disgraced sniper, known as Soldier N, will face interrogation by top detectives at Scotland Yard this week after he came out of hiding in the Middle East.

Last week it was reported that he had fled the country in fear of his life after his high profile claims that SAS soldiers flashed lights to deliberately blind the driver of Diana's car and cause a collision.

But it seems he has now reconsidered and flown back to the UK to face questioning.

Soldier
N allegedly told his wife that the SAS used the technique, which was 
developed for targeting terrorism, against Diana's driver in Paris in 
1997 to cause him to crash.

The
38-year-old former sergeant will also have to answer questions about 
allegations that he smuggled thousands of pounds of stolen money into 
Britain after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He was due to be questioned by Scotland Yard's Detective Chief Inspector Philip Easton who is leading the investigation into Diana's death but vanished shortly beforehand.

A source told the Sunday People: 'He was told in no uncertain terms he had to return to face the music.

'He was aware the police wanted to interview him over claims he said the SAS was responsible for Diana's death - and running away wasn't the most sensible option.

'He's now back in Britain and expects to be interviewed by the police.

'His partner and children are still in the UK so he really had little choice.'

It is believed he originally fled to the United Arab Emirates where there is a large British ex-military community.

But rumours that he had moved on to Thailand are now known to be incorrect.

Soldier N's claims about the SAS being responsible for Diana's death were sent to the Yard in July following the court martial of sniper Danny Nightingale.

Both men were arrested in 2011 after a police raid found illegal weapons and ammunition in a house they shared.

Soldier N was given two years detention 
for his part despite an impressive combat record that saw him mentioned 
in despatches for his heroic defense of a UN convoy after it came under 
fire in 1995 during the Bosnian conflict.

Nightingale's conviction was quashed on appeal but was then found guilty at a retrial in July and given a two-year suspended sentence.

Since Soldier N's claims were made public another former serviceman has come forward claiming that many people behind the scene believe Diana's death was ordered.

A former MI6 agent claims that the attitude of many in the secret services towards the Princess at the time of her death that she had become and embarrassment.

He also claims there were fears that her relationship with Muslim Dodi Fayed, 42, posed a threat to the monarchy and said the question often asked was: 'What are we going to do about Diana.'

Speaking about going to work on the day after the crash which killed Diana, Mr Fayed and driver Henri Paul he said: 'I'd just sat down when a colleague leaned over and whispered, "I can't believe we killed her."

'I was initially confused and said, "Who?", and he added "Diana." 

'At first I thought he was joking - but then I realised he was being completely serious.'

The former spy, who had served in Moscow and Eastern Europe added: 'Many people who worked for MI6 at the time thought the organisation played some sort of role in Diana's death.

'My view was that Diana had become an embarrassment and if she had married Dodi it would have presented significant difficulties for the monarchy.

'But even if you accept all of that, why kill her.'
