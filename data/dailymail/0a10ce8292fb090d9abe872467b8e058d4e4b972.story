Road rage: A man was filmed wielding an axe and striking a car with two children in the back on a highway in St Petersburg

A minor dispute on a highway near a park in St Petersburg led to the appalling altercation, with a hysterical woman begging the angry driver of a black Land Cruiser to calm down before the incident exploded into violence.

The dispute began when the driver of an Audi car - a man in his 30s - hooted when the other vehicle stopped abruptly in heavy traffic.

The two cars did not bump, but prompted a roadside shouting match.

Throughout the woman with the enraged Land Cruiser driver tries to calm him, but he constantly fights off her attempts during the spat on the busy highway.

After several minutes of enraged argument with the driver of the Audi - in which two small children were in the back seat - the white shirted owner of the Land Cruiser suddenly went to the back of his vehicle and pulled out a long-handled axe.

The saloon car driver rushed back into
 his car, and began reversing it when the axe man smashed his weapon 
onto the bonnet of the car.

A second blow hit the windscreen of the Audi manoeuvred his car away.

The
 children in the car are heard screaming, as is the woman - possibly the
 attacker’s wife - as she tried but failed to restrain him.

He then aimed another blow at the back seat window where the children were sitting, but failed to strike the car.

Amid the anguished screams two children's voices are hearing shouting ‘Papa!’.

The axe man struck the Audi three times, fortunately not harming anyone inside the car.

He then chased the Audi on foot but soon gave up, returning clutching his weapon.

The Audi driver made away, and was followed by another the driver who had filmed the road rage nightmare but not intervened as the horror unfolded.

This third driver offered the Audi driver his footage to show to the police.

One scared girl was seen through the back window of the Audi.

‘Brother, I filmed everything, let me give it to you and help,’ he said.

Police have launched a hunt for the axe man who is understood to have left the scene after the attack.

It is now routine for drivers in Russia to have dashboard cameras to use as evidence in insurance claims, and to lower the risk of being framed by bribe-taking traffic police.
