Jailed indefinitely: Mentally ill Terrence Dunkley killed his parents in a violent attack

An elderly couple were stamped to death by their schizophrenic son after refusing to press charges for his earlier attacks, a court heard today.

Terrence Dunkley, 59, repeatedly abused his elderly parents before his fatal attack at their home in  Lyng near Dereham, Norfolk.

Police had been called to three violent attacks by Dunkley on his parents, Marguerite, 80, and her husband Arthur, 83, which included punching his mother in the face and pushing her down the stairs.

But Mrs Dunkley later confided to friends she would never press charges as she loved her son.

In the weeks before her death she told her neighbour: 'Terrence is my son. You will understand when you have a baby.'

The court heard Dunkley, 59, went 'completely lost his temper' killing his parents by punching them to the floor and repeatedly stamping on them after they returned from church.

Neighbours heard him screaming 'You f***ing bastards' and 'It's 
time to go.'

The former sports and geography teacher then piled up furniture over his parents' bodies after his fatal attack on June 12 2005.

Prosecutor Ian James told Norwich Crown Court: 'As the police 
approached the premises, the defendant came out with a demeanour 
described as totally calm.

'He told police that there had been some 
damage to the house and his parents were inside and they were dead.'

Loving parents: Arthur and Marguerite Dunkley told neighbours they could never report him to police as they 'loved him'

Police found the bodies were cold when they discovered them under the 
furniture indicating they had been dead for some time.

Mr James said Dunkley 'simply smiled' when the bodies were found and was arrested on suspicion of murder.

Mr James said it was a 'poignant' 
feature of the case that Mr and Mrs Dunkley had earlier refused to press
charges against their son who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic in 
2003.

Dunkley of Tottenhill near Downham 
Market, Norfolk was ordered to be detained indefinitely in 2006 after it
was ruled that he was too ill to enter a plea on murder charges

Justice: Dunkley was told killing his parents were 'very grave offences' by Judge Peter Jacobs at Norwich Crown Court

But a court heard today that 
his condition had improved enough for him to make a plea even though he 
was still diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.

Dunkley admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and denied two counts of murder.

Judge Peter Jacobs made an order 
for him to be detained indefinitely in a secure unit under Section 37 of
the Mental Health Act, saying it was clear he was suffering from a 
psychotic illness.

The court heard Dunkley had been a geography and sports teacher in Surrey, but his mental health deteriorated after he moved to Norfolk with his wife who was a primary schoolteacher.

Judge Jacobs described the killings as 'very grave offences' and said it was obvious that he had been in a 'terribly violent temper'

He said: 'Family members were expressing real concern about your behaviour, but your mother and father said you were their son and they loved you and they were reluctant to do anything about it.'

The judge added: 'The tragedy of this case is that you destroyed your own life as well as theirs. A further tragedy is that because of your mental state, it is something you can never fully appreciate.'
