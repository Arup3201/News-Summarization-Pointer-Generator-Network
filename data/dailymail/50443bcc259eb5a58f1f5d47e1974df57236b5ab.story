The Duke University freshman who was outed as a porn star has shot back at her critics, saying she is 'empowered' by her work.

The student who goes by the stage name Belle Knox appeared on Piers Morgan Live Thursday night after taking a brief break from school to deal with the backlash on campus.

'I'm not being exploited, I love what I'm doing and I'm safe,' Knox, a women's studies major, said.

Financial burden: Knox says she first starting working in the adult film industry to pay her $47,000 in tuition

Knox made headlines last month when fellow freshman Thomas Bagley spilled her secret at a fraternity event.

After that the news spread like wildfire on the North Carolina campus and Knox says it got to the point where she felt unsafe, so the university let her take a few days off classes.

'They've been very supportive of me. We're working really hard to make sure that I'm safe ,' she said.

In her CNN interview, Knox went into more detail about how she got into the porn industry, while also voicing some of her regrets.

She says she decided to start starring in adult films when she received her financial aid package for Duke and found out she was going to need to pay about $47,000 a year.

'The financial aid that I was given to pay for my tuition was insufficient and just really an enormous financial burden on my family,' she said.

On her side: Knox says she's faced some hostility on campus - mostly from other girls - but that most people have been supportive

Knox, who has two other siblings, decided to start shooting adult films since the pay was good and didn't require a huge time commitment. 

'I set my own schedule,' she said, adding that she makes $1,200 a scene. 'I don't have to worry about not getting sleep or not doing my work because I'm working three jobs.'

But she also says she hid her part-time job from her parents, which is something she now regrets.

'I regret not telling my family from the get-go. I think that was a really big mistake,' Knox said.

Knox wouldn't go into detail about how her family has reacted to the news, but says she's not worried her porn work will come between them.

Joy: Knox previously said that her experience in porn has brought her 'unimaginable joy'

'My family loved me six months ago when I wasn't a porn star, so I don't know what would make them not love me now,' she said.

Knox even went so far as to say that if her own future daughter wanted to go into porn, she would support her.

'I would want my daughter to make an informed decision about her career and I think it's absolutely her choice,' she said.

But Knox admits that the news of her porn career has made life on campus difficult.

Bullied: Knox says people have set up fake Twitter accounts and used them to harass her

Threats: Knox says both she and her family have received threats since her identity was revealed

She says she can't go out like she used to anymore because fellow students are hostile to her - especially other girls.

However,
 Knox says the majority of campus is on her side and supportive. She 
estimated that 70 per cent of her fellow students, especially the LGBTQ 
community, were behind her while the other 30 per cent of 'frat guys' 
and girls seem to 'hate' her

Also on the show, Morgan asked how Knox came up with her stage name. 

She
 says the first name is for the princess in the Beauty and the Beast, as
 well as the character Belle de Jour from British television drama 
'Secret Diary of a Call Girl'.

She
 takes her last name from Amanda Knox, the infamous 26-year-old 
suspected of sexually assaulting and then murdering her British roommate
 while studying abroad in Italy in 2007.

'She's
 just a really interesting person. I'm not saying I support her or 
anything...she just seems very intelligent,' The Duke student said.
