Taylor Swift accepted an honor at the American Music Awards on Sunday night and used the spotlight to proclaim that 'music should be consumed in albums.'

The speech highlighted views that put her at odds with the streaming service  Spotify, which she has stated before does not 'fairly compensate' artists.

'What you did by going out and investing in music and albums is you are saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in,' said Swift.

Platinum: Taylor Swift accepted the Dick Clarke Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards and made a plea for music to be 'consumed in albums'

'That music is valuable and music should be consumed in albums and albums should be consumed as art and appreciated,' she continued.

The remarks were similar to those she made after pulling her three albums from Spotify earlier this month.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Swift had put Shake it Off, the lead single from her new album 1989, up for streaming as she tried to stay 'open minded' about changes in the music industry.  

'It didn't feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, "If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it's theirs now and they don't have to pay for it."'

The criticism was expanded upon by Aloe Blacc, who stated in Wired that the song 'Wake Me Up,' which he co-wrote and sang for Avicii, earned only $12,359 from Pandora, in spite being played 168 million times. 

Swift opened the festivities Sunday with a fiery performance of 'Blank Space' that echoed her lampooning of the 'crazy ex' theme from her recently released music video.

Who's crazy now?: Swift pulled her entire catalog from streaming service Spotify earlier in the month and also became the first - and only - artist to have an album certified platinum in 2014

She was later presented with the Dick Clark Award for Excellence, in the same month she became the first artist to go platinum in 2014.

She was given the award by Diana Ross, and said she was 'so honored' to share the stage with the acclaimed diva.

About Clark, she praised him because 'he fought for music to be at the forefront of our minds and on our televisions as much as possible.'
