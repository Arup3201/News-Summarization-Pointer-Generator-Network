A proud Russian who insisted his four wheel drive could handle anything that recent floods could throw at it has become a laughing stock after his all-terrain vehicle sank in a giant 'puddle'.

Albert Nevzorov, 29, had driven with pals around the Adlersky City District in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea coast that had recently seen heavy rainfalls, to show off its abilities.

While other vehicles floundered in the water, Albert claimed his jeep would be able to handle anything the city's 'puddles' could deliver.

So when he came across a flooded road he decided to show his friends what his machine was made of.

After twice attempting to cross what he described as a 'puddle' before turning back, Albert was not put off.

He had spotted cars on the other side of the flood and believed that they had made the crossing - without realising they were actually cars on the back of a sunken vehicle transporter.

Determined Albert Nevzorov, 29, tries to show his mates that a bit of water is nothing his jeep can't handle. But the 'puddle' turns out to be deeper than he thought, and he runs into trouble trying to get to the other side

Pal Hilarion Uvarov, who took this video, said: 'I got the video camera working on my mobile phone and recorded attempt number three, where he had the bright idea of putting one of the wheels of the car on the curb to keep it out of the water.

'What he didn't realise was that he was driving down a slip road that just kept getting deeper. 

'He thought there were parked cars but it was actually cars parked on top of a car transporter.' 

Russian president Vladimir Putin is also a fan of the four-wheel-drive and owns this Lada Niva jeep

Determined to make the crossing, Albert kept going even though the water level was rising and rising.

Eventually the entire jeep becomes submerged in the flood, but luckily Albert manages to clamber out where he is left standing on the roof in the middle of the 'puddle'.

The video went viral in Russia and soon became one of the most viewed items on social media sites where it was branded 'Titanic Three'.
