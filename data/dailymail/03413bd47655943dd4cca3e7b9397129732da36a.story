Police prevented a pregnant woman in labor from crossing the street to get to a nearby hospital yesterday in L.A. because President Barack Obama's motorcade was on the way.

A Twitter user documented the unidentified woman sitting on a bus bench for roughly half an hour, waiting for the president and his entourage to pass through, as she was attended to by another woman in scrubs.

'This woman is in labor but can't get to Cedars[Sinai Medical Center] cuz of Obama!!!,' Carrie Clifford tweeted, along with a photo of the very pregnant-looking woman.

LA resident Carrie Clifford tweeted this photo of a woman in labor who couldn't get to a nearby hospital because the roads were closed for Obama

The woman had to sit on a bench at a bus stop across the street fro the hospital until the president's motorcade passed

After Obama's entourage cleared the intersection, police sent an ambulance over to check on the woman

After Clifford tweeted photos of the woman, KNBC reporter Robert Kovacik rushed to the scene.

Kovacik talked to a police officer who told him that the LAPD would allow the woman to go to the hospital 'as soon as we can.'

'It looks like the motorcade is coming through 
right about now, so we’ll be able to open it up for traffic,' he said. 'The first 
thing we’ll try to get through will be an ambulance.'

An LAPD spokesman confirmed the story to MailOnline on Thursday but said the police did not know the woman was in labor when she first asked to cross the street.

'She didn't tell them she was
in labor and gave no indication of urgency,' he said.

'She waited a while before her
husband asked how much longer it would be before they could cross. He still did
not say she was in labor, just that she needed to go to the hospital.

'Officers
requested an ambulance, but a nurse happened to be there so she chatted to her.
In the meantime the motorcade passed and she was able to make it over the road
to the hospital before the ambulance even arrived.

The police department spokesman said the woman later gave birth from the comfort of the hospital.

'She had her baby and did not
give birth on the street or anything like that.' 

Snarl up: Many residents of LA were vocal in the criticism of the city being blocked so the president could ride through the city to a fundraiser

Rush hour traffic in LA went from bad to worse during the president's visit

LA residents stuck in traffic expressed their frustration with the president via twitter using #thanksObama, #Obamatraffic and #Obamajam

Clifford, the woman who tweeted the pictures of her, told The Blaze in an interview that she 'felt bad' for the pregnant woman.

'It does happen when Obama comes
 to L.A. or I’m sure anywhere else. It paralyzes the city, it does make 
it complicated.

'You can’t do the things you had set out to do because the president is in town,' she said.

Traffic went from bad to worse in Los Angeles yesterday as sections of the metropolitan area were shut down to make way for President Obama.

L.A.
 residents complained on Twitter that local commutes took upward of two 
hours because of road closures and traffic jams caused by the 
president's motorcade.

'I
 was literally sitting in the same spot on La Brea through 5 red lights 
then they put up road closures,' a resident named Lilly Cook said in a 
tweet.

'I'm voting for the Republican next election....If I vote. #Obamatraffic #SorryHillary,' tweeted Anthony Luce.

Actress Sarah Michelle Gellar tweeted a photo compilation of the traffic jam Obama created near her house with the caption: 'This is what happens when Obama comes to your hood. So much for groceries and dry cleaning #ObamaJam'

Even celebrities were annoyed with traffic created by Obama's motorcade. Actress Sarah Michelle Gellar tweeted this photo compilation of the traffic jam Obama created near her house. 'This is what happens when Obama comes to your hood,' she said. 'So much for groceries and dry cleaning #ObamaJam'

'Ironically, Obama is going to 
@shondarhimes. This could be #GreysAnatomy -woman in labor can't get to 
Cedars cuz of O,' Clifford tweeted during the saga with the pregnant woman, referring 
to the fundraiser Obama was about to attend at Rhimes' Beverly Hills 
home.

Rhimes
 is also the creator and producer of political thriller Scandal, which 
is very loosely based on the life of former George H.W. Bush communications aide Judy Smith, who also serves as a producer on the 
show.

Smith did not attend last night's fundraiser, but her on-screen counterpart, actress Kerry Washington, served as a co-host.

Tickets

 to the event began at $1,000 for single entry and jumped up to $10,000 
for photos. Hosts were required to max out to the Democratic National 
Committee at $32,400.

At the event Obama took the opportunity to take get in a scandal-related dig at Republicans in Congress obstructing his agenda.

'Members of Congress can’t seem to do anything,' he said, 'all we hear about is gridlock, and all we hear about is posturing, and all we hear about are phony scandals.

'And no offense, Scandal is a great show, but it’s not something that we necessarily want to be living out day in, day out,' he said to laughter from the 450 or so attendees.

'And
 the truth is, is that what we see on the nightly news or on cable news 
is just this constant clamor of hot air, and folks posturing and 
opinionating but not actually doing any work that focuses on the people 
who sent them there. '

Drivers in San Francisco were none too happy with the president, either. His motorcade backed up traffic in the Bay Area yesterday as well

San 
Francisco residents were none too happy with Obama, yesterday, either.

Travelers 
reported massive delays at the San Francisco International 
Airport due to airspace being closed while the president was flying in 
and out of town.

'Finally
 home after a long series of delayed flights started by the President's 
plane arriving in SFO #ThanksObama,' a user named Ally Jo tweeted 
overnight

Obama left San Francisco yesterday for L.A. The president has two events today - a roundtable and a speech - before he flies back to Washington, D.C. from California this evening.

The first event is a Democratic National Committee discussion with approximately 25 donors. It will take place at Live
 Nation CEO Michael Rapino's home. Entry to this intimate event with the president is also $32,400.

Afterward, the president will give a speech on the economy at the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. Tickets to that event were free and were first come, first served.

The president has been on the West Coast since Tuesday, attending a series of fundraisers for Democratic groups.

In addition to criticism over clogged traffic, Obama has taken during the trip for a perceived lack of focus on international and domestic crises such as the flood of Central American children seeking amnesty at the U.S. border with Mexico.

'I'm not going to give him advice about how to allocate his time, but
 he's certainly not spending the kind of time with the people he needs 
to pass legislation and convince people who have a vote, who were sent 
here to legislate, of the virtues of whatever position he has,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday.
