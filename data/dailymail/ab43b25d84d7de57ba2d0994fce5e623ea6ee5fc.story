Saudi Arabia is beheading criminals at an unprecedented rate - almost half of them for non-violent drugs crimes, the human rights charity Amnesty International has warned.

The Arab state is believed to have executed 38 people so far this year, treble the number in the same period in 2014 and a sign its new King Salman is showing no mercy to offenders. 

Now Amnesty has sounded the latest of several warnings over the country's 'unfair' justice system and harsh punishments. 

Regime: Some 38 people have already been beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. King Salman (above meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron) was crowned in January and shows no sign of leniency

The charity's Saudi Arabia researcher, Sevag Kechichian, told Adam Withnall of The Independent: 'Almost half of this year's executions have actually been for non-violent drugs-related offences.

'There's no real rhyme or reason for this upsurge in executions, and in a way this makes it all the more alarming.'

The Saudi authorities insist there is a surge in the number of executions because

Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's version of Islamic sharia law. 

No mercy: King Salman pictured in January

One diplomatic source told the AFP news agency the surge in beheadings had started long before the reign of King Salman, who was crowned in January after the death of his half-brother King Abdullah. 

'The Saudi authorities want to show everyone they are strong, people can rely on them to keep the security and the safety in the kingdom,' said the source. 

The insider claimed the aim was to deter all forms of violence but the policy is linked to the kingdom's fight against the Islamic State group.

In September, Saudi Arabia began air strikes against the terrorists in Syria as part of the US-led coalition, raising concerns about possible retaliation inside the kingdom.

Security officers arrested three Saudis who allegedly acted 'in support of' the group when they shot and wounded a Dane in November.

But Mr Kechichian said: 'The current rate has been truly unprecedented. It would... be a stretch to say that this is an attempt to deter violence.' 

The United Nations has said many Saudi trials are 'by all accounts grossly unfair' and that confessions are obtained under torture.

Amnesty's annual report last week made a similar warning.

'Courts continued to impose death sentences for a range of crimes, including some that did not involve violence, such as "sorcery", adultery and drug offences, frequently after unfair trials,' it said.

'Some defendants, including foreign nationals facing murder charges, alleged that they had been tortured or otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions in pre-trial detention.' 

Those executed have included five Pakistanis, an Indian, two Jordanians, two Syrians and a Yemeni, with few foreign governments willing to appeal publicly for clemency from the oil-rich state.

Three beheadings in a single day on Tuesday - one for rape and two for murder - took the total so far this year to 38, according to an AFP tally.
