She's the bubbly pageant queen with a penchant for glamorous dresses so it made sense for KEY fashion to snap up Amy Willerton to model its new partywear collection.

The model and TV star has replaced Ashley Roberts as the face of the brand and showcases the glamorous, girly styles to perfection in the new campaign.

Speaking about her new campaign, Amy told MailOnline: 'I am so excited to be modelling this range, it is princess-like, sparkly and girly so I was in my element.

New face: Amy Willerton has replaced Ashley Roberts as the face of KEY Fashion and showcases the glamorous, girly styles to perfection in the new campaign imagery (£160)

'I wanted to be a princess when I was younger so this is my dream come true. I come from pageantry and full-on glamorous attire is what I love to wear so the opportunity to wear all these beautiful dresses was one I couldn't turn down.'

The new range is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and Amy says each and every design makes her feel confident, which, she says, is the most important element of getting ready for a big event.

Beauty buff: Amy says it doesn't take her very long to get ready, despite what people may think, and she's really interested in organic beauty and natural remedies (£95)

In her element: Amy said she loved modelling the new range because she is a huge fan of girly, feminine fashion (£160)

Party perfect: The new range, which Amy launched yesterday at Chotto Matte in Soho, London, is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and Amy says each and every design makes her feel confident (£95)

What's her secret? Amy eats a clean and lean diet - she loves protein-rich meals - and works out every other day to stay in shape (£160)

'People don't believe me but I get ready very quickly. I try to enhance myself, not change myself. It's important to highlight the best of what you've got,' she said about her beautifying regime.

Amy, who describes her personal style as 'girly girl', says another misconception people have is that they think she dresses like a grandmother.

'They say I dress like an old lady but it's because I love the fifties. Everyone is so into looking cool and wearing leather and then I'm there prancing around in my dress.'

When it comes to style inspiration, the 22-year-old cites her style icons as Gisele and Grace Kelly; she takes the classic Hollywood look of Grace and combines it with the strong, independent flair of Gisele.

Despite getting a taste for the world of fashion in this new campaign, Amy admits she doesn't have the expertise needed to create her own range.

'I know everyone does their own collection but I need to get a taste of it before I would ever consider it. I don't follow trends so I'd suck at designing!,' she said.

One project she is considering - and one that she knows all about - is beauty. 'I would love to look into designing my own hair range or natural organic make-up collection. I am a big believer in finding alternative treatments.

'I make my own hair treatments but I can't give you the secret formula in case I develop it!'.

Maybe one day: Despite getting a taste for the world of fashion in this new campaign, Amy admits she doesn't have the expertise needed to create her own range and would rather venture into beauty (£120)

As well as sticking to an organic beauty regime, Amy swears by a clean and lean diet. 'If I want to feel good, I eat raw, natural food. If mother nature didn't make it, don't eat it,' she says.

However, the lithe-limbed star does allow herself the occasional treat and says she's very flexible when it comes to eating.

'I don't let my diet control me, I would never let it rule my life and I love a good pizza. I know from first-hand experience from when I was in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here that not eating properly is really bad for your body. I lost a lot of weight but then just piled it all back on afterwards.'

The star, who just landed herself a modelling contract with a top agency, says that she exercises every other day and really enjoys it but found the London marathon 'horrific'. 

Fresh from her latest fashion campaign, Amy has lots of plans in the pipeline but says they're all 'top secret'. Watch this space.
