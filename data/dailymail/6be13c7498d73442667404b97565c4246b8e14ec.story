A stockbroker who crashed a £250,000 super-car was pulled from the burning wreckage by the salesman giving him a test drive.

The driver, who has not been named, lost control of the McLaren 650S and smashed it into a tree.

As the vehicle burst into flames, salesman Lee Christian managed to clamber out but he was initially unable to free the unconscious driver.

One of the firefighters saidit had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies

It was only seconds before the fuel tank exploded – completely destroying the 200mph car – that he pulled him clear.

The stockbroker was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he was treated for fractures to a shoulder, elbow and ankle. He is still recovering from a series of skin grafts.

Mr Christian, who suffered cuts and burns, was back at work at the McLaren dealership in Knutsford, Cheshire, within four weeks.

Father-of-two Lee Christian, 37, sustained a nasty cut to the back of his head and burns to his face and head

The father of two said: ‘After we impacted with the tree, my first thought was that I was OK. But when I looked across, the driver looked in a very bad way. 

'The impact had ripped off the driver’s door and there were flames in the back of the car.

‘I tried to make my escape through the passenger door but that was jammed, so I had to clamber over the driver.

‘The fire was so intense that it was difficult to get to him and on the third attempt I knew it was going to be now or never.

‘I managed to grab him by his trouser belt and by an arm and with my feet against the vehicle managed to pull him out.

‘I then managed to carry him 30 metres into the field with the car behind me banging and exploding. 

'Passers-by used the detached driver’s door to shield him from the intensity of the blaze.’ 

Mr Christian has been honoured with a bravery award from Cheshire Constabulary.

Chief Constable Simon Byrne said: ‘It was a selfless act in an extremely perilous scenario that put Lee’s own life at risk. His actions are very much deserving of this commendation.’

The incident took place on a country road near High Legh, around four miles from the McLaren dealership.

Mr Christian said he had had two ‘very nice’ letters from the driver’s wife in which she said without his actions her husband would not be alive.

A firefighters said it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies

In the weeks following the crash Mr Christian also went to thank the firefighters from Stockton Heath who had attended on the day

He added: ‘One of the firefighters told me it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies.

‘That just shows how lucky we both were on that day.’

Last year, a McLaren worker died in hospital after he crashed a 650S on his way back to the Formula 1 team’s headquarters in Woking, Surrey.
