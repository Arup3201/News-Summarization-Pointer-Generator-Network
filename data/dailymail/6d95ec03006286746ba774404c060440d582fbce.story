Virgin Holidays is being sued for up to half a million pounds by a British holidaymaker who claims she contracted a life-threatening illness on an all-inclusive package holiday.

Sarah Bowes-Phipps, a 31-year-old mother of one, said her dream Caribbean holiday ended with a case of food poisoning so severe that she had to have her gall bladder surgically removed.

She said she became violently ill a day after eating a piece of mystery fish in a hotel restaurant infested with stray cats and birds at the Verandah Resort and Spa in Antigua. 

Mrs Bowes-Phipps became ill while staying at the Verandah Resort and Spa in Antigua in September 2011

According to a writ filed at London's High Court, Mrs Bowes-Phipps ate ‘a small piece of an unknown fish in breadcrumbs, served lukewarm’ after ordering the ‘catch of the day’ at the resort’s beach bar and grill in September 2011.

In the writ, her barrister, Asela Wijeyaratne, said she did not consider the fish to taste ‘fresh’, and she was awoken by ‘shooting, stabbing pains’ the following morning and had to be transported to hospital by ambulance.

Her condition was so severe that she was airlifted to a hospital in Florida, where she underwent emergency surgery.

Mrs Bowes-Phipps, from St Albans, remained in hospital in Florida for almost a month before she was airlifted to the UK, where she underwent further surgery. 

She was diagnosed with salmonella and secondary septicaemia, and is now seeking up to £500,000 in compensation from Virgin Holidays Ltd, according to the writ. 

Mr Wijeyaratne said that Virgin sold Mrs Bowes-Phipps and her husband Steve an all-inclusive one-week package holiday, and she did not consume any food or drink off the resort.

The barrister claims that Virgin, through their ‘agents’ at the hotel, ‘failed to ensure that food and drink served to Mrs Bowes-Phipps was safe for human consumption’. 

The barrister said the resort had also ‘permitted stray cats and birds to enter the beach bar and grill restaurant with the consequent risk of contamination.’ 

Mr Wijeyaratne alleges that there were no adequate food hygiene systems at the hotel and that the ‘hotel accommodation was so unsafe that no reasonable holidaymaker would agree to go on holiday there.’

The writ states that her claim is 'currently expected to exceed £300,000' but to be less than £500,000 in total. 

The contents of the writ have not been tested in evidence before a judge.

A spokesman for Virgin Holidays said: 'Virgin Holidays is aware of the complaints raised by Mrs Bowes-Phipps and the claim issued in the High Court of Justice.

‘Virgin Holidays exercised all reasonable care and skill in the selection of the Verandah Resort and the monitoring of the services and facilities, including the provision of food and beverages.

‘As Mrs Bowes-Phipps has now issued proceedings, solicitors representing the Verandah Resort will be filing a defence to the claim and it would be inappropriate for Virgin Holidays to comment any further on the matters now forming part of legal proceedings.’

A spokesman for Verandah Resort and Spa said: 'Out of respect for our guest’s privacy, we are not at liberty to discuss this pending matter at this time.'
