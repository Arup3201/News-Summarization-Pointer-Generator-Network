Most fathers are opposed to shared parental leave with many worried about the impact on their careers, research shows.

A law introduced yesterday allows men to share up to 50 weeks of parental leave with their partner if their child is born after March 31 next year.

Instead of taking just two weeks of statutory paternity leave, fathers can take almost a year off to care for the baby. But a study suggests many have no intention of taking up the offer.

Research by jobs website Glassdoor found that only one in four men surveyed agreed that both parents should take parental leave. This falls to one in five for over-45s but rises to one in three for men under 25, showing a generational gap in attitudes.

Under the new rules women must take the first two weeks, but men can then take over for the remaining 50 weeks. They can also take the time off at the same time.

Yet Glassdoor found just one in ten men wanted to take the maximum amount of leave allowed, while almost half said they would still take two weeks.

A separate report by law firm Linklaters found almost two-thirds of men and women were concerned that taking shared leave could damage their career prospects. Half of men said they would be deterred from taking shared parental leave if male colleagues did not take it.

Jeremy Davies, of think tank the Fatherhood Institute, claimed that men’s reluctance to take parental leave was mostly financial and not because they did not want to care for their child. He said: ‘Pay is the main factor. We know that for men to take advantage of these sort of things they need to be able to afford to do so.

‘Is status anxiety an issue? Yes. You’ve got to feel confident that if you do this it’s not going to mess your career up.’

Couples who take shared parental leave could also be offered less favourable packages than women on maternity leave. The law says firms must pay 90 per cent of an employee’s weekly earnings for the first six weeks then £138.18 or 90 per cent of salary, whichever is lower, for another 33 weeks.

In reality, many offer more generous maternity pay on top of this so that staff are not financially penalised for caring for their child.

There is no obligation for employers to extend this enhanced pay to those on shared parental leave. However, Lucy Lewis, a partner at law firm Lewis Silkin, warned that employers could be sued for discrimination if they failed to offer the same generous package to men.

Yesterday, a report by the Trades Union Congress said many pregnant workers are victimised by bosses with ‘sacking, bullying and side-lining’ commonplace.

In the last five years, 9,000 women have brought tribunal claims against their employer for unfair dismissal or suffering a detriment because of pregnancy.
