A newlywed who killed his wife after strangling her and beating her around the head with an industrial hammer in a row over decorating, has been jailed for just seven and a half years.

Thomas Crompton, 39, was found guilty of manslaughter after he brutally killed his 34-year-old wife of three months, Angela, on June 11.

His wife's family, who have asked for her to be referred to as Angela Phillips, have blasted the length of sentence saying he will be walking the streets again in just three years.

The argument began because Ms Phillips had cleared Crompton's belongings away ready to decorate their house at Arminghall, near Norwich.

When metal sculptor Crompton got home from work he 'lost it' because he was concerned his items could have be damaged.

A blazing row broke out and witnesses could hear crockery being smashed.

Father-of-two Crompton attempted to strangle his wife before attacking her with the hammer, hitting her around the head a number of times.

When he returned to the workshop he confessed what he had done to his co-worker Bjorn Fiskvatn, and said: 'That’s it. I’ve killed her'

Mr Fiskvatn rushed to the house and found Ms Phillips on the floor of the dining room, where she was still breathing.

The mother-of-three young children was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital before being moved to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, but died two days later from her head injuries.

A post mortem found Angela had suffered significant brain damage and 'non-survivable' head injuries.

Crompton had always admitted killing his wife and was cleared of murder following a trial at Norwich Crown Court, but was convicted of her manslaughter.

Compton Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The type of injuries she received could not have been survived by anyone.'

However he accepted that Crompton was of previous exemplary character and had tried to help his wife in the past with her problems.

The family of Ms Phillips said: 'We have lost a daughter, sister, mother and aunt in the most horrific circumstances.

'Angela was a beautiful and vivacious 
young woman with a gift for artistry and creativity. It is a tragedy for
 everyone that her young life has ended so abruptly.

'We
 are deeply disappointed with the manslaughter verdict in this case and 
will be pursuing all available avenues to understand how such a verdict 
was reached.

'The fact the defendant will only serve half of today’s sentence before being released is merely salt in the wound.

'His actions have left three deeply bereaved children to grow up without a mother and have put all our family through a dreadful ordeal of intensive care, funeral and court.

'During the court case it felt that Angela herself was on trial, and in many ways that has been the hardest part for us. We feel Angela and her family have been let down in this case by the justice system.

'This continues to be a
 life changing experience for us and our energies are now focused on 
protecting and nurturing Angela’s children. We ask for privacy in our lives while we do so.'

Karim Khalil, defending, said that Crompton’s actions that day had been 'out of character'. Mr Khalil said: 'His remorse is and always has been and will remain genuine and deeply felt.

'He has to live with the consequences of what he did. He was so overwhelmed by the emotion of passion he was unable to resist the impulse that overcame him.'

The court was told that Ms Phillips had mental health problems, had threatened suicide and that the

'This was a complex, emotive and difficult case for all parties concerned and it demonstrates that violence is never the answer to any domestic argument.

'The actions of Crompton have had widespread and devastating consequences for the children and family of Angela and Thomas.'

He added: 'This was a brutal attack on someone Crompton claimed to love. Violence is never a good resolution to an argument and this is a tragic end to this couple’s relationship, leaving their children and families devastated.'

After the death of Ms Phillips, who had two children from a previous relationship, her family paid tribute to her and the staff that helped try and save her life in June last year.

They said: 'It is a tragedy for everyone that her young life has ended so abruptly.

'We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the staff at the Norfolk and Norwich and Addenbrooke’s hospitals who made Angela’s final hours as bearable as possible.'
