This amazing stunt has probably been performed by thousands of children playing with their Hot Wheels toys on the living room carpet.

But the loop-the-loop trick required a great deal more skill and courage when scaled up to world record proportions and done in a family saloon car.

The Lotus L5 car - made by Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co - broke the previous record after successfully completing the nerve-shredding 42ft tall loop.

Brave: Driver Li Yatao showed nerves of steel as he hit the ramp

Hang in there: The car needed to be travelling fast enough to cling to the 42ft loop-the-loop

Holding on: But if the car went too fast it risked overshooting the ramp and flying off into the air

Brave driver Li 
Yatao displayed amazing calmness as he steered the car at more than 50 miles per hour towards the make-shift road during the record attempt in Shanghai, China.

The car appears to have had both front
and rear bumpers removed which is done in order to  improve ground clearance during the tight loop.

A full roll cage was fitted to ensure if disaster were to strike and the car fell during its full height, Yatao, a factory team driver Youngman - the company which recently bid to take over Saab - would have added protection.

The stunt had to be maliciously planned. If the car travelled too fast, it risked destabilising the ramp, damaging the car, or even launching the motor off the edge.

Too slowly, and the car would not generate enough force to defy gravity. It would plummet to the ground before completing the full loop.  

Bracing: Driver Li Yata's body was subjected to massive G-forces as he was pressed into the car

Success: Yatao, driving a common family saloon, more usually seen on the school run or being driven to the shops, completes the loop

Nerve-shredding: Yatao beams with delight after breaking the world record for the largest loop-the-loop
