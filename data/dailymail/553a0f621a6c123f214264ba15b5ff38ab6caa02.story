A man, who has fathered nine children by eight different women, has been jailed for headbutting his ex-girlfriend in a row over a cheese toastie.

Keith Macdonald, 27, was jailed for 20 days after he was found guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend Stephanie Jubb at their home in East Rainton, County Durham.

Miss Jubb was left with a bloody nose and two black eyes in the attack.

Macdonald had already been convicted in his absence on June 13 when he had failed to appear at Sunderland Magistrates' Court.

Charges of theft and criminal damage were also proved in his absence and on Thursday, he admitted a charge of absconding for not appearing at the earlier court 
hearing. .

A warrant was issued for his arrest 
and he eventually handed himself into police earlier this month.

The court heard the couple argued on March 1 when Macdonald, who had been drinking, went to go upstairs to eat a toastie where Miss Jubb had just vacuumed.

Giving evidence in June, Miss Jubb said: 'He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot.

'He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it.

'I told him 'you're not eating that upstairs, I've just hoovered.

'He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted 'F**k it!''

She ripped the plug from his X-Box console and Macdonald then threw her Nintendo Wii across the room and assaulted her.

He then stole £80 and a Sony Ericsson 
mobile phone belonging to Miss Jubb.

The 24-year-old then fled to a neighbour's house and said she has been 'angry and upset' since.

The pair had previously been in an on-off relationship which ended in 2009, but he contacted her again at the end of 2011 and they reconciled before moving in together in February this year.

Jobless Macdonald, from Millfield, Sunderland, fathered his first child at just 15-years-old and met most of his conquests at bus stops.

Gavin Sword, mitigating for Macdonald,
 said: 'He has some notoriety and is referred to in derogatory terms 
because he has so many children by different mothers.

'He shows in relation to a number of issues a motivation to change.

'Since the incident he has significantly moderated his drinking.

'He said he used to have a drink first
 thing in the morning, but since he has been living away from the area 
he doesn’t drink at all during the week and has two or three drinks on a
 weekend.'

Mr Sword said his client had intended 
to travel from his then home in Stoke-on-Trent, but lost a train ticket 
which he could not afford to replace.

Macdonald was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, minus 14 days already spent on remand.

Chairman of the bench Peter Cowling 
also made Macdonald the subject of a restraining order for 24 months, 
banning him from contacting Ms Jubb or going near her home.

Mr Cowling said: 'We feel that only a custodial sentence can be applied.'

At a previous hearing, magistrates 
heard how Macdonald already had one conviction for assaulting Miss Jubb.

In
 2008, he was also given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to 
undertake an anger management course after assaulting Rebecca Wright, now 
21, and her mother while living at their home.

Miss Wright gave birth to
 his daughter, Clio, in the same year.

He has a series of previous convictions, including a prison sentence for hitting another man with a pint glass.

Macdonald,
 who spends his money on lager and fruit machines, has also had 
restraining orders taken out against him by two of his children’s 
mothers and spent time in jail for breaking one of the orders.

In 2011 Keith was caught out on Panorama when he could not remember the names of all his children.
