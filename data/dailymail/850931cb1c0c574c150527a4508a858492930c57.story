With an eleven-week countdown to the big day and miserable weather making summer feel like a distant memory, mothers will make the most of the recent payday and get ‘stocking’ up on Christmas gifts this weekend.

A new survey has revealed that over a quarter of mothers are starting their Christmas shopping earlier than last year.

With purse strings pulled tighter than ever, a staggering 69 per cent of mothers revealed the top reason for the early start to gift shopping was due to money restraints and helping to manage the ever-expanding festive budget.

Other key reasons for stocking up early proved to be taking advantage of the pre-season sales and feeling organised ahead of the Christmas rush, as named by 55 per cent and 53 per cent respectively. 

Two in five mums (42 per cent) are doing more bargain hunting than ever before, but will still be forking out £626.10 on gifts alone.

Despite over one third of mothers vowing to spend less on gifts this year due to the rising costs of living, the survey claimed that parents will distribute an eye-watering 72 gifts this year.

The average mother will buy presents for a generous 13.6 people, including extended family, friends, colleagues and even pets.

Hayley Bolton, a spokesperson for Asda, said: 'Starting the Christmas shopping early is a great way for busy mums to "tick" an extra to-do off the festive list.

'Whether it’s using the most convenient shopping methods or managing the budget well in advance of the big day itself, we’ve seen our shoppers get savvy when it comes to buying gifts.

'We are expecting to see sales of presents start to increase over the weekend as the Christmas shopping season gets truly underway.'

It seems that tech-savvy shoppers are taking advantage of online shopping.

Last year, Asda saw a 14 per cent increase in mothers doing their Christmas shopping online to save precious time over the festive period.

Asda isn't the only store preparing for the festive rush this weekend.

Boots have revealed the first of 
their eagerly anticipated ‘Star Gift’ offers - a weekly product on sale 
for better than half price until the big day.

Annabel Franks, head of Christmas and Exclusives at Boots: 'We
know that some of our customers like to get ahead of the game when it 
comes to doing their Christmas shopping and just can’t wait to start 
planning gifts for loved ones.

'We’ve launched our Christmas shop and gift guide in store this week in recognition of those avid Christmas planners.'
