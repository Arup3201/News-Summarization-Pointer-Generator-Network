A small dinosaur the size of a crow may have had feathers on its hindlegs and limbs, as well as on its wings. 

Studies of the most complete specimen of an 
Archaeopteryx suggest it evolved these 'feather trousers' to absorb shocks when landing, and to attract mates.

Researchers believe the Archaeopteryx is the missing link between dinosaurs and birds because of its mix of sharp reptilian claws, a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth.

The Archaeopteryx was about 1.5ft (18 inches) long with sharp reptilian claws, a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth.  

It lived around 150 million years ago 
in the Jurassic and the first fossil was discovered over 150 years ago 
in 1861 - two years after the publication of Charles Darwin’s On the 
Origin of Species.

Its black wing 
feathers could have helped the creature flap and glide, but whether it 
could fly is unknown.

An
 analysis of other early feathered dinosaurs - and birds - suggests the feathers
evolved in relation to display and were later recruited for 
aerodynamic functions.

Its ‘trouser of feathers’ could have been used as a shock absorber during landing.

Scientists said the characteristics that make Archaeopteryx an evolutionary intermediate are its combination of reptilian and avian features - which include a wishbone.

Dr Oliver Rauhut from the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology and Geology 
in Munich, said there is 
evidence of quill-like feathers all over the creature’s body - not only 
on the wings and tail but also the body and legs.

The
 upper hindlimbs display long symmetrical feathers and there are shorter
 ones along the lower - suggesting this distribution during the origin 
of birds was more complex than previously believed.

Dr
 Rauhut added that, as in living birds, the feathers most likely related to body
 insulation, manoeuvrability, brooding, camouflage and display.

The Archaeopteryx (artist's illustration pictured) was about 1.5ft (18 inches) long with black feathers. It has a mix of reptilian and avian features, including a wishbone, and is considered to be the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds

But it seems plausible Archaeopteryx used them primarily for display.

‘Here we describe a new specimen of Archaeopteryx with 
extensive feather preservation not only on the wings and tail but also 
on the body and legs,' Dr
 Rauhut said.

‘The specimen shows the entire body was covered in quill-like feathers.’

An
 analysis of other early feathered dinosaurs - and birds - suggests the feathers evolved in relation to display and were later recruited for 
aerodynamic functions.

Its ‘trouser of feathers’ could have also been used as a shock absorber during landing.
