A tearful woman bids farewell to her loved one at Paddington Station in 1942; elsewhere, young boys leap over gravestones as they use a Glasgow cemetery as a post-war playground.

These striking images form part of a retrospective celebrating the work of renowned photographer Bert Hardy, who would have been 100 this year.

Hardy, who died in 1995, is best known for his assignments at Picture Post magazine between 1941 and 1957.

The Gorbals tenements were built quickly and cheaply in the 1840s, providing housing for Glasgow's burgeoning population of industrial workers.

Conditions were appalling; overcrowding was standard and sewage and water facilities inadequate.

The tenements housed about 40,000 people with up to eight family members sharing a single room, 30 residents sharing a toilet and 40 sharing a tap.

Redevelopment of the area began in the late 1950s and the tenements were replaced with a modern tower block complex in the sixties.Â 

He covered the London Blitz, D-Day landings and the liberation of both Paris and the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.

Now, an exhibition of his work will be shown at The Photographers' Gallery in Soho, from next Thursday, to coincide with his centenary.

The pictures on display will focus on ordinary people going about their daily lives during and after the Second World War - including the poor district of Gorbals in Glasgow.

Often referred to as Europe's worst slum, Gorbals was filled with low-quality housing and street gangs were rife.

Despite this, Hardy managed to capture the cheeky playfulness of urchins as they made the best of the hand fate had dealt them.

The exhibition works include Gorbals 
Boys (1948), Maidens In Waiting (1951), Life Of An East End Parson 
(1940), Grand Hotel Torquay (1947) and Holiday Camp Yorkshire (1953).

Born in London to a working-class family in May 1913, Hardy was the eldest of seven children.

After leaving school at the age of 14, he got a job as a messenger, which saw him collecting and delivering film and prints for West End chemists.

Bitten by the photography bug, he bought his first camera for 50p from a pawn shop and had his first big break when he snapped King George V and Queen Mary passing by in a carriage down Blackfriars Road.

The enterprising youngster printed off 200 postcards and sold them to friends and neighbours.

Following his work as a laboratory 
assistant for a photographic agency, he was hired as a staff 
photographer at the Picture Post in the 1940s.

There, he used his trusted Leica to 
capture the slums of London and Glasgow (including the gritty Gorbals 
neighbourhood), as well as assignments during World War Two and Korea.

He died aged 82.

His widow, Sheila, has granted access to images and limited-edition prints that have not been widely seen.

The exhibition runs from April 4 to May 23.
