Former WBA heavyweight champion David Haye marked the launch of his personal training club in London on Tuesday with a host of stars.

Haye, who hasn’t fought since 2012, posed alongside actor Jeremy Piven, rapper Tinie Tempah, reality TV’s Lauren Goodger and personal trainer to the stars Ruben Tabares at the event at Frost of London club.

The Londoner’s club is a private fitness group which charges £1900 for twenty personalised exercise sessions as he pursues interests away from the boxing ring.

Haye’s future in boxing remains unclear despite promoter Eddie Hearn announcing he wants undefeated Anthony Joshua to fight Haye next summer.

The 34-year-old cancelled two fights against Tyson Fury in 2013 citing head and shoulder injuries.

Haye later announced he required shoulder surgery in late 2013 but has yet to officially retire from the boxing ring.
