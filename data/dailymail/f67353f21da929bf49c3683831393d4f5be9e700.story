Tara Dawn Smith has been charged with cruelty to a person 65 years of age or older after her 87-year-old mother allegedly developed a bed sore down to the bone

A daughter has been charged with cruelty to her elderly mother after the 87-year-old developed a bed sore down to the bone.

Officers arrested Tara Dawn Smith, of Cobb County, Georgia, after a concerned relative contacted police to report suspected neglect.

An arrest warrant said 'packed dirt' was visible on the elderly woman's body and the house smelled of human waste.

The warrant, obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said: 'There was a trail of feces from the bed to the bathroom.

'The feces was packed into the fibers of the carpet and the entire home smelled of feces.'

It stated the woman had not seen a doctor for a number of years and had lost 40 pounds since December.

The warrant also said the elderly woman had fingernails and toenails which measured several inches and had 'dirt caked underneath,' according to The Marietta Daily Journal.

It also said she had two bed sores on her left hip, 'one of which was infected down to the bone.'

Police allege Smith did not bathe or groom her mother for months, forcing her to 'lay in bed while her diaper was soiled'.

She was charged with cruelty to a person 65 years of age or older and was held in Cobb County jail last week before posting a $7,500 bond.

According to the warrant, she told police she knew she should have asked for help or dialled 911 weeks ago.

Chief investigator Lt Craig Graydon told The Marietta Daily Journal family members contacted officers after growing concerned.

He said: 'They were concerned she was not being cared for responsibly.'

He said abuse of elderly people often goes unreported.
