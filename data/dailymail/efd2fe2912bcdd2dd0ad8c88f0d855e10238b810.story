Phil Neville is this week shadowing England’s Under 17 side in their friendly tournament against Italy, Portugal and the Czech Republic, continuing on his development to become a manager.

The Under 17s are spending this week training at England’s St George’s Park training facility and playing three games against Czech Republic on Wednesday, Portugal on Friday and Italy on Sunday.

Neville has been on the coaching staff for England Under 21s and at Manchester United. Although he was interviewed for the manager job at Everton, he eventually lost out to Roberto Martinez and has yet to take charge himself.

Ill-fated: Phil Neville spent last year as David Moyes' assistant manager at Manchester United

The former Manchester United and Everton player will be casting an eye over the England Under 17s training and be at the first two matches against Czech Republic and Portugal.

Head coach John Peacock said: ‘Phil has come in to shadow me for the first two games. He’s just finished playing not so long ago and is starting off in his coaching career.

‘He’s an ex-England international and it’s great to have him around the place, good experience for the boys to learn from someone like Phil and more importantly it gives him an insight into what we’re trying to achieve with the future development of these players.’

Chris Ramsey, who was most recently assistant manager to Tim Sherwood when he was in charge of Tottenham last season, is also assistant coach for this tournament.

Peacock added: ‘It’s good to have Chris back on board for these games, he’s a very experienced coach and worked for the FA a number of years ago. He was assistant coach at the Under 20s World Cup In Turkey last year and it was good to call on Chris to assistant me for this tournament.’

Today’s match against the Czech Republic will played at the Aggborough Stadium in Kidderminster, before the Under 17s face Portugal in Chesterfield’s Proact Stadium on Friday. Their final game of the tournament against Italy is at the Pirelli Stadium in Burton on Sunday.
