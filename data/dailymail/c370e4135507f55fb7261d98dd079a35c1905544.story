An American couple charged with starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar were sentenced Thursday to three years in prison, a verdict that stunned and shocked the family, according to the couple's defense lawyer.

Matthew and Grace Huang were jailed in Qatar on murder charges in January 2013, following the death of their daughter, Gloria. They were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving Qatar during the trial. 

'We feel that we have been kidnapped by 
the Qatari judicial system,' Matthew told reporters outside the 
courthouse after the sentencing. 'This is wrong.'

The Huangs will appeal the decision and it is unclear whether they will be imprisoned pending appeal.

Matthew added: 'We
 just don't believe that we have been convicted. This verdict
 should be overturned immediately and we should be allowed to go home.'

The
 Huangs' lawyer, Sami Abu Sheikha, said the judge hastily read out the 
sentence and failed to say what the couple was guilty of.

Matthew
 Huang had been working in the booming Gulf nation as part of 
infrastructure improvements for Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup.

The Huangs say their adopted daughter,
 who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual 
eating habits that included periods of binging and self-starvation. 
Defense witnesses have testified that the girl appeared healthy and 
active just days before her January 2013 death.

The prosecution had demanded the death 
penalty, alleging that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said she
 was locked in her room at night.

A
 Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's autopsy found that the child's 
hips, ribs and spine protruded and concluded the cause of death was 
dehydration and wasting disease.

On Wednesday, the State Department 
expressed concern that not all of the evidence had been weighed by the 
court. It also said it had raised the case with Qatari officials on 
multiple occasions.

During Thursday's sentencing in Doha, 
Judge Abdullah El-Emedy also ordered the Huangs deported from Qatar 
after serving the three-year sentence and issued them a fine of 15,000 
Qatari riyals, which is about $4,100. 

The case raised questions about 
possible cultural misunderstandings in a conservative Muslim country 
where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively
 rare.

The couple are suing Matthew's employer for not warning them that their adoptions would not be well thought of in Qatar.

Happy: The family says Gloria, shown left, was severely malnourished in early childhood and would periodically refuse food for several days and then binge eat or get food from bizarre sources, such as garbage cans or from strangers - a behavior her parents traced to her impoverished upbringing and were trying to address

An investigative report by Qatari police had raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were 'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website.

The Huangs, of Asian descent, have two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the U.S.

Matthew Huang described the allegations 
as 'ridiculous' and called on President Barack Obama to explain to the 
ruler of Qatar 'why American families adopt high-need children.'

Gloria, who was severely malnourished in 
early childhood, would periodically refuse food for several days and 
then binge eat or get food from bizarre sources, such as garbage cans or
 from strangers - a behavior her parents traced to her impoverished 
upbringing and were trying to address.

She would also try to leave the house at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on late-night binges, according to a report prepared last year in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic pathologist who reviewed the case for the family.

When Gloria died, she was in an anorexic episode and had not eaten in as many as four days, Ophoven wrote in her report last year.

Eric Volz, managing director of the David House Agency, which is coordinating legal and publicity efforts for the family, told reporters on Thursday that the appeal process takes anywhere from six months to one year.

He said the prosecutor's case has 'zero evidence.'
