A housing association was ensnared in a dispute over political correctness last night after questioning whether its tenants could afford ‘Sky TV, fags, booze and bingo’.

It suggested that residents living in 8,000 former council homes should start budgeting properly if hit by new cuts in housing benefit.

The association asked its tenants: ‘Can you really afford Sky, cigarettes, bingo, drinks and other non-essentials?’

It added: ‘If your benefit is being cut and you want to keep your home, you have to make up the difference.

Eastland Homes issued a newsletter advising tenants to cutback on satellite television and cigarettes in preparation for benefit cuts when the bedroom tax is introduced

Eastlands Homes, which has more than 6,000 properties in Greater Manchester caused offence with its recent newsletter

‘Non-essential items won’t matter if you lose your home. Start budgeting now – we can help you do this, call us!’

The association was forced  to apologise last night after it was accused of being ‘deeply patronising’.

But Sheila Doran, chief executive of Eastland Homes in Manchester, 
insisted the advice in the latest issue of its Streets Ahead newsletter 
was intended to help its tenants prepare.

Was Eastlands Homes housing association wrong to advise people not to spend their money on Sky, cigarettes and bingo?

‘We are concerned that some of our customers will be living “hand to mouth” as a result of the benefit cuts,’ she said.

‘Their quality of life will be significantly reduced and they face stark choices.

‘With benefit levels frozen and escalating fuel bills, there is a risk 
of families falling into arrears and losing their homes –  we don’t want
 to see that.

‘We will provide as much support as possible and that includes giving 
advice on household budgeting, as requested by many of our customers.’

Last night Eastlands Homes added in a statement: ‘Our message is that we
 are here to help wherever possible and we’re sorry if we worded that 
clumsily.’

But residents living in the association’s properties across Manchester were furious.

One of them, Julie Deal, said: ‘It is contemptible. Many of their 
residents don’t sit around on benefits.

'It is deeply patronising. Talk 
about stereotyping those who live in former council homes. They should 
be ashamed.’

Residents of Lily Thomas Court were among thousands of social housing tenants across Greater Manchester to receive the newsletter from Eastlands Homes

Another tenant said: ‘This is patronising nonsense.

‘People are having a tough time as it is without having to be fed this nonsense.

‘Anyone who heard this would think we were living in the lap of luxury.

‘Many of us have had to make severe cutbacks, and we’re not all sat there with our tins of lager watching daytime telly.

‘Just because you see feckless families in [the TV drama] Shameless, it doesn’t mean it happens with all families.’

Many of Eastlands Homes’ 8,000 properties are ex-council. The 
association says it has invested more than £130million in improvements 
since 2003.

Tenants took to Facebook to vent their fury at the newsletter which was described as 'patronising'
