Karl Perryman allegedly stalked a female colleague after she spurned his advances, a court heard

A senior manager at an NHS hospital bombarded a female colleague with letters calling her a tart after she spurned his advances, a court heard today.

The 'dark and spiteful' notes allegedly composed by head of complaints and legal services Karl Perryman, 52, accused Joanne O'Neill of cheating on her partner, dressing 'like a hooker' and 'sleeping her way to the top'.

They also claimed the complaints manager had noisy sexual relations 'on hospital time' and warned ominously: 'You will reap what you sow.'

A total of eight letters were sent to Miss O'Neill, her mother and other managers at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk.

The letters began in December 2012 and were addressed to Ms O’Neill, her partner, her line manager, her mother and the human resources manager at the hospital. 

They were supposedly from an anonymous Christian woman who worked at the hospital and wanted to put a stop to the 'deplorable conduct' of Miss O'Neill and deputy director of ICT Michael Brown.

But a jury was told they were all written by Perryman after Miss O'Neill rejected his attention and began a relationship with Mr Brown.

Prosecutor Jude Durr said: 'These letters had dark and spiteful undertones. All concerned rank, status, sex, lying, cheating, flirting, dressing inappropriately and reaping what you sow.

'By the time she made a statement… these letters had already had a significant effect on her life.

'She felt genuinely frightened that she was being watched every time she attended a meeting or saw a colleague in the corridor. It was also affecting her home life.

'She didn't at that stage have any idea who could be so vindictive and hateful. The invasion of her personal, professional and private life caused a real devastating fear of escalation.'

Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told.

But Perryman is said to have called her afterwards to say he was 'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'.

A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave.

The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift.

He then sent a friend request on Facebook under the name Earnest Jones, which she declined.

At the time, her relationship with partner Phillip Twite, 39, was breaking down and she had begun a friendship with line manager Mr Brown.

The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff.

It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses… they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.'

Two letters were sent to Mr Twite's home the following month in which the author claimed to have heard Miss O'Neill and Mr Brown having sex 'with my own ears'.

One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians… one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.'

A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage.

It warned: 'You will reap what you sow… we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.'

Another letter she received had biblical references and described her as 'Jo Jo Judas', while one to her mother, Margaret Titmarsh, claimed she had told people her father had sexually abused her.

Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. 

She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him.

'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde.

'He said if I went against him he would destroy me, destroy my credibility and my career. It's worked because I've moved hundreds of miles away.

'He said he had something on everyone and if I spoke out no one would believe me.'

She added: 'I was frightened because someone had written to my home address and said horrible things. I was shocked.

'It was upsetting as I was going through a break-up and felt like someone had intruded and was saying lies about me, which upset us both.

'What was going on between my partner and me was private. I felt humiliated.'

The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer.

After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture.

He denies one count of stalking and another of intimidating a witness.

The trial continues.
