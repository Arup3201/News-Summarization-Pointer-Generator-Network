Well, the atmosphere was certainly better, although the performance took a while to warm-up. And this time Jose Mourinho took out his frustration on his players rather than the Chelsea supporters as he fumed on the touchline.

Mourinho criticised his players after hauling off Andre Schurrle and Willian at half-time and Filipe Luis once Maribor, a team thumped 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last month, had taken the lead with a brilliant goal.

Diego Costa, Oscar and Ramires - who he had hoped to keep fresh for Saturday's game at Liverpool - were scrambled as was an unusual three-at-the-back system in a bid to rescue pride.

They emerged with a point after an equaliser by Nemanja Matic and they would have taken all three had Eden Hazard not missed a penalty, five minutes from time.

Mourinho praised Maribor and grumbled about the Italian officials who ruled a late goal by Costa to be offside and only added two minutes of stoppage time at the end, when he clearly thought he should have been be more.

Generally, the he cut a disgruntled figure and his mood was not enhanced when the travelling fans, offended by his remarks that the Bridge had been like an 'empty stadium' during last Saturday's win against QPR, started to tease him.

'Cheer up Mourinho,' they sang, in the first half, and then: 'Jose Give us a Song'. They left him alone once it was clear the manager was not amused. When asked to comment on the songs, he shook his head and said: 'Forget it'.

At the end of the game, he congratulated Maribor boss Ante Sumundza and then stalked straight down the tunnel as John Terry led the players to salute the 600 Chelsea supporters who made the trip.

At half-time, Mourinho had made the same purposeful march across the pitch and into the dressing rooms, staring at the floor with clipboard tucked under his arm like a man about to deliver a few home truths.

One of his backroom staff emerged moments later, sent to retrieve the electronic board used by the fourth officials to indicate substitutions.

'In the first half we were not good,' said Mourinho. 'Very slow; no intensity, no creativity. It was easy for Maribor to control the game and reach what they wanted to reach, a 0-0.

'I tried to improve my team. When you try to improve your team, sometimes it's for tactical reasons. Other times it's for individual performances. I think I was successful with the changes I did.

'In the second half the team were much better than in the first half. I thought we played magnificently: creative, fast, good dynamic, a lot of chances to score. Only when Maribor scored did the players realise the game was in danger. After that, a fantastic reaction.

'We deserved to win, clearly.We didn't reach the number of goals that we should have in the second half, but the team played well. And we scored a great second goal.'

No English side won a single group match this week, the first time that happened since November 5, 2008. 

The 'second goal' was a reference to the disallowed goal prodded in by Costa moments before Hazard's 85th-minute penalty miss. It looked very tight, perhaps marginally onside, and he did not miss the chance to take a swipe at referee Daniele Orsato. They have history stretching back to Mourinho's time with Inter Milan.

'We scored two goals, two very good goals,' said the Chelsea boss. 'The second goal, the referee decided to disallow but it's a clear goal. Normally we should win because we scored two goals. But we have to accept it and to praise a fantastic stadium with lots of enthusiasm. 

'For the people, it was a fantastic night, and Maribor gave everything. They fought. They had a fantastic goalkeeper. And the referee's team didn't have a good night.'

Perhaps it had all felt a little too comfortable because, after scoring six against the Slovenians in London. The Barclays Premier League leaders started well, creating chances and missing them until Kurt Zouma was forced to clear off the goal-line from Sintayehu Sallalich.

Confidence washed through the home team and they passed the ball with more assurance. Sallalich caused problems with his pace and trickery and Agim Ibraimi's goal was a delicious piece of skill, curled into the top corner with his left foot from wide on the Maribor right past Petr Cech. 

It was the first time Chelsea had been behind since September 13 against Swansea. Mourinho made his third substitution and switched to a three-man defence, with Hazard at wing-back.

Maribor ought to have doubled the lead when Mitja Viler's cross from the left found Luka Zahovic at the far post. The teenager only had to tap it in, but somehow lifted it over the goal. 

Here was an escape for Chelsea, and they took advantage by summoning a strong finish. The leveller came from Matic with 17 minutes left after Terry had headed a corner from Cesc Fabregas towards goal.

Hazard came to life but could not find a finish and Costa was denied, and that goal that never was. Oscar thought he might have won a penalty and yet Maribor could have won it when Tavares fired wide after a break by Sallalich.

Amid the chaotic closing spell, Hazard was tripped by Viler, climbed to his feet and saw his spot-kick saved by Jasmin Handanovic. It summed the night up. Maribor clung on and the home crowd could barely contain their joy, chanting, jumping, burning flares and waving their giant flags. At the end they did not want to leave. They have never seen anything like it.

For Chelsea, as the dust settled, it did not seem quite so bad. They remain top of Group G, in a good position to qualify and remain unbeaten in 16 games this season in all competitions.

Next in Europe, they meet Roberto di Matteo's Schalke, but first to Anfield where the atmosphere will surely be right up Mourinho's street.
