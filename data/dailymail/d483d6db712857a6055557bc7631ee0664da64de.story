The influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants has led to a surge in support for Britain leaving the European Union.

A new survey indicates that 50 per cent of the population would cut the UK’s ties with Brussels, with a record low 33 per cent in favour of staying in.

The 17 per cent margin in a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday is one of the biggest gaps in recent ‘In or Out’ EU surveys.

Now half the population wants to cut ties with Brussels. In June just one per cent was in favour of leaving

It is in stark contrast with a similar poll in June which showed just a one per cent majority in favour of leaving the EU, with 45 in the ‘Out’ corner and 44 ‘In’.

Significantly, the 33 per cent in the new poll who want to stay in is the lowest ever number polled by Survation on the issue.

Three out of ten say the arrival of 
migrants from Romania and Bulgaria since the New Year has made them more
 likely to vote to go it alone in a referendum on Britain’s future in 
Europe.

The issue has also 
led to a revival in the ratings of UKIP leader Nigel Farage. His party  
is back to 16 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems on 11 per cent,  but 
behind Labour on 35 and the Conservatives on 31.

The level of concern sparked by Romanian 
and Bulgarian migrants is underlined in a  league table of 16 voters’ 
concerns, ranging from immigration to jobs, welfare and Scottish 
independence.

Immigration is way ahead, with 29 per cent saying it was their biggest worry, with the cost of living a distant second on 17, the economy on 15, national debt on 13, and unemployment at eight.

The chief concern about the impact of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants is how schools will cope with extra children. An overwhelming 77 per cent say the strain on schools is their  biggest fear.

The extra cost of welfare handouts and the effect on community tensions come next in the list.

An increase in begging and a drop in wages for British workers are not far behind.

But to some extent, British workers may have themselves to blame, according to the poll. A total of 45 per cent say UK firms who employ Romanians and Bulgarians instead of Britons cannot be blamed because immigrants work harder.

Intriguingly, the willingness of individuals to employ Romanians and Bulgarians who charge lower rates than their British counterparts varies sharply, depending on the nature of the work.

Asked if they would use a British decorator who charged £500 or a Romanian or Bulgarian who charged £400, people chose the British worker.

They made the same choice presented with a British baby sitter at £8 an hour or a Romanian or Bulgarian for £7 an hour.

But offered a British car wash for £6 or a Romanian or Bulgarian one for £5, they chose the latter.

The survey also confirms the view of most pundits that fears over immigration are fuelling support for Mr Farage and his anti-EU UKIP party, who are poised to inflict a crushing defeat on the Tories in May’s European Parliament elections.

According to Survation, Labour will win 32 per cent of votes in the Euro elections, UKIP 26, the Tories 23 and Lib Dems nine.

However, David Cameron can take some comfort from the indication that he is still more trusted than other party leaders on immigration. A total of 31 per cent back his stance, with 29 for Mr Farage, 26 for Ed Miliband and 15 for Nick Clegg.
