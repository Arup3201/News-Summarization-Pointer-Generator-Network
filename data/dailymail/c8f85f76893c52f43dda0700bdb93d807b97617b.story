As London 2012 looks to the future with its sci-fi-style cable cars across the Thames, an artefact has come to light giving a fascinating insight into the capital's Olympic past.

This newly uncovered poster showing the medalists of 1908 demonstrates how the games have grown between the first London Olympics and this year's competition.

Whereas in 1908 only 2,000 athletes from 22 countries competed in 110 events, this summer will see more than 10,000 athletes from 200 nations competing in over 300 events.

The poster depicting the modest band of winners was due to be shown on tonight's Antiques Roadshow, along with memorabilia from the 1908 event held at London's White City Stadium.

These items were originally owned by William Knightsmith, who is pictured with a megaphone on the bottom right of the print. In the days before public broadcast systems, it was his job to relay the action to the stands.

But he was not just any sports announcer, according to his great grandson who produced the memorabilia when the BBC's Roadshow team visited Wimbledon.

Patrick Stevenson said yesterday: 'My great grandfather was a toastmaster, the most famous in the country. He was the one who "invented" the red coat for toastmasters because he didn't want to be mistaken for a waiter.

'He was a favourite of the royals, which is why they asked for him to be their score announcer at the Games. He wore a top hat and relayed the results to the Royal Box by megaphone.'

As well as the souvenir poster - which was produced by Gamages, a London department store that closed in 1972 - Mr Stevenson brought to the Roadshow his great grandfather's megaphone and his top hat.

Expert Paul Viney described the poster as 'a wonderful print, showing all the Olympic champions and one or two sports that we don't have these days, such as the tug of war and tandem cyclists.'

Mr Stevenson also produced a gold medal won at the 1908 Games in another long-abandoned event. It was won by 25-year-old British runner Emil Voigt, although Mr Stevenson does not know how his family acquired it.

Voigt, born in Manchester to German parents, is on the far right of the poster, racing down the track towards William Knightsmith.

Mr Viney told Mr Stevenson: 'That's quite incredible: a gold medal in its original leather case inscribed "Olympic Games Winner, five miles run, London 1908".  Five miles - they don't do that any more because it's in metres.'

Valuation: William Knightsmith's poster and megaphone come under the expert eyes of the Antiques Roadshow team in Wimbledon, London. The megaphone could fetch as much as £2,000

It was the last occasion on which the five-mile event was run before it was replaced by 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres.

On values, Mr Viney said: 'At auction, the medal would probably fetch somewhere between £6,000 and £8,000, and on a good day might even make £10,000.'

He said the megaphone could make £1,500 to £2,000. And he valued the poster at £400 to £500.

Another figure that has changed markedly since the 1908 Games is the price tag of the event itself. The first London Olympics cost just £20,000 - a tiny fraction of the probable £10billion cost of staging London 2012.
