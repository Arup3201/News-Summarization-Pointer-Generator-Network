The once disgraced Duchess of York has flown to Balmoral to spend the weekend with the Queen, it has today been revealed.

Sarah Ferguson, former wife of Prince Andrew, reportedly flew to Aberdeen on Friday shortly after daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in Windsor.

While she has visited Balmoral since her divorce, it is thought to be the first time she has been invited to stay in the main castle on the Queen's estate since her marriage ended in 1996.

Fergie was joined by Andrew, and daughters Beatrice and Eugenie on the trip, the Sunday Express reports.

A Balmoral source told the paper it was 'just like old times'.

They added: 'The Duchess is being treated as if she and the Duke were still married.'

The Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law.

But Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship. The couple, who still live together, separated in 1992 but remained on good terms and brought up their daughters together.

It is believed that the Duchess has only been allowed to Balmoral on the condition she leaves before the Duke arrives on Monday.

The 92-year-old has been recovering since an operation on his abdomen, which was carried out in June, and has not yet seen his new great grandson, Prince George.

He is expected to travel to Edinburgh to carry out his first public engagement since the procedure, and will the join the Queen in Balmoral, where she has been staying since last Thursday.

It has been claimed that Prince Philip has never forgiven the Duchess for the embarrassment she caused the Royal Family during the 90s - during which time she embarked on an affair with a Texan oil tycoon while pregnant with her second child and was photographed ­having her toes sucked by  her 'financial adviser'.

In 2010 she also was revealed to have tried to sell 
access to Andrew for £500,000 to an undercover reporter as she tried desperately to pay off debts of £3million.

It has been reported that Prince Andrew,  then a Special Trade Ambassador,  helped her out of financial difficulty.

Fergie has been living in the Queen mother's old home, the Royal Lodge, for five years. 

In 2000 Fergie said during an interview that she and her former husband had talked of remarrying but that Prince Philip would not allow it.

The Queen is said to think of her as a 'good mother'.
