Drivers in remote areas could pay less for their petrol and diesel under Government plans to  cut fuel duty.

Residents of the Scottish islands and the Scilly Isles already receive a 5p discount on their fuel because the costs of transporting it means prices are higher than on the mainland.

Now ministers are considering extending this island fuel rebate scheme to other areas including parts of Devon, Cumbria and Wales.

The campaign group FairFuelUK said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses

The Government will collect price details from fuel retailers in 35 remote regions before seeking the right to implement the move from the European Commission.

A cut in fuel duty is defined as state aid under EU law and must receive permission from Brussels to go ahead.

The overall cost of the scheme will depend on the number of areas affected, but it is likely to run into millions of pounds as retailers would be able to claim back lost revenue from the HMRC. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said it would not be easy to gain approval from Europe.

He said: ‘The island fuel rebate provides much needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher.

‘I know that there are other remote rural areas of the UK with similarly high fuel costs.

‘So we are starting to gather further evidence that will form part of an application to the Commission to extend the island fuel duty discount scheme to very remote rural areas.

‘We will need to prove there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs so I would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible.

‘As a Highlander, I know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice, but a necessity. So while it won’t be easy to get this agreed with the Commission, I want to do everything I can to make this happen.’

The campaign group FairFuelUK said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses.

Instead, it called for a fuel duty cut across the whole country. Spokesman Quentin Willson said: ‘I welcome the Treasury’s acknowledgement that the UK needs a duty cut, but we need it across the country, not just for remote communities.  Everybody is hurting, not just the few.’

Edmund King, president of the AA, said help for motorists was good news, but all road users needed lower fuel costs.

He added: ‘It is quite hard to define a rural area.

‘Our analysis showed that if you have a supermarket close by, that will bring prices down.

‘The Government needs to take measures to increase fuel price transparency as petrol costs and duty are too high generally.’

Nearly 1,500 retailers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are being consulted. The Treasury said it was most interested in identifying areas where prices were consistently similar to those on the islands that already fall under the scheme.

But places where prices were consistently lower than those on the islands currently covered are ‘extremely unlikely’ to be included in any extension of the discount scheme.

Fuel retailers in the following areas are being asked to submit price data: Aberdeenshire, Angus, Antrim, Argyll and Bute, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Cookstown, Cornwall, Cumbria, Devon, Down, Dumfries and Galloway, Dungannon, Fermanagh, Gwynedd, Herefordshire, Highland, Isle of Anglesey, Larne, Limavady, Magherafelt, Monmouthshire, Moray. Moyle, Newry and Mourne, North Yorkshire, Northumberland, Omagh, Perth and Kinross, Powys, Scottish Borders, South Ayrshire, and Strabane.
