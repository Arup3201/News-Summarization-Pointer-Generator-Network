A set of mastodon tucks and a stone-age tool dredged together out of the Chesapeake Bay by fishermen suggest that human could have settled in North America thousands of years before previously thought, according to a controversial new study.

The mastodon remains are 22,000 years old, according to radio-carbon dating - up to ten thousand years older than the Clovis culture, thought to be the first settlers in the Western Hemisphere. 

Most researchers believe the first humans inhabited North America between 13,000 and 16,500 years ago after crossing the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia.  

This flint tool, which was found with a 22,000-year-old mastodon skull in the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay. It could be proof that humans inhabited America up to ten thousands years before previously thought 

The mastodon tusk that was hacked off a skull found in the Chesapeake was carbon-dated to 22,000 years old

Despite the incredible claims, much of the archaeological community remains skeptical, Live Science reports. 

'The bottom line is, there simply is no context for these discoveries,' University of Arizona-Tuscon archaeologist Vance Holliday told the site. 

He added: 'There's absolutely no DNA evidence.' 

Just because the two items were found together, he argues, doesn't meant that they were from the same time frame. There is no way to prove the flint tool is as old as the mastodon skull, Dr Holliday said.  

The incredible archaeological find was discovered in 230 feet of water 60 miles off shore in 1974. Fishermen who were dragging their scalloping nets across the bottom of the bay snagged a massive mastodon skull and dragged it to the surface. Also in the net was a flint knife.

The skull of the giant ice-age beast was too big to carry back to shore, so the crew cut off the tusks and teeth and threw the rest back in the water. 

The captain of the boat donated his artifacts to the local Gwynn's Island Museum in Virginia, where the sat unnoticed for near 40 decades. 

These are the teeth hacked from the mastodon skull in 1974. They suggest the beast was less than 30 years old when it died

They were re-discovered by a University of Delaware geologist, who alerted Dennis Stanford, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution. 

Dr Stanford believes that the tool shows wear - proof, he says, that it was used before it was submerged in water.

The Chesapeake has been underwater since the last ice age ended 14,000 years ago - meaning the tool is at least 14,000 years old. 

Dr Stanford, however, believes it was used to butcher the mastodon, which would make it 22,000 years old, according to Live Science.
