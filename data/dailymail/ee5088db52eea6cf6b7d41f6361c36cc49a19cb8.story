Barry Hearn has launched an outspoken attack on the SPFL’s failure to land a multi-million pound sponsorship deal.

The renowned sports impressario responsible for transforming snooker, boxing and darts was an invited speaker to an SFA convention at Hampden. He took the opportunity to brand the culture of leadership in the Scottish game ‘lazy’ and ‘disgraceful’.

And he told Scottish football to stop ‘looking at its shoelaces’ and ‘wallowing in self pity’ while reserving his strongest words for the league hierachy by insisting the failure to replace Clydesdale Bank as sponsors – whose deal ended in 2012 – was a sackable offence.

‘I look at Scottish football and see a nation with its head down looking at its shoelaces', he said. ‘When I started off with the darts and snooker we were way down - but we believed in ourselves and had a bit of a passion.

‘Sometimes organisations get into that mode of “that’s how it is”. They are totally lazy and set in their ways.

‘The fact you’ve got a Scottish Premiership without a sponsor. Do you know how long you’d work for Barry Hearn if that was the case?

‘I won’t even tell you how long - because that’s not a performance I’m looking for.

‘You’ve got to grow. You’ve got to be positive. You can’t expect people to take you seriously if you don’t take yourself seriously. If you live in everyone’s shadow then you never come out of that shadow.

‘You need something dramatic like “attendances are going great ... commercial is this ... Abu Dhabi Bank is sponsoring the SPFL”. The fact the league doesn't have a sponsor says everything you need to know so you better get it right and if you don’t then it doesn't matter to me because I won’t be back to talk again.’

The ex-Leyton Orient chairman said it was a disgrace that the Scottish Premiership did not have a sponsor

Hearn would later comment: ‘The fact the Scottish Premier League has no sponsor is not good. Put it this way, if you worked for me you’d be sacked.’

The man who turned snooker into primetime television in the 1980s, Hearn has also been a prominent figure on the boxing circuit for decades and has now transformed darts into a sport capable of filling Glasgow’s 12,000 seat Hydro arena.

Laughing off talk of sprinkling his magic on Scottish football as a consultant, Hearn added: ‘I certainly won’t be up for the leadership. But you can take a horse to water and what I’ve said isn’t rocket science. It’s just common sense.

‘If they don’t take on the wider picture then you’re stuck with what you are.

‘Listen, I’ll carry on selling 11,000 for a night of darts at the Hydro and your (football) attendances will be 1250 people or whatever. I’m a visitor so I’m cheating a bit but the world is changing and there are so many more opportunities that you might not be aware of.

‘How can a little company like mine turn over the same amount as the SPFL? And how can we make millions and millions of pounds of profit and you’re doing your b*******?’

The Scottish Cup replay between Inverness and St Mirren attracted just 1,326 fans on Tuesday
