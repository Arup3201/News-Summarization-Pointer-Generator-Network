A suspected shoplifter on the run had a lucky escape when he was hit by a car – and still managed to evade capture.

The man was being chased by members off staff when he ran into the street in front of a silver car and was thrown in the air by the impact.

His shocked pursuers attempt to help him as he scrambles to his feet, but he drops his trousers and falls over again.

Hit: The alleged thief, wearing a white hoodie and dark low-slung trousers, notices the the silver car coming towards him, but it is too late

Impact: The silver car knocks him off his feet and he is thrown in the air and up on the windscreen

Up in the air: When the car hits him, he goes over the bonnet of the small vehicle

Over the top: The unidentified man has a different kind of flight than the one he had planned

Video footage of the incident outside 
an Asda Supermarket in Oldham, Greater Manchester was uploaded to 
YouTube and has had over 10,000 hits.

The alleged shoplifter stole alcohol 
from the shop and the video shows him being pursued by a male member of 
staff before running onto a busy road.

When the car hits him, he rolls across the bonnet, over the car’s windscreen and out of shot.

The Asda worker stops the hunt 
and comes to his aid, asking: ‘Are you alright? Are you hurt?’, but the 
young man is more interested in escaping justice.

'You alright?': The pursuer, dressed in Asda uniform, runs to help him

Running away: Looking rather unsteady, the man seems unharmed as he resumes his flight

Oh, pants!: It doesn't take long before the man's trousers drop causing him to fall over - and exposing himself

He gets up and comes back into view, scrambling to get away from concerned passers-by who have gathered to help.

However, as he steadies his feet, his trousers fall down, exposing his backside, and he tumbles again.

He attempts to get away again but falls to the ground a second time, before finally stumbling away.

The Asda staff member makes a 
haphazard attempt to follow but is so shocked by the incident he sits 
down at a nearby tree – visibly shaken - whilst the young man runs off.

Down again: After getting up once more, the man stumbles and falls

Escape: Onlookers try to follow the man to help him, but he manages to run away

The scene: The man allegedly stole alcohol from this Asda Supermarket in Oldham

Asda declined to comment on the 
impact on individual members of staff, and said the incident is a matter
for investigation by the police.

'We take matters of shoplifting 
seriously, but would never want our colleagues to put themselves or 
anyone else in harms way and our policy is to deal with shoplifting in a
manner that is safe for everyone involved,' a spokesperson for Asda 
told MailOnline.

Police have yet to trace the man in the video, but his accident and escape has become a hit on YouTube.

The footage was captured by a camera in a parked taxi near the Oldham Asda on September 29th.

One YouTube user wrote: 'Hahaha love it karma at its best!'

Another added: 'W****** got what was coming.'

A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said they were investigating the alleged theft but no-one had been arrested.
