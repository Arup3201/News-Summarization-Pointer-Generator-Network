For millions of Britons the drought is officially over, swept away by record rainfall.

Nineteen areas in parts of the North, the West and the Midlands were declared drought-free yesterday by the government’s Environment Agency.

However, it has refused to lift the alert for the Thames Water area and South-East England, despite the fact reservoirs are full to overflowing.

Filling up nicely: Bewl Water in Kent, a county where hosepipe bans remain in force

Shrinking fast: The same reservoir two months ago before weeks of rain began to refill it

As a result, millions of families who have put up with weeks of downpours still face threat of prosecution for using a hosepipe in the garden or to wash the car.

Britain had 4.8in of rain in April, which was the highest level on records that date back to 1910. The downpours have continued into May. Liscombe in Somerset was the wettest place in the country with 10.8in of rain, which was more than three times the average.

Areas no longer in drought include Somerset, Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, parts of Gloucestershire, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. South Yorkshire, East Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, West Midlands, and Warwickshire are also given the all-clear.

The status of these areas meant residents and businesses were under threat of a hosepipe ban, although no restrictions had been put in place.

Heavy showers continued to pummel 
parts of the North and Wales yesterday. In the North-West, parts of 
Cumbria were plunged back into winter after snow fell overnight.

Weathermen say many areas will enjoy 
some relief this weekend with a touch of spring warmth. Temperatures 
could read 16c in some areas.
However, the reprieve will be short-lived, with the rain expected to return by the middle of next week.

The Environment Agency said the heavy
rainfall of recent weeks has restored many rivers and reservoirs. 
However, levels of ground water, which is reached through bore holes, 
are still low in many areas.

Companies that are still officially 
covered by drought and continue to have a hosepipe ban in force include 
Thames, Anglian Water, South East Water, Southern Water, Sutton and East
Surrey Water,  Veolia Water Southeast and Veolia Water Central.

However, there is anger that firms 
behind the bans are allowing almost a quarter of all treated water to be
wasted through leaks in their pipes.

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman yesterday defended the need to maintain hosepipe bans.

‘Even the record rainfall we had in 
April and the prediction of more wet weather in May won’t make up for 
the shortages in these areas caused by two extremely dry winters,’ she 
said.

She said it would only be possible to
bring the drought to an end in all areas if the country gets several 
months of very wet weather.

Richard
Aylard of Thames Water said: ‘No water company wants to impose 
restrictions on its customers for any longer than absolutely necessary.

'We
still have a serious groundwater shortage, and we could yet have a 
long, hot summer, so, much as we’d love to, it would be irresponsible 
for us to lift the hosepipe ban just yet.’

The
Environment Agency’s chief executive, Dr Paul Leinster, said: ‘Low 
groundwater levels remain a concern across many parts of England, with 
many still at a similar level to those in 1976 and unlikely to return to
normal levels before the winter.’

MeteoGroup Forecaster Brendan Jones said: 'We should see a bit of a break from the heavy rain over the weekend.

'Today will see more of the same for parts of Scotland and northern England, with some hill snow in northern Scotland.

'From Manchester southwards, there may
be one or two showers but a lot of the day will be mainly dry. Some 
sunshine will come through which will be welcomed.

'Most
of the country will have a fairly good day on Saturday. There may be 
the odd showers but many places will be dry with some sunshine.

'Temperatures
will range from 12 to 15 degrees, which isn’t brilliant for May but 
better than it has been. By Sunday, most of England and Wales should see
some pretty good weather.'

The Met Office shared their optimism 
in finally predicting a brighter weekend for Britons with temperatures 
reaching a respectable 16C.

A
forecast for Saturday on their website said:'A much brighter day 
generally, with a good deal of sunshine. Probably somewhat cloudier at 
times in the afternoon, though. Light winds.'

Sunshine
will certainly be welcomed across the UK, as heavy flooding saw bizarre
scenes like those in north Wales, where downpours caused a football 
pitch to be invaded by eels.

The 3ft-long fish were washed onto fields at Wepre Park in Connah’s Quay, Flintshire, used by under-11 teams.

Firefighters in North Yorkshire were 
called to a number of localised incidents yesterday including the rescue
of 350 sheep and lambs caught out by a flooded river in the Yorkshire 
Dales.

The fire service had also attended reports of flooded properties, mainly in the Skipton and Harrogate areas.

There were a number of reports of a flash flood in the village of Summerbridge, north of Harrogate.

Three of the four Environment Agency flood warnings in force across England and Wales were for rivers in North Yorkshire.

Two were on the River Nidd in the Knaresborough area and the third was on the River Ure in the area of Ripon and Boroughbridge.

Meteorologists said the flash flooding was likely to have been caused by a narrow band of exceptionally heavy showers which worked its way across the North Yorkshire region yesterday afternoon.

Mr Jones said the band of downpours - only 5-10 miles wide in places - combined with the high general rainfall levels seen across the region on Tuesday night to produce the exceptional totals.

He said: 'With that volume of rain coming down, the water just hasn’t anywhere to go.'

Mr Jones added there were dramatic differences in temperature levels between places caught in the wave of downpours and those just outside.

He said the North Yorkshire seaside town of Scarborough, which had 0.3in (7mm) of rain in an hour yesterday afternoon, only saw a high of 13C (55.4F) today, whereas at Bridlington, just a few miles down the coast, temperatures hit 21C (69.8F).

The highest rainfall figure was in Shap, Cumbria, which saw 1.4in (36mm) in 12 hours yesterday and 2.4in (62mm) in 24 hours.

Mr Jones said the narrow band of exceptionally heavy rain had now moved out to the North Sea and the more general rainy weather was moving towards Scotland.

While Britain has battled through torrential downpours and unrelenting rain in recent weeks, those in Australia have been lapping up record conditions of a far more enjoyable variety.

Sun worshippers were spotted in the Australian city today basking in temperatures of 29.1C - the warmest day in May for more than 70 years.

Only three days in the last summer have been recorded as warmer in Sydney, and there has been no rainfall recorded in the city this month.

Despite being autumn in Sydney, only three days have been warmer this summer, according to experts

Weatherzone meteorologist Doug Fenton told the Sydney Morning Herald the temperature of 29.1C at Observatory Hill in Sydney was the hottest day in May since 1942.

He said: 'We've had a high pressure system which has been planted directly overhead,' Mr Fenton said.

'That's brought some sunny skies over the last few days and really allowed surface temperatures to heat up.

'We've also had north to northwest winds bringing in that warmth from the interior ... that meant we're seeing the heat build up over the last few days.'
