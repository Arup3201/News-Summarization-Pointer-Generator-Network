Foul-mouthed: Viewers think rants from stars like Gordon Ramsay (pictured) were too frequent

A third of television viewers believe there is too much swearing and violence on our screens, according to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

Some 36 per cent thought there was excessive violence on TV, while 37 per cent thought foul-mouthed rants from stars such as Gordon Ramsay were too frequent an occurrence.

The regulator’s annual report into consumer attitudes on broadcasting also found that one in four adults think there was too much sex on TV.

It comes after family shows  such as X Factor caused public  outrage over sexualised performances by singers such as Rihanna and swearing before the watershed.

Last year Ofcom set out stringent guidelines for programmes, saying that scantily-clad singers and  lewd dance routines must be cut from programmes being aired before 9pm.

And earlier this year they warned that channels broadcasting repeats of post-watershed programmes before 9pm could face fines.

The annual report also revealed that around a quarter of adults disagree with the time of the TV watershed.

Ofcom’s figures show 9 per cent thought the watershed was ‘too late’ last year. In 2005 just 6 per cent thought it was too late and should be brought forward.

And almost 20 per cent of adults said they had been offended by something they had seen on TV in the past year.

But Ofcom said these figures were down considerably from 2005 for each of the categories.

It also claimed the survey showed that the proportion of adults saying there is too much sex, violence or swearing on TV has fallen by about a third since 2005.

The proportion of adults saying the standard of TV programming had ‘got worse’ was 31 per cent.

But 46 per cent of those 65 and above thought that standards had worsened. Just over one in ten felt standards had improved.

The top two reasons given for the standard of TV programmes getting worse were ‘more repeats’ (71 per cent) and ‘lack of variety’ (43 per cent).

The report also found that 96 per cent of adults are aware that broadcasters are allowed to show programming unsuitable for children only after a certain time.
