Sonny Bill Williams was absent from All Blacks training in Cardiff on Tuesday to witness the birth of his first child back in New Zealand.

The Waikato Chiefs centre, who recently returned to rugby union after a two-year stint with the Sydney Roosters in rugby league, missed his side’s training session at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff to watch his wife give birth to their first daughter via Skype.

‘Sonny wasn't training simply because he was monitoring the progress of his wife,’ said All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster.

‘We're delighted Sonny and his wife Alana had a little baby girl this morning and he was following that event so we're delighted,' added Foster.

‘The family's good and it's all on top of [prop forward] Charlie [Faumuina] and Michelle's second child last week, so it's been a week of celebration for the All Blacks with babies.’

New Zealand face Wales in Cardiff on Saturday with Williams in line for a recall after coming on as a replacement during his side’s 24-16 victory over Scotland last weekend.

Williams starred at inside centre in New Zealand’s 24-21 win over England at Twickenham.
