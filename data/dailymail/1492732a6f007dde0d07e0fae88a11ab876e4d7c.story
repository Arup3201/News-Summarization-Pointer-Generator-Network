Philip Branch was jailed for three years at Guildford Crown Court for historic sexual abuse

A paedophile golfer who repeatedly abused his schoolboy caddie more than 35 years ago, was behind bars today.

Grey-haired Philip Blanch was jailed for three years after his victim, now an adult, found the courage to contact police.

He had targeted the schoolboy, then aged 11 years,  after he volunteered to caddie for him in exchange for pocket money.

Over the next four years Blanch, now aged 79, repeatedly sexually abused the boy  until he turned 15.

He told the child that if he ever contacted police both he and his sister would be taken into care.

His victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, branded Blanch a 'monster' who had wrecked his life in a statement read to Guildford Crown Court.

'He took away my childhood,' he said.

'I am living behind the wall with no emotional output. I blame him for multiple suicide attempts. I blame him entirely for my criminal record, I turned to stealing when he was abusing me.

'It sent me into a spiral of criminal behaviour. My IQ was 157 yet I failed miserably at school.'

The man urged Judge Peter Moss to jail Blanch to protect the public.

He added: 'I feel let down by those who should have protected me from this monster.

'I look to the court to do the right thing and send him to prison and protect other young boys.'

Blanch, of Belaugh Avenue in Lowestoft, Suffolk, admitted three indecent assaults on the boy when he was a member of a golf club near Woking in Surrey. 

He was also convicted on a majority verdict of 11 to one of three other indecent assaults on the same boy after a five day trial in November.

Blanch was acquitted of four counts of rape by buggery and three counts of indecent assault on a child.

Blanch told his victim that if he ever told anyone else about what happened both he and his sister would be taken into care

A judge sitting at Guildford Crown Court was told how Blanch would take the boy on trips and abuse him in the car as well as buying him gifts.

Blanch told the boy, who lived with his mother and sister, that if he reported him to the police he and his sister would be taken into care.

Stephen Requena, defending, appealed for a suspended sentence because Blanch's 80-year-old wife has poor health and he has to do most of the house work.

He said: 'This is an elderly woman who has stood by Mr Blanch and with reason it has to be said, these 34 years despite what he did in the 60s and 70s.'

The court heard Blanch was convicted of two similar incidents in 1965 and 1980, but was arrested in a public house in April 2013 for the current crimes.

Mr Requena stressed that since his last conviction Blanch has had treatment and now has 'significant' health problems including diabetes and heart disease.

He said: 'It is a case of positive good character. He has spent the last 34 years feeling disgusted, ashamed and deeply sorry. He has shown remorse.'

However, Judge Moss told Blanch that because of the severe psychological damage his crimes had caused his victim only an immediate jail term would suffice.

Jailing him for three years and four months, Judge Moss said: 'These offences arose when you met the boy at your golf club. You stole his innocence. That has obviously had an impact on the remainder of his life.

'He has suffered psychological damage as a consequence of what you have done.

'He was 11 years old at the time and from a background which was deprived of a father.

'You took advantage of him. You knew he would be vulnerable. He trusted you and you utilised and abused that. You did groom him.

'Your wife is an innocent victim of these historic allegations.

'It is impossible to find any alternative other than an immediate custodial sentence.'
