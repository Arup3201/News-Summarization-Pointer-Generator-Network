A middle-aged man was arrested on suspicion of murder today after an elderly woman was found dead, sprawled in the street outside a block of flats.

Police were called after the frail 88-year-old pensioner was spotted lying outside the property in a tree-lined street not far from Hove seafront, East Sussex, this morning.

A second floor window above the body was wide open and the pensioner, who had lived at the property, was clad only in her nightwear.

Investigation: Police investigating the incident have arrested a 49-year-old man

Detectives investigating the discovery of the body outside Baltimore Court in The Drive later arrested a 49-year-old man from the area in Brighton.

The suspect and victim were known to each another, although the pair were not related.

Police remained at the scene tonight while a post-mortem examination was set to take place tomorrow.

The nature of the pensioner’s injuries was tonight unclear although it appeared she had plunged from the window.

Police said that they were not releasing the victim’s details until they had contacted all relatives and broken news of her tragic death.

Detective Chief Inspector Claire Pridgeon, of Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We are working to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death of the woman and I would appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in The Drive before 7am on Thursday to contact police.'

Anyone with information can contact Sussex Police on 101 quoting the murder investigation’s codename Operation Atlantic.
