Eco-fashion brand Reformation is launching its first bridal collection, with each dress made according to the brand's strict sustainable practices: using repurposed vintage and surplus materials.

The collection, to be sold online from Tuesday, consists of eight styles, each available in a choice of seven colors.

Ivory silk wedding dresses range from $518 to $588, and bridesmaids dresses are priced between $198 and $368.

'Girls can get into these guilt-free,' said Reformation in a press release, explaining that the dresses were also designed to be reworn for other occasions -- far more sustainable than most wear-once bridesmaid ensembles.

'We tweaked some of our best shapes and carefully picked the best fabrics to make, well, the best dresses,' they explained.

For some price comparison, the cheapest dress at the similarly bohemian Stone Fox Bride is $1,500, meanwhile J. Crew's wedding gowns can cost upward of $1,000 and even the majority of dresses at inexpensive wedding emporium David's Bridal run at approximatly $800.

And designer wedding gowns can set a bride back $2,000 to $12,000 on net-a-porter.com.

Reformation's collection is made locally in the brand's New York and Los Angeles studios, using at least 80 per cent reclaimed materials.

Founded by Yael Aflalo, who started Ya-Ya in 1999, Reformation aims to make use of the nearly 13million tons of clothing going directly into American landfills each year.

'Our vision is focused on our environment, and how our business affects the world and community around us,' states the brand's website.
