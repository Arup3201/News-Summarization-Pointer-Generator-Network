Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has shown his face in public for the first time after being yanked off of his slot on NBC's Nightly News.

Williams, who was kicked off the show for lying about surviving an RPG attack in the Iraq war, was the guest of honor at a fundraiser for the private Catholic high school he attended as a boy.

The shamed newsreader schmoozed with guests at a casino in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in the hope of scraping together $1million to prop up the Mater Dei Catholic prep school in nearby Middletown.

Speaking to the Two River Times, Williams waxed lyrical about his schooldays. He said: 'I had four great years here. I did not know it then, but it was the last degree I’d ever earn. It’s a wonderful school, and it should be open for a long time, for everybody'.

'Four great years': Williams committed to helping save the school just before NBC suspended him

According to the Asbury Park Press, Williams topped off his attendance at the $125-per-head dinner with a $50,000 donation.

He handed over the cash without a salary to back it up - as NBC has cut his pay for the duration of his six-month suspension.

Williams left Mater Dei in 1977. Afterwards he attended community college and two universities, but never graduated.

According to the gala's organizer, Maria Buzzanco, there were 'warm hugs' for the beleaguered anchor at the event, and 'everyone was telling him how much they support him'. 

He first committed to trying to help save the school days before he was punished by NBC bosses for telling exaggerated tales about covering the Iraq war.

Williams had routinely claimed he was on board a Chinook helicopter which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, which miraculously did not explode. He later admitted he wasn't there.

His old school has also been struggling in recent months, announcing in February it needed to raise an urgent $1million on top of the $10,000 a year it collects from each of its students.

Fundraisers say they now have more than $900,000 of their hoped-for total, some $80,000 of which was raised at the fundraiser Williams attended.
