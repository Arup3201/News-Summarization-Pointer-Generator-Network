A contestant on a Turkish television dating was asked to leave after he revealed to a shocked audience he had murdered his wife and a former lover.

Sefer Calinak, 62, told Flash TV's 'Luck of the Draw' he had served prison sentences for each of the murders and had been released under an amnesty programme.

He told the show's host 'I'm an honest person looking for a new wife' before adding he killed his first wife because he was 'irritated' by her behaviour and murdered a subsequent partner because he thought she was after his money.

A contestant on a Turkish television dating was asked to leave after he revealed to a shocked audience he had murdered his wife and a former lover. Sefer Calinak, 62, told Flash TV's 'Luck of the Draw' he had served prison sentences for each of the murders and had been released under an amnesty programme

Calinak was asked to leave the show by the host, prompting applause from the studio audience, in an episode which made headlines in Turkish newspapers.

He has since said that he will leave his search for a wife 'to God'.

Çalınak was twice released from prison under a government amnesty -  without completing his sentences it has been reported.

His first wife was a cousin named Fadime, who he married when they were both 17, as they tried to escape Fadime's forced arranged marriage to a widower, Hurrieydailynews.com reports.

He said after five months of living together her behaviour changed.

He said: 'The nephew of the man who wanted to marry her started to come to our village. I was jealous and I killed her, in a way.'

He said he was released from his 13 year nine month sentence after four years and six months.

He then married another woman, and they had two children, but they separated.

He then embarked on an affair with another woman who said she would leave her husband for him - but he said she did not.

He said: 'I killed her after she attempted to kill me. She was accidentally killed when I swung the axe.'

Çalınak was again sent to prison, but released in another amnesty.
