A feminist stripper who has been working in the industry for 22 years has spoken out in defense of her controversial profession, insisting that she feels more empowered as a woman because of her time spent dancing on the pole in strip clubs.

Antonia Crane, who also works as a writer and a teacher, told CNN's Lisa Lang that she feels incredibly 'sexy' whenever she takes to the stage and believes that stripping allows her to embrace her womanhood and her sexuality.

'Generally it's a sexy dance and you just kind of get into the mode,' she said. 'When the music plays you just go and you become kind of an animal. You become part of that world, like a sensual world of heat and sleaze.'

'It's hot and empowering': Antonia, 42, believes that stripping can actually enable women to better embrace their femininity

'My goal was to pay my tuition': Antonia initially began stripping as a means of paying her way through college

The 42-year-old is adamant that society's perception of stripping as a degrading and shameful profession is entirely wrong.

'I think it's hot and empowering,' she added. 'I think that our culture tells us that it's bad and that it's inherently degrading but I don't subscribe to that.' 

Having entered into the industry at the age of 20, when her friend took her along to one of 'San Francisco's oldest, sleaziest clubs', Antonia has since clocked more than 10,000 hours working in a variety of strip clubs across America.

'Initially, my goal was to pay my rent and afford my exorbitant college tuition while taking down the patriarchy one lap dance at a time,' she wrote in a piece for CNN. 'I was studying post-structural feminist theory and the civil rights movement and stripping complemented the art and literature I was exploring at that time.'

She is clear, however, that there are some drawbacks to working in what can  be an incredibly dark - and sometimes even dangerous - profession and admits that there have been nights when she has been 'grabbed' and the people have been 'awful'.

But despite her growing career in writing and teaching - Antonia has already published one memoir, Spent, about her mother's illness and the sex industry and is currently writing a new self-help book for strippers - she admits that she has no plans to retire from the pole any time soon.

Money matters: The writer, who has already published her memoir, Spent, insists that stripping is the most profitable profession for her to work in

'My plan was to strip for a month or two, pay some bills and walk away unscathed with a cushion in the bank... 

'Every stripper... I have ever met assumes they're just going to strip for one weekend to pay a stack of parking tickets or buy a plane ticket, but that's not what happens...

'I hope to build a life so huge outside the strip club that I won't need to dance anymore because I am too busy writing and teaching; creating other moments of joy and human connection in the classroom and on the page; to rise so far in that field that I won't need to land into laps again, but until that happens, I will strip.'
