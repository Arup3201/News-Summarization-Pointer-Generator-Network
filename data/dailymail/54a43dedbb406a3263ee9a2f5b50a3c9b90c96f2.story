An hour delay seems like nothing compared to a wait of more than two-and-a-half years for a Gabriel Obertan league goal – but it was the forgotten Frenchman who passed his St James’ Park screen test on a day where everything threatened to go wrong for Alan Pardew.

The game was in serious doubt when the canvas surrounding the club’s new giant screen – making its debut – became dislodged by high winds at 1pm.

It took two hours to resolve the issue and, with thousands of supporters held at the turnstiles amid safety concerns, kick-off was delayed to 4pm.

But that wasn’t before influential midfielder Cheick Tiote hobbled from the warm-up in obvious discomfort and declared himself unfit to play. At this point, Pardew could have been forgiven for wishing for another gust to come along and postpone the fixture.

Come full-time, though, the Newcastle boss was puffing his cheeks in relief at a first league win, avoiding the ignominy of a club record of eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season.

The identity of his match-winner was equally satisfying. Obertan – a player signed on the say-so of Pardew – had become a figure of fun on Tyneside after three ineffective seasons. 

But it was the 25-year-old who had the last laugh as his 71st-minute strike – his first since February, 2012 – settled the contest and gave his manager a much-needed three points.

Pardew’s team had started well. With an extra hour of ale inside them, the home fans were right behind their side from the off with no hint of any protest against the boss or regime, despite the earlier farce.

And Newcastle should have been two up inside 10 minutes. First Moussa Sissoko whipped enticingly through the six-yard area but there were no takers. Then, having outmuscled Richie De Laat deep inside his own half, Obertan charged fully 50 yards before feeding Papiss Cisse who drew back for the unmarked Fabricio Coloccini, the defender somehow populating Leicester’s penalty area. But he failed to climax the swift break and stabbed wide from just eight yards.

Home left back Paul Dummett then slammed down the throat of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from range having seized upon some slack passing in Leicester’s midfield.

But for all of that early promise, Newcastle should have fallen behind when Vurnon Anita – dozing in possession midway inside his own half – was robbed and Leonardo Ulloa teed up Matty James who prodded tamely at Tim Krul from 12 yards.

With Leicester finishing the half much the stronger, Krul lost flight of Marc Albrighton’s cross-cum-shot and the ball cracked the upright, the goalkeeper’s blushes spared.

 The half expired goalless with home fans booing their side’s performance, but they were soon cheering when their jazzy new screen relayed news of Sunderland’s 8-0 thrashing at Southampton.

Kicking towards the ‘screen end’ after the break, the hosts came within a few inches of breaking the deadlock when Sissoko, sizing a shot from 20 yards, saw his effort deflected just wide by the boot of a sliding Liam Moore.

Buoyed by that near miss, Newcastle pressed for an opener and should have had it when Paul Konchesky gifted a chance to Cisse. 

The left back, perhaps blinded by his own team-mates, failed to notice Cisse lurking on the shoulder of the defence when he rolled a ball back towards Schmeichel.

The Senegal striker pounced and rounded the keeper only to wedge into the side-netting from a narrow angle – not narrow enough to mitigate what was a glaring miss, however.

Pardew, spinning on his heels, shot a despairing look towards his dugout, for he knew the screen should have been replaying its first goal. Colback stung the palms of Schmeichel with a dipping free-kick soon after.

But there was nothing the Foxes custodian could do to keep out Obertan’s blast. Cutting infield from the left, his low drill flew beyond Schmeichel with the aid of a slight deflection, Pardew responding with a trademark fist-pump not sighted in a long while.

On a day of delays, the winning feeling was worth the wait.
