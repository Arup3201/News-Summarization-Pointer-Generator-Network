A former justice of the peace accused of killing a North Texas district attorney and his wife had a 'treasure trove' of evidence in a storage shed, prosecutors said during opening statements Monday.

Eric Williams faces a possible death sentence for the 2013 slayings of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and the prosecutor's wife, Cynthia, at their home in Forney, just east of Dallas. 

Williams also is charged with fatally shooting assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse two months earlier.

Prosecutor Bill Wirskye told jurors that the storage shed's contents pointed to Williams being the alleged gunman. 

Wirskye also said 20 rounds were fired inside the McLellands' home in less than two minutes. 

An investigator provided early testimony on what authorities discovered at the home, where the couple was dead and dressed in their nightwear.

Friends reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their home on March 31 2013, having not heard from them in almost 24 hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds.

Authorities contend Williams was upset because the prosecutors' office had pursued charges against him in 2012, saying he stole county-owned computer equipment. 

His subsequent conviction cost him his law license and job.

Williams' estranged wife, Kim, is accused of helping him carry out the slayings and is expected to testify against him.

The trial was moved from Kaufman County to nearby Rockwall County. 

Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told The Dallas Morning News that residents were 'anxiously awaiting' the case.

'People are ready to let justice prevail, so we have put this behind us,' he said. 'Not that we'll forget.'

Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March 2013

Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January 2013 as he walked toward the Kaufman County courthouse for work

Hasse was gunned down in January 2013 as he walked toward the Kaufman County courthouse for work, while the McLellands were gunned down in their home two months later.

Authorities allege that Eric Williams was the gunman in both cases.

Prosecutors say they have a gun linked to Hasse's death and a mask believed to have been worn by the gunman. 

The items were found by a dive team in a North Texas lake.

Wirskye filed court documents in September alleging that Williams intended to target other law enforcement officials. 

Defense attorneys have declined to comment on the charges against Williams.

Williams practiced law in Kaufman for more than a decade, specializing in family-related cases.

He was elected to his judicial post in 2010, but he lost the $53,000-a-year position and his law license when he was convicted of stealing computer monitors.

During the highly contentious trial, McLelland and Hasse portrayed Williams as a dishonest public official with a dangerous streak.

At sentencing, they presented evidence indicating Williams had made death threats against another local attorney and a former girlfriend.

Although the two prosecutors sought prison time for Williams, he ultimately received probation.

The murder case is being prosecuted by two Dallas attorneys, Toby Shook and Bill Wirskye. 

Shook and Wirskye, criminal defense attorneys who both previously served as Dallas County prosecutors, were appointed after Hasse's slaying on McLelland's recommendation.

A neighbor told the Dallas Morning News that he knew Williams to be a 'nice guy' who was known in the neighborhood for riding around town in his Segway.

Once a respected attorney, a justice of the peace and a member of the chamber of commerce, Williams had lost everything following his conviction.

Williams could no longer practice law in the state and his peace officer license was revoked, leaving him unemployed and on the brink of financial ruin. 

Prior to his sentencing, Williams told prison officials that he had taken the computer equipment to test a video system that would allow him to hold hearing online and insisted that he did not steal anything.

The disgraced lawyer said the case against him had put tremendous stress on his ailing wife and elderly in-laws.  

One month before Hasse's death, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a warning to authorities statewide that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could retaliate for an October indictment that targeted some of its leaders.

McLelland's office was involved in that investigation. 

In the months after Hasse was killed, McLelland began to carry a gun everywhere and took extra caution when answering his door.

He told The Associated Press in an interview shortly before his death that he was warning his employees that they needed to be more cautious as well.
