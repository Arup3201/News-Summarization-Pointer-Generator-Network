Philippe Senderos has spelled out to Roy Hodgson the expectation on England to make it to Euro 2016 ahead of their crucial first qualifier in Switzerland on Monday.

England lag 11 places behind their Group E opponents in FIFA’s world rankings but Senderos insists Hodgson’s team are favourites because of the depth of quality at his disposal compared to Switzerland.

The Aston Villa defender, who has played every minute for the Premier League’s joint-meanest defence so far this season, believes English players sometimes wear the Three Lions shirt heavily, including at the World Cup in Brazil where he says: ‘Everyone expected more.’

Clear warning: Philippe Senderos believes the pressure is on England to qualify for Euro 2016

Disappointment: England crashed out of the 2014 World Cup during the group stages 

But ahead of their clash at Basle’s St Jakob Stadium, Senderos believes the onus to deliver remains on the visitors.

‘I don’t think you can ever enter as favourites against a big team like England,’ he explains. ‘We are still a small country, we are developing very well and qualifying for big tournaments. But England are a massive country in football and they have a lot of players to pick from.

‘It’s different in Switzerland, because England are expected to win and go to every tournament. With the players and quality they have they should do that.

‘For Switzerland it’s a massive achievement to qualify for any competition. Now we’ve raised the bar really high, qualifying for the last three World Cups, every time we don’t qualify it will be a big disappointment.

‘We want our level of football to compete with the big nations.’

Under Ottmar Hitzfeld, Switzerland thrived to such an extent that they entered the summer’s World Cup as a seeded nation following an unbeaten qualifying campaign.

In Brazil they won a thriller against Ecuador, experienced a chastening defeat to France but then rallied to beat Honduras. In the last 16 they only went out to Argentina by virtue of Angel di Maria’s late goal in extra time.

England were eliminated before 12 teams had even played their second game after defeats to Italy and Uruguay, before limping to a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.

Senderos declines to say what he thinks went wrong but concedes most seasoned observers had higher hopes. ‘It’s a big competition and it’s always difficult to go through,’ he adds. ‘I know we have a very tough game against them and that’s all I want to concentrate on.

‘We are going to try to battle hard and start this new campaign on a good foot. A win means you can do something special.’

Croatian coach Vladimir Petkovic, 51, has taken over from Hitzfeld, who retired aged 65, and despite losing the man who masterminded Switzerland’s recent success, Senderos describes the atmosphere in the camp as ‘very excited’.

‘He’s going to create something new, the whole country is up for it.’

It is nearly a decade since the 29-year-old made his international debut and he hopes to win his 55th cap against England. He is well placed to identify how a country of eight million has managed to compete at the last five major tournaments. He attributes their standing to an emphasis on youth development and the embracing of migrant families.

Senderos, son of a Spanish father and Serbian mother, won the Under 17 European Championships in 2002. ‘The national team and every single club in Switzerland has done major work on youth. The next generation to mine (in 2009) were world champions in Nigeria, a massive achievement. Those players now have come through to the first team.

‘Also in Switzerland we have a lot of immigrants, born and raised here but with heritage from different countries, and have used that to our advantage. If you see our line-up we don’t have many Swiss names in the team. It’s very important for a small country to do that.’

Villa might have two representatives on the pitch in Basle, if Fabian Delph earns selection from Roy Hodgson. ‘He will bring his energy, his power, his will to move forward all the time,’ says Senderos. ‘He is a very positive player to have around.’

There are kind words too for maligned Wayne Rooney, and an explanation of why he is a nightmare for centre-backs. ‘It’s very difficult to mark him because he’s always moving around and finding these pockets between the midfield and the striker

‘For us as defenders he brings you out of the spot where you are normally comfortable. He will thrive as England captain.’

Happy: Former Arsenal defender Senderos is delighted to be back in the Premier League

Senderos is thriving alongside Ron Vlaar for Villa, and the pair have only conceded once in three Premier League games as Paul Lambert’s side sit among the Champions League places. It is a brighter start than how his three-year spell at Fulham ended, before a six-month stint in La Liga with Valencia.

‘I’m very pleased to be back in the Premier League,’ he says. ‘We have started well but it’s very early and we have to continue working.

‘I’m sad about what happened at Fulham and wish them all the best. I went to a big club like Valencia, so I was very pleased with my move.

‘It was a good experience. We played in the semi-finals of the Europa League and were so close to going to the final.’

For England going close will not do. Hodgson must qualify.irmly in the thoughts of McLaren.
