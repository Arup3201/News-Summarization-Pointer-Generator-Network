Google's Glass has come under fire for its ability to take pictures and record video anywhere - but a new video reveals just how tough it can be to get the perfect shot.

The 'Google Glass Photographer' comedy video, produced by online education start-up Grovo, a hapless Glass user trying to to capture a wedding, a gig, a piano recital and even a group photograph.

Each picture is accompanied by a series of increasingly bizarre stances.

The wedding photographer: Taking closeups of the happy couple can prove to be a little intrusive

'Here's someone you'll be seeing in a few months: the Google Glass photographer,' the firm says in the introduction to the video.

'Nature shots, concerts, time-lapse videos, weddings...the Google Glass photographer does it all.'

The photography video comes days after website Mashable produced a similar comedy video, an etiquette guide to wearing the glasses.

The Etiquette video starts with a reminder to those smug people currently wearing 
the glasses that they aren’t suddenly smarter than everyone else just 
because they can access the entire internet on a small screen directly 
in front of their right eye.

Capturing video of cars could be potentially dangerous

Another piece of advice worth reminding Glass wearers is that the device
doesn’t suddenly increase their attractiveness and in fact a lot of 
people may be creeped out if they're approached by someone who could be 
secretly filming or photographing them.

Although the £1,000 gadget is not
yet publicly available, it has sparked a huge debate over privacy and
the future of wearable computers.

An intimate concert: Capturing your favourite musicians can prove difficult with Glass

The emergence of Glass has also led to the term 'Glasshole', which is used frequently in the comments section of the latest photography video.

It comes amid warnings today of the potential risks of Glass.

The revolutionary 'wearable computer' could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity and distract wearers to the point where they miss things which are 'utterly obvious', researchers say.

Daniel J. Simons, is a professor of psychology and advertising at the University of Illinois and Christopher F. Chabris, is a professor of psychology at Union College.

In a piece for the New York Times, the two experts examine the dangers the real-time digital distraction could pose.

They write: '...most agree that a smartphone-linked display and camera placed in the corner of your vision is intriguing and potentially revolutionary — and like us, they want to try it.

'But Glass may inadvertently disrupt a crucial cognitive capacity, with potentially dangerous consequences.'

Getting close to nature: Taking closeups of nature can be tricky with a head mounted camera

Earlier this year Sergey Brin, one of Google’s founders, said safety had actually been a motivation for the new product.

He said: 'We questioned whether you should be walking around looking down at a smartphone.'

He said designers wanted to make something that freed both the hands and the eyes.

But the professors say when the mind is engaged, wearers could fail to see something that would 'otherwise be utterly obvious.'

They write: 'Google Glass may allow users to do amazing things, but it 
does not abolish the limits on the human ability to pay attention.'

The hilarious attempts to capture a group photograph show the wearer having to squat in the middle of a road

Google is already facing a growing backlash over its ‘Glass’ eyewear, 
with cafe owners in the US banning the technology from their premises.

Dave Meinert, who runs the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, said those wearing 
the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in.

He has put up a sign on the wall which reads: ‘Respect our customers’ privacy as we’d expect them to respect yours.’

The move comes after it emerged people wearing Google Glass could be 
banned from American cinemas, casinos and even parks because owners 
don’t want filming there.
