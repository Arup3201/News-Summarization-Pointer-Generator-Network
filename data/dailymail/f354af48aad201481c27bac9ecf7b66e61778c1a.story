Vance McAllister, the conservative Christian congressman who was caught on video kissing a female staffer, has turned to Willie Robertson, one of the stars of the smash 'Duck Dynasty,' for guidance.

Robertson's advice to the Republican lawmaker was straightforward.

'Willie told me that he was a friend and that I needed to work things out privately,' McAllister told the News Star.

McAllister had been in seclusion in his Louisiana district since the video of McAllister and a female staffer kissing in his district office was leaked on Monday. He has said he has no plans to resign.

McAllister and Robertson, who is CEO of the highly successful duck call maker Duck Commander, are not strangers. When McAlister was running for his seat last year,  he sought — and received — and endorsement from Mr. Robertson.

Some pundits believe the endorsement of Robertson and other members of the Robertson family was critical to his political success, according to abcnews.com. The Robertsons even filmed campaign commercials for McAllister's campaign.

And when McAllister, who is in his first term, needed someone to join him for President Obama's State of the Union Address, he sent an invitation to Mr. Robertson, who accepted.

McAllister said that he has not reached out to Phil Robertson, Willie's father, who founded Duck Commander. The elder Robertson was himself the focus of controversy last year after made comments about homosexuality in an interview with GQ magazine.

Earlier today, McAllister, requested an FBI investigation today into the breach which led to a surveillance tape being leaked from his office. McAllister and his now former staffer, Melissa Peacock, are seen kissing in the darkened office. Peacock has 'voluntarily' resigned from her position.

McAllister's chief of staff Adam Terry said on Wednesday that the Louisiana congressman will send a letter to House Speaker John Boehner asking that the leak from his Monroe district office be investigated at a federal level.

Both McAllister and Peacock are married. McAllister has five children, while Peacock has one. Peacock's husband, Heath, said the congressman has ruined his life and marriage.
