Madeleine McCann's family say they 'would welcome' a fresh search of a man-made lake close to the holiday resort where the three-year-old was taken, amid claims her body may have been dumped there. 

A rain-sodden letter reportedly discovered outside the room from which she vanished on the first anniversary of her disappearance contained details of what it claimed was her final resting place.

A handyman who discovered the note is said to have immediately handed it to the Portuguese police, but it is understood that a full underwater search of the Barragem da Bravura reservoir - which lies nine miles from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz - has never been carried out.

Despite the claims made in the letter, there remains no evidence to suggest Madeleine is dead, and her parents Gerry and Kate McCann still cling to the hope that she will one day be found alive.

The letter containing allegations relating to Madeleine's disappearance was discovered by a handyman on the rain-soaked doorstep of the Ocean Club's room 5A - the room from which Madeleine went missing - according to the Mirror.

It was found on the the night of May 3, 2008 - a year to the day of Madeleine's disappearance.

The letter is understood to have been headed 'Madeleine Beth McCann' but otherwise written in Portuguese. It reportedly started with a description of her being dumped in the Barragem da Bravura reservoir which it described as her 'final resting place'.

'I spoke to the other staff about it and they said to hand it in to the Portuguese police. I gave it to them, but I have no idea what they did about it,' the handyman told the newspaper.

He went on to describe Barragem da Bravura as 'the perfect place to hide a body'.

Search: A spokesperson for Kate and Gerry McCann said they would 'welcome' any new searches of the Barragem da Bravura and the surrounding woodland

 The woodland area surrounding the reservoir is understood to have been searched several months before the emergence of the letter but no underwater investigation was carried out.

Following the discovery of the note, a two-hour second search was carried out using sniffer dogs, but eyewitnesses reportedly claim that police divers were still not deployed. 

A spokesperson for Kate and Gerry McCann said they would 'welcome' any new searches of the Barragem da Bravura and the surrounding woodland.

Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry will be informed of what this witness is telling the Daily Mirror.

'We would welcome any new searches. But they cannot comment on any specific detail as that is entirely a matter for Operation Grange and the Portuguese authorities.' 

Investigation: Robert Murat pictured in Praia da Luz, in August 2007. Mr Murat has said he would have no problem speaking to police again if they wished

Last week a Portuguese newspaper claimed that police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann want to question British ex-pat Robert Murat.

Scotland Yard detectives want to speak to several potential witnesses including Mr Murat, who was previously questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished in 2007 just before her fourth birthday, the newspaper Jornal de Noticias reported.

Mr Murat, 41, who has always denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, said neither he nor his lawyer had been contacted by police, but said he would co-operate if contacted.

Mr Murat was named as an arguido – a person of interest or suspect - during the Portuguese investigation seven years ago, as were Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann.

All three were later cleared when the Portuguese investigation ended in 2008.

Scotland Yard launched its own investigation and its inquiry team travelled to Praia da Luz to conduct searches and observe Portuguese police interviews.
