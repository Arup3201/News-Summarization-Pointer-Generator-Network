Against a backdrop of a tumbling Big Ben and Houses of Parliament, a grinning ISIS commander has been taunting Britain with his plans to launch an attack on the West.

Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, has issued the image as part of a campaign to intimidate Britain.

It features two bearded fighters with their hands shading their eyes, looking at London as it burns in a ball of computer generated flames.

The warning comes as the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets.'

Militant: Al-Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies

International: Abu Omar al-Shishani heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English

ISIS followers are known to have planned attacks in Britain and Europe, although the degree to which they are directed by the high command has been unclear. 

The language used in the latest video, which shows the head of US aid worker Peter Kassig, suggests they are planning attacks outside their borders.

The new imagery, posted on the internet by Chechen fighters serving with ISIS and entitled “Omar Shishani in London,” reinforces the idea that the group now has global ambitions similar to al-Qaeda.

Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen, is pictured grinning in the bottom right of the image. He heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the Russian-backed hardline leader of the Chechen Republic, announced that Shishani had been killed by posting a picture on Instagram last Thursday, although the death remains unconfirmed and he gave no location.

Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies.

He is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, a British father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he drove a dumper truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison in a suicide attack in February.

His other followers included Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, from North London, who was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin, and had fought in that conflict in 2011 before moving on to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work.

Abu Omar al-Shishani is a nom de-guerre which refers to his Chechen origins. His real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, 28, and he is a former sergeant in the Georgian Army.

He was born to an Orthodox Christian father and Muslim mother and brought up in the Pankisi Gorge, an ethnically Chechen area of North East Georgia, where he worked as a shepherd before joining the army when he left school.

He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis.

After recuperating and being refused reenlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010.

Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012, to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict.

He became the commander of a group of hardened Chechen fighters known as Katibat al-Muhajireen [Emigrants Brigade] which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra.

The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council.

Terror: Abu Omar al-Shishani's warning comes after Jihadi John (pictured) warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets' 

Sick: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image is not the first time ISIS has taunted the West by threatening to attack a landmark. A chilling threat was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to the extremist group. The images were taken outside the White House and Chicago's Old Republic Building

In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo.

Units under his command have participated in major assaults on Syrian military bases in and around Aleppo, including the capture of Menagh Airbase in August 2013.

Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said: 'Omar al-Shishani is the most prominent of the Caucasian fighters alongside ISIS and is seen as the leader of the foreign fighter brigades.

'He has a long history of conflict which has given him a prominent role amongst the ISIS foreign fighter brigades.

'We have seen how Brits and other Europeans have often been marshalled under his wing and the result is that he is elevated to be a figure of great significance in the mythology around the group and what it is doing, in particular in the imagery and videos they release.

'While his skills and abilities have been called into question by others, he has undeniably become the most prominent of the so-called Chechen fighters in Syria.'
