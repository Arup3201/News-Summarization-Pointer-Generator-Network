A three-week-old baby has died after his grandmother allegedly fell asleep on top of him on a sofa while drunk.  

Police believe that the 55-year-old had been watching television and drinking alcohol when she dropped off and smothered the baby - named as George Charnock. 

His grandmother, who has not been named, was looking after him for his mother, Emily Charnock, at the time in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Tragedy: A three-week-old baby has died after his grandmother allegedly fell asleep and smothered him while drunk at a home in this Oldham street

Police and paramedics were called to a house on Lychgate Court, in Oldham's Holts estate, in the early hours of Friday.

Baby George was rushed to hospital but medics were unable to revive him.

His grandmother was arrested later at hospital on suspicion of causing the baby's death by overlaying.

Overlaying is the offence of suffocating a child aged under three while asleep with them when intoxicated. 

MailIOnline understands that the tragedy happened on a living room sofa.

The woman has now been released on police bail while investigations continue. 

An inquest will be opened and adjourned at a later date.
