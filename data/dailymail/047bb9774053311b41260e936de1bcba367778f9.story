Health experts have condemned the new GPs contract which means doctors don't have ask patients how much exercise they do.

British Medical Association officials were accused of ignoring the 'wonder drug' of fresh air which saved lives and treated dozens of diseases with no side-effects.

The doctors' union claimed the question was one of a number of bureaucratic tasks leaving less time for patients.

Exercise: GPs no longer to ask patients how often they do physical activity after a questionnaire was removed from their contracts sparking a row

But leading charity Macmillan Cancer Support said the move might send a message that physical activity was unimportant while chief medical officer Jane Maher described exercise as a 'wonder drug.'

The row erupted after an email from a BMA official celebrated the removal from the contract of the General Practice Physicial Activity Questionnaire, the Sunday Independent reported.

The paper quoted the note: 'No more GPPAQ questionnaires asking ill 
patients how many hours they cook or garden; GPs can be clinicians 
diagnosing depression rather than ticking the box for a bio-social 
assessment.'

One health expert blamed 'fuddy-duddy' doctors for an over-reliance on drugs, while William Bird, an expert on physical activity, accused the BMA of acting as a 'block to getting GPs to encourage patients do more exercise.

Healthy: fresh air has been described as a 'wonder drug' which treats dozens of diseases with no harmful side-effects

He told the paper: 'For the BMA to dismiss it [exercise] and
almost to laugh at it with the email … it just makes you feel a bit fed
up. They haven't grasped the one thing that could have a huge impact on
outcomes.'

Mr Bird, a GP, said activity levels were 'more important than any other 
risk factor', including smoking. 'Some GPs are really keen, [but] you 
have this block usually in the BMA, where this evidence doesn't seem to 
have percolated through – or, if it has, they don't know how to deal 
with it.'

Exercise even proved effective in 
treating breast cancer, he said. 'Gardening may look a bit trivial but 
that physical activity could save that women's life.'

Treatment: BMA chiefs have been accused of acting as a 'block' to getting GPS to talk to patients about exercise

He revealed he had spoken to 180 London doctors since 2012 and not one of the them knew the recommended guidelines for exercise was at least 150 minutes a week.

In a major study published last month in the BMJ journal, research showed that exercise could be considered a 'viable alternative' to drugs given for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke.

The BMA told the Telegraph it did believe in the benefits of exercise and that doctors would promote it to patients when deemed necessary.

A spokesman for the BMA said that a 'large amount of bureaucracy and box-ticking' introduced last year meant less time talking to patients. Removing these requirements did not mean downplaying the importance of aspects of them, simply that they became a matter for a GP's judgement.

NHS England, which negotiated the new contract with the BMA, said: 'The benefits of exercise are not in doubt. The changes are designed to reduce overly prescriptive bureaucracy and free up time for GPs to use their judgement.'
