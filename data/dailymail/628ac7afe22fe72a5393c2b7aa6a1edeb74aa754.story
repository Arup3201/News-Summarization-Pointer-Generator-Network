Manchester City are considering a summer move for Newcastle's Cheick Tiote.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini wants a top quality defensive midfielder to bolster his squad and has been impressed by Tiote since his arrival in England.

The 27-year-old Ivory Coast star is a fiery character who has drawn admiring glances from the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United since signing from FC Twente in 2010.

Middle man: Newcastle's Cheick Tiote has tempted Manchester City into lining up a summer swoop

Familiar face: City midfielder Yaya Toure is a team-mate of Tiote on international duty with the Ivory Coast

He was particularly impressive in Newcastle's 2-0 defeat by City at St James' Park last month, when he was unfortunate to have a goal disallowed, and also caught the eye with a lung-busting performance against Manchester United at Old Trafford earlier in the season.

City have been weighing up the likes of Fernando at Porto and Victor Wanyama at Southampton but Tiote is emerging as their preferred option.

He has a proven Premier League pedigree, has performed well in Europe and has a good understanding with international team-mate and friend Yaya Toure.

I want you: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is planning a summer recruitment drive

Although Javi Garcia has shown signs of 
why City shelled out £17million for him of late, they still want someone
 with greater consistency and quality.

City remain keen on England and Southampton left back Luke Shaw, as do Chelsea and Manchester United, and will look to add a goalkeeper, centre back and possibly a striker depending on departures.

Inter Milan are among several clubs interested in Edin Dzeko and the Bosnian will weigh up his options at the end of the season.

Newcastle would not sell Tiote cheaply but they also anticipate a summer of change with the likes of Papiss Cisse, Shola Ameobi and Mathieu Debuchy either ready to leave or subject to interest from other clubs.

Defender Steven Taylor is a possible target for Steve Bruce at Hull City.Young Saint Sims impresses Premier League big guns

Premier League scouts are out in force at the Algarve Tournament in Portugal this week.

Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool were among those represented as they watched England defeat Holland 2-0 in Lagos on Wednesday with Southampton winger Josh Sims impressing on his debut, scoring one goal and setting up the other for Tottenham's Joshua Onomah.

High hopes: Southampton youngster Josh Sims has looked good on England duty in Portugal

Grabbing his chance: Fulham kid Patrick Roberts is also attracting attention with his England displays

Fulham's Patrick Roberts and 16-year-old midfielder Taylor Moore, who was born in Walthamstow, east London but plays for Lens in France, are also attracting attention.

Chief recruitment officer Geoff Watson was there for Manchester United and is assessing talent from other countries too.

England play hosts Portugal on Friday before facing Germany on Sunday.

Williams leaving Palace for Ipswich

Ipswich Town are taking Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams on loan.

The 20-year-old Wales man has played nine Premier League games this season but manager Tony Pulis wants him to gain more game time elsewhere.

Cardiff have considered a move for the Wales international should they stay up this season while several Championship sides have also made enquiries but Mick McCarthy has persuaded Williams to move to East Anglia for a month initially.

Blake hoping for Brum deal

Former Crystal Palace defender Darcy Blake is training with Birmingham City.

The 25-year-old left Palace by mutual consent last month after only making 10 appearances during his 18-month spell there.

The Wales international is hopeful of impressing Lee Clark and earning a short term deal.

Millwall are looking at Alex Tayo Akande.

The 25-year-old Nigerian striker is playing for Kitchee in the Hong Kong first division but manager Ian Holloway knows him from his days at Blackpool where Akande spent two weeks on trial.

The Seasiders, meanwhile, have signed right back Kevin Foley on loan from Wolves.

Toffees win Kinsella race

Got him: Roberto Martinez has won the race to sign teenager Stephen Kinsella from Templeogue United

Everton
 have beaten off competition from Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and 
Manchester United to sign Irish prospect Stephen Kinsella.

Manager
 Roberto Martinez made a personal visit to the 15-year-old's family in 
Dublin to convince the Ireland Under 17 winger to sign a 
scholarship deal with Everton ahead of next season.

Kinsella plays for Dublin-based Templeogue United and hopes to follow 
the progress made by Everton full back Seamus Coleman.

Everton
 academy manager Alan Irvine told evertonfc.com: 'I am delighted Stephen
 will be joining us.

'He is a very talented player who was wanted by many
 other clubs and who has decided to come to Everton.

'He’s a winger who has the ability to go past players and we are very much looking forward to working with him.'

Barca set to tie up Valdes replacement Ter Stegen

Barcelona expect to finalise a deal for Borussia Monchengladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen after reports that he underwent a not-so-secret medical earlier this week.

Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes is leaving at the end of the season and has an agreement with Monaco although there is interest from other clubs including some in the Premier League.

Going: Victor Valdes is set to leave Barcelona

Coming: Barca have lined up Marc-Andre Ter Stegen

Spanish media have reported that Valdes can escape any agreement with Monaco if a small compensation fee is paid by any other suitor he agrees to join.

Barcelona attacking midfielder Bojan Krkic, who is currently on loan at Ajax, has been linked with a move to Liverpool but they are unlikely to pursue a deal as they look for better quality.

Lambert looking at £5m Odjidja-Ofoe

Aston Villa are maintaining a watching brief on former Everton target Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe at Club Brugge.

The 25-year-old Belgium midfielder was close to signing for David Moyes at Everton only for red tape to block the first loan move and the clubs failed to agree on a fee six months later.

Paul Lambert is keen to strengthen his midfield and Brugge would sell for around £5m.
