David Cameron last night joked that ‘assassination’ would be a ‘welcome release’ from the pressure of keeping Scotland in the UK – as the battle over independence raged ahead of tomorrow’s vote.

The Prime Minister made the crass remarks at a  Downing Street gathering last night as the polls showed Scotland’s future in the Union hanging by a thread.

Mr Cameron also decided against a last-minute campaign trip north of the border today – leaving his former adversary Gordon Brown to do the heavy lifting for the ‘No’ campaign while he dropped off his children at school and  visited a factory in Hampshire to highlight Britain’s plummeting unemployment.

The PM has been forced to defend his handling of the independence debate amid criticism that he has given Alex Salmond an easy ride – only venturing to Scotland a handful of times to campaign against separation.

He said had no regrets about allowing Mr Salmond a referendum, but added that he was 'passionate' about keeping the Union together and revealed he had 'of course' suffered sleepless nights over the break up of Great Britain.

Mr Cameron will face intense pressure over his stewardship of the Union if the Yes campaign emerges victorious on Friday morning.

Speaking last night at a charity event attended by the BBC broadcaster Andrew Marr, Mr Cameron admitted the pressure of his job was intense.

At the reception – in which Mr Marr was handing out copies of his novel featuring a Prime Minister who is assassinated – Mr Cameron said: ‘I have to say that after the events I’ve been facing over the past few days assassination would be a welcome release.’

Mr Cameron used the final day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s crunch referendum to visit a factory in Hampshire run by the prominent Scottish ‘No’ campaigner Keith Cochrane.

Mr Cochrane is the chief executive one of Scotland’s biggest manufacturing companies Weir – which has not ruled out relocating its headquarters to England in the event of a Yes vote.

At the visit today Mr Cameron insisted he would not resign in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote tomorrow.

‘My name is not on the ballot paper,’ he said. ‘What's on the ballot paper is 'does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom, or does Scotland want to separate itself from the United Kingdom?

‘That's the only question that will be decided on Thursday night. The question about my future will be decided at the British general election coming soon.’

It came after Mr Cameron acknowledged his unpopularity in Scotland in a speech on Monday.

He said: ‘If you don’t like me – I won’t be here forever. If you don’t like this Government – it won’t last forever. But if you leave the UK – that will be forever.’

Mr Cameron is facing growing pressure from his own party of the plan to hand Scotland more powers over tax and welfare in the event of a ‘No’ vote.

But the PM said: ‘The Conservative Party and all our backbenchers want to see the United Kingdom survive and thrive.

‘Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous.

‘But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds.’

Polls continue to suggest that the referendum contest is going down to the wire, with three separate surveys last night all putting support for No narrowly ahead on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent for Yes.

With the opinion polls on a knife-edge, there is dismay among Tory MPs at the prospect of a possible Yes vote.

The Prime Minister admitted that he was feeling ‘nervous’ ahead of the vote, but insisted that he was confident about the case for a No vote.

‘Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous,’ he said.

‘But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds - a successful economy with a growing number of jobs ... combined with the ability of Scots if they vote No to have even more powers and even more say over how to run their own affairs in Scotland.’

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said he was confident voters would back independence when they go to the polls.

Speaking on a visit to an engineering firm in Stewarton, Ayrshire, the SNP leader said: ‘My confidence is based on what's happening in the streets and communities around Scotland, I think there's a very substantial movement towards yes because people understand this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the future of this country into our hands.’

But former PM Mr Brown said: ‘The vote tomorrow is not about whether Scotland is a nation - we are, yesterday, today and tomorrow.

‘It's not about whether there is a Scottish Parliament - we have it. It's not about whether there are increased powers, we are all agreed to increase the powers.

‘The vote tomorrow is whether you want to break and sever every link, and I say let's keep our UK pensions, let's keep our UK pound, let's keep our UK passports, let's keep our UK welfare state.

‘What we have built together, by sacrificing and sharing, let no narrow nationalism split asunder ever.’
