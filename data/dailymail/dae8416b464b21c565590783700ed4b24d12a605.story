Police are investigating after a man's body was found at the bottom of an NFL player's swimming pool after a Labor Day party.

The body of Engram Lamar Crenshaw, 37, from Katy, Texas, was pulled out of the pool at the home of Houston Texan Antonio Smith.

Police were called to the $1million, five-acre property at around 9.30am on Sunday morning after fellow guests had found the dead man.

Mr Crenshaw, who was fully clothed when he was found, is believed to have been a personal friend of Mr Smith.

Fort Bend County authorities are now investigating the drowning, although no foul play is suspected.

Fort Bend County sheriff’s spokesman Bob Haenel said an autopsy has been ordered. It is likely to be carried out on Monday.

Mr Smith, 29, advertised the pool party several times on Twitter, saying: ‘Hot and sunny out at 94's paradise ranch cowboy boots ninja mask and speedo's.'

Law enforcement officials said that about 100 people attended the party, and 25 of them stayed at the house overnight.

The victim was reportedly last seen alive at about 2am.

Mr Haenel said: 'All I know is they had a party last night and they found a guy at the bottom of the pool this morning.'

Captain James Burger from the Sheriff's Office said: 'There were no abrasions and no evidence of physical injuries to his body.'

'He was not dressed to be swimming in the pool, I can say that,' he added, according to USA Today.

'Apparently he stayed out there by himself. In the morning, when people woke up and went outside, they discovered him in the pool.'

Mr Smith’s home is located just north of Richmond, a suburb of Houston. As well as a swimming pool, it has a man-made lake at the front.

He is about to begin his third season with the Texans.

In a statement to the Chronicle, the team said: 'We're aware of the situation. We're gathering facts and will have no further comment at this time.'

The team is scheduled to open their season on September 11 against the Indianapolis Colts.

The Texans signed Smith in 2009 on a five-year, $35 million contract that included a $12.5 million signing bonus.

He played five years with the Arizona Cardinals before joining the Texans.
