Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho could have breached his BT ambassador contract by his surprise appearance on rival network Sky's Goals on Sunday.

Mourinho used the programme to make a 27-minute attack on referee Martin Atkinson's performance in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley culminating in Nemanja Matic's sending off following Ashley Barnes's horror tackle.

And Mourinho choosing Sky - whom he wasn't speaking to a few weeks ago following their comments about Diego Costa - to make such a controversial TV appearance naturally infuriated BT.

Mourinho is lucratively paid to represent BT and his deal stipulates that he can only appear on other networks when his Chelsea club work demands - such as Premier League, Capital One Cup, FA Cup and Champions League commitments or when the club insist on other occasions.

BT, who are more annoyed with Mourinho's representatives than Jose himself, are considering what action to take as a consequence. But it is likely to be resolved with Mourinho doing extra work for BT to compensate for their upset,

Mourinho's camp are saying that Chelsea ordered him to go on the programme, but Goals on Sunday co-host Chris Kamara claimed on Twitter that Mourinho had been promising to come on the show for some time and contacted him last Saturday.

A Chelsea spokesman said that it was a joint decision between the club and Mourinho made after the game against Burnley.

After Chelsea's game against Burnley, Jose Mourinho listed four minutes; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong. Here, Sportsmail looks at them: 

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

33 - Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty.

43 - Diego Costa goes to ground after  Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been  soft.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.
