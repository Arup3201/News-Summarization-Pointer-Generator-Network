 A Seattle man who was recently released from prison for offering to pay an undercover police officer for sex with a 13-year-old girl has been caught by the same detective for a near-identical crime.

Thomas Rutledge Spencer - who also goes by the name Howard Kivley - finished a three and a half year sentence for attempted child molestation earlier this year.

Now King County prosecutors claim the 65-year-old placed an advertisement online expressing his desire for a 'daddy-daughter' sexual arrangement with a young girl, according to Seattle P-I.

Spencer is alleged to have sent several graphic emails to an undercover detective in which he offered to pay $50 for sex with a 15-year-old girl.

Re-offender: Thomas Rutledge Spencer, 65, was allegedly caught trying to pay to have sex with a child straight after serving a three and a half year prison sentence for the same crime

In October 2010 he was caught responding to an ad posted by the same detective, who was posing as a parent attempting to pimp out a 13-year-old child.

Two hours after the detective posted the ad, Spencer was in contact offering to pay for sex with the child.

He sent hundreds of emails to the detective graphically describing what he hoped to do to the child.

Spencer was arrested after meeting with the detective.

He failed two polygraph tests when asked whether he’d molested children.

Spencer was jailed and ultimately convicted, but he was released after serving the minimum term of 40 months, despite an evaluator ruling him unfit for post-release treatment.

Now he is accused of advertising himself as a man looking for a mother willing to let him have sex with her daughter.

The detective responded and set up a meeting with Spencer.

He was arrested as he arrived at the location.

'This defendant poses an extreme danger to the community as he is an untreated sex offender who has been caught twice in four years attempting to have sex with young girls,' Senior Deputy Prosecutor Carla Carlstrom said in court papers.

Spencer has been charged with attempted commercial sexual abuse of a minor.

He also faces revocation of his parole and could be held indefinitely

He has been remanded without bail.
