Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to prevent convicted rapist Ched Evans from returning to play for his former club Sheffield United.

The former Wales international was jailed for five-years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire - but is now preparing to be released from prison within days.

Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor had stated that the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to the game, saying: 'I didn't know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can't do anything.' 

Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence

Tony Adams - Was miles over the drink-drive limit when he crashed his car into a wall in 1990 and spent 57 days in prison. After release, captained Arsenal and England with distinction.

Lee Hughes - Served three years for causing death by dangerous driving in 2003. Played for Oldham and Port Vale among others following his release.

Joey Barton - Was imprisoned for 77 days in 2008 after being convicted of assault outside a McDonald's. Now playing for QPR.

Duncan Ferguson - Jailed in 1994 for headbutting an opponent on the pitch, he went on to become an Everton hero.

Jermaine Pennant - Another drink-driving conviction, the winger spent 30 days in prison then became the first Premier League player to take to the field wearing an electronic tag.

However, 101,917 people have disagreed by signing the petition - while a counter petition by fans wishing to see Evans back at the League One club has attracted less than 5,000 names.

Jean Hatchet, who started a charge.org petition, told the Daily Mirror: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before.

'Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd re-sign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans.

'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that the importance of gaining a woman's consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.'

Evans arrived at the Blades for £3million in 2009, but was released along with 10 other players shortly after his conviction  

The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction.
