Arsenal fans desperate to see Joel Campbell grace the Emirates turf this season were given a shock when the striker posed with a Santos shirt on Wednesday.

The Costa Rica international has helped his side to unexpectedly reach the World Cup quarter-finals where they face Holland on Saturday.

And, having scored against Uruguay in Costa Rica’s opening match, the striker is expected to return to Arsenal for pre-season.

And... relax: Arsene Wenger has confirmed the Costa Rica striker will return to Arsenal after the tournament

Gunners fans need not fear that the 22-year-old has decided on a switch to Brazil as he was most likely just getting into the spirit of things at the World Cup - where even Lionel Messi has posed with a Corinthians shirt after all.

Campbell signed for Arsenal three years ago but has spent the entire time out on loan, with Wenger feeling he was not ready for first team football at Arsenal.

He sent him first to Lorient in France, then Real Betis in Spain and most recently to Greek champions Olympiacos, where he impressed against Manchester United in the Champions League.

Campbell's performances in Brazil led the Arsenal manager to confirm the striker would return to the club for pre-season and be contention for a place in the squad for the approaching campaign.

‘He will definitely come back to us for pre-season,’ Wenger told Sportsmail. ‘He is maturing well.’

AC Milan have also expressed an interest in taking Campbell on loan if negotiations develop with Arsenal over Mario Balotelli.
