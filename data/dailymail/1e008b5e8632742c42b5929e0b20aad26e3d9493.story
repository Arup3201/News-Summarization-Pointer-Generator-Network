Martin Odegaard only made his debut for Real Madrid Castilla at the weekend but the most talked about teenager in football was back training with Cristiano Ronaldo and Co this week.

The 16-year-old Norway international entered the fray as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao B during the Segunda Division Group II clash at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium to make his official bow in the famous white strip.

But Odegaard was back in the big time midweek when he was pictured training with Carlo Ancelotti's first-team squad as they prepare for Saturday's La Liga match against Deportivo La Coruna at the Bernabeu.

Real will be keen to bounce back from last weekend's humiliating derby defeat at the hands Atletico Madrid as Los Blancos's lead at the top was cut to just a single point following Barcelona's win on Sunday.

Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and the rest of the Real Galacticos were given a training ground dressing-down earlier in the week by club president Florentino Perez in the wake of that defeat.

But it was training as usual on Wednesday as the players were put through their paces ahead of the weekend's fixture.

Meanwhile, Real Madrid's £328million plans to redevelop their Santiago Bernabeu have hit yet another snag after a ruling by the High Court of Madrid overturned the approval of plans that included updates to the stadium.

Perez revealed the vision for the new Bernabeu to be 'the best stadium in the world' last January along with mock-ups for the 400million euro works.

The three-year project would include a revamped exterior, a retractable roof and increase its capacity to 85,454 to 90,000, along with a hotel and shopping centre complex alongside, but Tuesday's ruling has put a spanner in the works.
