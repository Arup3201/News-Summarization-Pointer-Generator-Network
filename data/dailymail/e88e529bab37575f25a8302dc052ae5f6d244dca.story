A service for K-9s and their handlers has taken place in Palm Harbor, Florida, to honour police dogs who have died since their retirement.

Five German Shepherds, named Vader, Jester, Deuce, Thor and Judge were remembered during the service at the Curlew Hills Memorial Gardens Pet Cemetery where the animals are buried.

Tributes were also paid to a sixth yellow Labrador, called Sirius, who is not buried at the cemetery, but was the only service dog to die on 9/11.

Police K-9s and their handlers have attended a service in Palm Harbor, Florida, to honour former service dogs

The service paid tribute to five German Shepherds, Vader, Jester, Deuce, Thor and Judge who are commemorated with a plaque each, along with Sirius, a yellow Labrador who died during 9/11

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Keenan Knopke, the cemetery's president, said: 'These are officers, really, that serve the public well. They need to be remembered in the correct fashion.'

During the service, each of the dog's former handlers gave a short speech about the exploits of their partners.

In a poignant tribute to his bomb-sniffing dog Vader, Pinellas Deputy Rick Tapia said: 'I'm sure at some point in my career that dog saved my life.'

Vader served the sheriff's office from 2002-2009, Jester also served in Pinellas from 2004-2011 along with Deuce, who served from 2004-2010.

Dodge was a Clearwater police dog from 2003-2007, whike Thor, served as a Pinellas County unit member from 1974-1977 and 1981-1983.

Dozens of current and former handlers, some of them with their dogs, attended the service, which included a sermon by Rev. Danny McDonald and a performance of Amazing Grace on bagpipes.

While in service, the dogs honored helped to locate explosives, narcotics and missing children.
