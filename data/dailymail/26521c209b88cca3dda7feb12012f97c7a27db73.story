Worried: The girl has gone to court after her family allegedly scheduled her a birth centre appointment to have an abortion (file picture)

A pregnant 14-year-old girl has gone to court after her family allegedly scheduled her a birth centre appointment to have an abortion.

She claims her adult cousins, whom she lives with in Corpus Christi, Texas, stopped her going to school and threatened to beat her up.

Judge Missy Medary has barred the girl’s family from forcing her to make any decisions on the abortion until at least Thursday next week.

‘One family member threw her into the car on her stomach, and said: "I'm going to beat you until you decide otherwise”,’ her lawyer told ABC News.

Stephen Casey added that he wants his client to be protected and ‘assert her rights’ to avoid her being physically or emotionally harmed.

The girl's grandmother Carmen Pantoja has denied the allegations against her family but admitted that she did suggest an abortion.

‘I advised her to have it,’ Ms Pantoja told ABC News. ‘That's not the same as forcing her. Nobody forced her do anything.’

The girl secretly texted the pro-life legal group Texas Center for the Defense of Life when she was seven weeks pregnant.

Ruling: State District Judge Missy Medary heard the case and appointed a guardian for the girl while also passing two temporary injunctions

Now she is 10 weeks pregnant and living with relatives of the father of her unborn baby, who will back any decision she makes, reported ABC News.

The couple have not yet decided whether the baby should be put up for adoption but have agreed she should still give birth.

State District Judge Missy Medary heard the case and appointed a guardian for the girl while also passing two temporary injunctions.

She banned the girl’s family from getting her to make reproductive decisions until at least a hearing on January 19, reported ABC News.

But Ms Pantoja said she will now not stop her granddaughter from giving birth. ‘She's going to have her baby,’ she told ABC News. ‘It's OK.’
