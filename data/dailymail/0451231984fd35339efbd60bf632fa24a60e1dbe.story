It is a controversial illness that many believe to be a malady of the mind.

But chronic fatigue syndrome is a 'real and serious disease' that needs proper diagnosis, doctors have said. 

As a result, the condition needs a new name - and there should be a straightforward way to diagnose it, they added. 

The comments came from the Institute of Medicine, a prestigious government advisory group in the U.S.

Chronic fatigue isn't all in the mind, a panel of leading US medical experts has declared. It has now set out five main symptoms as simple criteria for doctors to use in making a diagnosis

The federal government asked the independent organisation to investigate the state of chronic fatigue diagnosis after it was flooded with stories by patients who were misdiagnosed or even dismissed by sceptical doctors.

Yesterday, the IOM panel sought to redefine chronic fatigue syndrome, setting five main symptoms as simple criteria for doctors to use in making a diagnosis.

Experts also called for a new name for the condition, because many patients feel the term 'chronic fatigue' belittles their suffering.

Instead, they argue it should be called Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease, or SEID, to reflect that symptoms worsen after exertion.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is also know as ME.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is also know as ME.

The condition affects between one and four million people in the US and millions more worldwide - and the combination of symptoms can devastate a patient's life for decades.

Jose Montoya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a leading expert in CFS, has previously described the condition as 'one of the greatest scientific and medical challenges of our time'.

He said: 'Its symptoms often include not only overwhelming fatigue but also:

Joint and muscle pain

Incapacitating headaches

Food intolerance

Sore throat/enlarged lymph nodes

Gastrointestinal problems

Abnormal blood-pressure and heart-rate events

Hypersensitivity to light, noise or other sensations

The condition affects between one and four million in the US and millions more worldwide - and the combination of symptoms can devastate a patient's life for decades.

Its hallmark is persistent and profound fatigue where, on a bad day, a simple activity like grocery shopping can put someone to bed. 

It is often accompanied by memory problems or other symptoms. 

These include joint and muscle pain, incapacitating headaches, food intolerance, a sore throat or enlarged lymph nodes and sensitivity to light.

However there is no specific treatment and the IOM found less than a third of medical schools teach about the disease.

'Chronic fatigue is not a figment of patients' imagination,' said Dr Ellen Wright Clayton of Vanderbilt University's Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, who chaired the IOM panel.

'These patients have real symptoms. They deserve real care. 

'It is not appropriate to dismiss these patients by saying, "I am chronically fatigued, too".'

She added: 'People shouldn't wander around in the wilderness for years trying to get a diagnosis.'

Under the new proposals from the IOM, diagnosing chronic fatigue would require three core symptoms:

These are:

* Fatigue and a reduction in activity that lasts for more than six months

* Fatigue that gets worse after exertion

* Sleep that is unrefreshing despite exhaustion

Patients must also have at least one other symptom of the following:

* Cognitive impairment, sometimes described as 'brain fog'

* What's called orthostatic intolerance - meaning symptoms improve when lying down and patients find it hard to stay upright for long.

Dr Lucinda Bateman, of the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City, said: 'We are hoping that these diagnostic criteria provide a very clear path,' she said. 'It's a fresh start.'

There are ways to treat some of the symptoms, if doctors make a diagnosis, said added. 

To spread the word, committee members are writing about the diagnostic criteria in several medical journals, and the institute's web site, www.iom.edu, will eventually post a guide for doctors. 

Patients have long sought a change to a name they say belittles their suffering. Some groups already had begun using another term -  myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME.

The new report rejected that option, saying not all patients have the muscle pain and brain or spinal cord inflammation that medical jargon reflects.

'This is a defining moment for the disease,' said Carol Head of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative, the largest advocacy organisation for the condition in the US. 

Beyond improving diagnosis, the government-funded report should spur more research to understand and treat the disease, she said.

It's too soon to know if the new name will catch on, but including the word 'disease' instead of 'syndrome' is an improvement, Head added.

'Having called this serious disease by an inappropriate and frankly insulting name is one of the factors that kept doctors, friends, family members, even employers from affording it the seriousness it deserves,' she said. 

The recommendations mark 'a critical step toward assisting medical providers in making a diagnosis for those with this serious and debilitating illness,' said Dr Nancy Lee, of the HHS Office on Women's Health. 

She added the government would review the recommendations.

Last year Stanford University researchers revealed the brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people.

First, an MRI scan showed that overall white matter content of CFS patients' brains was reduced compared to that of healthy participants' brains.

The term 'white matter' denotes the long, cable-like nerve tracts carrying signals and information through dispersed concentrations of 'grey matter' - which specialise in processing information.

The researchers said while the first finding wasn't entirely unexpected, the second was.

Using advanced imaging techniques, they identified a consistent abnormality in a particular part of a nerve tract in the right hemisphere of CFS patients' brains.

The tract, which connects the frontal lobe with the temporal lobe, assumed an abnormal appearance in CFS patients.

Furthermore, the study identified a strong link between the degree of abnormality in the patient's tract and the severity of their CFS.

The third finding highlighted a thickening of the grey matter in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in CFS patients, compared with the control group
