Brought together: Connor Rabinowitz and his girlfriend Erin Roberts were brought together when Connor was transplanted with the donor heart of Erin's brother Kellen

Connor Rabinowitz fell in love at first sight with the sister of the man whose heart was now beating inside his chest.

Lucky to get the donor heart of Kellen Roberts after his health collapsed because of a genetic heart condition, Rabinowitz was bowled over when he met Erin - just over a year after his transplant.

Although he was only 17-years-old at the time and she was 26 when they first met in 2004, the electric chemistry between the pair persisted until they got together in 2010 - with both feeling that deceased Kellen helped them to become lovers.

'We had an instant connection – we both feel that Kellen bought us together,' Connor said to the UK's Daily Mirror.

Connor was a fit teenager when he began to suffer flu-like symptoms in November of 2004.

One morning he woke in cold sweats to actually see his enlarged heart beating up through his chest and was rushed to hospital.

Doctors told the Minnesota teen that he would need a heart transplant or he would die and so he began the terrifying wait to see if a donor organ would become available.

Sadly for the Roberts family, but luckily for Connor, Kellen passed away after he suffered head injuries during a drunken fight in his home state of South Dakota.

Instant connection: The two first met when Connor was 18 and she was 26- but waited six-years before they started their relationship

The heart was moved to be transplanted to Connor, who had mixed feelings about his predicament.

'It was the best day of my life but I knew someone had died for me,' he said to the Daily Mirror.

'I felt undeserving, that I had something to do with this person’s death. I struggled with that for a while.'

Tragic: Kellen Roberts died after a drunken fracas at a party in 2004 - and his heart now beats inside Connor Rabinowitz - who is dating his sister Erin

During his recovery, Connor decided that he wanted to write a letter to the family of the donor - who were protected by anonymity.

'Kellen’s mother Nancy got in touch immediately and a few months later my mum flew to meet her. Six months after that I was well enough to visit too.

'It was an emotional meeting and as Nancy put her hand on my chest to feel Kellen’s heart beating inside me, I saw Erin for the first time.

'We locked eyes – and I was smitten. Erin felt the connection too but she tried to dismiss it, thinking I was too young.

'She took me sightseeing for the weekend and we felt so comfortable together, like we’d known each other our entire lives. I visited twice more and felt the same, but we were both dating other people.'

While school assistant Erin thought that Connor was too young and had a teenage crush on her, the two lost contact for five-years - but got back in touch using Facebook in 2010.

'We were both single for the first time and everything just fell into place,' said Connor.

Now 34, Erin said that the shared connection that the two felt was undeniable.

'He was still very young and I thought he might have a teenage crush,' she said to the Daily Mirror. 'I tried to dismiss my confused feelings. But I couldn’t stop thinking about Connor – he made me feel happy.

Happy: The couple were brought together when Connor began to suffer heart failure as he suffered a genetic condition

'After we reconnected via Facebook in 2010 everything changed. He came to visit and for the first time I felt really nervous around him.

'When he left, I couldn’t stop thinking about him, my heart was just racing.'

While Connor was training to be a cardiovascular ultrasound technician in Minneapolis, Erin was living in Seattle - so the two began a long-distance relationship.

For Erin's family, the beginning of her relationship was difficult - especially for her mother and her 14-year-old son, Christian.

However, once they all witnessed Erin and Connor together, they all came to realize that maybe it was Kellen who had played some part in their relationship.

'I know he brought us together and I know he is watching over us,' said Connor, who moved to be with Erin and is now a medical technician at a Seattle hospital.

Thankful: The happy couple believe that is is Kellen who has helped them to find happiness with each other - almost ten years on from his death

'All of the family tell me stories about Kellen. He is always in my thoughts – and obviously in my heart. He was a great guy – he always looked out for people. Through him, I hope I can do the same. If I was to meet him today, it would be like meeting my other half.'

'I was now forever connected with this young man who sacrificed his life and chose to save mine,' Connor told the West Seattle Herald.

'He is my hero, my guardian angel and I will be forever grateful for his decision to donate his organs.'

Kellen died after becoming involved in an argument at a party with 20-year-old Cody Faber.

While Cody was charged with second degree manslaughter after Kellen fell and hit his head on the concrete driveway - the judge in his case decided that Faber was not directly responsible for his death.

The lockets made after the transplant were inscribed with 'Connor', 'Kellen' and the number 552, referring to the 552nd heart transplant made at the University of Minnesota Hospital

He was sentenced to 10-days in prison after pleading guilty to assault - a verdict which Kellen's mother, Nancy and his family, including Erin agreed with.

'That’s the verdict we wanted. It became clear to us that Cody was telling the truth – as clear as you could be with alcohol and all the chaos,' said Nancy.

According to the Star Tribune, whenever Erin really misses her brother, she rests her head on Connor’s chest. 'It’s a strong beat,' Erin said.

The couple added that they believe Kellen bonded them together, both through sadness at his departure but also through huge celebration of his life.

'[Connor] understands on a level other people can’t. We’re aware of the sacrifice that had to be made,' Erin told the Star Tribune. 'I feel my brother chose him for me … as a last gift.'
