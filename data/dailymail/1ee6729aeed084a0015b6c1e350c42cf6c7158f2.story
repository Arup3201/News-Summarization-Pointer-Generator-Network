Unusual fear: Diane Freelove, 49, from Rochester, cannot bear the smell, touch or even sight of newspapers

A woman who developed a fear of newspapers after watching her mother hit her father over the head with one has told how her unusual phobia affects her life every day.

Diane Freelove, 49, cannot bear the smell of newspapers, hates to touch them, and cannot even look at them.

The mother-of-three from Rochester, Kent, has suffered from a rare condition known as chloephobia for the last 25 years.

It means even a visit to the shops is an ordeal for the care home kitchen assistant.

Mrs Freelove said: 'When I visit a shop I walk as far away as I can from the newsstand. I can’t go anywhere near someone who has got a newspaper, and if they approach me, I freak out.

'At one time I could touch a newspaper as long as I knew I could wash my hands thoroughly afterwards, but now I can’t even look at them.'

She added: 'I don't like the feel of them - if I touch a newspaper it feels like my skin is crawling, and I can’t stand the smell, which I think is quite strong and distinctive.

'If I see a newspaper flash up on TV, I have to physically turn away.' 

Mrs Freelove, whose children are grown up, suspects the root of her fear lies in uncomfortable memories from her childhood.

She said: 'When I was a child, my mother hit my father over the head with a newspaper. She did it in a playful, friendly way, but it worried me.

'I became afraid of newspapers gradually over the past 25 years.  At first I hated it when the newsprint rubbed off on my hands, feeling as if my hands were very dirty, meaning I would have to wash them.

'Today, I just think newspapers feel horrible.'

Mrs Freelove, who has a sign on her door asking for newspapers not to be delivered through her letterbox, said she winces when she catches her son, Matthew, 29 and daughters Lauren, 24 and Rebecca, 19, enjoying the daily news.

She said: 'All my children like to read newspapers. My daughter has them delivered to her house but is careful to throw them away before I go over to visit her.

'They made fun of me at first, but now they realise I have a serious problem. They understand it is a genuine issue for me.

Warning: Mrs Freelove, a widower since her newspaper-loving husband, Ian, died, has a sign on her door

'My younger daughter, who lives with me, has to go out and read the papers in secret. If I know she has touched a paper when she comes home she has to wash her hands and clothes.'

Mrs Freelove, who reads the news online, says she regularly bought newspapers for her late husband, Ian, who died in 2011, but always used gloves and a plastic bag to pick them up.

She said: 'I would go into the newsagent, pay for the newspaper first and ask if it could be left aside at the counter. Then I would do the rest of my shopping and collect the paper at the end. I would pick it up wearing my gloves and then pull the bag over it.

'I was very careful not to touch it. I could never even attempt that now.

'As my husband read the paper, I left the room and went to an open window in the kitchen. Fresh air made my anxiety more bearable.

The mother-of-three's younger daughter still lives at home but must wash her clothes if she's read a paper

'Ian realised how much I hated it and he stopped buying the papers. I always felt bad about that because he loved reading the paper.'

Mrs Freelove says she understands that her phobia is not an ordinary fear.

'I have some ordinary fears as well - I am scared of spiders and heights - but for some reason I’m also scared of newspapers,' she said.

'I saw someone put a newspaper in their mouth once. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. It made me feel sick, as if I was watching someone put a spider in their mouth.

'I have thought about trying hypnotherapy to overcome my fear but I haven’t gone down that route yet.'

Scary?  If you're frightened of this, you may suffer from the comparatively rare turophobia, or fear of cheese

More than a fear of something, a phobia is a type of anxiety disorder which means the sufferer has an overwhelming need to avoid avoid all contact with the source of their anxiety.

Some phobias, such as arachnophobia, or fear of spiders, are more common than others, while others, such as these below, are more unusual.

Papyrophobia:  Fear of paper

Bibliophobia:  Fear of books

Euphobia:  Fear of hearing good news

Turophobia:  Fear of cheese

Coulrophobia:  Fear of clowns

Aulophobia:  Fear of flutes

Arachibutyrophobia:  Fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of one's mouth

Linonophobia:  Fear of string

Hylophobia:  Fear of woods or trees

Omphalophobia:  Fear of tummy buttons
