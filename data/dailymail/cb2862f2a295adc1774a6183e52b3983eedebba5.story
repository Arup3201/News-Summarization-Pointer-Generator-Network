Jailed: Peter Clarke, pictured, was today sentenced to 16 years in prison at Preston Crown Court after admitting drugs and firearms offences

Police have seized a terrifying array of weapons, including machine guns, pistols, machetes and a pump-action shotgun from a violent, drug-dealing gang boss.

Peter Clarke, 35, used to be a firearms instructor in the army, but turned to crime and was today jailed for 16 years on drugs and firearms offences.

Preston Crown Court heard that Clarke was involved in dealing heroin, cocaine and cannabis, and was also involved in a £50million money laundering operation.

And when investigators cracked down on his criminal ring, they found the huge stash of firearms locked up in a garage. Officers said they were used to 'intimidate and strike fear' into gangland rivals.

The cache of weapons included a MAC-10 sub-machine gun, a Glock pistol, Luger handgun, two revolvers with silencers, stun guns, machetes a samurai sword and a sawn-off, pump-action shotgun. Investigators also uncovered 10kg of cocaine.

Clarke, who pleaded guilty to drugs offences, assault, conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and possession of a firearm and ammunition, lived a life of luxury on the back of his criminal activities.

He drove expensive cars, including Audi, Jaguar and BMW models, and regularly holidayed in destinations including Las Vegas,
Paris and Dubai.

He
moved into a smart £400,000 detached house in the former Viking village
of Tarleton, Lancs and used his wife to help hide his ill-gotten wealth.

Clarke had served in the Army, as part of the King's Regiment, until 2001 when he was convicted of a gangland murder.

Intimidation: Knuckle-dusters and knives also featured in the stash

He spent five years in prison for the murder of Stephen Lawlor, but was released in 2006 when the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction.

But he turned to crime after he was freed, amassing an array of weapons which police said were 'available to be used if and when required in the drug dealing enterprise'.

He
and his brother, who has also been jailed, made contact with drug wholesale suppliers in the 
Netherlands, Spain and France and 'cleaned' their dirty money via a contact in Derby.

In
January 2011 Police from Titan , the North West Regional Crime Unit, 
kept watch on couriers who would use ferries to take wares to contacts 
in Northern Ireland as others would return to Merseyside with the cash.

Collection: A huge array of bladed weapons was also found

Undercover
officers recorded one member of the gang stuffing 2kg of cocaine inside
the air filter of a hire car bound for Belfast in full view of his 
young son.

Repellent 
was often sprayed on drugs and cash in a bid to foil sniffer dogs so 
drug runners could easily by-pass customs and police.

Today
Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan said: 'The Clarke 
brothers were sophisticated and experienced criminals who would go to 
great lengths to protect their drug dealing empire from both the police 
and their rivals.

'Our 
investigation unearthed a terrifying array of weapons, including 
semi-automatic firearms, which were used to intimidate and strike fear 
into the hearts of their rivals and enemies.

'The drugs they supplied, with the help of others, will have caused untold misery in local communities.

Weaponry: This ammunition and sub-machine gun, pictured, were taken in as evidence by police

Drugs: Officers also seized large amounts of cocaine which Clarke's gang was dealing

Cash: Bundles of banknotes were also found. Clarke was able to live a luxurious life from the proceeds of his crimes

Pills: Preston Crown Court heard that Clarke's gang dealt in cocaine, cannabis and heroin

'Their drugs will have been traded in deals that will have fuelled other violent disputes and rivalries. The users who took them may have committed further crimes to pay for their addiction.

'It
is a circle of misery that serious criminals like the Clarkes and their
gang care nothing about. As long as they can live a comfortable life 
off the back of it, I do not believe they care for the wider damage they
cause.

'The fact they 
are today starting lengthy prison sentences sends a clear message to 
other criminals like them that we will stop at nothing to put them out 
of business and into prison where they belong.'

In
court Judge Andrew Woolman said the gang made millions from the crime 
racket and said the drugs seized by officers were the 'the tip of 
the iceberg'.

He told 
Clarke: 'You had a fine army record. To go from that career to the 
business of this conspiracy is indeed a long fall from grace.'

Clarke's older brother Stephen, 45, was also jailed for 10-and-a-half years after he pleaded guilty to drugs offences assault and conspiracy to cause GBH. In total, nine accomplices were jailed for a combined 80 years.
