A newlywed from Brooklyn, New York has recycled her wedding dress and worn it more than 10 times since saying 'I do'.

After spending nearly $2,000 on a gown for her 2013 nuptials, Randi Seltzer Bonica, 35, was inspired to start Trashed In The Dress - an ongoing project that gives women an opportunity to wear their wedding dresses to various events in New York City.

'It's the most beautiful, expensive item of clothing I've ever purchased,' the high school guidance counselor said of her gown. 'I knew before the wedding that I would be wearing it again.'

While planning her wedding to Steve Bonica, 37, Mrs Seltzer Bonica learned that she loved shopping for gowns - more than she thought she would.

'I found "the" dress every time I went to another store,' she said.

Following her October 2013 beach side ceremony on Fire Island, New York, Mrs Seltzer Bonica said she entertained the idea of doing a 'trash the dress' wedding photo shoot – which sees brides transforming their gowns into unique works of art using paint, glitter and streamers – but realized that she ultimately wanted to be able to continue wearing her gown in public.

She added: 'I couldn't imagine saving the dress for my future daughter who might not even want to wear it.' 

Instead, she gathered her friends. called a photographer and put on her wedding dress. 

'We went to a bar for some drinks, and the project has developed from there,' Mrs Seltzer Bonica explained. 

Since founding Trashed In The Dress in December 2013, Mrs Seltzer Bonica has thrown 10 events, including a trip to an amusement park, mini golfing, and even archery lessons.

'All the events are really special because we always have a different photographer following us around and they have their own ideas of how they see us,' she said. 

One of her favorite outings was a ping pong event that her mom attended. 

'She wore her dress too, and it was such a unique experience,' Mrs Seltzer Bonica said.

'I think I'm getting my money's worth out of it,' she noted. 'It's been a lot of fun.' 

Mrs Seltzer Bonica explained that wearing her wedding gown is like playing dress up as a child. 

'When you're a kid, you put on what you feel like wearing - butterfly wings, striped pants, and a tutu - this is the same feeling,' she said. 'We reach a point in our lives where we don't do it anymore - but once a month I get to put on my dress and don't worry about what other people think.'

'New Yorkers are so interesting - you can walk around naked and no one says anything.'

She noted: 'We do get a lot of tourists stopping us and asking what we're doing, but New Yorkers aren't surprised by us.'
