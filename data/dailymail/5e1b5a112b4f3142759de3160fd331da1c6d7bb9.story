A string of petty complaints – from the canteen not stocking ready-salted crisps to the television being ‘fuzzy’ – are made on a regular basis by inmates at one of Britain’s toughest prisons, it has emerged.

Prisoners at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire – which include convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles - have logged hundreds of complaints about the category A jail over the last 12 months.

Their moans centre on everything from the food in the canteen to the cleanliness of the men-only prison.

One prisoner, whose name has not been revealed, made a formal complaint about his dietary requirements after he failed to receive a packet of ready-salted crisps with his lunch.

He wrote: ‘No red crisps (i.e. ready salted) were given at lunchtime to me.

‘Evidently some of the wing staff found this very funny when I used an expletive over this. Whilst they might find this funny, I do not.

‘I have had enough problems getting my dietary requirements right for seven years in this place and I still have problems. I am informing you that all mistakes etc. with my dietary requirements with regard to food will be noted and action taken for my health being put at risk.’

In a separate complaint, another inmate wrote: ‘For the past two weeks we have had no parsley sauce with the fishcakes despite it being advertised on the menu sheet as fishcakes with parsley sauce.’

As one of Britain’s toughest prisons, HMP Wakefield is understood to house a number of high-profile criminals and the likes of paedophile Ian Watkins, April Jones’ killer Mark Bridger and Sarah Payne’s killer Roy Whiting are all thought to be serving time there.

The complaints, which have been obtained by The Mirror via freedom of information request, also reveal how inmates are complaining about matters which are often out of prison staff’s hands.

One lodged a complaint saying: 'Can something be done to stop pigeons landing and leaving droppings on my window sill.’

While another said: ‘The other night the temperature did not go above 18.5C. This is making me unhappy because I don’t like to be cold.’

Inmates have the option to earn a few pounds a week by working in the prison and are allowed to spend the money on certain items, including on the television which costs them each £1.

However, despite being able to enjoy luxuries such as watching TV, one still wasn’t happy and lodged a complaint about the picture quality.

He said: ‘The picture is a bit snowy. How many months will this take to fix?’

The list of complaints has drawn criticism from some officials including Labour MP Michael McCann who said the inmates ‘should have thought about home comforts before they committed their crimes.’

Prisons Minister Andrew Selous also hit out at the inmates and told The Mirror: ‘Prisoners shouldn’t be in any doubt they are there to be punished and complaints will only be taken forward if they have any merit.’

The revelation comes just days after a fire was started by inmates during a riot at HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire.

Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of the category C prison on Saturday when they were told they were not allowed outside during hot weather.

The fire was reportedly started during the ongoing incident which lasted more than eight hours.
