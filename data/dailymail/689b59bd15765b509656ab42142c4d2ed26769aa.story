It’s the biggest away game of the season for the Spanish Champions, but with three days to go before kick-off Atletico Madrid have sold just 30 tickets for their visit to the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.

One of the peculiarities of Spanish football is that there is no tradition of huge travelling support, but even taking that into consideration, the failure to take up their measly allocation of 250 is staggering.

Prices at the Santiago Bernabeu, starting at 70 euros for away fans, will have made up some supporter's minds. Atletico Madrid fans have had an expensive time of it lately with last season’s trips to London and Lisbon in the Champions League semi-final and final.

It seems, the fact that there are no more than five miles between stadiums has not been enough to tempt them to put their hands in their pockets and the fact that the game is not available on terrestrial television has also not got the waverers heading to the club’s ticket office.

There is also an element of derby-fatigue after these sides met twice in the Spanish Super Cup just last month. And Juventus are in town on October 1 as Atletico’s Champions League adventure kicks-off against the Italian champions.

Even with the Atletico fans’ no-show there will be 81,000 supporters in the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday as Real look to make up for losing both the league and the Super Cup to their neighbours in recent months. If Atletico score - the silence will be deafening. 

A few more than you... The Bernabeu will see about 81,000 Real fans compared to a measly 30 Atletico so far
