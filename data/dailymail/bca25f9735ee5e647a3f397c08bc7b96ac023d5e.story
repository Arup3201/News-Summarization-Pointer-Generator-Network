Team news 

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney could return to the Eagles starting line-up for the visit of Stoke in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

Delaney was on the bench for the goalless draw against Tottenham last weekend but is now considered fully fit, having recovered from a calf injury.

Midfielder Jason Puncheon will be assessed after missing training on Thursday through illness while Joe Ledley (hip) and Adrian Mariappa (knee) are both ruled out.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Kelly, Fryers, Delaney, Dann, Ward, Hangeland, Jedinak, Bannan, McArthur, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Gayle, Campbell, Johnson, Doyle, Chamakh, Zaha.

Stoke City

Stoke are likely to be without defender Marc Muniesa for Saturday's Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.

The Spaniard tweaked his hamstring during last weekend's victory over Arsenal and is set to be replaced by either Marc Wilson or Robert Huth, both of whom are fit after injury.

Striker Jonathan Walters has an ongoing problem with his knee but is expected to feature while Steve Sidwell, Peter Odemwingie (both knee), Victor Moses (thigh) and Dionatan Teixeira (broken foot) are all sidelined.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Butland, Shawcross, Huth, Pieters, Cameron, Bardsley, Nzonzi, Adam, Ireland, Wilson, Whelan, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Diouf, Crouch, Shenton.
