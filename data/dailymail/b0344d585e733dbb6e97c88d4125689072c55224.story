Chaos ruled the streets of Mexico last night as violent protests erupted across the country over the government's failure to catch the killers of 43 missing college students or snare a notorious drugs baron.

Running battles between federal police and protesters organizing a concert in solidarity with the missing students left at least 21 people injured and several cars ablaze on Sunday in the southern state of Guerrero.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Michoacan state, local police and vigilantes clashed over street blockades in a sign of renewed unrest in an area President Enrique Pena Nieto's government said it had pacified.

The violence in Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero state, left eight officers injured, including five who were run over by a vehicle, an official told the Associated Press. 

Three others were beaten by protesting teachers, leaving one officer with 'severe brain damage.' The official was not authorized to talk to the press and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Tlachinollan human rights group, which supports the relatives of the missing students, said the violence left at least 13 people injured, including students, teachers, parents of the missing students and two journalists, including a photographer who was working with The AP.

Each side blamed the other for initiating the clash, which began early Sunday when students from the Ayotzinapa teachers college began blocking a street with metal barriers in preparation for the concert.

The case off the missing students, who disappeared in September at the hands of corrupt local government officials linked to a drug cartel, has ignited protests across Mexico.

Mexico's attorney general said 80 people have been arrested so far in the case, including 44 police officers from the cities of Iguala and Cocula and former Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, who is under investigation for ordering the Sept. 26 attacks.

So far, one student has been positively identified.

Blockade: Civil relations were no better in Michoacan state, where the federal government's security commissioner, Alfredo Castillo, said on his Twitter account that a half dozen blockades had been removed following dialogue with the groups behind the unrest

No injuries: While there were no reports of injuries or major damage on Sunday, the disturbances in Michoacan follow rising discontent about the security situation in Mexico, where the abduction and apparent murder of more than 40 trainee teachers has sparked mass protests

Vigilantes: Vigilantes hold weapons during a blockade on a highway near the town of Uruapan in Michoacan state

Wrest control: At the start of 2014, the government sent reinforcements into Michoacan to wrest control of the state from a powerful drug gang, and later forged an uneasy alliance with vigilante groups to restore order

Civil relations were no better in Michoacan state, where the federal government's security commissioner, Alfredo Castillo, said on his Twitter account that a half dozen blockades had been removed following dialogue with the groups behind the unrest.

The groups criticized the government for failing to apprehend Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel which for years has ravaged Michoacan, despite nearly a year of federal police and military intervention.

While there were no reports of injuries or major damage on Sunday, the disturbances in Michoacan follow rising discontent about the security situation in Mexico, where the abduction and apparent murder of more than 40 trainee teachers has sparked mass protests.

At the start of 2014, the government sent reinforcements into Michoacan to wrest control of the state from a powerful drug gang, and later forged an uneasy alliance with vigilante groups to restore order.

But one of the major vigilante groups later on Sunday posted on its Facebook page that it has decided to take up arms again, blaming Castillo for taking sides in gang turf battles.
