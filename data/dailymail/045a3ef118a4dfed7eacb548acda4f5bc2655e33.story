Amongst Celtic supporters, an air of simmering discontent currently festers. In Perth on Wednesday night, there is every chance they will make it public.

Ronny Deila’s first SPFL match as manager against St Johnstone is unlikely to be a flag-waving, championship jamboree.

Thanks to a breach of UEFA rules by Legia Warsaw, the recent 6-1 Champions League qualifying defeat may not prove fatal. But it has exposed a growing disconnect between Celtic supporters and their board of directors. A crack the dual arrivals of Jason Denayer and Aleksander Tonev on 12-month loan deals have done little to patch up.

Pressure: Ronny Deila has not had the easiest start to life at Celtic

Bluntly, Celtic fans believe their club are guilty of arch-parsimony. Of taking the season-ticket cash and Champions League profits and failing to reinvest them in the team on the pitch.

Of the four signings made so far this summer, three have been year-long loans and the other, Craig Gordon, was a free transfer. In a week when Fergus McCann returns to Glasgow to unfurl the league flag, there is irony in the timing of all this.

According to Deila, the failure to pay a transfer fee has not been for the want to trying. Supporters are weary of sob stories and excuses in these situations, but the Norwegian claims the club were close to spending £1.7million on Haiti midfielder Jeff Louis before he opted for Belgium, instead.

‘We were very close to signing Jeff Louis from Nancy,’ said Deila. ‘We were offering more money than Standard Liege - but he want to go there instead of us.

‘It has to be something about not wanting to come to Scotland and preferring to be in Belgium.

‘It is very important that we understand the language, what is happening here. It is different.

‘We are not in the English Premier League, we are playing in Scotland and that is why a talented player can be easier to get than the “big” player. And the big players have salaries that are three, four five times, bigger than you can get here. That is the main issue and you know that.

‘But I understand that because it is very hard to see the big club and then see finances that are not even close to how big the club actually is.’

Sealed deal: Jason Denayer poses with Deila following his arrival on a season-long loan

One former Parkhead player put it to Sportsmail in the following terms the other day: In their transfer dealings this summer, the Scottish champions have been Doctor Who’s Tardis in reverse. Big on the outside, small on the inside.

Asked if Celtic supporters now have to accept the reality of their geographical boundaries and minuscule broadcasting revenue, Deila shrugs. ‘I don’t know, I can’t tell them that — but, in the last few years, I don’t know if I can remember some very big signings,’ he said. ‘It’s been players coming in that you have to develop.

‘So I think if we start the crazy business then you will ruin the club, that’s how it is.’

For Celtic figures the accepted practice now is to point across the city at Rangers and say, ‘Look what happened there…’

Supporters argue there is a middle ground. There are few who expect their signings from Harrods but feel right now as if their favourites are shopping from Aldi whilst demanding a gift receipt.

Deila agrees that they could pay some substantial fees, but points out that £4m players want £4m player wages.

The decision to sell Gary Hooper rather than pay him £28,000 a week has largely backfired, but the Norwegian sees the footballing logic in maintaining a dressing room on level salaries.

Arrival: As has Aleksander Tonev from Aston Villa

‘If you start getting one, two, three or four players who are on much higher salaries, then the others have to come after you and you will never resign the players,’ Deila continued.

‘This creates a bad situation for the club.

‘So I think it (the salary cap) is important. I don’t think it’s so important if you have a lot of money because then everybody’s just having what they want.

‘But when you know you’re playing at a club and you can see the club is treating you well, they have a good system, the players who have been there a long time get good salaries.’

For Celtic, overtures to prospective signings usually come into two categories. Those who won’t look at lowering themselves to playing in Scottish football. And those who will – if the money is right.

But Deila says the process has to be about more than mere cash, adding: ‘We have to see it in their eyes they want to come.

Moved on: Whilst Celtic's goalkeeper Fraser Forster has signed for Southampton

‘Of course, when you start talking about the club and you talk about money at once, the business is tough. You see how many agents there is for one player.

‘When you get into things, there are so many involved in the business. I laugh when I see Peter (Lawwell) doing this and people come from all over the place and they want a piece of it. That’s the deal now.

‘But Scottish players abroad they sometimes want to come back because they are from here and they come back and they don’t expect that salary.

‘That’s what we need to do with Celtic and Scottish football, we need to get the players out and when they are experienced, we need to get them back again and we have to build the club from there.’

Bringing back unsettled, homesick Scots will be a key tenet of Deila’s transfer strategy. After watching Fraser Forster leave for Southampton for £10m, selling defender Virgil van Dijk this transfer window won’t be.

‘I think we are done selling in this window but again, you never know in football — it’s about money,’ he said.

‘But so far there has been no interest and he is important for us in the Champions League and in the league, as well.’

Legia Warsaw have lodged their appeal with UEFA and will go all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if need be.

Despite some emotive, emotional blackmail this week, however, Deila declines to add to the verbiage surrounding the saga.

‘I’ve said all I can about that case. Now they are appealing and that has to be arranged by UEFA.

‘I have to keep my focus on winning games and being a football manager, not a politician.’
