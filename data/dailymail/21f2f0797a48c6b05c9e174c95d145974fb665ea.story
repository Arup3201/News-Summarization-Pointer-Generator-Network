A Royal Navy warship seized cocaine worth £21million after a 12-hour chase with drug runners in the Caribbean.

The suspicious speedboat had been spotted by a US Maritime Patrol Aircraft and Plymouth-based boat HMS Argyll was deployed.

It took the Type 23 ‘Duke’ frigate half a day to catch up with the small vessel after it launched a Lynx helicopter to confirm the crew were suspected drug smugglers.

Sailors from HMS Argyll seized 18 bags of cocaine with a street value of £21million after chasing a speedboat in the Caribbean for 12 hours and detaining the five suspects on board, who were handed over to US authorities

Navy sailors dispatched high-speed sea boats to intercept the ship and seize their haul.

On board they found 600 kilos of cocaine, which had been packed into bales and wrapped in bin bags, and with an estimated UK street value of £21million.

Five suspects were detained in HMS Argyll and handed over to US authorities.

The seizure was part of a joint counter-narcotics operation with the US to target South American drug networks.

Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said: ‘The Royal Navy has a hard-earned record of tackling illegal drugs smuggling and we should be extremely proud that HMS Argyll has been involved in a dramatic and very successful operation to disrupt the supply.

‘The operations showed tenacity and professionalism.’

HMS Argyll's Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Hammond, said: 'My team and I knew that a swift and correct interception was required in this case. We worked well with our international partners to give ourselves the best chance of success.'

HMS Argyll was involved in previous significant drug raids including two in September 2006 when she was deployed with other vessels to intercept merchant ships and found drugs worth £50 million.
