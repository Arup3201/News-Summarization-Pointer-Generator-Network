MPs are expected to have a £7,600 pay rise rubber-stamped within weeks – despite fears of a public backlash.

David Cameron is facing pressure from a powerful group of backbenchers who insist the 11 per cent rise recommended by their independent pay watchdog must be implemented.

In July, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was condemned by all three main party leaders after recommending an increase from the current MPs’ salary of £66,396 to £74,000 in 2015.

Charles Walker MP, left, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee, that represents Tory backbenchers, said David Cameron could not ignore Ipsa recommendations

But as the consultation on the proposal ended yesterday, with about 200 responses from MPs, senior MPs said it was ‘beyond doubt’ the Prime Minister would have to accept the increase.

Ipsa was set up following the expenses scandal in 2009, but has attracted criticism for recommending the pay rise for MPs at a time when most workers are seeing their real wages fall.

Under the proposal, MPs would earn almost three times the national average wage of £26,000.

Charles Walker MP, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee that represents Tory backbenchers, said Parliament could not ignore Ipsa, the body it set up to rule on the issue, as that would mean putting pay and expenses back into the hands of MPs, which did so much to damage public faith in politics.

He added: ‘Pay is a matter for Ipsa. Either it is independent and the party leaders accept its decisions, or scrap it.

'Because what is the point of us paying its £6.5milion a year operating budget if it is ignored?’

Ipsa’s recommendation for a 11 per cent rise would cost taxpayers an extra £4.6million a year, but would come with more restrictions on MPs claiming expenses for items such as dinner and taxis.

Another senior member of the 1922 Committee said that the Prime Minister had to accept Ipsa's recommendation - which would see salaries rise to £74,000

Mr Walker said: ‘What is required is a bit of leadership and courage. With the PM saying that the Ipsa recommendations aren’t ideal, respecting the independence of this body must be better than returning to the failed system of the past, which nearly shattered faith in our democracy.’

Another senior member of the 1922 Committee said: ‘It is beyond doubt the Prime Minister has to accept Ipsa’s recommendation. Parliament gave it the power to decide. We cannot withdraw that power because it looks bad.’

Sources claimed yesterday that No 10 would seek a way out of the impasse by publicly condemning the rise but conceding that the watchdog’s word on salaries is final. A No 10 spokesman said they would wait for Ipsa’s final report at the end of the year.

He added: ‘We will publish our final decision after examining all the responses. This is not subject to a vote in Parliament.’
