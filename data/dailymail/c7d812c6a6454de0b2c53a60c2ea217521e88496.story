Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero has denied reports that he rejected a move to Manchester United.

The 27-year-old, whose penalty saves helped his country defeat Louis Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup, was offered to United in the summer as his club Sampdoria looked to move him on.

United want another goalkeeper to give competition to David de Gea but first need to move on Anders Lindegaard.

Romero was also discussed by Liverpool, however, talking to Radio Nacional, he said: 'Many lies have been spread, like, for example, that I refused a transfer to Manchester United. To me, something like that is crazy.'

Romero played under van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar and is behind Emiliano Viviano in the pecking order at Sampdoria. He added: 'I can’t do this for much longer. The same thing happened to me in France – arriving a club when the transfer window is nearly closed and having to wait for an opportunity.

'I am happy at Sampdoria, though, and I will keep showing the coach that I am ready to play and that I don’t want to keep sitting on the bench.'

Romero also saved a penalty from Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar during the shoot-out on July 9th
