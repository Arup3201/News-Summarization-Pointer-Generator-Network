Paul Scholes and Phil Neville have gone from owners to caretaker managers after taking control of Salford City's clash with Kendal Town on Saturday afternoon.

The ex-Manchester United duo, along with their former team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Nicky Butt, bought the non-league club earlier this year.

But after the club sacked manager Phil Power and assistant Dave Chadwick on Friday, Scholes and Neville were in the dugout for the Evo-Stik Division One North side's crucial game.

Neville was a coach under David Moyes at Manchester United last season but left the club in the summer

And the pair's influence on the side clearly worked as they won 2-1 at home. Prior to Saturday's result Salford sat third in the league after losing 3-2 to promotion rivals Droylsden on New Year's Day with league leaders Darlington having three games in hand on The Ammies.

It had been left to former United first-team coaches Scholes and Neville to get them through Saturday's game, but the pair will be relieved of their duties following the appointment of manager Anthony Johnson from EvoStik League Division One North side Ramsbottom United. 

After sacking their previous management team, a club statement said: 'Salford City Football Club would like to announce that discussions between the owners of SCFC and the committee have led to the departure, with immediate effect, of team Manager Phil Power.

'The committee and owners would like to thank Phil for all his hard work and commitment and wish him all the best for the future.

'The Club feel they need to take a new direction and will in due course announce plans for the team going forward.'

The Class of '92 hope to lead Salford, who are currently in the eighth tier of English football, into the Championship within 15 years.
