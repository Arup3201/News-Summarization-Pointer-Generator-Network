Manchester City have started negotiations over a £25million move for Swansea striker Wilfried Bony.

Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins  said on Wednesday his club are yet to receive any offers but City are now poised to make their opening gambit for the Ivory Coast international amid interest from Real Madrid also.

Talks took place with Bony's advisers on Wednesday night with the 26-year-old poised to join Ivory Coast on Friday before heading to Abu Dhabi next week for warm weather training ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations campaign.

Bony has scored eight goals for Swansea this season 

Due to Financial Fair Play restrictions Bony, who has scored eight goals this season, can not play for City in the Champions League but would give them impetus in their Premier League campaign as they look to chase down leaders Chelsea.

Coach Manuel Pellegrini played down the importance of new signings yesterday but City have had injuries to Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic and want back-up should any of those re-occur.

Manuel Pellegrini knows that if City sign Bony he won't be able to play in the Champions League due to FFP

Pellegrini said: 'We have restrictions about the amount of money and about the number of players we can put in the Champions League, so I don't think it will be a special transfer window for our team. We have the option to do it - we will see in the whole month of January what we are going to do about that - but it is not a major concern.'
