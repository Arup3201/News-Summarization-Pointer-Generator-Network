However, prosecutors claim that the mother-of-five engaged in child neglect when she strapped Ava to her in a forward-facing device without a helmet before going for a ride on the 2013 Honda all-terrain vehicle, according to Tulsa.

Police say that Russell lost control of the four-wheeler and she and the toddler were thrown from the vehicle just before 8pm on Sept. 27 near Chouteau, according to Oklahoma's Own. 

Russell hit the ground face-forward with the two-year-old still attached to her front. 

Ava died of blunt impact injuries to the head.

Police say Russell was uninjured but smelled of alcohol. A toxicology report released in January revealed that Russell's blood alcohol level was 0.173, Tulsa reports.

That's more than twice the legal limit of 0.08. 

Reports say that Russell also tested positive for barbiturates, a drug prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders that can cause drowsiness.

Russell is being held on $500,000 bail and is set to appear in court in April. 

A second-degree murder conviction carries a weight of 10 years to life in prison.
