A police force which helped patrol the streets of Ferguson during protests over the killing of Michael Brown is kitted out with grenade launchers and military-grade vehicles.

The lethal arsenal of the St Louis Police Department, which sent forces to the Missouri city during fraught demonstrations this year, also includes mobile riot shields, Tasers and an extensive array of conventional firearms.

Police officers armaments, often provided by the Federal government under a scheme to re-use old army equipment, have been under increased scrutiny after shocking images of heavily-armed officers emerged in the wake of Michael Brown's death in August.

Freeze: Conventional firearms populated most of the list, but more exotic weapons and vehicles also feature

The new list of equipment was revealed to BuzzFeed News under freedom of information laws, and details all significant equipment acquired by the police force since 2004.

Worrying entries in the arsenal of the force, which is responsible for just over 300,000 people, include two PGL-65 multi-shot grenade launchers, from which one officer can fire six canisters in a matter of seconds without reloading.

The pump-action weapons were seen on the streets of Ferguson firing tear gas rounds, but can also launch flash bangs, non-lethal foam rounds, and traditional 40mm explosive grenades.

The police department also has access to a 1969 Hughes MH-6C helicopter, which can have mini-guns, rockets and anti-tank missile attached. It also has two other helicopters.

Dozens of pistols and rifles were also included in the load-out - as was a powerful 'acoustic device' which can fire deafening noises into crowds.

Defensive equipment for the police included dozens of thick riot shields and a BearCat armored personnel carrier which is strong enough to withstand a blast from a land mine.

Proponents of the mass buy-up of lethal technology has said that a well-armed police force can help shut down potentially dangerous confrontations.

However, critics say it creates an overly aggressive force which is more able - and likely - to inflict harm on the population.

On August 20 in Ferguson a police officer, Ray Albers, was suspended after pointing an assault rifle at a Ferguson protester and reportedly threatening to kill.
