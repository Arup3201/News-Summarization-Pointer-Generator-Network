Women across the UK are trying to trim down for the festive party season

Whether you are hoping the free bar will help you pluck up the courage to confess your office crush, or just wishing to induce envy among colleagues and friends, you will want to look your best at the merry-go-round of festive events.

Women across the country are on last minute diet plans before the Christmas party season and supermarkets are seeing sales of healthy meals soaring as a result.

M&S has reported sales of their healthy eating ranges up 25 per cent on last month while Waitrose reported sales of fruit and vegetables are soaring ahead of the festive season.

And it is not just dropping those excess pounds that we are hoping to achieve through our last minute over haul of our diets.

Our shopping habits reveal that superfoods and green smoothie ingredients, both touted as miracle cures for bad skin, lacklustre hair, and low energy, are as popular as in the summer months.

Sales of chard and kale are up a huge 32 per cent on this time last year, Waitrose reports, as people look to green juices to strengthen their bodies ahead of the party season.

Mango sales have also increased by 30 per cent, avocados are up 17 per cent and grapes as well as melons are up 11 per cent, as Brits try to pack in the nutrients.

M&S reports that sales of blueberries are up 40 per cent on last month, and family size boxes of Clementines are the third most popular item in store!

Those who are less inclined, or too busy, to prepare meals from scratch are also jumping aboard the November health kick.

 M&S’s two popular healthy eating ranges Count On Us and Simply Fuller Longer saw a big surge in sales, with its biggest week since May at the end of November

Sales of diet ready and micro meals are on the rise as rushed slimmer’s still try and shave away the calories and shape up to impress in their LBD.

M&S’s two popular healthy eating ranges– Count On Us and Simply Fuller Longer saw a big surge in sales, with its biggest week at the end November, since May.

A spokesman commented: ‘Count on Us and Fuller Longer products are popular with our customers watching their weight, and three main peaks are clear during the year: January for New Year resolutions, pre-summer holiday bikini diets in May and pre-Christmas in November.’

Joanne Lunn, Waitrose nutritionist comments: 'In the month or so left before Christmas, there is enough time to really make a difference in the appearance of our skin, eyes, hair, nails and teeth.

'We can beautify ourselves from the inside out quite easily.'

Here are Joanne’s tips for eating yourself beautiful:

A healthy varied balanced diet is essential if you want to stay fit and healthy throughout the festive season.

This means trying to eat at least 5 portions of fruit and veg each day, making balanced meals of wholegrain starchy foods and lean proteins and keeping hydrated. Foods that are particular good throughout the party season are:

Foods such as pomegranate are rich in Vitamin A, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin E

Consume foods rich in Vitamin A, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin E such as yeast extract, pulses, wholemeal bread, pomegranate, blackberries, avocados, brazil nuts and shellfish.

Biotin (found in peanut butter and wholemeal bread) and Selenium (avocados and lentils)

Tuck into carrots, chard, kale and melon for your vitamin A and eggs, milk and breakfast cereal to top up your riboflavin.

Eat foods rich in Vitamin C, such as pomegranate, citrus fruit, grapes and blackberries and opt for high calcium foods including dark green leafy vegetables and dairy.
