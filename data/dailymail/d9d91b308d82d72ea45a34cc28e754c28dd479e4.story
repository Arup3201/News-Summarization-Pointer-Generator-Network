Steve Bruce has blamed the linesman and Jan Vertonghen for having Gaston Ramirez sent off and 'ruining the spectacle' in Hull City's 2-1 home defeat by Tottenham on Sunday.

The Uruguayan forward was dismissed after an innocuous clash with Vertonghen ended with Ramirez flicking out a foot at the Spurs defender, with Bruce complaining that the decision changed the game.

Hull had taken an early lead through Jake Livermore but conceded twice - through goals by Harry Kane and a last-minute winner from Christian Eriksen - after being reduced to 10-men, leaving their manager fuming.

Hull manager Steve Bruce has questioned the decision, which led to his side losing 2-1 to Tottenham

'When you see it back there's only really the linesman who's 20 yards away and then he just ruins the spectacle as far as I'm concerned,' Bruce said.

'And of course it gives Tottenham a huge advantage and they've punished us in the end.

'I understand that they have really difficult jobs but why does he have to get involved? If he does get involved, why doesn't he just say 'it's a yellow card'?

Ramirez is shown a dubious red card, with Bruce blaming the linesman and Vertonghen for getting involved

'No-one in the ground has seen it, no-one on the TVs have seen it. It's a little coming together. He (Ramirez) is a bit disappointed that he's not got the free-kick.  

'It's hard to with ten, never mind eleven,' said Bruce.

'It was petulance and the letter of the law says it's violent conduct. But the really top referees use common sense. I think it should have been a yellow.

The Tigers boss also complained that Vertonghen's reaction unfairly contributed to having his player sent off. 

'Vertonghen is a 6ft 3in centre half but he has done down as if pole-axed.

'That can't be healthy for the Premier League. It is creeping in and it's disappointing.

'We are seeing incidents of players trying to get others sent off and it's not healthy.'
