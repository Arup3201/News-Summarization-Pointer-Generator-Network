A High Court judge has asked government officials in three countries to help re-unite two sisters at the centre of a tug-of-love dispute with their mother.

Selina Ali, three, and her sister Hana, who is nearly two, from Birmingham, were thought to have been taken to Algeria by their Algerian father, Hamza Ali, 30, the High Court in London heard.

This is in breach of court orders that they should live with their Polish mother, Edyta Wawrzak, also 30, Mrs Justice Hogg was told at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court.

Lawyers representing Ms Wawrzak, a hotel housekeeper from Sosnowiec, Poland, said Mr Ali, a mechanic, had returned to England alone.

They said the girls were thought to be living with members of his family in Algiers - and said it was hoped that a relative might bring them back to England.

But lawyers said the girls might have problems obtaining travel documentation which would allow them to re-enter the UK because of the nationalities of the parents.

Mrs Justice Hogg asked British officials at the UK Border Agency and the Foreign Office plus officials in the Polish and Algerian embassies in London to do what they could to help.

She also ruled that the youngsters’ plight could be reported - in the hope that publicity would help get them home.

‘I will give leave for publicity,’ said Mrs Justice Hogg. ‘I am very concerned about these little girls.’

Ms Wawrzak had been in the UK for about five years, the judge was told.

She had married Mr Ali in 2011 and they had separated in 2013.

Ms Wawrzak said Mr Ali had offered to look after the children on a day in early February when she had to go out.

She said when she returned Mr Ali, the children - and their ‘Mickey and Minnie toys’ - had gone.
