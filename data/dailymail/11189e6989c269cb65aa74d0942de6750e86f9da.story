On a red carpet full of beautiful women, Jennifer Aniston ensured all eyes were on her at the SAG Awards as she flaunted her cleavage in a plunging vintage Galliano gown.

The daring dress drew full attention to the actress's décolletage which was adorned with a long, gold necklace. 

It's not the first time the 45-year-old has dared to bare recently with such a revealing outfit choice.

We do know that Jennifer Aniston is a fan of her little black dresses, but she steered well away from safe at the Screen Actors Guild Awards when she turned up in a plunging maxi dress in a gold-green shade.

The dress that really bared all looked stunning on the Cake star and despite her not picking up an accolade once again this awards season, Jen was a winner in our eyes.

She teamed the V-neck number with the Amrit long-link necklace that she actually wore to the Critics' Choice Awards just last week.

The dress really skimmed her trim physique and her golden tumbling locks fitted in nicely so it got the thumbs up from us.

Being a vintage Galliano piece, you can't buy it of course, but we've found some alternative plunging pieces below, ready for you to bare all at your next big event.

Earlier this month she chose a similarly exposing top as she wore a trouser suit with nothing underneath the jacket to the Annual Critics Choice Movie Awards.

The plunging necklines show how the former Friends star has grown in confidence and style since she first found fame in the Nineties.

When the hit TV show first aired, she perfected a girl next door look often looking casual in trousers and V-neck T-shirts.

At the Critics' Choice Movie Awards earlier this month, she wore a similar plunging style top

The actress has admitted her confidence is sky high since becoming engaged to Justin Theroux and it's reflected in her daring wardrobe choices

Back then, people were more obsessed with her hair than her wardrobe as fans rushed to copy her 'Rachel' haircut.

If she did glam up for a red carpet event, more often than not, she chose floor-length gowns that hid her legs.

Her favoured style in the late nineties and early noughties - when she was married to Brad Pitt - were dresses that either covered her chest in a halter neck fashion or were strapless showing just a hint of cleavage.

Following her split from Brad - who famously moved on with Angelina Jolie - she seemed keen not to draw attention to herself in plain, black dresses on special occasions.

But by 2008, she seemed keen to show him what he was missing, starting to get more daring with her outfits by stepping out in mini dresses that showed off her slim figure and perfect pins.

Now in her forties, she upped the ante again, choosing thigh-high split dresses - and currently the plunging necklines - to show how age hasn't dented her body confidence.

In fact, she says she's getting happier with her appearance with age.

The actress admitted at the end of last year that she's '100 per cent' more confident than she's ever been and she's learnt to love her figure.

'It's true, youth is wasted on the young. There's no doubt about it,' Jennifer told Access Hollywood's Liz Hernandez. 'I look at all of my girlfriends and friends, and I think we're all becoming more and more in our bodies.' 

By 2008, she starts to look happy and and more confident again - showing off her legs like she did on the red carpet at the Marley and Me premiere with Owen Wilson 

For the 2009 Oscars, she stuck to her tried and trusted long strapless gown style

Shortly after turning 40, Jennifer shows she's becoming happier with her body with age wearing this sleeveless gown split to the thigh to the 2010 Golden Globes 

The star's soaring self-esteem is largely thanks to her relationship with fiancé, Justin Theroux, who she is expected to marry this year. 

'It's absolutely one of the happiest times in my life,' she said of her current situation. 

So it seems for the Horrible Bosses star the cliche is true - life really does begin at 40.
