The foreboding message on the door reads: Warning  - Reduced Oxygen Levels.

Inside, warm air gusts out at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) with 80 per cent humidity, as strength and conditioning coach Ian Aylward orders everyone to pedal harder and faster on their state-of-the-art Wattbikes, used by Team GB’s cycling champions in their training.

Welcome to England’s special World Cup humidity chamber, their secret weapon in how to cope with the heat of the Amazon jungle when they face Italy on Saturday night.

Thanks to this tiny room inside England's national training centre at St George's Park, manager Roy Hodgson is in charge of the best-prepared group of sportsmen ever to have left these islands.

Wayne Rooney, Steve Gerrard and the rest of the 23- man squad were virtually encamped in there for four days up to the start of last week to undergo the physical preparation that could make the difference between glory and disaster in Brazil. 

There is just enough room to fit six bikes, a generator and the gadgets needed to set the temperature and humidity levels to replicate exactly what they can expect in their first game of the World Cup.

‘By the time the England boys had finished working, the glass was totally steamed up and people outside couldn’t see in through the window,’ said an impressed Aylward.

‘I think this chamber has been a massive help in preparing for the World Cup. The more you can be exposed to the environment that you are going to compete at, the better.’

Medical specialist Michael Davison, who runs a London Fifa medical centre of excellence, concurs: 'England have trained in five locations across four countries for the World Cup. But it's only the bike sessions in the 35 degree (Celsius) chambers that will have given the players the body shock of a wall of heat.'

To try and illustrate the benefits, Aylward this week put a middle-aged and unfit hack- me - through my paces at the humidity chamber this week, accompanied by a proper former professional footballer, former Everton and Republic of Ireland footballer Lee Carsley.

Able to regulate conditions inside the chamber, Aylward ordered us onto the bikes and to start pedaling at 70% per cent humidity – sweaty indeed, but still below the 80 per cent that England can expect in Manaus when the game kicks off at 6pm local time.

After 95 seconds, the first bead of sweat appeared on my face. After three minutes, my heart rate was noticeably higher and there was a first overwhelming urge to swig at the cool bottle of water I was allowed as a non-athlete to take in for safety reasons.

As breathing became a heavier, an unsympathetic Aylward only increased the temperature and humidity, perhaps remembering the local saying in Manaus: 'We’ve got two seasons here – summer and Hell'.

The effect was like running in a sauna. I was glad Carsley was sweating even more than me, though to be fair he was peddling a lot harder too.

The hard work that Hodgson's men put in before crossing The Atlantic will pay off according to Aylward, whose company Perform is based permanently at St George's Park. ‘I think it’s safe to say this is the best-prepared England team ever to go to a tournament because sports science in itself has developed massively even over the last four years,' he said.

‘No stone has been left unturned so the lads are in the best possible condition. We’ve studied conditions in Manaus because with any sport you need to spend time understanding the physical demands so you can set training parameters - physiological, duration, intensity and environment.

'And obviously in Manaus, environment is going to be key.

‘Normally it takes seven to 10 days to acclimatise to any sort of environmental changes so the work they have done here is certainly going to benefit the team and the medical staff.’

Afterwards, a profusely-sweating Carsley had some encouraging news for England fans as he clambered off the bike: 'That was tough - I wasn't one of the best at Everton at fitness and aerobic tests, but Wayne Rooney was very good.

'Alan Stubbs was probably the best, some of the foreign lads, but Rooney was fine. He was a fit lad.' 

The level of detail in England’s planning before they left St George’s Park for their final warm-up games in Miami is astonishing.

Every individual player has been tested and given their own sweat profile. It helps determine how much liquid, and exactly what kind, each of them will be given during the Italy game.

Aylward explains: ‘Everyone has a separate sweat profile and different electrolyte balance. Whilst it is important to balance the water intake to the amount of water you’re losing through sweating, the most important thing is the electrolytes that we lose as part of that sweat.

‘We need vital things like sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, they all play a part in how the nerves conduct.From a cognitive point of view, a mental point of view, once those stores diminish, it can massively effect your performance.’

The general advice for players is to refuel little and often, around 200mls every 20 minutes. Too much in one go and you’ll get cramps.

Fifa will allow three-minute water breaks once temperatures go above 36 degrees but different players will get different drinks, depending on how well they retain sodium chloride and other electrolytes in the body.

The Wattbikes has the facility to determine how strong the right side of each player’s body is compared to the left and what needs extra work.

Near to the chamber and other cardiovascular gym equipment, a £250,000 underwater treadmill at St George’s gave extra help to any players who ended the season with particular aches and pains.

Mercifully, Aylward allowed me to stop pedalling after 20 energy-sapping minutes in the humidity chamber.

One trusts the England players managed a longer spell than that if they’re expected to chase Andrea Pirlo for 90 minutes on Saturday.
