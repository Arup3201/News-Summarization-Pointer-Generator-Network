Adam Osborne had his licence suspended by the General Medical Council after being accused of having a two-year sexual affair with a highly vulnerable woman

George Osborne’s psychiatrist brother is battling to save his career after it was revealed that he has been suspended as a doctor following serious allegations of misconduct.

Adam Osborne, 38, who has a private practice in Central London, last week had his licence suspended by the General Medical Council (GMC) after being accused of having a two-year sexual affair with a highly vulnerable woman patient who has psychiatric issues, is married and has two children.

The news comes five years after he was suspended by the GMC for ‘dishonest and misleading’ behaviour in prescribing drugs to his cocaine-addicted prostitute lover.

The latest blow means he cannot practise in any capacity as a doctor until an investigation into the new allegations has been concluded.

The suspension will prove highly embarrassing for the Chancellor, coming as he prepares for Wednesday’s crucial Budget, the last before May’s General Election.

If the investigation results in a Fitness To Practise hearing, which is held in public, Dr Osborne could face further sensitive personal information being revealed. And if the allegations are upheld, he could be struck off.

A GMC spokesman said that the interim suspension was not an indication of guilt.

In the wake of the hearing, Dr Osborne’s personal website was taken down. His Linkedin page states that he has a special interest in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, depression and anxiety.

Dr Osborne currently runs Devonport Psychiatry, which is based in Marylebone, Central London, but is officially registered to his home address in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, which he shares with his wife Rahala Noor, a plastic surgeon.

On Friday, blinds were drawn at the £1.5 million terraced house, and although Dr Osborne was seen going in, he refused to answer the door. His Mercedes – with personalised number plates – was parked outside.

Dr Osborne is the youngest brother of the Chancellor and one of four sons born to Sir Peter Osborne – who co-founded the wallpaper company Osborne & Little – and artist’s daughter Felicity Loxton-Peacock.

Dr Osborne’s medical career has been beset by controversy since he finished his medical course at Manchester University in 2003.

His suspension in 2010 stemmed from a series of allegations surrounding his use of prescription drugs, which centred on allegations of a relationship with a prostitute.

The GMC said that his ‘relationship’ with the woman had ‘clouded his judgment’ and led him to prescribe powerful anti-psychotic drugs, dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her GP.

Dr Osborne was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to his then girlfriend, Rahala, a strict Muslim who would become his wife, and an anti-smoking drug to an unnamed family member.

The GMC hearing was told that Dr Osborne had been in a relationship with the prostitute, referred to as Miss B, from 2007 to 2008 while he was separated from his girlfriend and he was a trainee psychiatrist in Manchester.

Dr Osborne admitted prescribing the drugs to his girlfriend, to a family member, and Quetiapine, Haloperidol and Lorazepam to Miss B. But he denied his conduct was dishonest, misleading or impaired his fitness to practice.

Adam Osborne married Bangladeshi-born Noor in an elaborate Muslim ceremony in 2009 only after he had converted to Islam and changed his first name to Mohammed. The pair met as undergraduates at St Andrews University, Fife, before going on to study medicine together at Manchester University. Once qualified, he became a junior doctor at the city’s Wythenshawe Hospital.

He was forced to resign following the allegations that he was handing out falsified prescriptions.

Dr Osborne declined to comment.
