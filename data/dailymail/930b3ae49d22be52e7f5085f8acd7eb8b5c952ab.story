Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was forced to allow members of the public to use the beach next to his $37million California home after losing a year-long legal battle

A Silicon Valley billionaire who blocked access to a popular beach next to his $37million home has lost a legal battle against a group of surfers, forcing him to re-open it to the public.

Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems who is worth around $1.5billion, bought the luxury property and adjoining road that leads to Martin's Beach in San Mateo County, California, in 2008.

The previous owner had allowed visitors to get onto the stretch of sand for $5, but the father-of-three decided against it.

He locked the gate at the entrance to the access road and even hired guards to keep people away. 

But yesterday a judge ruled that blocking the road was illegal and he required a permit from the Coastal Commission. 

The Surfrider Foundation started legal proceedings against the businessman a year ago, arguing that Mr Khosla should be forced to pay the maximum fine of $15,000 a day - which would amount to around $20million.

They have been campaigning on behalf of at least 100 people who have been arrested for 'trespassing' on the beach, according to court documents.  

The technology mogul's attorneys argued that the Coastal Commission was a 'runaway' body and his Fifth Amendment property rights.

Mr Khosla, who owns the road but not the beach itself, claimed he simply wanted to establish that he cannot be forced to allow people on his property. 

Judge Barbara Mallach of the San Mateo County Superior Court ruled against him, stating that closing the gate to the road was illegal.

She said that Mr Khosla, who owns the land via limited liability corporations, should stop preventing the public from accessing and using the water, beach and coast at Martin's Beach until a resolution of his permit application has been reached by San Mateo County or the Coastal Commission. 

'Today's decision is a huge victory for all of the people of California,' Joe Cotchett, the attorney representing Surfrider told NBC. 

'It affirms that great wealth cannot be used to circumvent and ignore the law. Everyone can again visit Martin's Beach.'

Khosla and his attorney released a statement Wednesday afternoon expressing disappointment in the court ruling. They added that they will consider their options for an appeal - meaning litigation could still go on for years.

The Surfrider Foundation has been campaigning for the beach to be reopened to the public and began legal proceedings against the technology mogul a year ago 

He was however not required to pay any fines. 

The beach is about 35 miles south of San Francisco and is a favourite with surfers for its great waves. 

In California, unlike in many other states, all beaches are open to the public under the constitution.

But private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their properties. 

Last year the Surfrider Foundation, a coastal protection group, filed the lawsuit to open access to Martin's Beach, arguing that closing the approach amounted to a violation of the state's Coastal Act, which governs issues including shoreline access.  

But Mr Khosla, a father of three, who owns the land via limited liability corporations, had closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people out.
