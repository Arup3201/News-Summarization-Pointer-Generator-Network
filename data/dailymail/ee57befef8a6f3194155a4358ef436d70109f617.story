A paralysed student has graduated from university thanks to the help of a stranger who has spent the last eight years pushing him to high school and college lessons in his wheelchair.

Collin Smith, 22, was left paralysed from the chest down after an horrific car crash before he began his freshman year.

But when 72-year-old Ernest Greene heard about the youngster's plight through his local church he offered his help.

Helping hand: Ernest would even sit in class with Collin and take lecture notes for him

Reward: Ernest was given an honorary diploma at Collin's graduation ceremony for his help

The former engineer has pushed Mr Smith to lessons ever since, even taking notes for the student in class.

And now Collin is celebrating after graduating with a diploma from High Point University in North Carolina.

Collin told ABC News: 'Without him, I wouldn't have got to where I needed to be, it takes a lot to get somebody mobile and to believe they can do things.'

Collin's parents were delighted when Mr Greene contacted them to offer his help, despite having never met the then-teenager.

Since then, Mr Greene has been doing 12 hour days to ensure that Collin gets a decent education.

He would leave his home before dawn to get to Collin's house at 6am where he would get him out of bed and ready to go to class.

Mr Green would then drive 45 minutes across North Carolina to the university campus and sit in class with Collin to take notes.

He would push Collin at least three miles a day around campus.

Always there: Ernest would push Collin in his wheelchair for more than three miles a day

And he got his reward at Collin's graduation ceremony when he pushed him on stage and was awarded an honourary diploma of his own, to rapturous cheers from the crowd.

He said: 'I've been pushing him all over campus for four years I wanted to push him up to get his diploma.

'I've always felt like he could do whatever he wanted to do.'

Friends: The two men have a strong bond after spending eight years as friends
