A former petrol station owner has made a mint after selling the world's only 'silver' two-pence piece for almost £1,400.

David Didcock discovered the bizarre coin among a roll of brand new pennies while filling the till at his petrol station in Poole, Dorset, in 1988.

Intrigued by the peculiar coin, Mr Didcock researched it and discovered it had been accidentally made from cupro-nickel in a strange quirk of the striking process.

Auctioneer Richard Brommel with the 2p coin that sold at auction for £1,357, 67.850 times its face value

It is thought the coin, the only one of its kind in existence, was made from a cupro-nickel blank that was accidentally left inside a machine used to mint currency.

Shortly before it was made a series of South African coins had been made from cupro-nickel and it is thought the blank might have been from that batch.

Mr Didcock kept the coin in a drawer wrapped in cotton wool for 26 years before deciding to list it for auction.

Experts had given it an estimate of £200 but the one-off coin sold to a private collector for a £1,357, a staggering 67,850 times its face value.

Mr Didcock, 74, from Poole, said: 'At the time I owned a petrol station and I was opening up for the day when I realised there were no two pence pieces in the till.' He had a lucky break when he found a unique coin

Mr Didcock, 74, from Poole, said: 'At the time I owned a petrol station and I was opening up for the day when I realised there were no two pence pieces in the till.

'I got a new roll and tipped them into the tray but spotted a silver coin in amongst all the others. I was in a rush as I was going to a funeral so I put it in my pocket.

'Later that day I took a closer look and realised what it was, I thought 'Well this is different'.

'I started asking around and realised what it was, and I spoke to a few auctioneers who said if I got the authenticity I could sell it.

'The Royal Mint wouldn't give it to me and wanted the coin back.

'It appeared in the paper and people said to me 'You could retire on that'.

'I really enjoyed watching the auction and I'm very pleased with the result, it's great.'

The coin was sold at Charterhouse auction house in Sherborne, Dorset, on Friday.

Richard Bromell, auctioneer, said: 'I am incredibly pleased with the result, as is the vendor. The price realised is a fantastic return on investment.

'If you can turn a humble 2p piece into more than £1,300 then clearly you have a winning formula.
