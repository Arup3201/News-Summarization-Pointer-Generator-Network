ISIS is once again urging Muslims to 'kill disbelievers' and attacking Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama for recent statements they have made about the terrorist group in a new audio recording.

Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani refers to Sec. of State Kerry as 'the old uncircumcised geezer' and calls Pres. Obama 'the mule of the Jews' on the recording, which is roughly 42-minutes long.

He then asks Muslims to do whatever they can to kill those who do not share their faith.

Spokesman: Abu Mohammad al-Adnani (above) attacked Pres. Barack Obama and Sec. of State John Kerry in a new audio recording released yesterday by ISIS

'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State … kill him in any manner or way however it may be,' says al-Adnani.  

France angered the group when four of their airstrikes killed dozens of the group's fighters  after they targeted a logistics depot in northern Iraq this week.

The group then takes aim at Pres. Obama just days after his announcement that 40 countries would aid the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.

'Obama, the mule of the Jews, suddenly became a sheikh, mufti, and an Islamic preacher, warning the people and preaching in defense of Islam, claiming that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,' says al-Adnani.

Low blow: The group also called Sec. of State Kerry an 'uncircumcised old geezer' after his comments that the terrorist organization 'did not represent Islam' in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee

'This occurred during six different addresses he made in the span of a single month, all of them about the threat of the Islamic State.'

The group is also directing their anger at Sec. of State Kerry, who said ISIS was 'not a state' and 'did not represent Islam' in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.

'The uncircumcised old geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist, issuing a verdict to the people that the Islamic State was distorting Islam, that what it was doing was against Islamic teachings, and that the Islamic State was an enemy of Islam,' al-Adani says in his speech, which was translated and released over social media.

More airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in these strikes, though she would not say what countries.

These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Pres. Obama.

In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.
