'Booze buses' that treat drunken revellers by the roadside are being rolled out across the country under NHS plans to cope with the UK's summer of major events.

Doctors, the ambulance service and the police are preparing for a potential silly season, due to start with the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations next weekend.

The Jubilee is quickly followed by Euro 2012 and then the Olympics and Para Olympics starting in August.

Extra staff will be on duty in A&E departments and in the mobile units stationed near events.

St Thomas's hospital, opposite the Houses of Parliament, will be on 'semi internal major incident' alert from Monday, a protocol usually reserved for New Year's Eve.

Its close proximity to the West End sees it dealing with a high number of intoxicated people on a regular basis.

Dr Beth Christian, an A&E consultant at St Thomas's told The Guardian: 'We increase our staffing levels in A&E, have more nurses working on the wards, and clear our emergency admission beds in preparation.

'Sometimes we open up outpatients and put mattresses down on the floor.'

Further south in Portsmouth, paramedics will hand out flip-flops to drunk women who can no longer totter in their high heels.

A treatment unit, usually run on Friday and Saturday nights by the Project Safe Space multi-agency hub will also be in operation. Staff can treat minor injuries and provide five mattresses for people to sober up on.

Dr Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, warned the summer's big events would put 'added pressure' on NHS emergency services which are already stretched.

He said: 'The resilience of the system is being tested on a daily basis. The events this summer are added pressure because there will be more people in the country and there will be increased numbers of alcohol cases for departments to deal with.

'Initiatives that safely care for patients suffering from uncomplicated mild intoxication in settings other than the emergency department are helpful.'

Worry: Newly appointed England manager Roy Hodgson may be hoping for a win in Euro 2012 but the ambulance service are worried about an increase in drunken revellers during the games

Meanwhile, Brian Hayes, a senior paramedic with the London Ambulance Service, highlighted Euro 2012 as a particular cause for concern.

The late afternoon and evening England games in Ukraine and Poland will make it easy for fans to drink while watching, he added.

Mr Hayes' service will be deploying its 'booze bus', an ambulance that can ferry up to five intoxicated revellers at a time to a recovery centre in central London. 

The unit opened for Christmas 2011 and in February began opening on Friday and Saturday nights. Between February and April it treated 259 people.

Mr Hayes said the service is 'cost effective' because it stops people from clogging up busy A&E departments.

The capital's ambulances dealt with 66,254 alcohol-related incidents in 2011-12; each callout costs the NHS £225.

Alcohol abuse costs the service millions of pounds each year. In a recent audit St Thomas's estimated that for 12 months from late 2010 it dealt with 5,500 alcohol related A&E visits at a cost of between £3m and £4.3m.

Dr Christian warned that figure 'is the tip of the iceberg' due to large under reporting of incidents.

She added that A&E was 'not set up to be a drunk tank', but 10 emergency beds are usually filled by drunk people.

'This is a very costly way to manage patients,' she said. 'An additional 30-40 patients for an A&E night shift can mean a department that is coping becomes a department that is overwhelmed. The NHS can't afford a £1,000 for every big night.'
