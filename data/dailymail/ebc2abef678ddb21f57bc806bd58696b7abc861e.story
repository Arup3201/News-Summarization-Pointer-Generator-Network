Taco Bell has announced the ascent of its newest indulgent hybrid: the Quesarito, which sees its meat-stuffed classic burrito wrapped in a cheesy quesadilla.

The Mexican food chain states: 'The Quesarito is filled with seasoned beef, premium Latin rice, Chipotle sauce, and reduced-fat sour cream, and then wrapped up in a grilled quesadilla loaded with melted cheeses'

From June 9, the menu item mash-up will be available 'permanently' in Taco Bell's around the U.S., retailing for $1.99 for its seasoned beef option, $2.79 for shredded chicken and $2.99 for a steak filling.

According to Taco Bell's chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, the Quesarito - which packs 620 calories for its chicken version, 640 calories for its steak filling and 650 calories for its seasoned beef - has been road-tested in Oklahoma to a roaring reception.

In fact, it's the best-selling test product since the legendary Doritos Locos tacos; a meaty taco encased in a hard shell made out of Doritos Cool Ranch chips - a whopping 825 million of which have been sold since March 2012.

Last month, Taco Bell finally revealed the list of additions made to its '88 per cent beef', to account for the remaining 12per cent.

The meat of the matter: Taco Bell recently launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12per cent of its beef that is not really beef (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos)

According to the brand, each of the two billion tacos it serves up every year contain USDA-inspected quality beef, water added to keep it moist, 'Mexican spices and flavors', plus oats, yeast, citric acid and 'other ingredients' to ensure the consistency of its seasoned beef.

Taco Bell's unexpected move toward greater transparency, followed by its launch of a breakfast menu in March and now its announcement of the Quesarito, is further evidence of the brand stepping up its game in a bid to take on fast food giant McDonald's.

Taco Bell's addition of breakfast was its largest menu expansion in the chain's 50-year history. The Waffle Taco - eggs and bacon wrapped in a waffle and drizzled with syrup - has been a national hit.

As for its the evening crowd, Taco Bell is also planning to test the waters of the fancier, fast-casual eatery scene with a new restaurant called U.S. Taco Co. In addition to fancier food, the new joint will also have booze.

Jeff Jenkins, 
Taco Bell senior brand manager, said in a statement: 'U.S.
Taco is a new concept sit-down restaurant that offers the best fusion of 
American-inspired flavors in tacos, fries and shakes, for [the] emerging 
demographic of edgy foodies looking for a unique dining experience.'

The opening of its first restaurant, in Huntington Beach, California, is still a few months away, but fans of Taco Bell's fare will only have to wait until Monday to get their hands on the Quesarito: the next installment of the brand's master plan to take over the fast food world.
