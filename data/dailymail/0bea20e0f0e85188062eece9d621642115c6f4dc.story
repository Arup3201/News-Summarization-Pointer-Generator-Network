Two Pakistani-Americans on trial for terrorism-related charges  allegedly tried to kill two US Marshals as they made an attempt to flee a courthouse in Miami.

The incident took place last April in the Miami court complex where the men, brothers Raees, 30, and Sheheryar Qazi, 22, were being tried. 

The Department of Justice has alleged that two men looked up at the ceiling together, distracting the deputy marshals escorting them, who they then punched, ABC news reported.

The men then struggled with the marshals and tried to use 'potentially lethal force' on them while calling out 'Allahu Akbar' in Arabic which translates to 'God is Great'.

The US Justice Department has now slapped an attempted murder charge on the men who were on trial on charges of materially supporting the al Qaeda terrorist organisation.

One of the brothers was allegedly planning to plant a bomb in New York City and both were indicted in late 2012.

The Qazis are naturalized US citizens who emigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan.

During the past two weeks, terror has been in the spotlight following attacks in the French capital, Paris, that led to the death of 17 people.

Most recently two members of a Belgian terror cell were gunned down by armed officers in Verviers overnight, while a third was overpowered after being wounded.
