Nearly half of Americans in key voting areas think race relations have gotten worse under the nation's first black president, a new poll shows.

The survey, taken by Politico the last week of August and the first week of September, found that 46 percent of residents in states and House districts with competitive federal elections this fall believe that racial tension has increased under President Barack Obama's leadership.

Just six percent of voters polled said they thought relations had improved under Obama.

The survey's findings follow the high-profile death a black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot and killed by a white police office. 

Wrong kind of change: Nearly half of Americans think race relations are worse now than they were when President Barack Obama took office

Whites were more likely to believe that racial tensions had worsened under Obama than other races

African-American leaders from across the nation poured into the mostly black town and local residents staged protests for weeks after 18-year-old Michael Brown's killing.

Two and a half years ago the death of another black teen, Trayvon Martin, put race relations front and center after it was revealed that the shooter, volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman, was Hispanic. 

It was white voters who were most likely to tell Politco's pollsters that the relationship between races had broken down during Obama's five and a half years in office, however.

Among African Americans, 38 percent said they thought relations had worsened, compared to the 49 percent of whites who said the same thing. 

Hispanics were least likely to believe that Obama's tenure had brought about increased racial tension in America, with only 30 percent saying relations had gone south while 14 percent said they'd improved.

Roughly the same number of African Americans, 13 percent, were optimistic about the state of race relations. A mere six percent of white voters agreed.

The survey on the relationship between races was part of a pre-election poll that sought to take the temperature of voters in battleground districts.

The remainder of Obama's presidency hangs in the balance as voters head to the polls in November to decide which political party will control the House of Representatives and which party will lead the Senate.

Republicans are expected to maintain their stronghold in the House, and they have a ripe opportunity to pick off Senate Democrats in half a dozen states.

It is critical for the president that this party does not lose its majority in the upper chamber and that it pulls off upsets in more than a dozen House races. Otherwise, Obama will have little to no ability to push forward his legislative agenda during his last two years in office.

With less than 50 days to go until the mid-term elections, control of the legislative branch is still up for grabs, as voters remain divided over whether they want a Democrat or Republican to represent their interests in Congress.

If dissatisfaction with the president is any indication of which way the political winds will blow, Democrats are in serious trouble.

Obama continues to be underwater with voters on the issues they say concern them the most, including the economy and immigration.

And even though a net majority of voters, 66 percent, claim to support comprehensive immigration reform, which the Republican Party mostly opposes, and 51 percent say they support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, respondents to Politico's poll favored Republicans to handle immigration over Democrats by a slim margin, 34 percent to 31 percent.

'It’s not going to be a good year for Democrats by definition,' newly minted CNN contributor and former White House press secretary Jay Carney admitted yesterday on State of the Union. 

'The sixth year is always particularly bad for a president’s party,' the former Obama flack said, according to Mediaite.

'You couple that with the fact so many seats are defended by Democrats in red states where Mitt Romney did very well against the president, double-digits in most cases, and there’s no outcome in November that anybody could say would be great for Democrats, except for barely holding onto the Senate,' he concluded.
