The Air Force charged three of its cadets with sexual misconduct on Thursday, including one accused of rape, just over a week after the government revealed a rise in reports of sexual assault at military academies.

The three cadets all attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but were involved in separate incidents over the past 15 months, the military said.

Cadet Robert Evenson Jr, who faced the most serious accusations, was charged with rape, unlawful sex acts, engaging in an unprofessional relationship and conduct unbecoming an officer.

Evenson has three charges against him 
for allegedly raping a female cadet on one occasion and engaging in 
forced sex acts on other occasions, in all three instances using 'power 
or strength or restraint' to prevent escape.

The alleged crimes are especially egregious as he was one of the cadets who ran the honour system, which, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette, ‘punishes those who lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate comrades who break the rules.’

The maximum punishment for such a violation is expulsion from the prestigious academy.

Cadet Kyle Cressy, a senior, was accused of aggravated sexual assault on a woman while she was ‘substantially incapacitated.’

Cadet Stephan Claxton was accused of unbuttoning and unzipping a female cadet's pants while she was incapacitated, the charging sheet said.

He was also accused of underage 
drinking, abusive sexual contact and several instances of assault, which
included an accusation he punched another cadet in the face.

'Sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the Air Force. We expect the best from our cadets, and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours.'

-Colonel Tamra Rank

Colonel Tamra Rank, the Air Force Academy’s vice superintendent said in a statement: ‘The fact that the charges in all three cases are being referred at this time is due to the near simultaneous completion of each individual investigation.’

She added: 'Sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the Air Force.

‘We expect the best from our cadets, and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours.'

The charges came after the Department of Defence said last week that attacks at the three main military academies – Annapolis, West Point, and the Air Force Academy – rose sharply to 65 in the last academic year from 41 previously.

In September, the U.S. Government Accountability Office had said the military needed greater leadership and oversight to prevent sexual harassment in its ranks.

Col Rank said that while the three Colorado cases were separate, the men were charged simultaneously because investigations in their cases were recently completed.

The military did not reveal the ages of the men charged, nor were the women identified although some of them were described as female cadets.

The charges were not the first instance of sexual misconduct accusations involving cadets.

In 2003, reports surfaced that dozens of female Air Force Academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets for a decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints.

The fallout from that led to a shake-up in the academy's administration following hearings before Congress.

According to the Gazette, rape can bring the same punishment as murder under military law, though there’s only a sliver of a possibility the death penalty would be administered.

The next step in the three latest cases is an Article 32 hearing, which is the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury, the Air Force said.

The accusations against the cadets are deemed by the military as 'preferred charges,' and the hearing will determine which if any charges are finally levelled against them and whether to move forward with court martial proceedings, Air Force Academy spokesman Lieutenant Colonel John Bryan told Reuters.

All three cases will be dealt with separately, Col Rank said, and are expected to begin later this month or early in February.
