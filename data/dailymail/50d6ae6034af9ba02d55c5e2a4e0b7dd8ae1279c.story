He is the Made In Chelsea lothario who's affectionately dubbed 'pug' and 'fat boy' by his co-stars.

And now Spencer Matthews has revealed that he decided to get into peak physical condition ahead of season six of Made In Chelsea after looking in the mirror one day and realising he was fat.

Speaking to MailOnline, the Chelsea boy said: 'The weight just creeps up on me. I woke up one day, looked in the mirror and thought. "Oh great, I'm fat again".'

New man: Spencer Matthews reveals that he has lost weight and made an effort to change his ways ahead of the new season of Made In Chelsea

The Eton-educated star recently lost over a stone at an intense boot camp and has already been using his new physique to attract women after breaking up with Stephanie Pratt.

'Losing weight certainly helps with the ladies,' joked Spencer, who counts his idols as Collin Farrel, Jake Gyllenhaal and David Brent.

'Mine and Stephanie's relationship always had an expiry date, it was never going to last. I didn't allow myself to fall deep into the reals of love; she lives in LA so it was more of a holiday romance.

'We are still close and she is arguably the nicest person I've ever met,' he said of his American-born former flame.

More than meets the eye: Spencer thinks that people perceive him as someone who sits around 'sipping champagne and sh**' but he is actually 'honest, hardworking and ambitious'

Speaking about the upcoming season of Made In Chelsea, Spencer said we will see a different side to the usually outspoken womaniser, insisting that he has even stopped going out clubbing.

Instead, he has been focusing on work and last week released his debut autobiography.

Speaking about his tome, he said: 'Initially I thought it was arrogant for a 25-year-old to write their own autobiography, but it was a fun project.

'My break-up with Lucy Watson was bad so I sat inside and penned the book. Despite popular belief, I wrote it myself and I really enjoyed doing it.'

Changed his ways: He shot to fame as the show's resident womaniser, but Spencer maintains that he has changed and hasn't told one lie this season

Despite having a very privileged upbringing (his parents own the prestigious Eden Rock hotel in St Barths and he was educated at some of the world's top schools), Spencer maintains that he was never spoiled as a child and worked hard for his money.

'Money was never thrown at me. I was only given Â£150 a month between the age of 12-15 and my father never helped me with money.

'I made money through hard work and graft, I worked in a hotel as a waiter and as a nightclub promoter so now I have a firm understanding of money.'

Still close: His relationship with Stephanie Pratt has come to an end, but Spencer still maintains she is the nicest girl he's ever met

He is also hoping that by reading his book - within which he reveals details of the tragic death of his brother - people will see a different side to him.

'People think I sit around sipping champagne and s*** but hopefully this book will give people a deeper insight into who I am.'

Spencer, who describes himself as 'kind, ambitious and honest (in the end)', has big plans for the future.

'In five years time, in an ideal world, I will be acting in some way, in small movies perhaps.

'I have connections in LA because I went to film school there so when the time is right I will look into it. I've read a few scripts but I'm not ready to move yet.

'Made In Chelsea is doing so well and the story just gets better and better,' he said.

Confessions of a Chelsea Boy: The Autobiography, published by Sidgwick & Jackson, is out now.
