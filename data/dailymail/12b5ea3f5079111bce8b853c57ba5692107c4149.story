Steven Gerrard has revealed he warned Luis Suarez not to join Liverpool's Premier League rivals Arsenal as he knew Barcelona would come back in for the Uruguayan international.

Suarez played a pivotal role in helping Liverpool challenge for the Premier League title by netting an incredible 31 goals in 33 appearances.

The 27-year-old has completed a £75million move to the Nou Camp on the back of his fine season for the Reds and his former captain Gerrard believes he was always destined to seal a move to Barcelona.

Gerrard said: ‘Last summer, when Luis was out in the cold and training on his own, I told him ‘Don’t go to Arsenal’.

‘With all due respect to them, I told him he was too good for Arsenal.

‘Luis’ dream, from the first day he came to us, was to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona.

‘I said “If you score 30 goals for us and win the PFA Player of the Year, the Footballer of the Year” - I knew he was going to win them – “they will come back for you”.’

Gerrard believes Liverpool can win the Premier League this season despite the departure of Suarez to Barcelona. 

‘I can understand what people are thinking, because he is such a good player,' added Suarez.

'I am his No 1 fan and no doubt there is a hole that will be left when someone like that leaves. But it was exactly the same when Fernando Torres moved on.

'This club is so big that it moves forward, it’s not about one player. We have been really sharp in the transfer market to soften the blow of a world-class player going. Now everyone needs to share the responsibility of Luis moving on and that starts with me.

‘Last year we were in it until the end and that has given us the belief we are genuine contenders.’
