A young lawyer has been found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House.

David Messerschmitt's body was discovered at The Donovan on Tuesday morning - 24 hours after his wife reported him missing.

The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from The Donovan, but police have not yet said why the 30-year-old lawyer was at the four-star hotel.

Messerschmitt's wife Kim Vuong said 'everything seemed fine' before he left their home on Sunday, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The couple texted that night but he failed to return home.

Killed: David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday morning, two days after he failed to return home

He was found in a fourth-floor room with multiple stab wounds around 11am on Tuesday, the Washington Post reported.

On Wednesday, authorities released surveillance footage showing a dark-clothed 'person of interest' walking into the hotel and impatiently waiting for a lift before walking up the stairs.

The images were recorded inside the hotel around 7.45 p.m. on Monday, a day after he failed to come home and the night before the body was found.

It is not clear what gender the person is. 

Police are asking for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. 

Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009.

After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati, the Enquirer reported.

'He was a star, an absolute star,' she told the newspaper. 'I'm just so sick about this. He was the nicest, most wonderful kid you could ever want to meet.'

In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate.

His biography for the firm describes him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements, the Post reported.

Josh Epstein, a spokesperson in the New York office, said the company was cooperating with police.

'This is an extremely tragic situation and we send our sincere condolences to David’s family,' Epstein said.

Gary Meltz, a spokesperson for the family, also released a statement and asked for privacy.

'We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of David, our beloved husband, son, and brother,' the family said in the statement.

'We ask anyone who has information about this crime to please contact the Washington, D.C. Police Department at 202-727-9099.'
