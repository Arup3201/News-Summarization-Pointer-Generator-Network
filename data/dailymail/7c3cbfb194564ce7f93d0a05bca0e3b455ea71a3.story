Missing schoolgirl 12-year-old Tia Sharp's body was found in her grandmother's house, but why did it take seven days to find it?

Police have admitted 'human error' meant officers failed to discover the body of Tia Sharp in her grandmother's house one week after her disappearance.

More than 100 officers were assigned to the case, yet had no success in locating her for seven days, even though she was found in Christine Sharp's house - the first location the police were called to.

Day after day the police searches saw little progress, even the addition of highly-trained sniffer dogs, who were brought into the house, failed to find any trace the 12-year-old.

The blunders have caused a wave of criticism of the police who today apologised to Tia's mother for their handling of the case.

In a statement South-East London Area Commander Neil Basu said: 'An early review has been conducted and 
it is now clear that human error delayed the discovery of the body 
within the house.

'We have apologised to Tia's mother that our procedures
did not lead to the discovery of the body on this search.'

He told the press conference at New Scotland Yard today: 'It is important that we explain more about the circumstances of the searches.

'Four scene examinations were conducted of the property. The first followed immediately from the missing person report that was received on Friday 4 August.

An initial visit was made to assess the situation and examine the property. This visit was not regarded or viewed as a full search of the property.

'The second visit was a full search of the property with the consent of the occupiers. This was conducted on 5 August over a period of two hours. All parts of the premises were searched including the location where a body was discovered, five days later, on Friday 10 August.'

'A third visit was undertaken on 8 August. This was not a search, but the attendance of a body recovery dog to assist the investigation team in their enquiries.

'It is not appropriate to comment further on aspects of the criminal investigation currently being conducted but our investigation was such that it was decided that a further intrusive search needed to be undertaken - it was that search, yesterday, which resulted in the discovery.

'On behalf of the Metropolitan Police I apologise for the distress and concern this delay will have caused.'

Specially-trained sniffer dogs were brought into Tia Sharp's grandmother's house to help find clues. Yet they did not find her body until two days after the dogs were used

Christine Sharp's house, the eventual scene of Tia's body, was searched on several occasions by forensic officers

Neighbours
in the New Addington estate where Tia lived have already expressed 
their disappointment in the police's performance, saying they felt let 
down.

Retired
Scotland Yard Commander John O'Connor is the most senior figure so far 
to go public with criticism of the way the case has been handled.

'The police should have gone into that house quicker. Clearly Hazell should have been treated as a suspect from the off. he was the last person to see Tia alive,' he told The Sun.

'if police have enough evidence to bring in sniffer dogs, then they have enough evidence to pull the place apart. It's unforgiveable they didn't do that.' 

'You can't rely on a dog - you need human beings. They haven't done very well. That child should have been found much quicker.'

The alarm was first raised over Tia's disappearance on the evening of Friday August 3 when she did not appear for her dinner.

The police, some diverted from Olympics duty, with the help of local residents, began searching the local area on Saturday 4 August.

A whole hoard of police were involved in looking for Tia, with some even pulled off Olympics duty to find her

Police teams searched bins in the area of Tia Sharp's disappearance and stopped local collections taking place

On Sunday 5 August a pair of glasses were found in a nearby street which was cordoned off. The glasses were later discounted.

Monday saw police begin to look through CCTV footage of of trams and buses between New Addington and Croydon, where Hazell said Tia was headed.

The next day saw specialist police search woodland known as Birchwood, The search included garages, sheds, outhouses, and a local school.

Refuse collections were then withdrawn in the local area to help the search.

Sniffer dogs were sent into Christine Sharp's house on Wednesday 8 August, specially trained to detect blood and evidence of composition. It was on this day when Hazell was interviewed as a witness.

The search returned to Christine Sharp's house on Friday 10 August, and this was when the body was eventually found.
