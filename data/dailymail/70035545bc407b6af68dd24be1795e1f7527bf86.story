James Milner has responded to Paul Scholes' suggestion that Manchester City's recent struggles have stemmed from underestimating their opponents.

Prior to Sunday's Manchester derby, which City won 1-0, the former Manchester United midfielder claimed: 'There is something about them (City).'

'You may even call it a touch of arrogance - that they don't have to take their opposition into consideration.'

Quick to dispel the accusations, City midfielder Milner came out to show his support for his manager and team-mates.

'We go out there with a game plan, and if we hit our standards we can beat anyone - we've proved that.'

Milner also reflected on City's recent below-par performances, with their derby win the first in four games after losses to Newcastle and West Ham.

'We've not been at our strongest over the last few weeks, and the players know that. It's down to us to change that, and the derby win will go a long way to changing it.

'We didn't play as well as we can but it was all about the win.'

With a busy schedule ahead in the lead up to the festive period, the 28-year-old sees that there is certainly room for improvement, and that getting the wins is imperative for them to get back to form. 

'We can improve performance-wise, but it was all about getting a win and Wednesday is the same. We have to get three points and if we play to our level we will.'

'It's a busy period now - we have an international break coming up but then games come thick and fast and Christmas is always a tough time.

'The league table always seems to change dramatically going into December, and again coming out of it.

'So of we can keep getting the results and get one or two boys back from injury, I am sure we can be in a good position going into the end of the season.'
