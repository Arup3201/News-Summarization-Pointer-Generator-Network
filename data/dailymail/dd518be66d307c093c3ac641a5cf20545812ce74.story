While E.L. James is still reaping the rewards of her sexually explicit Fifty Shades of Grey novel, one author isn't having as much luck.

Nancy Huston has received one of the literary world's least coveted prizes: the Bad Sex award.

Her novel Infrared, which was written in French and
translated into English, even beat Newsnight's economics editor Paul Mason and veteran US writer Tom Wolfe to the top spot.

Top spot: Nancy Huston has won the title of the Bad Sex award

Although the 59-year-old was unable to attend the ceremony
at London's In And Out Club she passed a message on to organisers.

She said: 'I hope this prize will incite thousands 
of British women to take close-up photos of their lovers' bodies in all 
states of array and disarray.'

'She
would have lain down in the warm mud for him, even the mud of the 
pigsty, to enter the exaltation she found in his brute love …' Gertrude 
and Claudius, John Updike

'That
night she cradled me in her arms and soothed me; told me what I needed 
to be told; strengthened me. On that night of 12 May 1994, I needed that
love Cherie gave me, selfishly. I devoured it to give me strength. I 
was an animal following my instinct.' – A Journey, Tony Blair

Huston, who is now based in Paris is the third female to win the prize, which is officially titled the Literary Review Bad Sex in Fiction Award and was launched in 1993.

The prize aims to highlight and discourage 'crude, badly written, or perfunctory use of passages of sexual description in contemporary novels'.

Infrared is the tale of Rena Greenblatt, a photographer who has an art of taking infra-red images of her lovers during sex.

One passage from the novel that particularly struck judges was: 'Oh the sheer ecstasy of lips and tongues on genitals, either simultaneously or in alternation, never will I tire of that silvery fluidity, my sex swimming in joy like a fish in water, my self freed of both self and other, the quivering sensation, the carnal pink palpitation that detaches you from all colour and all flesh.'
