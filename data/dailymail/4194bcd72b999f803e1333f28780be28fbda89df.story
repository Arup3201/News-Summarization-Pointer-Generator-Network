A Utah man was put on notice by the federal government last month over his business where he physically mints digital currency.

Mike Caldwell has spent years taking bitcoins - digital currency used in online transactions - and actually turning them into physical coins for online consumers.

Caldwell's business model was simple: people would send him bitcoins over the Internet and he would send them back a physical, metal coin in the mail.

Bitcoins: Mike Caldwell is suspending his bitcoin minting business after receiving a letter from the federal government

To spend a bitcoin, you need a secret key - a compilation of numbers and letters. So when Caldwell mints his physical bitcoins, he hides the key behind a tamper-resistant strip.

According to Caldwell, he's minted the equivalent of roughly $82 million in bitcoins.  

That much business has put him on the federal government's radar and now his business of turning digital currency into physical coins could be coming to an end.

In November, Caldwell got a letter from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FINCEN - an arm of the Treasury Department that interprets the nation's anti-money-laundering and financial crime regulations.

'They considered my activity to 
be money transmitting,' Caldwell tells Wired.

To legally transfer money, there are a lot of regulations that must be followed, and Caldwell hasn't been following them.

Since receiving the letter, Caldwell has stopped minting his coins and no longer is taking orders for his popular Casascius bitcoins.

According to Caldwell, though, he doesn't think he transmits money - he doesn't accept any type of actual currency because he is paid in bitcoins.

Caldwell charges about $50 per bitcoin but he's paid in digital currency. The coins he sends through the mail, he argues, are not actual money and should be viewed as collectibles. 

The feds, however, see things differently, and rather than cross Uncle Sam even further, Caldwell says he plans to fulfill his final few orders and then calling his lawyer before he continues to produce physical versions of digital money.
