Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas admits the club have hit 'rock bottom' following Tuesday's 4-3 home defeat by Schalke in the Champions League.

Carlo Ancelotti's side have hit a disappointing run of form after surrendering top spot in La Liga to rivals Barcelona following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao having dropped two points six days earlier against Villarreal at the Bernabeu.

Real still qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals despite Tuesday's defeat and Casillas is keen to look forward and stop the rot.

Speaking to Spanish sports paper AS, Casillas said: 'We have hit rock bottom in a resounding way but the positive is that next week we play again and we can forget the last ten days. Because they have been ten dramatic days.

The Spaniard, who suggested Madrid have a chance of turning things around when they face Barcelona a week on Friday, admits Real must improve if the club are to progress any further in the Champions League.

'We are not up to the standards we should be as Madrid and the quarter-finals of the Champions League,' said the 33-year-old.

'We are in a privileged position and now what we have to do is think about tomorrow. We can't look back, nor can we remember those 22 victories or other things we have succeeded in.'

Schalke took a 2-1 lead on 40 minutes after Casillas' unconvincing save from a Max Meyer shot led to Klass-Jan Huntelaar's first goal of the night.

However, the Spain international insists it is not a time to scrutinise his own performance.

'I think a goalkeeper is always to blame. It was not one of my best games but it's not a time to think about yourself. Despite not doing what we should have done, we were able to get through.

'The sooner we get the fans on board the better. We weren't at our best.'

At the final whistle, Casillas insisted Cristiano Ronaldo - who cut a frustrated figure for most of the night - acknowledged the fans. 

The former Manchester United winger did not appear to be too happy at the end of the game despite his side's progression in the Champions League.

Ronaldo shook his head in disgust repeatedly and stared into the camera with a frosty glaze following Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat on the night.

In fact, Ronaldo was so angry that he told reporters: 'I won't talk again until the end of the season.'

Real Madrid fans jeered their side's players throughout the defeat and waved white hankies to show their unhappiness at the performance.
