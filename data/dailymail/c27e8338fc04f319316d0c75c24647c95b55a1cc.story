The Prime Minister does it, Barack Obama does it. And now, it seems, even gorillas do it. We’re talking, of course, about monkeying around, Gangnam-style.

Gerhard, an infant Western Lowland gorilla at Apenheul Zoo in the Netherlands, is wowing visitors with his own moves inspired by the worldwide dance craze.

The youngster’s bandy legs are an advantage when it comes to  imitating Gangnam star Psy, and he exuberantly slaps his hips and waves his arms just like the effervescent South Korean rapper.

Perfection: The gorilla apes Psy's routine as he gets into the groove

Psy’s catchy single topped the charts in 40 countries and received a billion YouTube hits, making it the most viewed video in the history of the internet.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon – displaced as the world’s most famous South Korean – even hailed the infectious hit as a force for global peace.

And he wasn’t the only world leader to be impressed. President Obama revealed that his daughters taught him the moves, while David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson are known to have copied the routine at Chequers after a lively afternoon in a nearby pub.

Anything you can do: Gerhard is the epitome of cool - much like the rapper

Psy, 34, spent a month perfecting his moves. He said he tried several ‘cheesy’ animal-inspired dance steps before settling on pretending to ride a horse, alternately holding the reins and spinning a lasso.

Psy is said to have made more than £5 million from the worldwide smash. And Gerhard? Zookeepers say the new king of the swingers gets peanuts.
