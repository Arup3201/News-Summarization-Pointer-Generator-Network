The Canadian woman who was reportedly kidnapped by ISIS has said she is fine, and that rumors of her capture spread on jihadist websites are untrue. 

Gill Rosenberg, 31, joined the ranks of the Kurdish peshmerga fighting force this year, which has elite all-female units.

ISIS sources reported Sunday that Rosenberg was captured in the contested town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, and were gleefully debating whether to execute her or try to negotiate a prisoner swap.

But now Rosenberg, who leaves sporadic updates about her campaign against extremism on Facebook, has posted to clarify that she is in fact alive and well.

Before: Rosenberg, who went to Syria earlier this year, is pictured above before she left 

She wrote: 'Guys, I'm totally safe and secure. I don't have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security.

'I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bu*****t news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured.'

Sources in the Kurdish militia also confirmed that she is unharmed and was not captured.

Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane, said he had been told by peshmerga members she is fine, and dismissed the reports of propaganda..

Even when the initial reports came out, some sources were sceptical and said Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobane in the first place. 

Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border.

She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault.

Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role. 

After the reports over the weekend of her capture, Canadian and Israeli government sources said they were investigating the possibility.

IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.

At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.
