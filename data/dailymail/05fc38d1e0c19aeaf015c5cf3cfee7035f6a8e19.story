A Captain Kirk action figure, Iron Man toys and part of a Tyrannosaurus rex are to be sent into orbit around the Earth as the ‘crew’ of the first test flight of Nasa’s next generation Orion space capsule.

The spacecraft will also carry a sample of soil from the Moon, an oxygen hose from an Apollo mission spacesuit and a series of Sesame Street puppets and props.

They are all part of a weird collection of artefacts and memorabilia that will be sent into space as cargo aboard the first test flight of the Orion spacecraft.

The Orion space capsule, the white tip of which can be seen sitting on top of a Delta IV Heavy rocket at the Space Launch Complex 37 in Cape Canaveral, will launch on Thursday for its first test flight into space

Nasa is due to launch the capsule into orbit around Earth in what it hopes will be the first steps towards eventually using the vehicle to carry astronauts to Mars.

Weather conditions for Orion’s launch on Thursday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, scheduled for 07.05 EST (12.05 GMT), are looking favourable.

Orion is Nasa's first manned space capsule since the Apollo module and will allow the US to regain its capability to launch astronauts into space, which it lost after the retirement of the Shuttle.

The Orion Exploration Test Flight 1 is designed to expose the capsule to the conditions it will experience when returning from deep space missions to asteroids and Mars.

Upon reentry it will reach speeds of up to 20,000 mph and its heat shield will have to bear the brunt of the scorching plasma that builds up as the spacecraft dives through the atmosphere.

Temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees C before it slows down enough to deploy its parachutes before dropping into the sea.

Astronauts in Orion will also travel through areas of space where intense radiation can be encountered and the capsule will need to protect them from this.

 The test flight will send Orion through the inner Van Allen belt, a deadly zone of radiation trapped by the Earth's magnetic field.

Radiation experiments onboard the test flights will measure how electronics and astronauts might survive in this hostile environment if they are inside the capsule. 

Yet despite the crucial nature of the test flight, Nasa has packed many of the lockers inside with toys and memorabilia, including a toy figure supplied by William Shatner and a fossil from a T. rex. 

The spacecraft, and its cargo, will be carried into orbit on a Delta 4 Heavy Rocket, taking it 3,600 miles above there Earth, about 15 times higher than the International Space Station.

During the four and a half hour flight the capsule will orbit the Earth twice before beginning its violent descent back into the atmosphere as scientists attempt to test its heat shields.

Reaching speeds of up to 20,000 mph, the 16 feet wide heat shield will have to withstand temperatures of more than 3,300 degrees C (6,000 F).

A suite of more than 1,200 sensors onboard the capsule will record the stresses, vibrations, temperatures, radiation exposure and acceleration it is exposed to during the descent.

If it survives reentry, Orion will deploy parachutes before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, where it will be recovered by the US Navy.

'Orion is the exploration spacecraft for NASA, and paired with the Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket it will allow us to explore the solar system,' said Mark Geyer, program manager of Orion, which is based at Johnson Space Center in Houston. 

'Really, we're going to test the riskiest parts of the mission - ascent, entry and things like fairing separations, Launch Abort System jettison, the parachutes plus the navigation and guidance.

'Plus we’ll fly into deep space and test the radiation effects on those systems.'

Technicians pack bags to be placed into Orion's stowage lockers with items from Sesame Street including a cookie belonging to Cookie Monster, Ernie's rubber duck, Grover's cape and Slimey the Worm

A Captain Kirk figurine and Iron Man collectables are among the cargo to be carried on the 3,600 mile test flight of the Orion space capsule as Nasa tests its heat shields ability to withstand the intense heat of re-entry

Orion will travel twice around the Earth before reentering the Earth's atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean as engineers attempt to test how the capsule will hold up against the violent descent

Although it will not carry any astronauts on the test flight, the capsule is designed to transport humans, so engineers want to find out what the conditions inside the cabin will be like.

Officials at Nasa have, however, also decided to continue the tradition of taking mementos into space.

While Orion Test Flight 1 will carry important radiation experiments, the other lockers have been stuffed with a strange assortment of toys, memorabilia and signed celebrity photos.

Among the cargo will be props from Sesame Street including a cookie belonging to Cookie Monster, Ernie’s rubber duck, Oscar the Grouch’s pet Slimey the Worm and Grover’s cape.

When they return to Earth they will take prized spots on the long-running television programme in a bid to educate millions of children about space.

Lockheed Martin, the main contractor for constructing Orion, also worked with the Entertainment Industries Council to collect items from science fiction-related celebrities to fly onboard.

William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek series and is a noted space enthusiast, supplied an action figure of ‘Captain Kirk in Environmental Suit’.

The Orion capsule, seen here inside its launch abort system and service module outside the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, has been fitted sensors to measure the temperature, vibrations acceleration and radiation that astronauts might be exposed to inside during reentry from a mission to an asteroid or Mars

Reentry is one of the most dangerous parts of human space flight as temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees C as plasma builds up on the heat shield of Orion, seen here in an artists impression of the capsule as it lines up to being its race through the Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 20,000 miles per hour

‘William Shatner is thrilled to send Kirk back to space and support Orion, while inspiring future generations about space travel," EIC vice president Skylar Jackson told collectSPACE.

Director Jon Favreau offered an Iron Man challenge coin while Back to the Future actress Claudia Wells provided signed cast photos and a Delorean time machine model.

Mayim Bialik, from The Big Bang Theory, also gave pictures of her ancestors. A collection of pins, medals and artworks will also be carried in the Orion lockers.

Recordings of Mars from Gustav Holst's The Planets, performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, and 'We Shall Overcome' by Denyce Graves, will also be onboard.

Nasa has also placed a tiny sample of lunar soil along with a fossil from a Tyrannosaurus rex donated by the Denver Science Museum, into the capsule..

A microchip carrying the names of more than a million people who submitted their names will also be carried onboard.

In a statement on its website, Nasa said: ‘Together, the artifacts chart humanity's progress and technological advancement as the nation takes a critical step forward on the Journey to Mars.’

Carrying commemorative cargo into space, however, is not a new tradition and has been done since the very early age of space flight.

Nasa's Mercury astronauts carried dimes in their spacesuits while astronauts on the Apollo missions carried photos and specially stamped envelopes.

The Voyager spacecraft have also carried gold discs featuring sounds of Earth along with a range of other information while the Curiosity rover on Mars carried a penny to calibrate its instruments.

A microchip carrying the names of a million people will also be flown aboard Orion on the test flight after the public were given  opportunity to have their names included as part of Nasa's journey to Mars
