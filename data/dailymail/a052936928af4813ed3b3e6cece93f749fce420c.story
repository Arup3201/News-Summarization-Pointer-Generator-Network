NFL player Eric Berry has a crippling fear of his team's own mascot - a horse named War Paint that unfortunately for Berry, takes a victory lap every time the team scores a touchdown. 

The 6-foot, 211-pound Kansas City Chiefs safety avoids War Paint at all costs, though every game he's forced to share a stadium with the animal. 

'NFL Films Presents' ran a special Tuesday about Berry's fear of horses, featuring hilarious clips showcasing his candid reactions whenever the animal makes a move during a game.

Berry says his fear comes from an unfortunate incident in his past where he was bitten by a pony at a petting zoo

In one clip, he's standing on the sideline about to go out on the field when he suddenly spots the horse. 

'Oh, hell naw. There go that horse. I don't f*** with that horse,' he says, as he returns to the sideline bench.

'Huh?' another player asked, apparently unaware of Berry's fear.

'That horse. I wait till the horse pass,' Berry continues. 'I don't mess with horses, bro. It might come over here and throw a tantrum.'

In another clip, the team is huddling with a coach when Berry suddenly breaks away from the group. 

'Hold up coach, that horse out there,' he says, pointing at the animal. 'Horse.'

Berry says he doesn't trust horses and worries that the animal might 'throw a tantrum'

Berry watches videos of War Paint to prepare for a meeting with the horse, in which he will try to overcome his fear

'You need to go on ahead with that horse now,' he shouts. 'I don't fool with no horses. Hell naw.'

Berry says his fear comes from an unfortunate incident in his past. 

'You know all the cartoons and all the TV shows you see when you are young - like horses and ponies are always really, really cool and happy. They always got like a rainbow and some stars flying behind it. You know what I'm saying, like, "Oh, it's a pony! It's a pony!"

'So I'm at the petting zoo and for some reason the pony came and bit me. When it happened I turned around and looked at it. Aside from the fact that the horse didn't look anything like the cartoon or what I saw on TV, it was like, "Dang, horse. I trusted you!" You know what I'm saying? I was really betrayed.'

His teammates and his own father think the fear is silly.

'I sort of think it's hilarious that he's afraid of horses,' his father said.

Finally, Berry reaches out and pets the animal. But he stays an arm's length away

But Berry finally decides to confront his fear at the end of the 'NFL Films Presents' special, and he agrees to meet War Paint in the stadium.

He reaches out to pet the animal with a few fingers, but that's as close as he would get. 

He did offer War Paint a heartfelt apology, however, for being so judgmental of him.

'War Paint, I'm sorry that I, uh, talked about you like that on TV but I feel like we are making strides toward a good relationship,' Berry told the animal. 'Just kinda slow it down on the field and yeah, we're cool.'

Below are some clips of Berry reacting to War Paint on the field. Watch the full NFL Films Presents segment here.
