Chic in a tailored cream jacket and a neat black dress, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for her husband King Felipe's speech at the UN today.

But for once, she had serious competition, which came in the shape of the Netherlands' equally glamorous Queen Maxima.

The two were in New York for the 69th session of the UN General Assembly, which includes a debate in which both King Felipe and King Willem-Alexander are due to speak.

With no speech of their own to make, the two sat together and chatted as they waited for proceedings to begin and, at one point, burst into laughter.

It was all a far cry from the serious business on Monday, when the Spanish Queen and her husband spent the day meeting scientists living and working in New York.

But with Felipe due to make a big speech putting the case for his country's inclusion in the UN Security Council, Letizia and Maxima soon sobered up and watched intently as the debate began. 

Both Maxima, 43, and Letizia, 42, are relatively new to their thrones, with the Spanish Queen ascending to the throne in June and her Dutch counterpart a year earlier.

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, both are mothers to young children and have taken a keen interest in children's charities since being handed the top job. 

But while Letizia's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling.

Nevertheless, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families.  

She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil.

Despite the  tragedy, the Dutch royal couple were cheered to the rafters when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag, along with former Queen Beatrix, 76.

Letizia too has become increasingly popular since ascending to the throne in June, making regular appearances in support of children's and disability charities, as well as on the arm of husband King Felipe, 46.

Most recently, Letizia found herself on the receiving end of a slew of positive headlines after stopping to greet a wheelchair-bound well-wisher who had travelled to the Spanish city of San Sebastien to meet her.

Her hair whipping around her shoulders, Letizia ignored the unseasonably miserable weather as she bent down to chat to the elderly lady.

The engagement, which took place days before she and King Felipe travelled to New York, was part of an unusually intense September schedule which looks set to be replicated over the coming month.
