Reunited: Helen Smith has been reunited with her pet dog Snowy - four years after she disappeared

Helen Smith thought she would never see her pet dog Snowy again after she disappeared four years ago.

The Parson Russell Terrier had been playing in her owner’s garden in Hook, Hampshire, before she vanished in a suspected theft in October 2010.

But the 13-year-old dog is now back home after she was found wandering along a dual carriageway in Portsmouth, more than 40 miles away.

Miss Smith, 50, said: ‘I was absolutely devastated when she was stolen. I did all I could to find her, but eventually resigned myself to having lost her for good.

‘I broke down in tears when I got the phone call to say Snowy had been found. I was in complete shock.’

Staff at the Portsmouth City Dog Kennel had scanned Snowy’s microchip and consulted their database, Petlog, allowing them to reunite her with IT worker Miss Smith.

Miss Smith said she was worried that Snowy would not recognise her as she had poor eyesight and was due to have a cataract operation before she went missing.

But she added: 'I shouldn’t have worried - as soon as we turned down our lane she started to get really excited, so I knew that she hadn’t forgotten.

“She has returned straight to her old bed and she hasn’t left my side since getting home.

'I am eternally grateful I had Snowy micro chipped - without that I had no hope of ever finding your beloved pet again.'

The terrier has been treated for infected ears, obesity and laboured breathing since her return on June 17.

Celia Walsom, an executive at Petlog, 
said she was 'delighted' that Snowy had been able to come back home a staggering four years after she went missing.

'We couldn’t be more delighted that we were able to reunite Snowy 
and Helen, so that she can live out her twilight years where she 
belongs,' she said.

'This case is a fitting reminder that without a microchip, and if Helen hadn’t kept her contact details up to date, we could never have brought them back together and Snowy would not have made it home.'
