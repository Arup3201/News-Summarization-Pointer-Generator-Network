Interest in travel to Scotland from the rest of the UK has declined by 29 per cent compared to this time last year, according to new research.

Ahead of the Scottish referendum on Thursday, industry experts have expressed concern over what independence could mean for the country's tourism industry - but it looks as though its uncertain future may already be having an impact.

According to hotel comparison website trivago.co.uk, hotel searches for Scotland from England, Wales and Northern Ireland between August 1 and September 15 have decreased by 29 per cent compared to the same period last year.

The Ryder Cup, one of the biggest tourism events in Scotland, has not managed to boost this decline, with hotel searches for the golfing event also declining year-on-year by 19 per cent.

And it's not just the rest of the UK seemingly snubbing Scotland: Interest in travel elsewhere in the UK from Scotland has also decreased by 19 per cent from last year. 

Denise Bartlett, UK Public Relations at trivago, said: 'With the future of Scottish independence uncertain and many questioning how this will affect both potential visitors and the country’s tourism industry, it is interesting to note that Scotland has already seen a decline in travel interest from the rest of the UK.

'Despite the Ryder Cup, which was expected to boost Scottish tourism, searches for accommodation in the country have decreased in comparison to last year.

'Although this cannot be attributed wholly to the referendum, it is interesting to note that searches made by Scottish users to the rest of the UK have simultaneously decreased. 

'With many in Scotland voting for independence, it appears likely that interest in visiting England, Wales and Northern Ireland has declined.'

Industry experts this week expressed concern for Scottish travel if the country votes Yes in the referendum. 

Impact: Industry experts have expressed concern over the affect of independence on Scottish travel

Tourism is a massively important industry in Scotland, where it employs an estimated 200,000 people and attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year.

Visit Scotland, the country's official tourism board, said the industry is worth £11bn and showing faster growth than the country's manufacturing, retail and transport industries.

But observers are offering conflicting views over  whether that growth will accelerate or slow down in an independent Scotland.

The impact of independence on border controls, currency, visa requirements and travel insurance have all been under scrutiny. 

Joe Goldblatt, an expert in event tourism in Edinburgh, believes tourism to Scotland will boom if independence wins the vote.

He told travel news and data agency Skift: 'In the short term, tourism will dramatically increase in Scotland following independence due to the enthusiasm and interest in Scottish ancestry and culture.

'In the long term, tourism will grow even stronger due to easier and better visa regulations being put in place that will welcome more tourists to Scotland and encourage them to extend their stay to explore different parts of its beautiful land.'

And then there is the question of whether an independent Scotland should create a national airline.

Faced with the possibility of a new competitor, several aviation bosses told the Independent that Scotland shouldn't bother.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said: 'Don't do it.'

Professor Keith Shaw from Northumbria University, who has written an analysis on what he believes could happen if Scotland separates, said: 'There is also a good deal of anxiety about the implications, for Newcastle Airport in particular, of an independent Scottish government committing itself to an immediate 50 per cent reduction in Air Passenger Duty.

'There are also fears that cross-border businesses would suffer from any variation in exchange rates and from the potential administrative costs of dealing with two different currencies.'
