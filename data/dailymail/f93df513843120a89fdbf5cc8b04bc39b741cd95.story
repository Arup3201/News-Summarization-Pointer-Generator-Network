A woman has spoken of the heartbreaking moment she was told she was infertile because she had unprotected sex with one partner as a teenager.

Jodie Watson, 21, was undergoing exploratory tests in hospital to find out why she and her fiancé had been unable to conceive a baby when she was given the devastating news that she may never be a mother.

She was stunned to be told her infertility had been caused by an STD she had contracted and been treated for as a teenager.

Jodie Watson, 21, caught chlamydia when she was 16. When she started trying for a baby with her fiancé James Jackson, 30, she found the disease had left her infertile

Now, as she struggles to raise money for IVF, Ms Watson has made the brave decision to talk about her heartbreak in the hope that it will stop other teenagers from repeating her mistake.

She said: ‘I was young and I made one foolish mistake that I will pay for forever.

‘That single mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life and I want other young women to know that when they have unprotected sex they are dicing with their future and their fertility.

‘My dreams have been destroyed because of something that happened five years ago but I want to talk about it to stop it happening to anyone else.’

Ms Watson thought she was being sensible when she protected herself against pregnancy before sleeping with a partner when she was 16.

But after going for an STI test she was told she had contracted chlamydia. She was treated with antibiotics and put it behind her.

She says: ‘I’d learned a horrible lesson at a young age, but what young woman doesn’t make mistakes?

‘I put it behind me and vowed it would never happen again.’

Ms Watson had treatment when she was 16 and thought she was cured. When she struggled to conceive tests revealed her fallopian tubes were irreversibly damaged

But Ms Watson was unaware that the damage had already been done.

It wasn’t until she met James Jackson through her work in a care home, that she was to discover just how much her life had been affected by one mistake.

The couple quickly became serious and Mr Jackson proposed.

When they moved into their own home in Hartlepool, County Durham, the couple started trying for a baby.

But after a year with no joy Jodie saw her GP in April 2012.

Blood tests came back normal so she was referred to a gynaecologist in June 2012.

She underwent a series of ultrasounds and X-rays in October 2012, which revealed blockages in her tubes.

Ms Watson said: ‘I was stunned when they told us what they had found, but was not prepared at all when they said it was usually caused by chlamydia. I hadn’t even told James about it because it had happened so long ago, I thought it was in the past.’

But now it was affecting her future dreams of motherhood and Ms Watson was told she was infertile.

‘I broke down and cried. I just couldn’t believe it. I was ashamed, embarrassed and shocked.

‘I thought because I had been treated I would be fine but the consultant said the damage had likely already been done. I had no idea.’

Their only hope of a family lies in IVF but as Mr Jackson had a daughter with an ex-partner the couple do not qualify for treatment on the NHS.

After being dealt the bombshell Ms Watson suffered with depression.

She said: ‘I was just blaming myself every day and wishing I could turn back the clock.’

After researching her condition she read about an operation, which could help to unblock her tubes and increase her chances of becoming pregnant.

Her GP explained there was just a 15 per cent chance it would work but gave the go ahead.

Ms Watson underwent the operation in January this year but has still not become pregnant.

Ms Watson wants to raise awareness about the dangers of unprotected sex as she says she regrets her decision every day and doesn't want other teenagers to make the same mistake

‘They managed to partially unblock the right tube but the left was too badly damaged,’ she explains.

‘There is still a tiny chance I might fall pregnant so I cling to that but I know deep down the only real chance is likely IVF.’

Ms Watson applied to take part in an egg sharing scheme but was rejected because of the STD.

At between £4,000 and £6,000 per cycle the couple are now fundraising to pay for IVF.

She says: ‘After the bills there is hardly anything left to save so I’m doing what I can to raise the money including car boot sales.

Ms Watson has also started a Facebook page to spread her warning to as many teens as possible.

Ms Watson said: 'Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak'

‘I think it’s unfair that I don’t qualify for help on the NHS because my partner already has a child. That shouldn’t stop me from being a mum. I would like to see that rule reviewed.

‘Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak.

‘I know there are people who will judge me, but we all make mistakes and nobody regrets it more than me.

‘I wish I had never had unprotected sex and I wish I had known the full extent of the damage that can be caused.

‘I’m praying for a miracle and hope that one day I will get the chance to be a mother.

‘In the meantime I will do what I can to help other women by raising awareness.’

If it is not treated, chlamydia can cause long-term problems.

In women it can spread to the womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes - this can cause a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

PID can cause infertility and persistent pelvic pain. It also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

Chlamydia can also spread to cause inflammation in the fallopian tubes - this can make it difficult for an egg to travel from the ovary to the womb making conception more difficult.

In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis - swelling of the part of the man's reproductive system that carries sperm from the testicles.

If left untreated, it can lead to infertility.
