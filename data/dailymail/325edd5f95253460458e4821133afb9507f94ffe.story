A Tennessee mother is refusing to change her seven-month-old baby's name from Messiah to Martin after a judge ordered her to.

'I refuse to call my child Martin. His name is Messiah. If I have to do what I have to do for my child and my rights, then I will', Jaleesa Martin said.

The mother and father had attended a child support hearing for a dispute over their child's surname - however the judge had a problem with the baby's first name.

Naming rights: Mother Jaleesa Martin is refusing to change her child's name

While at Cocke County Chancery 
Court, Child Support Magistrat Lu Ann Ballew ruled that baby Messiah 
DeShawn Martin be renamed Martin DeShawn McCullough, WBIR reported.

According to the judge, only one person earned the name Messiah, 'and that one person is Jesus Christ'.

The mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued that she wanted to name her third child with an M too.

Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names.

Christian: Magistrate Ballew has strong feelings about children being named after Jesus - but not with the name Jesus

A WBIR reporter asked the judge what she thought about all the children named Jesus.

'Well, I thought about that,' she responded. 'That's not relevant to this case.'

Martin is amazed a judge could force her to change her son's name because of their own religion.

'I was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs.'

Judge Ballew said she was thinking of the child's future wellbeing when she made the decision.

The area of Newport where Martin and her son live has a large proportion of Christians, said the judge.

'It could put him at odds with a lot of people and at this point he has had no choice in what his name is,' Judge Ballew said.

Martin intends to continue fighting Ballew's decision.

'Everybody believes what they want so I think I should be able to name my child what I want to name him, not someone else,' she said.

An appeal will go before the Cocke County Chancellor on September 13.

The U.S. does not currently legislate baby name choices, therefore Jaleesa Martin has not changed her baby's name yet.
