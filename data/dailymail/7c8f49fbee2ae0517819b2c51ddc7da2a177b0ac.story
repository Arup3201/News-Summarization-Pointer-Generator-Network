Rock star Bryan Ferry was divorced from his wife Amanda Sheppard (both pictured) yesterday

Rock star Bryan Ferry was divorced from his wife Amanda Sheppard yesterday.

In a hearing at London’s High Court, which lasted barely a minute, District Judge Gibson granted the couple a decree nisi - the first legal step to ending their two-year marriage.

Mr Ferry, 68, and former PR girl Miss Sheppard 31, now have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage.

Neither the couple nor their legal representatives attended the hearing.

Court paperwork shows that Miss Sheppard applied to divorce Mr Ferry on the grounds of his continuing unreasonable behaviour.

The marriage was said to have irretrievably broken down.

On the petition before court, Miss Sheppard ticked ‘Yes’ to the question: ‘Is the respondent’s behaviour as set out in your petition continuing?’

The former PR worker also confirmed in the document that they were living apart.

The document was signed on January 16.

The pair married in a simple private ceremony at the Amanyara luxury beach resort on the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2011.

Before their nuptials, Mr Ferry had said he was ‘fortunate’ to have snared himself a younger girlfriend.

He said: ‘The interesting thing is - and I don’t want to say the wrong thing in case I get into trouble with my girlfriend - you never really meet people your own age who aren’t married.

‘I’m very fortunate that I work in music, where you’re in touch with different age groups, either the audience or people you work with.

'It does help. Obviously I’m not ageist!’

It was his second marriage following his 20-year relationship with Lucy Helmore, with whom he has four children.

He also famously dated Jerry Hall for two years before she left him for Mick Jagger.

Following his divorce from Ms Helmore, Mr Ferry began dating dancer Katie Turner, 35 years his junior.

Mr Ferry, who lives in Little Bognor, West Sussex, was reported in the Times Rich List 2010 to have amassed a fortune of £30 million.
