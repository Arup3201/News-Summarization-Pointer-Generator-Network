They have been told to be positive at all times, but England had to dig deep before they could have the desired effect at Lord’s when faced with a combination of one of the greatest batsmen in history and a featherbed pitch.

Even the best bowlers of all time may have struggled against Kumar Sangakkara on the third day of the first Test once he had decided that this was the day when he would finally make his first Test century at the home of cricket.

Yet, when Moeen Ali, almost out of nowhere, forced an edge from a rare loose Sangakkara shot to end his latest high quality century and claim a notable first Test wicket, England suddenly looked capable of claiming a decisive advantage.

A dab hand: Sangakkara nurdles the ball down to the third man boundary

They made two further inroads on a day when each wicket had to be hard-earned and, with Sri Lanka at 415 for seven, still 160 behind, there may yet be an interesting finish to a Test that had seemed certain to end in a high-scoring draw.

This was an attritional day’s Test cricket, with the balance tipping too far towards bat rather than ball, at least until England took three wickets in a final session which said much for their ability to stick to their task.  

Certainly an England attack that included two debutants in Chris Jordan and Moeen, plus a man playing his first Test in seven years in Liam Plunkett, initially had little answer to Sangakkara on what is likely to be his last Lord’s appearance.

It was left to England’s principal bowlers, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, to stem the early flood of runs with the first three wickets to fall on the third day on a pitch that has seemed too batsman-friendly.   

When the truly great batsmen are assessed it is not often that Sangakkara features highly on any list that includes Sachin Tendulkar, Viv Richards, Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting, yet his record stands up against the very best.

It is extraordinary to think that none of Tendulkar, Lara or Ponting ever made a Test hundred at Lord’s and in doing so yesterday, the Sri Lankan became the first man to score three Test hundreds in successive innings on three separate occasions. He is one serious performer.

Perhaps it is because Sangakkara has a poorer record against England that he can be under-rated here, yet there was an inevitability about his destiny in finally getting his name on the famous Lord’s honours board at 36.

He warmed-up by making a hundred here in the one-day series two weeks ago but this was the one he really wanted, celebrating in emotional fashion with his fellow great Mahela Jayawardene.

Reaching out: Anderson tries to grab the ball off his own bowling

By that time England knew their chances of forcing a win were diminishing and until Moeen struck they appeared powerless to do anything to stop Sri Lanka replying with gusto to their massive 575 for nine.

England want Test groundsmen to provide pitches with pace and bounce this season but there was little of that in Mick Hunt’s low, slow, tired surface that, while it may guarantee five days of lucrative Test cricket, does little for the spectacle.

This was more like Colombo than St John’s Wood and that suited Sri Lanka as they attempted to repeat their escape here in 2006, when they earned a draw after England had scored their previous high against them of 551 for six.

Pulling power: Angelo Mathews turns a short delivery into the leg side

Early strike: Anderson (centre) celebrates the wicket of Kaushal Silva in the first half an hour of the day

It took a cracking ball from Anderson and a decent catch from Matt Prior to give England their first breakthrough of the day and their second in the innings, sending back Kaushal Silva, but from that moment life became tougher for them.

Sangakkara was joined by a batsman almost as great himself in Jayawardene and together the gifted pair added 126 with such consummate ease that it looked feasible then for Sri Lanka to claim a first innings lead of their own.

It was apt that when Sangakkara finally went to that 36th Test hundred but first on this ground that Jayawardene should be at his side, his great friend rushing to leap on him and join the celebrations as Sangakkara basked in the adulation.

English heads could have dropped but, to their credit, they kept working hard for wickets and captain Alastair Cook did all he could by ringing the bowling changes and coming up with various fielding combinations.

Ducking out: Kaushal Silva sways out of the way of an Anderson bouncer

Dark days: Black clouds passed over Lord's in the afternoon

Jayawardene was absolutely plumb to Broad and wasted a review by officially questioning the decision, and the second new ball then claimed another victim when Lahiru Thirimanne lobbed Anderson tamely to mid-wicket.

But the big breakthrough was also the most unexpected when Moeen, still more a batsman than bowler but a very promising off-spinner, got some turn and bounce to force a big edge from Sangakkara’s attempted cut. Prior did the rest with another good catch and the Sri Lankan door was slightly ajar for England.

As Sangakkara has nine Test double centuries to his name and scored 319 in his last Test against Bangladesh, a score of 147 was almost a failure and he was quickly followed by Prasanna Jayawardene, Ian Bell taking a brilliant reflex catch at leg slip to give Plunkett his first Test wicket since Chris Gayle seven years ago.

When Jordan nipped in to take Nuwan Kulasekara’s edge and claim his second wicket, England could be satisfied with their day but they still have much more positive work to do if they are to go to Leeds one up in this two-Test series.

When Matt Prior (right) took a smart catch high to his right to get rid of Sri Lanka opener Kaushal Silva, he and James Anderson became England’s leading bowler-wicketkeeper combination with 61 dismissals. The pair overtook Bob Taylor and Ian Botham as the most prolific partnership.

Kumar's dream ton

Kumar Sangakkara had scored 35 Test hundreds before this match but had never scored one at Lord’s. He changed that yesterday with a masterful ton for which he was warmly embraced by his old friend and batting partner Mahela Jayawardene. Both men have said this will be their last tour of England as players.

India block England's DRS plea

England's bid to use Decision Review System video technology in next month’s Test series against India has been blocked.

England officials asked India, the only cricket-playing nation not to employ DRS, to consider its introduction for the four-Test series in the hope that Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement would encourage a change in position.

Tendulkar’s distrust of DRS - introduced in 2009 to allow players to challenge to umpires’ decisions - had been the main reason for India refusing to allow its use in any series they play.But India refuse to budge, which will be a blow to  England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke.

Lights out at Lord's

An unexpected power cut at Lord’s caused consternation on and off the field yesterday. The lights went out twice after lunch, causing both electric scoreboards to stop functioning. Panicked ground staff placed an old-school wooden scorebox from the Nursery Ground under the media centre which had also lost power.
