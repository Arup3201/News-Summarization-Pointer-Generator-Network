Ashton Kutcher arrived back in Los Angeles tonight after his troubled estranged wife Demi Moore was released from hospital today.

The 33-year-old actor looked strained as he quickly jumped behind the wheel of an awaiting SUV and sped off into the night after touching down at LAX airport.

His arrival comes as the 49-year-old actress left the Sherman Oaks hospital where she has been recovering from a health scare which occurred on Monday night.

Mercy dash? Ashton Kutcher arrived at LAX airport in Los Angeles this evening after his troubled estranged wife Demi Moore was released from hospital today

The actor has been in Brazil for the last week where he has been busy attending a slew of events, including a Brazilian fashion show and a Florence And The Machine concert.

But it appears that he may have cut his trip short following Demi's health drama.

It is unknown whether he will rush to be by the actress' side, but his serious demeanor was certainly in stark contrast to Tuesday night, when he was seen partying in Sao Paulo just one night after Demi was first hospitalised.

The Two And A Half Men star looked like he didn’t have a care in the world as he jumped up and down to a performance by Florence and The Machine on Tuesday night.

Ashton was seen with a female companion as he celebrated at the Summer Soul Festival at Anhembi Arena in Brazil. 

Demi was rushed into hospital on Monday night at around 11pm after inhaling nitrous oxide, according to reports.

She is understood to have been released from the Sherman Oaks hospital today.

Sao Paulo is six hours ahead of L.A.,
so news of the Demi’s heath drama broke around the same time that 
Ashton was enjoying himself.

A spokesperson for the star was not available for comment earlier today. 

Earlier today TMZ.com posted a video of Kutcher leaving a nightclub Wednesday night.

While
the photographer asked Ashton: 'Is Demi okay?' the actor refused to 
comment and got into a car with two people including a blonde woman. 

Demi’s daughter Rumer Willis is said to have tried to contact Ashton since he has been in Brazil about her mother’s health.

A
source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Rumer is devastated. She worries day 
and night about her mother and has been watching her mom fall apart.'

'Rumer actually reached out to Ashton on several occasions and he just blew her off.

'He either wouldn’t answer or he’d say he’d help but nothing would happen.'

Other reports say that Ashton is worried about his estranged wife but is moving on.

'Ashton is deeply concerned for Demi,' a source told People magazine.

'He
still cares about her and wants the best for her. But their marriage is
ending and they are both moving on with their lives.'

Ashton
has not made comment on his estranged wife’s condition on his Twitter 
page but has been updating fans with other topics, his last post was on 
early Thursday morning, Brazil time.

It has also been reported that Chloë Sevigny has just been drafted to star in Lovelace, which Demi just dropped out of.

According to People she is joining the cast as 'a feminist journalist assigned to write a story about Lovelace.'

It is believed this is the Gloria Steinem character Demi was going to play.

The Striptease favourite collapsed 
after taking nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, while at her LA 
home on Monday night, it has been claimed. 

She allegedly inhaled the chemical out of a canister commonly 
used in whipping cream cans. She allegedly collapsed after having a bad 
reaction, according to TMZ.

A source told the website the actress started to show symptoms of a seizure after ingesting large amounts of the substance.

According
to the website the 911 tape that made the emergency call to alert an 
ambulance for the actress won't include much detail when it is made 
public.

The L.A. City Attorney is recommending 
that all references to drugs in the 911 conversation between the 
dispatcher and one of Demi's friends to protect the actress's privacy.

The post split behaviour of her former husband Aston is being blamed by her friends for her hospitalisation.

Friends said he is openly flirting with women and then calling his ex-wife when he is in a 'low moment' leaving her confused.

He is also said to have caused an embarrassing scene when he confronted his wife at a Golden Globes party as she talked with basketball star Kobe Bryant when he made jealous comments.

‘Demi was talking to Bryant at a CAA Golden Globes party, and Ashton came over and made a scene.

‘He made jealous comments to Kobe, then Ashton went to the bar and was openly flirting with other women.’

A source said: ‘Ashton has been very sloppy about his private life.

‘He goes between doing ridiculous things and then making overtures to Demi.

Did Ashton ignore Rumer? Demi's daughter tried to contact the actor while he was in Brazil, but he is said to have ignored her, according to reports

‘She took her marriage very seriously, she gave it 100 per cent, and his behaviour is confusing to her.’

Moore,49, ended their six year marriage filing for divorce last November after 'Two and a Half Men' star Kutcher was accused of cheating on her with 23 year old Sarah Leal.

Since the split he has been seen 
flirting with numerous women, most recently with models at the Sao Paulo
fashion week in Brazil.

A source told the New York Post his behaviour is to blame for Moore's health crisis.

In happier times: Ashton and Demi at the Superbowl last year. In November last year the actress announced she was filing for divorce

‘Demi put up with a lot from Ashton — and despite the rumors, she always gave him the benefit of the doubt,’ the source said. ‘But as soon as he admitted [infidelity], she asked him to leave.

‘She helped him build his career, and as soon as he got his own success he became very full of himself. He was pushing and pulling at her for months before they split.

‘Now he’s carrying on like a teenager, goes around with other women, and then, when he’s feeling scared and lonely, he reaches out to Demi. It’s really taking its toll on her. Demi is exhausted and humiliated. She needs some time to take care of herself and regroup.’
