Ed Miliband today said he wants builders, plumbers and mechanics to stand as Labour MPs in a further escalation of his attempt to draw a class divide with David Cameron’s Tories.

The Labour leader said he wanted fewer ‘middle class’ candidates standing for his party in 2015.

And he renewed his attacks on the competence of the government, branding ministers ‘useless’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband took questions from party members on the fourth day of his conference in Manchester

Party members were so keen to ask a question they went to great lengths to attract his attention.

Delegates were seen waving umbrellas, crutches, flags and even cuddly toys to catch his eye.

One construction worker, wielding a hard hat, called for more builders, plumbers, mechanics and shop workers to be selected as Labour candidates in winnable seats.

Mr Miliband backed the idea and said it was ‘something that I have made a bigger feature of my leadership’.

He added: ‘I am not going to start saying we are going to decide who the candidates are but we do have a responsibility to make sure it is not just people from middle class backgrounds to into the contest. You have more absolute commitment.

‘We are right to say we need more women and we need 50 per cent of our MPs being women in my view, that is the only way we can be a truly representative country. We need to be more diverse in terms of ethnic diversity.

‘But it is also got to be more diverse in terms of class background.’

John Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, is reviewing how the party chooses candidates.

Queuing app: Delegates at the conference try to catch the eye of Labour leader using old methods and new

Ed Miliband's conference speech drew heavily on the One Nation theme of Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

But today Lord Prescott admitted he did no know who the Conservative was.

He told BBC2's Politics Show: 'You know me, I'm not an intellectual. Who the hell's Disraeli?

'The Labour Party changes. Ed did a brilliant speech there.'

Mr Miliband unveiled what was described as One Nation Labour, noting that Disraeli gave a famous three-hour speech on the subject in 1842 at the Free Trade Hall, just yards from where the Labour conference is being held.

Lord Prescott added: 'We've had New Labour, Old Labour, all sorts of Labour. I'm just Labour - traditional values in a modern setting.

'I'm the old man in this, but I still think when he talks about the health service, about getting our people back to work and making the changes, having a go at the banks - it sounds like traditional values to me.'

Speaking at a fringe meeting today, 
Mr Trickett, a former plumber, said: ‘We need to rebuild our party in 
the image of the rest of the nation.

'This means redressing the problem of
working class representation. Let me just say this, 7 per cent of the 
population went to a public school but 35 per cent of MPs went to a 
public school – five times as many as in the wider population. We have 
to make sure we reverse the trend we have seen.’

Mr Miliband has been accused of using
class attacks on Mr Cameron, using a party political broadcast and his 
main conference speech to highlight his education at a comprehensive 
school while the Prime Minister went to Eton.

In interviews today he seemed to be rowing back, insisting: ‘I am not making an issue of David Cameron’s background.’

However, his announcement that he 
wants class background to be a consideration when select candidates will
fuel speculation that he will target the upbringing and wealth of the 
Tory Cabinet at the next election.

He was challenged over his support for public sector freezes and tuition fees, and Labour environment policy.

And he revealed he would attend a 
union march against spending cuts on October 20, accusing the Government
of an 'arrogant' approach to public services.

'There has got to be an end to a style of government which is just arrogant and high-handed,' he said.

'It doesn't mean that there won't be 
disagreements between public servants and a Labour government but it 
does mean that you have got to be able to listen.

'And this Government is just totally unable to listen and just behaves in an incredibly high-handed way.'

Mr Miliband's new slogan appears to 
have caught on. He revealed his two-year-old son Sam was watching the 
speech, and after 15 minutes he suddenly said 'One Nation'.

But he admitted he thought his wife was 'trying to make me feel good, but anyway'.

Mr
Miliband renewed his attack on government competence, citing today's 
revelation that the West Coast Mainline franchise process was flawed.

He
said: 'I had the list yesterday of the incompetence of this government,
little did I know that the lost would be out of date in less than 24 
hours.

‘What can you say about the West Coast Mainline fiasco.

‘It is a disgrace that it is going to cost £40m of taxpayers money because they have so bungled this franchise.

‘The Prime Minister needs to get a grip on this useless incompetent government.

‘There is a pattern  with this government. Already we see them scurrying for cover. It is not their fault.

‘They always find somebody else to blame, this time it’s the civil service.

‘It’s
David Cameron’s ABC. When it comes to who is to blame, it is "Anybody 
But Cameron". That is the reality of this government.’

Mr Miliband's schooldays at a comprehensive school are being contrasted with David Cameron's time at Eton

Tonight a 
Labour party political broadcast will again emphasise Mr Miliband's 
upbringing and experience at Haverstock school, a comprehensive in north
London.

In the broadcast, Mr  Miliband says: 
'Every young person should feel they can have a career, a future like I 
had, you shouldn’t be the lucky few.

'I think the education that I got at this comprehensive was so much more than how to pass exams.

'It
was about how do you look after yourself, it was about the world is a 
complex place with people of all kinds and all nationalities, all 
classes, all races and you know, that is a really important lesson in 
life.'

Earlier, the Liberal Democrats launched a poster campaign in Manchester attacking Mr Miliband.

A
van circulated the city with an advert depicting the Labour leader as a
poodle on a lead held by a pin-striped banker, under the slogan: 
'Labour: 13 years as the bankers' lapdog. Two years trying to hide it.'

A
Lib Dem spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband's political education didn't take 
place at school in Primrose Hill but in the Treasury under Gordon Brown.

'He and Ed Balls were special advisers to Brown when they let the banks run amok and claimed to have abolished boom and bust.'

But Labour was disimissive of the criticism.

A
Labour source said: 'This is ridiculous, desperate stuff from a party 
that voted to help David Cameron give a £40,000 tax cut to 8,000 
millionaires.'
