A damning official report has laid bare how tax officials are wrongly rejecting thousands of complaints about bills.

The independent tax watchdog is finding in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigates, it has emerged.

All of these will have first endured months of fighting HM Revenue & Customs before being allowed to take their case to the Tax Adjudicator.

The report also warns that customers who are forced to use the internet to pursue complaints risk getting a raw deal.

In many instances, the victims are vulnerable pensioners on low fixed incomes forced to spend months fighting officials before being told they will not have to pay.

Over the 12 months to March 31, the adjudicator received 12,074 inquiries from the public about shabby treatment at the hands of HMRC. 

It resolved 2,311 complaints – nearly double the number last year. Of these, 2,073 went in favour, or partly in favour, of the consumer.

The adjudicator ordered HMRC to pay out £246,000 for poor complaints handling and causing worry and stress. Nearly £4million of tax was written off.

Robin Williamson, director of the charity Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, described the figures as ‘shocking’.

‘The people that take their case to the adjudicator have already hung on and gone after HMRC with a complaint and stuck to their guns all the way through,’ he said. ‘Many will have given up or not known they can complain.’

Many complaints are initially rejected by officials and taxpayers need to use a little-known rule – called an Extra-Statutory Concession – to attempt get the bill written off. If this is again rejected they have little option but to take their case to the independent adjudicator. This whole process can take months.

Adjudicator Judy Clements said some tax staff were in danger of ‘being left behind in their understanding of complaints and customer service’ and showed ‘no sense of urgency when making decisions on customer issues’. 

She also added: ‘I am disappointed to see HMRC staff still overlooking the needs of some vulnerable customers.’

As HMRC has put more information online and shut its walk-in inquiry centres, it has been accused of failing to support taxpayers who don’t have access to the internet or have problems understanding complex tax forms.

The adjudicator’s report is a vindication of Money Mail’s fight to expose the scandal of pensioners unjustly hit with tax bills. 

It comes as HMRC is under fire for plans to seize cash directly from the bank accounts or savings of people accused of not paying tax.

A spokesman for HMRC said it had ‘worked hard’ to improve how complaints were handled.

‘We expect the adjudicator to uphold fewer complaints this year as our improved procedures were then in place,’ said the spokesman.
