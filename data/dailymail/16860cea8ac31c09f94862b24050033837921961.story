It's seen as the ultimate month for sunshine and glorious weather - but August is also the month you're most likely to be struck by lightning.

Research shows the summer month is the peak time for thunderstorms - and that sheltering away from the inclement weather does not stop you being hit. 

Findings from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) show lightning can easily strike homes, as electrical currents surge through metal wires and pipes.

August is the month that people are most likely to be hit struck by lightning, according to researchers from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (stock image)

The organisation, which has been researching lightning, storms and tornados since it was founded in 1974, said almost as many people had been struck indoors as outdoors, even when windows and doors are closed.

Derek Elsom and Jonathan Webb told the Times that a quarter of all indoor incidents took place while the person was either using or touching their landline phones - one of the most dangerous things to do during a thunderstorm .

Researchers from TORRO revealed that 722 people were hit in Britain between 1988 and 2012, an average of 29 each year.

It compiled the figures using lightning incidents from the media, NHS 
reports and incidents sent in by the public.

On average, this means two people are killed by lightning per year - though it is expected many more incidents go unreported.

In 1982, as many as 14 people were killed by lightning. But there were no deaths
 in 2000 or 2001 - the first year that had happened since 
1937.

In England and Wales, about 80 per cent of those killed by lightning were men. That is believed men tend to work outdoors more than women, TORRO says.

The organisation says there are around 300,000 ground strikes by lightning every year in Britain.

On average, this means that someone is struck once every 6,000 strikes and someone is killed once every 100,000 strikes.

A 'thunderstorm day' may see up to 10,000 ground strikes. One of the most exceptional days in lightning history was on 24 July 1994, when 85,000 ground strikes were produced, TORRO said.

Their survey, published in the Royal Meteorological Society's journal Weather, also tackled widely held myths about lightning safety.

Metal objects, such as necklaces and bracelets, do not attract lightning, but they do increase the risk of burns.

Mobile phones and earphones do not draw lightning, but they too can leave burns and may help to pass electric current into the body and cause more serious injuries.

Being sweaty can also lead to a greater risk of being hurt by the strike, as the moisture instantly vapourises. Sweaty feet can also make shoes explode, they say.

But the number of victims has halved since the 1960s, as fewer people work outdoors and health and safety has improved.
