The 23-year-old, who started his career as a youth at Willem II, has said in the past that his attacking flair and instinct comes from Dutch legend Johan Cruyff. 

Celtic are reluctant to sell in this window but the 23-year-old is eager to move to the Barclays Premier League.

The highly-rated Van Dijk has two-and-a-half years left on his current deal at Parkhead.
