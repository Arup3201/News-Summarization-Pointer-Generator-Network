A struggling clothes store has made a bold marketing move in an attempt to boost sales - by offering an 80% discount for shoppers who make purchases in their underwear.

The Gran America emporium in Paraguay tempted clients with savings of up to 80 per cent - but only if they took their clothes off.

The store, which sells clothes, perfumes and electrical products, made a normal month’s takings in just a few hours as over 100 men and women stripped off to shop.

Naked ambition: The Paraguayan store offered a huge discount as long as customers turned up in underwear, similar to this promotion in Spain alst year

As a result the promotion, which was expected to last an hour, was extended for the whole of the day on Saturday.

Henry Martins, sales manager of the shop in Cuidad del Este on the border with Brazil, told Paraguay’s Vanguardia newspaper that sales had plummeted after Brazil recently tightened customs controls.

He said: 'It was either come up with something creative or go bust. At first we wanted people to go completely naked but realised I could have got into trouble with the law.

'It was a great success. We had people in their underwear taking advantage of the promotion, and lots more coming in to get an eyeful.

'I’ve never seen the shop so full. We’re already planning our next one.'

The concept of offering customers discounted items for turning up without clothes is not a new idea in the retail world.

Earlier this year, Spanish retailer Desigual offered customers free clothes if they turned up at their Madrid store in just their underwear.
