Thomas Sidley, 21, has been jailed for more than four years after joking that it was easier to steal from people than to get a job

A cocky criminal who boasted that he stole from people because it was easier than going to the job centre has been jailed for more than four years.

Thomas Sidley, 21, was arrested in January when he went on a two-day burglary spree just after being released from jail for similar offences.

He was caught after a gang he was leading beat and robbed a man in the street, taking his bag before before the victim managed to call police.

Sidley was arrested, pleaded guilty to robbery and four burglaries, but while being questioned by probation officers he joked that he stole because it was easier than trying to get a job.

After hearing of the remark at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn sentenced him to 50 months in jail for his crimes and shameless attitude.

He said: 'You accept you were the initial aggressor in the robbery, throwing the first punch, before a second man administered kicks.

'The victim's bag was snatched. He was chased briefly. He received an injury to his ear and thigh, but was very frightened.

'You were arrested soon afterwards, you were intoxicated. You say your motivation was to raise money to buy cannabis.

'You even commented to the probation officer that it was easier to commit burglaries than attend the job centre.'

Sidley broke into six homes across Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, in the days and weeks following his release from prison in January.

One victim returned home to find his property had been broken into and goods worth £880, including three laptops, stolen.

An iPad and jewellery were stolen from another house two days later after a glass door was smashed.

Another homeowner found a glass window smashed and a safe worth £80, which contained about £200 and a driving licence, had been stolen.

He was also the lead member of a gang who robbed a man as he walked home from work.

Prosecutor Steven Bailey told the court the robbery happened in January as the victim left his job at a takeaway.

Mr Bailey said: 'The victim was about to leave when a group of men, including the defendant, went in and aggressively demanded free food.

'The manager eventually gave them old chips to get rid of them. The victim spent £8.49 at a shop on whisky and cookies and was also carrying a box of spare ribs.

'He saw the group and tried to avoid them, but they noticed him. He tried to walk away to avoid any confrontation.

'But he was punched to the side of his head and kicked a couple of times to the thigh. His bag was snatched, but his phone wasn't and he was able to use it to call the police after the incident.'

During the case at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured), the judge was told that Sidley committed a spree of burglaries shortly after being released from prison for similar offences

Officers arrived and the defendant was found with the others a short distance away. Two were eating food and the cookies and whisky were unopened nearby.

Sidley, of Tunstall, Staffs, pleaded guilty to robbery and four burglaries. He asked for two other burglaries to be taken into consideration.

Jason Holt, defending, admitted the robbery was a 'mean' offence, adding: 'It was to try and humiliate rather than any particular desire to steal.'
