A man in Georgia last week stumbled across what he now calls 'the best hunting story of my life'.

Out looking for deer in the woods near his home in Chattahoochee Hills, Casey Sanders said he heard a shout before seeing a naked young man stranded by a creek.

Shocked and suspicious, Sanders announced that he was armed and started filming the bizarre encounter, which took place on October 2.

He soon figured out the confused twenty-something had attended the electronic dance festival TomorrowWorld, which was set on a 500-acre property not far away, but had finished four days earlier.

Dazed and confused: A naked reveler from music festival TomorrowWorld in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, is found stranded in a creek on a nearby property four days after the dance party finished by a local hunter, who filmed the encounter on his phone

'I was attacked': The stranger, who hasn't been identified, claims he was 'beaten up' and drugged by a group of men and then dumped in the woods, where he remained lost for four days

Appearing disoriented and admitting he wasn't sure what state he was in, the naked reveler eventually said he had been attacked while leaving the three-day jamboree, which concluded on September 28.

'Three guys, they beat the crap out of me,’ the stranger can be heard saying in the YouTube clip, The Houston Chronicle reported.

‘They drugged me out to the middle of nowhere.

'They stripped me down and they kicked me out.’

The man said he had spent 'days' looking for water and, once finding the stream, decided to stick by it.

Sanders continued to interrogate the man from afar, asking him where he was from and his address, which the man could not remember.

The man said he was from Atlanta, a one hour drive from Chattahoochee Hills, where TomorrowWorld was staged.

He also begged Sanders not to call the police. 

After four minutes of filming, Sanders, now convinced the man needed help, stopped recording.

In the comments section of the YouTube clip, he said she pent an hour helping the stranger out of the forest.

Sanders said the man remembered his phone number and called someone to come and pick him up from the main road using Sanders phone.

'I know I was confrontational at first, but what you don’t see is the hour after that of me getting him to safety,' Sanders wrote.

'I mean I did save his life and I didn't call the cops.

'Sorry I wasn't so trusting to (a) random stranger naked in the creek out in the middle of the woods who couldn't differ a dream from reality.
