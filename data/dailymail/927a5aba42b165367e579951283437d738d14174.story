A convicted British paedophile was 
living in the same area on the Portuguese coast at the time of Madeleine
 McCann's disappearance seven years ago, it has been revealed.

David Reid moved to Carvoeiro on the Algarve in 2004, after he was released from prison for sexually abusing young girls.

He
 was still living in the area  in 2007, when three-year-old Maddie was 
snatched from her family's holiday apartment while her parents were 
having dinner nearby.

The 
same year Reid arrived on the Algarve, several British families on 
holiday suffered break-ins and five young girls were abused in their 
beds.

Chillingly, just 
months before Maddie McCann's disappearance, one of his victims had 
warned that Reid remained a threat to young girls and would offend 
again.

'It's part of his being. He'll never change,' the victim said, according to The Mirror.

'Get your kids and your family away from him, Never out temptation in front of him. He just won't be able to resist it.

Reid,
 from Northern Ireland, was living just 30 miles from Praia da Luz, the 
holiday resort where the McCann family were staying, in 2007.

He
 was convicted and jailed for gross indecency and indecent assault in 
Belfast in 1995, but was able to move freely and unmonitored in Portugal
 as the sex offenders' register was not set up at the time of his 
release.

According to locals
 in Carvoeiro, Reid died last year aged 61 or 62, but his family in 
Britain has not been informed of his death, The Mirror reports.

The
 police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann took a 
step forward last week when detective announced that they
 are looking for a prolific paedophile who sexually abused five girls at
 holiday homes in the Algarve before the British toddler went missing.

The
 man, described as tanned, dark-haired and speaking English with an 
accent,  is suspected of breaking into holiday properties where British 
families were staying and sexually abusing five white British girls aged
 between seven and ten,

Reid, who died last year, moved from Belfast to Portugal after he was released from prison where he had served time for sexually assaulting young girls and a boy

The sex attacks took place between 2004-2006, shortly before Madeleine vanished in 2007, and are among a series of 12 break-ins to holiday homes in the Algarve that police believe were committed by the same man.

In six of the break-ins, the man sat 
on or got into bed with young girls.  On one occasion, he abused two 
young girls in the same villa.

Two
 of the attacks were in the resort of Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was 
staying in a holiday apartment with her family when she was taken.

There were also four in Carvoeiro, where Reid was living, and six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district.

Most of the attacks took place in low season, police said.

They
 had previously been discounted by Portuguese investigators because they
 are spread over a wide geographical area and there were no apparent 
attempts at abduction.

Nine
 of the 12 incidents were reported to Portuguese police at the time they
 happened, and details of three of those became known to British 
investigators only after they made televised appeals last autumn.

Witnesses
 describe the man as having dark, tanned skin with short dark unkempt 
hair. He spoke in English with a foreign accent, his voice was described
 as slow, or possibly slurred.

He was sometimes bare chested, some describe him as having a pot belly, and three victims said that he had a noticeable odour.

On
 two occasions in Vale de Parra and Praia da Gale he was wearing a 
distinctive burgundy long sleeve top, on one of those occasions it was 
described as having a white circle on the back.

DCI
 Redwood said: 'This is an offender who has got a very, very unhealthy 
interest in young, white, female children whom he is attacking whilst 
they are on holiday in their beds.'

Police said the suspect may have been
 in the villa or looking round the villa for some time before committing
 the offences or being disturbed either by a parent, or the child waking
 up, and said he remained calm, even when disturbed.

On two occasions, they said, the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby.

DCI
 Redwood said today that tracing the man is one of his priority lines 
of inquiry.

He said: 'We 
need to establish the identity of this man - these offences are very 
serious and no-one has been charged in connection with them.' 

He
 said some of the offences were previously known about, but three of 
them, including what is believed to be the first in the series of 12 
break-ins, were new reports to police and came about as a result of 
their appeal for more information last October.

Mr
 Redwood's team currently have 38 people classed as 'persons of 
interest' to the inquiry, and are also sifting through details of 530 
known sex offenders whose whereabouts they cannot account for.Of those 59 are classed as high priority, and some of those are British.

British
 investigators have so far sent three international letters of request 
to Portuguese authorities over the investigation, covering 41 priority 
areas for the team, involving 287 separate requests.

Deputy
 Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt showed his anger at the slow pace 
of the legal process, saying: 'That's causing us frustration because we 
know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that. But the 
process is the process.'

Another 30 letters have been written to other European countries, but the force would not reveal where.

Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.

After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it.
