A hitch-hiker is 'lucky to be alive' after a van driver who picked her up sped straight into a train on a level crossing.

Martina Jankowska, 26, got the lift in Radom, Poland, but within minutes the driver accelerated towards the tracks where the van was hit by a freight train.

Police in the city in the centre of Poland are now searching for the driver, who fled after the crash.

The driver in Radom, Poland, fled after the crash and is now being hunted by police

Investigators said they were amazed to find Ms Jankowska conscious in the passenger seat of the damaged van.

She told police afterwards: 'I saw the train coming and thought he'd stop any minute. But he didn't - he just kept going.'

Ms Jankowska told investigators she did not think the driver had been drinking.

The vehicle was shunted off the tracks by the oncoming train.

The van's hood was completely crushed and the windscreen was smashed.

Ms Jankowska was taken to hospital with a broken leg, bruising and suffering from shock.

One of the witnesses at the scene said: 'We had been driving behind the 
van and the crossing was clearly signposted stating that there were no 
barriers and that drivers should be careful.

'But instead of slowing down to check if it was safe to cross, this driver seemed to speed up.

'Luckily the train was a cargo train and going at a fairly slow speed, 
otherwise I dread to think what would have happened.'

Another witness said: 'We saw the car two ahead of us hit by the train. It was terrifying.

'We jumped out to go and help when the driver leapt out and sprinted off across a field.

'We found a passenger inside who was in shock.

'We phoned the police and an ambulance straight away.'

Police are now trying to trace the driver through the van’s number plate or forensic clues left by the motorist.

Police spokesman Andrzej Lewicki said: 'The driver had fled on foot. His passenger was taken to hospital and is lucky to be alive.

'We don’t know why he drove onto the tracks nor why he then ran off, but according to the passenger he was sober.

'We didn’t find any documents in the vehicle but hopefully something will turn up on our database.

'Failing that, the van will be examined for fingerprints and other bits 
of evidence that can help identify the man.'
