Even the most experienced of commentators find it difficult when players share the same surname.

So imagine the confusion at a game where all 22 footballers, as well as the referee, linesman and substitutes were all called Bungay.

The match played, at Bungay Town FC, near Lowestoft, north Suffolk, yesterday, is believed to have set a world first because of the team's shared surnames.

No name calling: Every footballer was called Bungay and the charity was played at Bungay Town FC, near Lowestoft, north Suffolk

That's my name: More than 50 Bungays travelled from all over the country and from as far away as Australia - they either took part in the kickabout or went to cheer on the sides as they raised cash for the Jack and Ada Beattie Foundation

The footballers did not let their common ground hold them back - the astonishing clash boasted 12 
goals, a controversial sending off, two penalties, a pint-sized goal 
scorer and a dramatic last-minute equaliser.

More than 50 Bungays travelled from all over the country and from as far away as Australia and America to play the charity match.

The Bungays either took part in the kickabout or went to cheer on the sides as they raised cash for the Jack and Ada Beattie Foundation.

The London-based organisation supports vulnerable people.

The small army of Bungays took in it turns to take to the pitch in either red or blue shirts as they played in a keenly-fought clash.

Game on: The astonishing clash also boasted 12 goals, a controversial sending off, two penalties, a pint-sized goal scorer and a dramatic last-minute equaliser

Shaun Cole, who organised the charity game and is on non-league Bungay FC's committee, said: 'It was an amazing game. 'It had everything - it could not have gone any better'

Shouted on by a crowd of very personal Bungay supporters, the players on both sides, made up of Bungays of all ages and both sexes, served up a treat at the Maltings Meadow ground.

Bungay is a historic Suffolk market town, situated in a loop of the beautiful river Waveney.

It has historic attractions including the ruins of Bigod's Castle, the ancient Buttercross - where a market is held each Thursday, and the old Borough well.

The origin of the name of Bungay is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon title 'Bunincga-haye'.

It is thought to represent the land belonging to the tribe of Bonna, a Saxon chieftain.

As well as the players, the referee was John Bungay, of Eastleigh, Hants, while the on-call doctor was Dr Kate Bungay, from nearby Beccles.

Tempers flared as the ref sent off his cousin, goalkeeper Chris Bungay, a retired trucker who had flown in from Australia to make his name in the match with a difference.

His dismissal also made football history as instead of the red card he was shown the blue card, blue being Bungay FC's colours.

Red-faced Chris said: 'I am sick as a parrot.

'I did nothing wrong!'There was further controversy as the blue side were awarded two last-minute penalties to make it 6-6.

Tricky
striker, Manchester United fan Keiran Bungay, 15, was voted man of the 
match and he told the crowd: 'Thanks for the support guys.'

Other
notable Bungays were tiny hotshot Owen Bungay, six, of Northolt, 
north-west London, and Todd Bungay, 22, of Southampton, who smashed four
goals.

Shaun Cole, who organised the charity game and is on non-league Bungay FC's committee, said: 'It was an amazing game.

'It had everything.

'It could not have gone any better.'

The name-in-a-million game was dreamed up by Londoner Bill Bungay, captain of the red team.
