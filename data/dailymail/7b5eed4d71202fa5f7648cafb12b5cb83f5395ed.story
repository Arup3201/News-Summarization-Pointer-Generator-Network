The first mission to the moon's south pole is being planned by two private companies that want to plant telescopes on top of a lunar mountain as early as 2016.

The International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) and a start-up called Moon Express have chosen the tricky location as they believe the telescopes will get a clear view of our galaxy.

They plan on installing a two-metre radio antenna, plus a smaller optical telescope on the elevated rim of the Malapert crater.

According to Wired, the ILOA has set its sights on building a scientific and commercial base on the moon, while Moon Express wants to become a space courier service in the next 10 years.

The companies have now joined forces with the intention of setting up two telescopes on the Moon's south pole as the instruments will not suffer our atmosphere's hazy interference.

The location also has the observational benefit of not picking up any radio or electromagnetic noise created by modern technology.

The idea to place a telescope on the moon is not new.

Astronomers have long thought about putting telescopes on the dark side of the moon that always faces away from Earth.

It is hoped that pictures captured by such instruments would be clearer than anything taken on Earth or even in space.

But telescopes in the location would depend upon satellite relays, which would be expensive.

The beauty of locating telescopes on the Moon's south pole, however, is that the telescopes would have a 'direct line to Earth,' Steve Durst, founder and director of ILOA told Wired.com.

Astronomers have previously toyed with the idea of planting telescopes on the dark side of the Moon, as they believe pictures captured by instruments devoid of atmospheric interference would be clearer than anything taken on Earth or even in space - the Hubble telescope is pictured

The spot on the Malpert crater also has the benefit of a slightly milder climate than the dark side of the moon.

One 'day' on the moon lasts for the equivalent of an Earth month.

It has two weeks of temperatures of over 120 degrees followed by chilling 'nights' that last for another two weeks when the temperature drops to minus 170 degrees.

This means engineering scientific instruments would need to be able to withstand the extreme climate and this has so far proved challenging.

However, as the telescopes would be situated at the south pole, they would enjoy sunlight for 90 per cent of the moon's day and consequently a relatively stable temperature of approximately minus 50 degrees Celsius.

Solar panels could therefore be used to collect energy and power the telescope, according to Mr Durst.

Due to the more consistent temperature and sunlight, he believes the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the moon.

The south pole of the moon is popularly thought to be rich with resources.

Moon Express, which intends to provide the lander and engineering expertise for the telescope, has ambitions to mine metals, minerals and water on the moon.

The telescopes would be situated at the Moon's south pole which has a relatively stable temperature of minus 50 degrees. Conditions on other parts of the Moon are much more varied. The companies believe the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the Moon (pictured)

The company believes resources could be sold to humans on Earth, while the water would be needed by astronauts living on a lunar base nearby.

Bob Richards, the company’s CEO, told Wired.com that during the mission, he plans on sending a small rover to explore the surface of the site.

The mission, planned as soon as 2016, is ambitious as the south pole of the moon has never been explored before.

Mr Richards conceded that due to the amount of finance needed - around $100 million - and pioneering engineering necessary for the mission, the schedule is tight.

However, he hopes that national and international space agencies will help to pay for the mission and that it will take place by 2018.

Moon Express has not landed a probe on the moon's surface yet but aspires to land on the moon in 2015 to scoop the $20 million Google Lunar X Prize.

The company is planning a mini mission to the moon to instal a shoebox-sized telescope with the aim of testing ILOA's technology on the lunar landscape.

Two American politicians have proposed legislation that would establish a national historical park on the surface of the moon, according to The Hill.

Democrats Donna Edwards and Eddie Bernice Johnson want to create a protected historical park at the sites of the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972.

They reportedly said that the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park would include all the artifacts left on the surface of the moon from the missions of Apollo 11 to Apollo 17.

The text from the proposed Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, reads: 'As commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire the ability to 
land on the Moon, it is necessary to protect the Apollo lunar landing 
sites for posterity.'

It would be run by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Nasa, but first the  US government would have to submit the lunar landing site to the UN and ask that it is made a World Heritage Site.

Ms Edwards and Mr Bernice Johnson are members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.
