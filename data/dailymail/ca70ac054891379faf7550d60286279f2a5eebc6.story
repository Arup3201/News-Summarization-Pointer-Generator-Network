A cancer doctor accused of plotting to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer said he wanted a picture of the attorney with a 'bullet between his eyes', a court heard.

Police said a video showed Mississippi oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr, 70, making the request of an alleged hitman.

The lawyer was unhurt, however, because state agents were tipped off to the possible £20,000 murder-for-hire plot and were waiting at his office when the hitman arrived.

Accused: Oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr is said to have plotted to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer

Alleged assassin Keaira Byrd, 23, who was wearing a black ski mask, was killed in a shootout and his associate was severely wounded.

Smith, 70, is charged with conspiring to kill attorney Lee Abraham, who represented his ex-wife.

Records for the divorce were sealed in 2005, but docket entries show the couple fought over money long after it was granted in 1998.

At a preliminary hearing at Leflore County Court yesterday, Greenwood police detective Jeff Byars said that the doctor kept a hidden camera in his office.

A video from the camera showed Smith telling Byrd that he wanted a photo showing Abraham dead, the policeman added.

'Take a picture of him with a bullet between his eyes,' Byars said in describing the video.

The men’s faces were not visible on the video, and some of it was inaudible.

Byars said that Bird was carrying a semi-automatic pistol with a 30-round clip when he walked into the lawyer’s office on April 28.

It is not clear whether Byrd or the investigators fired first.

Byrd’s associate, Derrick Lacy, 25, was shot several times in the back and in the leg.

A bullet grazed an investigator.

Lacy has been released on house arrest while he recovers.

He is charged with capital murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Smith, with greying hair, white beard and glasses, sat with his legs crossed during the hearing with a brown envelope and his hands clasped on his lap.

He shook his head from side to side when it was suggested he had hired someone to kill Abraham.

Byars said a police investigation discovered a list of possible hit men and where they could be found.

Onlookers gasped as names were read out.

County Judge Kevin Adams decided there was enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury.

The judge ordered the doctor to be held without bond on the capital murder charge and on a conspiracy to commit murder charge.

Smith’s bond remained $100,000 on a second conspiracy to commit murder charge.

The two conspiracy charges are both related to plots to kill Abraham, but involve different men the doctor approached to help carry out the plan, according to testimony.

Cordarious Robinson, 22, is charged in the second conspiracy count.

Authorities said Smith paid Robinson $15,000 for two guns and to 'put his ear to the ground to find someone to take out Lee Abraham'.

It is not clear if Robinson enlisted Byrd, but authorities said the two men met on the day of the shooting.

Smith’s relatives wept when the judge said he would remain in jail.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Steed said there was evidence that a plot against Abraham went back as far as two years.
