A cancer patient is moving to a caravan 50 miles away from his South Wales home in order to receive the drugs he needs.

David Southwood, 53, from Newport, has battled kidney cancer for two years.

He then heard about a drug called axitinib which will extend his life by a year - but it is only available across the border in England.

Mr Southwood, a property manager, believes without the drug he will live for 'a couple of months at most'

Now, he and his wife Angela say they have no choice but to uproot their lives and move to a tiny caravan in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset - far away from their friends and family.

Mr Southwood said: 'There's so much to think about - if I move to England I may lose the consultant I've had for the last two years.

'I have family in South Wales and no family at all in England, so it would be isolating as well to stay there.'

The property manager believes that without the drug he will live for 'a couple of months at most'.

He has already dipped into his life savings and has even sold his car to buy the drug privately, but now says he can't afford to keep paying for it.

The drug is due to become available on the Welsh NHS but Mr Southwood is worried that unless he moves he will die before he gets a prescription.

His wife of 26 years, Angela, said: 'If we lived a few miles away in England he would be able to get access to this drug, which could potentially extend his life.

'Perhaps someone can explain to me why as a UK citizen he is different to the population in the UK that is eligible to receive the drugs.

'To move away from family to have access to the drugs at a difficult time anyway seems totally unfair.'

A Welsh Government spokesman said they are currently waiting for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to finish appraising the drug.

He said: 'We have had discussions with the manufacturer but currently have no information about when the appraisal process will be completed and whether the final advice will be positive or negative.'

Yesterday a 100,000-signature petition demanding that Welsh cancer sufferers get the same access to treatment as English patients was handed to the Welsh Assembly. 

Campaigners called on the Welsh government – which is run by Labour – to create a special fund to pay for advanced but expensive new drugs. 

English sufferers have access to 71 types of pioneering cancer treatment for free on the NHS, available through the £200million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund, which was set up in 2010.
