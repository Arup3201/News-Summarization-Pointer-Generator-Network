Carlo Ancelotti saluted the players who have given him his place in history. The Italian coach becomes only the second manager in history to win three European Cups emulating the feat of Bob Paisley.

'We have thought about this night since the first game of the season and we finally achieved what we set out to do at the start of the campaign. We never lost the faith and we were stronger in extra time.'

Ancelotti had seen the game slip away from Real Madrid but he made the changes that changed the game bringing on the outstanding Isco and the scorer of the third goal, Marcelo.

'It’s 
incredible what we have achieved” said the former PSG, Chelsea, Milan 
and Roma manager. The coach also defended his goalkeeper Iker Casillas 
whose early error could have cost Real their much sought-after Decima 
saying: 'Everyone has played their part in the victory.'

Casillas
 said: 'Sometimes I make mistakes. The team bounced back and we have 
been able to do what we set out to do at the start of the season. This 
feels like something even bigger than winning the World Cup.

'I
 promised this to the fans a long time ago and 10 is a great number. The
 fans have suffered waiting for this moment and all this is for them.'

Real
 Madrid’s president Florentino saluted his last record signing Gareth 
Bale. 'His second goal killed them off and we are finally able to bring 
the 10 European Cup to our fans. We have done it with seven new signings
 at the start of the season. They all came good for us.'

It
 was Sergio Ramos whose goal brought Real Madrid back into the game in 
injury time. 'This goal is not for me it’s for all the supporters, we 
have waited for this moment for a very long time.'
