Maurice Jones-Drew is ready to return to boost the Oakland Raiders’ ailing running game against the Miami Dolphins.

The diminutive running back has been sidelined for the past two games following surgery on his right hand, but practised fully for the first time.

And he is champing at the bit to assist fellow tailback Darren McFadden, with the Raiders ranked 31st in the NFL with an average of 64.3 yards per game.

‘Everything’s good. I thought I was able to go last week. But the coaches just weren’t comfortable with it - they still wanted me to go out and protect myself.

‘This week I feel great: punching, doing everything, taking care of the ball with my right hand.

‘If it was up to me I would have played two weeks ago, but obviously I don’t have the final say here, so it’s one of those deals.’

Head coach Dennis Allen backed up Jones-Drew, adding: ‘I think he’s in a better spot now than he was two weeks ago and even where he was last week. Signs are pointing that he’s going to be ready to go for this weekend.’

After coming up short against the tough run defenses of the New York Jets, Houston Texans and New England Patriots, the Raiders may have an opportunity to gain some headway on the ground.

The 1-2 Dolphins have allowed an average of 125.3 yards per game, but Jones-Drew praised his Wembley opponents.

‘They’re a fast defense. The linebackers do a great job when they blitz. They use their hands well, which is something for a guy with not long arms you’ve got to be able to get into the body a little bit, so that’s something we’ve worked on this week.’

‘And then how they tackle. Their defensive line does a great job of getting penetration so being able to get around the defensive line up to the second level and make people miss.’

‘The last couple of weeks have been hard on us,’ Jones-Drew said. ‘I know Darren’s doing a great job, but it’s been kind of hard for us to get the running game going. So hopefully myself coming in to try and run the ball a little bit and protect it and catch the ball in the backfield will help us out a little bit.’

The Raiders received a boost in the shape of linebacker Miles Burris returning to limited practice.

With both Nick Roach and Sio Moore doubtful for Sunday’s game, Allen has only three fit linebackers to choose from - Kalil Mack, Kalula Maiava and rookie Bojay Filimoeatu, who was on the practice squad two weeks ago.
