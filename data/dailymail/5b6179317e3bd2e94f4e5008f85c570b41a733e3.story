A pregnant Florida woman has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for her part in a 2012 car crash that left another pregnant woman dead. 

Rosa Rivera Kim, 37, of Plantation, entered guilty pleas to the two counts of DUI manslaughter she faced in the death of 26-year-old Alanna DeMella and the unborn child she was carrying.

DeMella, seven months pregnant at the time of the crash, reportedly planned to name the boy Joshua.

DeMella was killed when Kim drunkenly smashed her car into a poolside cabana at Riverside Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, The Sun Sentinel reports. 

DeMella was in town for a two-day marriage conference with husband Michael at the Calvary Chapel after winning the trip and flying down from their home in Wodburn, Mass.

Michael was in the restroom at the time of the accident. He suffered only minor injuries.

Before she was sentenced, Kim gave a gut wrenching testimony expressing sorrow for her actions.

Her blood alcohol had been 0.24 at the time of the accident. That's three times more than the legal limit.

Once released, Kim must still serve another 15 years probation during which she will be required to clock 15 years of community service per year

'All I can say is I'm so sorry,' said a weeping Kim. 'If I could do anything to bring them back, I would … I would have thrown myself in front of a car if I would have seen that happening.'

The mother of three became pregnant again herself five months ago.

Kim's baby, set to be delivered via C-section in May, will be turned over to her family as she completes her sentence.

DeMella, a schoolteacher, was on her first pregnancy at the time of her death.

She had been active in her school's Students Against Drunk Driving chapter and even left a New Year's Party hours before midnight to avoid being in an accident with a drunk driver. 

The family she left behind seemed to view Kim's pregnancy as nothing more than an attempt to curry favor during the trial.

'It's amazing how one person could make so many poor decisions,' said DeMella's mother Paula Masterson. 'You have tried all avenues to evade responsibility for this crime.'

Even Assistant State Attorney Michael Horowitz called Kim's pregnancy 'appalling and manipulative.'

Horowitz was seeking a 20-year sentence.

Once released, Kim must still serve another 15 years probation during which she will be required to clock 15 years of community service per year.

She has also permanently lost her driver's license. 

The sentence was ordered to begin immediately.
