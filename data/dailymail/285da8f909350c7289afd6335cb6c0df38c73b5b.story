Alexander Rossi is on the official FIA entry list for this weekend’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix in place of Jules Bianchi.

Marussia are  yet to make an official announcement on their plans for the weekend with Bianchi in a critical but stable condition following his horror crash in Japan on Sunday.

The British-based team are still weighing up their options and may run only one car  or indeed pull out of the event altogether. An announcement will be made before first practice on Friday.

Rossi's name appears on the official FIA entry list - but Marussia are yet to reveal their plans for the weekend 

Rossi, a reserve driver for Marussia, has a superlicence which would enable him to race, but some within the team are wary of entering both cars given Bianchi's condition. 

The 25-year-old was diagnosed with diffuse axonal injury after he careered into the back of a tractor during Sunday's rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix.

The sport has united in Sochi with messages of support for Bianchi who remains at Mie University Hospital.

Writing in his MailOnline column, Nico Rosberg said: 'Since the race, I have spent a lot of time thinking about Jules, his family and the people who are close to him.

'He has a lot of friends in the paddock – obviously being a Frenchman many of them are from France – so I have been spending some time with them, particularly Jean-Eric Vergne. I flew from Japan to Russia with the Toro Rosso driver and I am staying in the same hotel with him. We have spent that time exchanging our different stories of Jules.

'I am really hoping that there is some good news on his condition, but tragically it has to be said that it is looking very serious.

'As such, the mood in the paddock ahead of this weekend’s race is very different. Nobody is laughing or having a good time. Everyone is talking and thinking about Jules.'
