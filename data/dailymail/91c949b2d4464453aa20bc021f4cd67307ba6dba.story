The number of illegal migrants reaching European borders is on track to swamp the 140,000 who fled the Arab Spring in 2011, according to new figures.

Frontex, the European Union border agency, said that 42,000 illegal immigrants reached the European Union between January and April this year, four times the number in the same period last year.

Italian authorities have said that in May another 14,000 arrived in their country making the total who have used central Mediterranean routes for illegal immigration at least 55,000.

Examining patterns of illegal immigration means that of those who have arrived in Europe, unknown numbers will try to reach Britain via Calais.

Last week, the French police disbanded and demolished two squatter camps near the Channel.

With this information, serious questions will be asked about how Britain will cope with an influx of yet more immigrants.

The immigration question was a key factor in the recent European elections and could be again ahead of the General Election less than a year from now.

Ewa Moncure, a spokesman for Frontex, said: ‘By the end of April the number of illegal border crossings was close to 42,000, including 25,500 through Italy.

‘The Italians gave a new figure a couple of days ago of over 39,000 so far this year, so the overall total will have grown significantly.

‘If we look at the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy last year compared with the number who have arrived in the first five months of this year, the total has already been exceeded. It was 40,000 or so for the whole of 2013 and it seems like we have nearly reached that point by the end of May.’

The figures are especially worrying as they come ahead of the traditional summer peak months for illegal immigration.

Miss Moncure said: ‘There have historically been more arrivals in the summer because of the weather and particularly because the sea is less treacherous for boat crossings from Africa.’

Frontex’s annual report also showed the whole of 2013 saw a 48 per cent rise in illegal migration compared with the previous year, from 72,437 to 107,365.

Syrians accounted for almost a quarter of last year’s total - 25,546 - with Eritreans (11,298), Afghans (9,021) and Albanians (9,500) making up the main other nationalities.

Detections of Nigerians (3,386), Malians (2,887), Gambians (2,817) and Senegalese (1,643) all quadrupled last year, it added.

Gil Arias Fernandez, Frontex’s deputy executive director, also cautioned that large numbers of Syrian and Eritrean refugees are in Libya ready to be illegally smuggled to the European Union.

His warning comes in the wake of comments earlier this year by Salah Mazek, the Libyan interior minister, who said that it would think of helping migrants get to Europe unless countries agreed to help his nation.

‘I’m warning the world and Europe in particular – if they do not assume their responsibilities, Libya could facilitate the transit of this flood,’ he said.
