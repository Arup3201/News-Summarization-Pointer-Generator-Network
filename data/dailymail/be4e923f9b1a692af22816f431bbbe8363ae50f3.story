A horse fair descended into violence as two families started a mass brawl in the street using catapults and batons, these dramatic images reveal.

Kicks and punches were thrown in front of shocked onlookers as the brutal fight escalated out of control, with members of each family left bloodied, bruised and badly beaten after the battle.

A man wearing a white vest and black flat cap initiated the mass brawl in Wickham, near Fareham, Hampshire, when he ran towards an older man armed with a catapult.

Shocking fracas: The huge scuffle last May saw large batons wielded and those injured kicked on the floor

His actions sparked a huge scuffle in which large batons were wielded and those injured were kicked on the floor, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. The fracas was caught on CCTV by the RSPCA.

Workers from the charity had attended the fair to look for potential animal cruelty. But instead their camera caught the lengthy brawl, which continued even as police arrived and tried to restore order.

Now six people - two from one family and four from another - have admitted various charges in relation to the fight. The violence took place during the annual horse fair in May last year.

Several of the defendants were left bloodied or with ripped clothing following the brawl.

Those involved included Esta Keet, 52,
 Ricky Keet, 24, James Albert Kempster, 27, James Kempster senior, 40, 
Horace Kempster, 20, and Albert Kempster, 19.

The dramatic footage shows David Keet standing in the street when a member of the Kempster family aims a catapult at him.
