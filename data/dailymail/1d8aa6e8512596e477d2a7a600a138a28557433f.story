A Maryland father is outraged after his six-year-old son and a classmate were suspended for using their fingers to make imaginary guns during a recess game of cops and robbers.

Army Staff Sgt. Stephen Grafton said White Marsh Elementary School's reaction to the 'completely harmless' act was 'easily the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard of.'

Principal Marcia Sprankle's decision to 
suspend the boys came a month after the shooting at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School, which cost the lives of 26 people including 20 young 
children, and less than three weeks after another six-year-old boy in the state was suspended for making the same gesture.

'This, a completely harmless act of 
horseplay at recess, was by no means an offense that warranted a 
suspension,' Grafton told Cain TV.

'It
was a pair of 6-year-olds playing with imaginary pistols, one of whom 
has a father who is charged by the United States with using firearms in 
his defense.'

Three weeks ago, Rodney Lynch was 
suspended from his Montgomery County school after pretending to fire an 
imaginary gun at another student.

Rodney told CBS Baltimore:
'Just pointing your fingers like this and then she did the pow sound 
and I just went like that and then I got sent to the office again.'

The school reversed its decision after Rodney's parents hired an attorney and appealed.

'They're saying he threatened a student, threatened to shoot a student. He was playing,' said Rodney's father, Rodney Lynch Sr.

White Marsh Elementary parent Julia Merchant agreed with Grafton that the boys' punishment was an overreaction.

'It's ridiculous,' she told the TV station.

Another parent, Janet Geotzky, agreed.

'Suspending them is a bit harsh and I don't think that's gonna do any good for the parent, child or school,' she said.

The Talbot County Board of Education, which oversees White Marsh Elementary, wouldn't comment on the suspension.

It released a statement saying: 'It is frustrating for school systems because a complete explanation of events cannot be provided due to confidentiality requirements under the federal educational rights and privacy act.'

Child psychologist Dr. Joe Kaine said he didn't believe the kids meant any malice, agreeing that they were just playing.

'I can certainly appreciate that at school, that's not a type of play that they are going to endorse and I certainly support that, but that's where we educate the time and place for doing things,' Kaine told CBS.
