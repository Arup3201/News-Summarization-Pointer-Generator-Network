Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush has successfully landed after going on a celebratory skydive at his family's seaside retreat in Maine to mark his 90th birthday.

Today's jump was his eighth time parachuting out of an airplane, and the former Republican leader made sure to show his national pride with a patriotic parachute.

The 41st president has been joined by friends and relatives, including his son former President George W. Bush and granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager, who watched proudly during his milestone jump.

Playful: The 41st president showed that his sense of fun is still intact on his 90th birthday

Jim McGrath, who worked as George HW 
Bush's spokesperson while in office, was on the ground in Kennebunkport 
when the newly-minted nonagenarian touched down.

Mr McGrath said that Bush felt 'great, exhilarated' after the skydive in spite of the 'hot' landing.

This wasn't be the first time he showed 
his daredevil side, but it definitely comes under different 
circumstances than his first. The Republican leader first jumped out of a
 plane during World War II  when his plane was shot down above the 
island of Chi Chi Jima in the Pacific in September 1944.

Today's tandem jump was confirmed by his granddaughter who shared a photo of balloons and a telling caption on her Twitter account this morning.

Her father, the fellow former President, posted a photo of the grounds of his parent's seaside retreat in Maine on Wednesday night, writing that he was 'in Maine to celebrate 41's 90th birthday tomorrow'.

More than 200 relatives and friends, including some from his days in the White House, are included on the guest list for a private dinner in his honour this evening, a family spokesman said.

The 41st president, who lives in Houston,
 has spent every summer at the three-story, stone-and-shingle home in 
Maine since he was a boy, except when he was a naval aviator during the Second World War.

Former press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, 
White House counsel Boyden Gray and political director Ron Kaufman are 
among the guests, said spokesman Jim McGrath.

His children, including former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, will also be there, McGrath said.

During
 his presidential years, Bush was known for jogging, tennis and 
fast-paced golf but now uses a wheelchair because of a form of 
Parkinson's disease.

'He's 
lost his mobility, but he hasn't lost his heart. He's still the genuine 
person that we've come to cherish,' said Ken Raynor, a friend and pro at
 the Cape Arundel Golf Club.

On Sunday, former first lady Barbara Bush
 was celebrating her 89th birthday with a low-key private dinner with 
relatives in Kennebunkport.

During the war, Bush bailed out of his airplane over the Pacific. Later, he decided to jump from a plane of his own accord and marked his 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays by skydiving.

While his activities are now limited, Bush still enjoys taking out his boat, Fidelity.

'He's always loved going fast. He loves the speed. He loves the adrenaline,' McGrath said.

Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian who is writing a book about Bush, said the former president is used to being in motion, so it is not easy for him to slow down.

The president feels lucky nonetheless, Meacham said.

'He had a remarkable great run of good health and good family and good friends,' he said. 'So I know his chief view of life at 90 is one of immense gratitude.

'He's very grateful for his parents, he's grateful for Barbara, he's grateful for his kids. He knows he's one of the luckiest guys who ever lived, really.'
