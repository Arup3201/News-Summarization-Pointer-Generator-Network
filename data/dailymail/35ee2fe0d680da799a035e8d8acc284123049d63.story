A new policy at the popular pharmacy chain CVS is causing outrage after the company announced it will require its employees to report their weight, BMI, and glucose levels – or pay a hefty fine.

CVS Caremark, which is based in Rhode Island, has some 200,000 employees.

The controversial new policy would require workers to sign a waiver that they ‘voluntarily’ disclosed the information, but those who opt out must pay a $600 fee.

Patient advocate groups say this is just another coercive measure and worry that those employees in poorer health might risk getting fired.

Disclosure: CVS Caremark has announced a controversial new policy that would require its 200,000 employees to disclose their height, weight, and other vital stats

The company mandated that all of its employees must get the screenings, which include their height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure levels, and glucose levels, by May 1, according to the Boston Herald.

CVS added that they will cover the cost of these screenings. But that comes at a price – those who have their tests covered by the company are required to sign a waiver saying the screenings were voluntary. 

If workers refuse to sign up, they will be charged an extra $50 a month, or $600 a year.

However, the policy has been called ‘technology-enhanced discrimination’ by Dr Deborah Peel, the founder of Patient Privacy Rights.

She told ABC News that the policy insinuates that workers need to be penalized in order to get into shape.

'The approach they’re taking is based on the assumption that somehow these people need a whip,' she said.

‘How is it voluntary if you are a low or medium-wage person?’ she told the Herald.

Representatives for CVS did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment on the policy, but released a statement saying they wanted their employees to be 'as healthy as they can be.'

The statement continues: 'Many companies around the country already have plans similar to the one we are implementing. In fact, 79 percent of large employers have health assessments incorperated into their programs.'

Healthcare costs have been rising at an alarming rate in the U.S., inflated by expensive premiums, high co-pays, and high deductibles. 

Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that CVS’ CEO Larry Merlo’s pay has skyrocked to $18million, up from $12million the year before.

According to WPRI.com, Merlo’s comprehensive pay package included a $6.4million bonus, as well as $10.3million in stock options.

CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis told the website via email that the pay increase was entirely merited, as the company ‘continued to deliver strong financial results and enhanced returns to shareholders.’

He added: ‘Mr Merlo’s compensation in 2012 reflects these strong suits.’

We want to help our employees to be as healthy as they can be, which is why we decided to implement this plan. In fact, we have been working for a number of years on ways they can improve their health through preventive measures. Healthcare programs that incent employees to be healthier are not new.

Many companies around the country already have plans similar to the one we are implementing. In fact, 79% of large employers have health assessments incorporated into their programs.

To encourage a higher level of participation in our wellness review, we reviewed best practices and determined that an additional cost for those who do not complete the review was the most effective way to incent our colleagues to improve their health care and manage health costs.

CVS Caremark is committed to providing medical coverage and healthcare programs for our colleagues and privacy is rigorously protected, consistent with HIPAA regulations.

All personal health data from these screenings are collected and reviewed by a third-party administrator that supports the CVS Caremark Wellness Program, and this data is not shared with CVS Caremark — rather it is designed to help employees make the best decisions about their own healthcare.
