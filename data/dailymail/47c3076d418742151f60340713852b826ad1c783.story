From the food mixer to the tumble dryer, the modern home is filled with a cacophony of sounds.

Now new research suggests this noise could be making us ill by causing two in five people to suffer from higher stress levels.

Some of the worst offending products are some of the most essential in the home and include washing machines, vacuum cleaners and extractor fans.

Some of the worst offending products are some of the most essential including food processors, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and extractor fans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40 per cent of Europe's population is exposed to noise levels in excess of 55dB - about the same level of a noisy office

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40 per cent of Europe’s population is exposed to noise levels in excess of 55dB – about the same level of a noisy office.

The average washing machine has a recorded sound level of 70dB, refrigerators average at around 50dB refrigerator while in some instances food processors can reach up to 90dB.

WHO says this amount of noise is enough to disturb sleep, raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease.

The problem is made worse by the fact that a third of people in the UK currently having an open plan living space in their home, and almost a quarter want one in the future.

According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), 40 per cent of Europe’s population is exposed to 
noise levels in excess of 55dB – about the same level of a noisy office.

The worst offending items in the home, on average, include:

Food mixer - 90dB

Tumble dryer - 60dB

Washing machine - 70dB

Vacuum cleaner - 70dB

Refrigerator - 50dB

According to a survey of 2,000 UK adults by  John Lewis, 39 per cent of people will avoid using technology appliances at certain times because of the noise they produce.

Meanwhile, almost a third of people find it difficult to drown out the noise and almost half consider sound an important factor in their purchasing decision when buying home appliances.

Not only is the noise created by home technology products considered irritating, a quarter of those surveyed said it made it difficult for them to concentrate.

‘We are not always fully aware of how much noise affects us on a daily basis, and we usually only appreciate the difference when those sound disturbances are removed,’ said Poppy Elliott, managing director of charity Quiet Mark.

‘Reducing unnecessary noise from appliances and technology that surround us significantly supports our health and well-being.’

A number of retailers, including John Lewis, are working with Quiet Mark to help find a solution including develop a new metric of sound measurement for electrical products in the UK.
