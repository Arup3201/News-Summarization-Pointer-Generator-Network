Action: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said spending a bit more in the short-term can secure big savings

Officials are to turn up at the homes of 400,000 of Britain’s most disruptive families to get them out of bed for job interviews and make sure their children go to school.

Alcoholics and drug addicts will also be made to go to rehab under the plan which hugely extends a project already targeting 120,000 families.

Money to widen the scheme has been found in the Government’s spending review for 2015-16 which is due to be announced tomorrow.

Chancellor George Osborne is to say that £4,500 will be spent targeting each of 400,000 high-risk families who dominate the work of the police, social workers and NHS staff. They cost taxpayers billions because of worklessness, anti-social behaviour and truancy.

The average annual cost to the state of such a family is £15,000, but ministers say the worst cost as much as £330,000 a year.

However, 84 per cent of the spending is used to react to their problems, rather than trying to turn around their lives. As many as 20 arms of the state are involved in dealing with these households at present.

A more co-ordinated approach, which will see one dedicated official take responsibility for ensuring that children go to school, adults attend job interviews and the whole family stays out of trouble, will be more effective, ministers argue.

The riots in the summer of 2011 convinced the Government that drastic steps are required to tackle a hardcore of neighbourhoods where few have a proper job.

The coalition says Labour’s welfare legacy means there are parts of Britain where three generations of families have never worked and live on state benefits.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said yesterday that an extra £200million had been found for 2015-16 to help problem families, despite spending cuts worth £11.5billion across Whitehall due to be confirmed in tomorrow’s review.

Government departments will provide 40 per cent of the cost of working with each family.

Problems: More joined up work between the police, social workers and NHS staff should stop their time being dominated by a hardcore of problem families

Councils and other agencies that will
benefit from savings which come from preventing crime and social 
breakdown will have to find the other 60 per cent.

Mr Alexander said: ‘The troubled 
families programme is a radical example of how, by spending a bit more 
in certain areas, we can save much more in others, and by doing so 
create a stronger economy and a fairer society.

‘Extending this intensive help to 
400,000 more families will enable us to tackle problems such as truancy,
anti-social behaviour and crime.

‘The Government is committing 
£200million in funding in 2015-16, and for every £4,500 spent on a 
family we can reduce the annual £15,000 cost of dealing with their 
problems by reducing the burden on the police, health and social 
services.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles 
said: ‘The programme is on track to turn around the lives of 120,000 
families by 2015. I am delighted that we will be able to continue the 
progress we have begun after 2015.’
Louise Casey, the former anti-social behaviour ‘tsar’ who advised Tony 
Blair’s government and now heads the troubled families programme, said: 
‘It is great news that the momentum we have built up can continue by 
extending the approach to a wider group of families.’

Labour, which had some success giving
a small number of families intensive supervision, admitted that a 
minority of ‘Shameless’ households were causing the majority of crime 
and anti-social behaviour.

That was a reference to the Channel 4
drama Shameless which features a dysfunctional family living on an 
estate of  benefit claimants and cheats.
