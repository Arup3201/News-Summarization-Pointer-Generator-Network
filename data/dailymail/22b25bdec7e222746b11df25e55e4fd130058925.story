A Christian bakery that refused to make a lesbian couple a tiered wedding cake because it would violate their 'religious beliefs' is being investigated.

Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries' civil rights division is reviewing whether  Sweet Cakes by Melissa discriminated against same-sex newlyweds Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer based on their sexual orientation.

Despite receiving death threats since the incident occurred in January, owner Aaron Klein, 33, maintains he would rather shut down his shop than 'be forced to do something that violates [his] conscience', according to NBC.

According to her complaint to the state, Rachel Bowman-Cryer, 30, met with the bakery's owner Aaron Klein on January 17 to order a wedding cake.

Klein, who runs the Gresham business with his wife Melissa Klein,  asked for the date of the wedding and names of the bride and groom.

'I told him, 'There are two brides and our names are Rachel and Laurel,''' Bowman-Cryer said, according to her complaint, reported by The Oregonian. 

She said Klein claimed his cake shop did not service same-sex weddings.

'Respondent cited a religious belief for its refusal to make cakes for same-sex couples planning to marry,' the complaint said.

Klein confirmed to NBC he refused to serve Bowman-Cryer, but denies calling the couple 'abominations', which was alleged in the formal complaint.

'I
stopped what I was doing, I looked at them and said, 'I'm sorry I may 
have wasted your time, we don't do same-sex marriages,''' he said.

The Kleins have received death threats, had the 
bakery picketed, received hate mail and lost 50 per cent of their customers since the incident was first reported - yet they still believe their 'homophobic' customer service approach is appropriate.

They say they have the right to serve who they want.

'I believe that marriage is a religious institution ordained by God. The Book of Genesis talks about that for this reason: A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife,' NPR reported Klein as saying.

'That, to me, is the beginning, the basis of marriage

'We're struggling, but in the end, my faith is more important to me than a dollar. So I will continue to stand for what I believe in.

'And I don't think anybody is ever going to force me to go against my religion.'

Authorities will investigate whether the business violated the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, which protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations.

If the complaint is upheld, the inquiry could be referred for prosecution or a settlement may be negotiated.

'It's definitely not discrimination at 
all. We don't have anything against lesbians or homosexuals,' Melissa Klein told The Oregonian. 

'It has to do with our morals and beliefs. It's so frustrating because 
we went through all of this in January, when it all came out.'

This is reportedly the 10th complaint to the state in the last five years involving allegations of discrimination in a public place based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian said people are entitled to their beliefs, but aren't allowed to discriminate.

'The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate,' Avakian told The Oregonian. 

'For those who do violate the law, we want them to learn from that experience and have a good, successful business in Oregon.'
