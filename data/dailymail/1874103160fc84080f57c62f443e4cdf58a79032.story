Luis Suarez's lawyer will travel to Barcelona on Friday, according to reports in Spain.

Spanish radio station Cadena COPE are reporting the Uruguayan frontman's attorney, Alejandro Balbi, is to meet Liverpool officials in the city.

Suarez's future in England is in doubt following the 27-year-old's alleged bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini and subsequent four month ban from football.

Homeward bound: Suarez will return to Uruguay and play no further part in the World Cup following his ban

Suarez, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona as well as Spanish rivals Real Madrid, will also miss Uruguay's next nine fixtures.

The news comes just a day after Balbi claimed England and Italy were responsible for a witchhunt against the frontman.

In an incredible interpretation of the events that unfolded on Tuesday, Suarez's lawyer told Uruguayan radio: ‘We don’t have any doubts that this has happened because it’s Suarez involved, and secondly because Italy have been eliminated.

'There’s a lot of pressure from England and Italy.

'There is a possibility that they ban him, because there are precedents, but we’re convinced that it was an absolutely casual play, because if Chiellini can show a scratch on one shoulder, Suarez can show a bruised and almost closed eye.’
