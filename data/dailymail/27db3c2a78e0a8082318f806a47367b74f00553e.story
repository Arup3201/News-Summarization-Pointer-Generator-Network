Britain was basking in glorious sunshine this week - with temperatures as high as a staggering 28C (82F).

But today, millions of people were forced to brave the rain as they attended sporting events and festivals across Britain.

Donning rain ponchos and wellies, tens of thousands of Formula One fans watched the qualifying stages of the British Grand Prix unfold at Silverstone.

They huddled under umbrellas and tents as they cheered racers around the Northamptonshire circuit, which was home to the very first F1 world championship round in 1950.

But they did not let the weather dampen their spirits - with many screaming and waving Great Britain flags in support of British racer Lewis Hamilton.

Spectator Sarah Hodgson, 23, from Cheshire, told MailOnline: 'My family and I watched the practice yesterday and it was so hot we all 
got sunburned.

'I certainly wasn't expecting to be wearing a poncho today. But despite 
the rain, we had a great time and it made for a great qualifying 
session full of surprises. We are all hoping that Sebastian Vettel will win tomorrow.'

The wet weather was also seen by spectators at the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire, and Cornbury Music Festival in The Great Tew Park in Chipping Norton.

But cycling enthusiasts in Yorkshire were treated to sunshine and dry weather as the opening stage of the Tour de France got underway in Leeds.

The international event, featuring 198 riders, was launched by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry this afternoon.

Forecaster Simon Partridge, of the Met Office, said today would see a 'mixture of sunshine and showers' across most of the country, particularly in the South-East, with temperatures in the late teens.

'Temperatures at Silverstone were around 18C today with some showers, but the weather should improve as the afternoon goes on,' he said.

Reduced numbers: The number of people on Brighton beach was drastically lower today as the warm, sunny weather gave way to downpours

'The Tour de France saw sunnier, 
drier weather, but this could be the other way round tomorrow as the 
rain moves towards the North East.'

The wet weather is not set to improve anytime soon - with further downpours expected tomorrow and throughout next week.

'Monday and Tuesday will again see a 
mixture of sunshine and showers, but perhaps quite not as many as on 
previous days,' said Mr Partridge.

'Wednesday
 will be a little bit drier, with temperatures around average for this 
time of year, but it will still not be anything like the weather we have
 recently had.'

'It certainly doesn't look like the weather will be improving drastically for the next week or so.'

As
 downpours caused misery for spectators at Silverstone today, they also 
resulted in slippery track conditions for all three qualifying sessions.

But despite the rain, Britain's Jenson Button, of McLaren Mercedes, still managed to qualify third for tomorrow's Grand Prix, which will involve 52 laps around the 3.66-mile circuit.

Germany's Nico Rosberg, of Mercedes, scooped the pole position, while Germany's Sebastian Vettel, of Red Bull, finished second.

However, Hamilton blew his chance of securing pole position for the Grand Prix after he 
inexplicably aborted his final run in this afternoon's dramatic qualifying session.

The racer appeared set to secure his 
second pole in as many years in front of his home crowd at the track, which was home to the very first F1 world championship round in 1950.

But
 as his title rival Nico Rosberg snatched the pole in the final moments,
 Hamilton chose to bail out on his final lap, seemingly confident he had
 done enough to start Sunday's race from the front of the pack.

The
 final sector of the track had however dried out, with not only Rosberg 
going faster than the Briton, but four other drivers, meaning Hamilton 
will only start sixth at Silverstone on Sunday.

Yesterday, a year-high of 28C was recorded in the village of Writtle, near 
Chelmsford, Essex - beating the likes of Portugal, Turkey and Spain.
