A drizzly lunchtime in central Birmingham and I’m standing in a rubbish-strewn lay-by, squinting into a pile of discarded takeaway boxes and fizzy drinks cans.

‘D’you see?’ asks Adrian Timms, bending forward and pointing into the mess. Before me is half a dead rat — the best part of a torso, a pair of chunky hind legs, and a thick, snake-like tail.

Where there should be a head, there’s a gaping wound, the surrounding fur matted with dried blood.

Rats! The number of calls to Birmingham's rodent-catchers has increased 300 in the last year

Adrian, 47, is a rat-catcher. Five years ago, after packing in a career in IT to ‘spend more time with nature’, he set up Pestforce Birmingham with his father David, 73.

Today, they’re taking me on a tour of the city to seek out the ‘giant rats’ which are reported to be terrorising the population.

There have been 5,100 calls to the city council’s rat-catchers in the past year — 300 more than in the 12 months before — with some people claiming to have seen ‘cat-sized’ creatures ‘wide as bricks’ stalking the streets.

Adrian agrees, saying he’s seen one that was 17in long.

It may all sound rather far-fetched — but there’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that rats are getting bigger.

‘Creatures can certainly change in size,’ says Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University.

He points out that humans became 
bigger with improved nutrition — for example people got larger after the
 Industrial Revolution because of the increase in the amount of meat in 
their diet.

‘It may well be the same with rats,’ he says. Dr Allaby believes their increasing size is probably down to the sugary and fatty foods thrown away by humans.

Across the country there have been sightings of enormous ‘super rodents’ and ‘massive mutant rats’ have allegedly been spotted in Bradford and County Durham.

One shocking photo, taken in a Tunbridge Wells park by 50-year-old Mark Willmot, shows his Jack Russell clutching a dead rat between his teeth.

It’s almost as big as the dog.

If the rotting specimen in Birmingham doesn’t quite live up to these ratzilla proportions — what remains of the rodent measures approximately 8in — it’s still pretty big, its fur unexpectedly thick  and bushy.

Adding to the revulsion, Adrian suggests the missing half of the corpse has most likely been eaten by other rats.

‘That’s the thing — they’ll eat anything!’ he says. No wonder they are growing so big.

And the problem is compounded by many councils’ decisions to cut rubbish collections to once a fortnight and the way they encourage us to recycle unwanted food by putting it into slop buckets which are then left out  on the pavement to await the bin men.

For example, Birmingham Council makes only one household bin collection a week, so rubbish bags full of discarded food are left on the street for days.

This offers a true banquet for rats and, as Adrian says: ‘Any creature will continue to grow if you give it food.’

He says dumped refuse is meant to be collected within two days of it being reported — but then points to several flimsy plastic bags that have apparently been lying here for weeks.

Rats love chewing on things and gnawing through plastic bags takes them seconds.

Their teeth never stop growing. So, if they don’t constantly use them, their incisors would get so long that they’d curve back under their chin and pierce their brains.

Another explanation for the emergence 
of super-sized rats could be evolution. Dr Allaby says: ‘In evolutionary
 history, rats have grown gradually bigger — for instance it happens 
over time on islands where they have no predators and don’t need to be 
small enough to get away quickly.’

Scavengers: Any creature will continue to grow if offered food. For rats, there's the added incentive that their teeth never stop growing - so if they don't constantly gnaw, their incisors would pierce their own heads

He mentions the now-extinct Tenerife giant rat, which grew to weigh over 2lb more than two million years ago. Indeed, scientists at Leicester University recently warned that rats in areas with a plentiful food supply and few predators could one day evolve to be as large as sheep.

Though Dr Allaby cautions that significant changes would take ‘thousands’ of years.

Whatever the cause, Britain’s rat population is also increasing. There are more than 80 million — that’s 1.2 rats per person and nearly 40 per cent more than in 2000. And the oft-quoted ‘fact’ that you’re only ever 6ft away from a rat is a myth, you’re unlikely ever to be much more than a 100ft from one.

While this may all be great for Adrian’s business, it can be devastating for anyone unfortunate to suffer an infestation in their home.

This brings the threat of disease — for rats are remarkably efficient at spreading a host of illnesses.

As well as thread worm and Weil’s disease (a bacterial infection which can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding), brown rats can carry tuberculosis, salmonella, E. Coli, foot and mouth, toxoplasmosis (a parasite inducing flu-like symptoms) and cryptosporidium, which causes severe gastrointestinal problems.

No wonder one of Adrian’s clients, Ken Wong, who has hired him to eradicate rats from the two-bedroom house he shares with his wife and ten-month-old son Kingsley, is so worried. ‘We can’t have our son here,’ he says. ‘If we can’t get rid of the rats, we’ll have to move.’

Giant rats can also cause huge amounts of damage. Last year they were blamed for starting a massive fire at a coach company headquarters in Southampton.

They had chewed through electric cables, sparking a blaze which destroyed six coaches. Another 15in rat was caught recently after it chewed through a concrete wall.

As we rattle around Birmingham in his van, Adrian regales me with his own stories of havoc.

‘I’ve seen them eat through boxes of goods in shop store-rooms. Once, I dealt with an infestation in a church where rats had eaten all the Sunday School children’s sweets and drunk all their orange juice.’

He helped a family after rats had stolen chocolate Dime bars from their sitting room.

Taking the blame: The disasters attributed to rats have been numerous - from a fire which gutted six coaches in a Southampton depot last year, to the Black Death which killed millions of people centuries earlier

Rats are also rather partial to dog food. Adrian says: ‘People think if they have a dog, rats will stay away. But by leaving their food on the ground, you’re only encouraging them.

Getting rid of rats can take months and involves far more than simply laying a trap.

M  ost rats, says Adrian, are ‘too clever’ to be deceived by traditional traps, which consist of a baited cage with a door that slams shut when the rat is inside.

‘They have ‘neophobia’, so they are scared of anything new. If you lay a trap in their path, they’ll just run around it to avoid it,’ he says.

Alternatives include the use of gas or glue boards, which trap the rats as they scurry across.

Adrian prefers bait boxes — bulky plastic shoebox-like containers in which he hides a small pouch of bright red rodenticide. Its effect is slow-acting, so the rats don’t learn to associate the bait with what’s killed their fellow rodents.

Even this isn’t foolproof, however. It’s feared some rats are developing immunity to traditional poisons. In any case, the bigger the rat, the higher the dose of poison needed to kill it.

Even then, there’s the on-going problem of keeping them away.

Rats can multiply almost as fast as they’re caught. They become fertile at three months and have a gestation period of just 21 days. The average litter contains ten babies, each with a life expectancy of three years.

By the end of my day rat-catching, I don’t know whether I’m relieved or disappointed that we’ve not spotted anything to match a huge rat spotted a few years ago in West Yorkshire before it was shot dead by a man with an air rifle.

But that’s the clever thing about rats, says Adrian — no matter how big, they’re amazingly good at avoiding human interaction.

Not only are they shy and fast-moving but, unlike mice, they don’t tend to leave droppings. Instead, they have a ‘toilet area’ which they use — usually somewhere hidden, like under a cupboard.

Worryingly, this means  infestations can go for months, if not years, undetected.

‘We had an old couple once in a nice clean house who only discovered they had rats living under their house when they started chewing through the floorboards,’ says Adrian. ‘There were dozens of them.’

So can anything put a stop to Britain’s giant rats?

Adrian thinks there’s only one solution — and it’s not just a matter of laying more traps.

‘Ultimately, people have to take responsibility for the state they leave things in,’ he says. ‘If they’re going to leave food out, what do they expect? It’s not Nature’s fault. The only way to reduce the rat population is to reduce our mess.’
