An obese woman who would scoff half a ton of potatoes every year has lost almost half her body weight after ditching her favourite spud snacks.

Trisha Corbett, 26, from Limerick, Ireland, tipped the scales at 26st 11lbs, eating her way through chips, roasties, mash or a jacket potato oozing with butter.

The trainee teacher's addiction spiralled out of control, and Trish ballooned to a size 30 before realising that she needed to lose weight. 

Trisha Corbett piled on the pounds after constantly snacking on potatoes but has lost almost half of her body weight since ditching her favourite spuds

The turning point for Trisha came in October 2011, when she began to suffer from terrifying heart palpitations that left her dizzy and gasping for breath.

She swapped the spuds for a healthy, varied diet, and by doing so, she lost an incredible 13st 4lbs - shrinking down to a size 14.

She joined her local Weight Watchers group and would dine on fresh fruit and vegetables. In her first week alone, she lost a massive 10lbs. Within 18 months, she had lost 5st. 

Trisha, from Newcastle West, had struggled with her size from a young age, saying that things got worse after she began to graze on potatoes.  

At her heaviest Trisha was almost 27st and her BMI was 57 more than double what it should have been

'I'd always been overweight, and as a child my parents struggled to find clothes to fit me,' she said.

'Over the years, I just got bigger and bigger. And my love of potatoes definitely didn't help.

'Whilst most people get cravings for chocolate or crisps, I couldn't wait to tuck into a spud!

'My favourite was a jacket potato with loads of butter - even thinking about one made my mouth water.'

Trisha's potato addiction meant her weight had spiralled out of control by 2011. At 5ft 8in and almost 27st, her body mass index was a shocking 57 - more than double the recommended range of 18.5 to 25.

As well as her weight being bad for her health Trisha was also the victim of cruel taunts from strangers, who said that she was 'as wide as a bus' and was 'blocking the street'. 

Before her weight loss (left) Trisha would gorge on potatoes eating three large jackets as a snack but since losing the weight (right) she says that she doesn't miss spuds at all 

Trisha was shunned by men on nights out with friends and had to watch friends settle down with boyfriends while she remained single. Pictured: Trisha (right) with friend Emma Falahee

BREAKFAST: Coco Pops and a sausage roll

LUNCH: Chicken wrap, chips and a Coke

DINNER: Mince and roast potatoes

SNACKS: Chocolate, pastry, jacket potatoes

BREAKFAST: Fruit and porridge

LUNCH: Chicken salad

DINNER: Chicken and vegetables

SNACKS: Fruit, yoghurt 

Trisha said  although their comments were extremely hurtful, she admits that they probably had a point.

'It was completely humiliating. Absolute strangers would shout that I had four stomachs, or point at my spare tyre,' she said.

'While it was upsetting and incredibly rude, I couldn't deny that what they were saying was true.'

As she continued to gain weight Trisha says she even began to resemble her favourite food. 

'My belly was always the most obvious thing about my size. Instead of growing out, it grew down in a big lump. I'd even started to look like a potato!'

The trainee teacher says that the turning point came after she began to suffer from heart palpitations 

As well as her health suffering, Trisha's weight meant she was often a victim of abuse from strangers

Trisha now works out regularly and says she has developed a talent for weight lifting

Shunned by men on nights out, Trisha had to watch as all of her friends began to get boyfriends and settle down.

Her weight also led to embarrassing social situations with Trisha recalling one occassion when car shopping left her red faced. 

'When I bought my first car, a little Ford Fiesta, I could barely fit in it. I had to push the seat right back so I could reach the steering wheel.

'I also had to ask for seat extensions on the plane - which was horrible. I felt like everyone was turning around to look at me.'

Speaking about suffering palpitations and dizzy spells, she added: 'It was really scary. Sometimes I'd have to sit with my head between my legs until the palpitations had stopped.

'My massive size was stretching my body to breaking point. It was then that I finally realised what I was doing to myself.

'Over the years, I'd tried pushing my weight problems to one side, but I knew I couldn't do this any longer - it could end up killing me.' 

After leaving Weight Watchers in April 2013, Trisha began to work out with a personal trainer five times a week.

Lifting weights and going for long walks ensured that she lost a further 8st 6lbs by September 2014 - taking her total weight loss to an incredible 13st 4lbs.

Now weighing in at 13st 7lbs, Trisha has dropped an amazing eight dress sizes and wears a size 14.

To maintain her slim figure, Trisha eats a balanced diet that includes plenty of chicken, fruit and vegetables - with potatoes no longer on the menu.

She also goes to the gym up to six times a week for a gruelling two-hour workout which she says has completely altered her life.  

'I'm in the best shape of my life. I've even discovered that I have a talent for lifting weights.

'It's incredible how I've gone from having to hold my head between my legs to stop me from being dizzy to spending up to 12 hours a week working out at the gym.'

With potatoes now banished from her cupboards, Trisha says she is looking forward to a healthy, happy future.

And although Trisha occasionally lets herself  dip into her old snack of choice she says she no longer pines for potatoes.

'I do treat myself to a couple of chips every now and again, but surprisingly I don't actually miss potatoes.

'I'm so much happier now. I'll never go back to being a 27st spud.'
