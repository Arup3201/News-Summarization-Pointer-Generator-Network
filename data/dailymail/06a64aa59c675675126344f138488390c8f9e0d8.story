Kadian Harding was hit by a van after he could not stop his bike hours after having his brakes checked

A teenage cyclist who was killed in a road accident had taken his bicycle to a repair shop hours before he died because he was worried about the brakes, an inquest heard yesterday.

Kadian Harding, 14, suffered fatal injuries when he crashed with a Mercedes van in July last year during a family bike ride to visit a relative.

Kadian was riding down a steep path with five other people, including his father and aunt, when he was unable to stop as he approached the busy road.

Eyewitnesses described hearing Kadian 
screaming as the bike went down the path at a speed of between 25mph and
30mph as he desperately tried to slow the bike down before colliding 
with the van.

The schoolboy suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene.

The inquest in Salisbury heard that the 
group only ended up on the A4 at Clatford, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, 
where Kadian was hit, because they had taken a wrong turn.

Thomas
Harding, Kadian's father, told the hearing how his son had saved up the
money to buy the long haul trucker touring bicycle to assemble himself.

'We
were always clear with him that the bike would have to be checked by a 
professional bike mechanic before it was deemed road worthy,' Mr Harding
said.

'It was always his intention to get it checked.'

Mr Harding, a writer, said Kadian had taken the bicycle to one bike shop close to his home in the village of Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire, on at least two occasions during July and to the Acceler8 shop in Marlborough on the day he died.

Mr Harding, who is a cousin of former editor of The Times newspaper James Harding, told the inquest that in his view, having ridden the bike two days before his son died, the brakes were 'functioning' but not 'optimal'.

On the morning of the day Kadian died, he said he told his son to get the bicycle checked by a professional.

'I specifically said: "We are really concerned about the brakes. You must get the front and back brakes looked at."'

He was hit during a family bike ride and father Thomas said he was laughing and joking moments earlier

Mr Harding said Kadian took the bike to a shop.

'He said they looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable. I didn't have a go (on the bike) but I did try both front and back brakes.

'I noticed they were much firmer now. I noticed the pads were now about 1mm apart.'

Mr Harding, an experienced cyclist, said that the day before his son died, in his opinion, there was 'no danger of a catastrophic failure'.

'From my narrative he would not have had the problems he had on the Wednesday if he had not gone to the bike shop,' he said.

Describing the moments before the fatal crash, Mr Harding said: 'I was right behind Kadian. We were talking and he was laughing and making jokes.

'We weren't going that fast. We were cycling in tandem and then he was suddenly ahead of me.

'It made no sense that Kadian wouldn't stop because you could see the road and there was plenty of time to stop.'

Witness Richard Knowles, who lives close to the crash scene, said he heard Kadian screaming as he cycled down the path.

'From the moment he came out of the tree line to the moment he passed me was only a few seconds,' he said.

Inquest heard that Kadian had saved up to buy the self-assembled bike but his father insisted it be checked first to make sure that it was road worthy

'He was pumping the brakes and that made me realise he was in trouble.

'He was standing up on the pedals. He was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable.

'I
think I said to him words to the effect of "come off". He made no 
attempt to steer off the path. He made no attempt to come off the pedals
and put his feet on the floor.'

Philip
Birkett, owner of Acceler8, said Kadian had come into the shop and 
asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes but said the teenager
had not mentioned anything about the brakes in general.

'If that had been mentioned I would have suggested that the bike stay for longer,' he said.

Mr Birkett said he adjusted the gears because they were 'ticking' and replaced a frayed rear brake cable and re-set them.

'I stand by my work and everything I did was correct. When that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition,' he said.

Under cross-examination by Jeremy Hyam, representing the Harding family, Mr Birkett said he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bicycles.

'I have never felt the need to do so. I feel comfortable with my abilities.'

Mr Birkett denied the suggestion that he had adjusted both the front and rear brakes.

The hearing was adjourned until today.
