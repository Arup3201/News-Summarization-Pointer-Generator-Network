Brother and sister John and Emma Smalley who run Temporary Measures in Keswick

I’m in the rudest cafe in the UK. It is called Temporary Measure, in Keswick. It’s pouring, and cold, I’m hungry, and there are lots of walkers afoot in fluorescent waterproofs. Therefore, I’m not in a forgiving mood.

The proprietors, John Sellers, 24, and his sister, Emma Smalley, 33, made headlines last week because of reviews posted on TripAdvisor complaining of ‘hostile’ staff and an ‘unwelcoming’ attitude.

They were on the TV news, accused of throwing forks at customers, and were being compared to Basil Fawlty at his most dictatorial.

The cafe is small, with vintage Lloyd Loom chairs, prints on the wall and lots of balls of wool. My friend sat down, and I went up to order. ‘Do you have scones?’ I asked the newly notorious Emma. She smiled. She looked me in the eye.

‘Yes, we do!’ ‘Ah, but do they have dried fruit in them?’ ‘Yes, but we could take them out? I have tweezers!’ ‘No, that’s OK. Can I have coffee with almond milk?’ ‘Of course!’

This was too much. Like finding out that escaped terror suspect Mohammed Mohamed (what unimaginative parents!) wore a burqa because he really wants a sex change and to  make pots.

Unlike in Costa Coffee, where they take your money before they have even begun to steam the non-organic milk for your latte, I was allowed to take my coffee and tea on trust.

When I went up to pay later, even though I was below the minimum card spend of £10, Emma decided to waive the rule, and thus avoid me having to make a wet trudge to the cashpoint.

She didn’t even ask whether I had a Nectar card! I asked why she and her brother have been so demonised. ‘John is a quiet lad,’ she said.

‘I haven’t really thrown a fork. I was joking. And when I said that we in the North have a healthy respect for a good old-fashioned surly disposition, I didn’t expect it to go viral.

The quirky cafe in Keswick, which according to Liz Jones, is a delight

‘The Sunday Telegraph came in today, and I told them, “People are not allowed to say anything these days. You say one thing out of turn, that’s meant to be a joke, and you are vilified.” ’

This ‘trial by the people’, where anyone is allowed to trash your reputation online, is the opposite of democracy: It’s not free speech, it is conviction and sentencing by the malevolent.

I’m reminded of the brilliant film The Lives Of Others, where East German thought police monitored your every move.

I’m getting a bit tired of this. Take bloggers. I was at a fashion event last week and met many, many 20-something bloggers: over-confident young women with no training, who thrust business cards into my hand.

How on earth do you earn a living, I asked one. ‘Oh, we are paid by brands to mention their products, or tweet photos of them.’

So, the internet has become home to the worst sort of journalism: PRs posing as critics. No delineation between advert and editorial.

What staggers me is that these young women, and the people who post negative reviews about a family-run cafe, have no self-doubt. No humility.

So, everyone is afraid, which is why you get columns that don’t stick up for factory-farmed animals, in case the author is deemed to be anti poor people.

We professional writers are afraid not of letting down those without a voice, but of inflaming the vocal and the outraged and the organised: mums, for example. Immigrants.

It’s all currying favour, like the outraged woman writing last week about how expensive and elitist M&S is for selling an £85 coat.

She would never tell you that she lives in a vicarage and has staff, a rich husband and loads of money in the bank: that would spoil the populist conceit.

I wish Emma from Keswick had indeed thrown a fork at a difficult customer who was already penning a post on her iPad Air.

Liz Jones complained to Natwest and said she was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years

After I criticised Lady Gaga last week
for wearing a bikini on TV before the watershed, I received a poo 
(human? dog? badger?) in the post; you have to laugh because I had to 
sign for it.

The world is being ruled by the loudest, not the smartest.

And for the record, the cafe in Keswick is a delight.

After I complained about the service at NatWest (I didn’t name my personal banking manager, mainly because his name is too long – 18 characters – and heinously difficult to spell, but also because I didn’t want to get him fired), and said I was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years, I got a letter from him, with a laminated photograph.

A photograph!

And yet NatWest wrote to me to say they will no longer be writing to tell me if something has bounced.

I used to love San Pellegrino fizzy water because it doesn’t give you a cold shower when you unscrew it, and it’s not salty.

Now, though, the bottle says: ‘Continue the story on Facebook.’ Bam! Six hundred years of sophistication dead in the water.
