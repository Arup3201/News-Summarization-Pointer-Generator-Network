Kris Commons isn’t the first so-called luxury player to find himself edged towards the periphery of a new manager’s plans.

Yet the attacking midfielder’s current plight at Celtic is unique in two senses. Firstly, Commons is the reigning PFA Scotland and SFWA player of the year. Lifting those two individual prizes in May hardly taxed him to the point of exhaustion.

Secondly, it almost always follows that a manager believes he can make do without the talent of such a player because he has others in the team who will compensate.

Poor-fit: Kris Commons does not appear to fit in to new Celtic manager Ronny Delia's plans

Looking at the Celtic side which started against Maribor – without Commons – supporters were entitled to ask who exactly was going to provide the goals and flashes of game-changing brilliance on which such nights hinge.

Jo Inge Berget? Unlikely. Stefan Johansen? Ditto. Anthony Stokes? No track record whatsoever at that level.

Had Ronny Deila been able to call upon a seasoned No 9 capable of playing the lone striker role at that level to good effect, Commons’ omission would have been less glaring.

Similarly, had his fellow Norwegians seemed capable of providing the offensive spark Commons showed in the corresponding fixture against Shakhtar Karagandy a year ago, there would not have been such a kerfuffle.

But of the four forward thinking players Deila started with, only the ever-improving Callum McGregor looked a decent bet to hit the Slovenians where it hurt.

With such a powderpuff look to the attack, little wonder Virgil Van Dijk was Deila’s most potent threat in the final third, with that only materialising in the dying embers of the match.

Nightmare: Last year's PFA and SFWA player of the year did not even start against Maribor last week

It begs the question – what exactly has Commons done wrong? The answer though is very little – aside from having a face that seemingly doesn’t fit into the manager’s preferred 4-2-3-1 model.

The tacit message Deila’s team selection spelled out against Maribor was that if you aren’t prepared to run, press and scrap to retrieve the ball in the final third like your life depends on it, then it’s going to be a struggle to accommodate you.

Deila will argue that he hasn’t yet cast the 30-year-old on the scrapheap. Given he has featured to some degree in all bar one of Celtic’s nine competitive games this season, his argument holds some water.

But it’s the game-time afforded to the former Scotland international in the past three matches – or rather the lack of it - that has given rise to the notion that he’s increasingly surplus to requirements.

An unused sub in Maribor last week, Commons had the dubious privilege of playing the entire 90 minutes at Inverness last Saturday – a day for the jersey-fillers, if ever there was one.

His worst fears were confirmed an hour and a half before kick-off on Tuesday – another place on the bench - and eventually a replacement it would transpire for Beram Kayal at the half-way point.

Exit: Commons could be heading for the exit with West Brom, Leicester and Norwich all interested

Sportsmail yesterday revealed that that player is considering his future as a result of the latest demotion – and it’s believed he sought an explanation from Deila on the night. He is unlikely to have been comforted by what he heard.

Now in the last year of his contract, the 30-year-old’s thoughts are no longer about securing the long-term extension – with one foot in the coaching camp - that was muted last season. Unless matters change radically, the temptation to explore options back in England even before Monday’s transfer deadline may prove tempting.

If he does go either now or in January (Norwich, Leicester and West Brom are all watching the situation) there will be much angst among the fans. And understandably so.

Upon signing for Celtic from Derby for £300,000 in January 2011, Commons scored 15 goals in half a season.

Form: Despite some poor sspells, Commons has matured with age, and managed 30 goals last season

The following term – his very own annus horribilis – saw him hit the net just once and face-off with humour rumours of a bust-up with Neil Lennon by training in bandages and a neck brace.

It proved to be no more than a blip: In 2012-13 he hit 19 goals then smashed 31 last term to sweep up the individual awards. Statistics that suggest he’s a ‘luxury player’ well worth making allowances for.

Commons may be a yard shy in pace of ever being classed as absolutely top drawer but, despite his retirement from Scotland duty last year, he remains an international class footballer. Together with Van Dijk and Mikael Lustig, he is the closest thing Celtic have to a star man these days.

Deila’s devotion to his system and insistence upon boundless energy is admirable to a degree but when it’s so slavish that a player of Commons’ ilk cannot be accommodated within it questions are naturally asked.

If the player is handed another watching brief at Dens Park on Sunday, he will at least feel he has the answer to the most pressing query in his mind.

With the transfer window closing the following evening, he may be of a view to seek a swift resolution to a growing problem.
