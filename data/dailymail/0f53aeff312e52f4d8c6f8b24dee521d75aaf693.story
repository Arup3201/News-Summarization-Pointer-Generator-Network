Pressure: Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO of News Corporation, has been asked by MPs to explain his recorded comments criticising the police

Rupert Murdoch has been challenge by MPs to explain his secretly recorded comments criticising the ‘totally incompetent’ police inquiries into phone hacking and corrupt payments.

The News Corp boss faces a police investigation over the tapes in which he criticises the ‘unbelievable’ treatment of journalists and he suggests he knew about corrupt payments to public officials.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, has given the media tycoon five days to respond to a demand for an explanation.

In the tapes, Murdoch expresses his fury at ‘incompetent police’ as he tries to placate staff furious at dawn raids at their homes, arrests and criminal charges.

In one exchange, the News Corp boss is told that dubious ‘working practices’ at News International went back many years.

He says: ‘We’re talking about payments for news tips from cops. That’s been going on a hundred years, absolutely. You didn’t instigate it.’

Critics say the tape shows Murdoch’s real attitude to the crisis, in contrast to the apparent contrition he displayed when giving evidence to MPs two years ago.

The request from Mr Vaz follows evidence to the committee from the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner Cressida Dick who said since May ‘voluntary co-operation (with News UK) has been significantly reduced and all requests for new material are now supervised by the courts’.

Miss Dick also said that Scotland Yard was trying to get a copy of the recording of Mr Murdoch, and added: ‘We will then assess the full contents of that tape.’

On the secret tape Mr Murdoch is heard railing at the way the police behaved.

‘Still, I mean, it's a disgrace. Here we are, two years later, and the cops are totally incompetent,’ he said.

‘The idea that the cops then started coming after you, kick you out of bed, and your families, at six in the morning, is unbelievable.

‘But why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing.

‘And now they're arresting their own, who never even took money. They're going to put all newspapers out of business.’

The last time: Mr Murdoch memorably addressed the culture select committee in July 2007

When one of the journalists present questioned why so much material had been handed over to the police by News Corp's management and standards committee (MSC), Mr Murdoch indicated that he believed they had gone too far.

‘Because - it was a mistake, I think. But, in that atmosphere, at that time, we said, 'Look, we are an open book, we will show you everything'. And the lawyers just got rich going through millions of emails,’ he said.

He added: ‘All I can say is, for the last several months, we have told, the MSC has told, and (name withheld), who's a terrific lawyer, has told the police, has said 'No, no, no - get a court order. Deal with that'.’

In his letter Mr Vaz told Mr Murdoch: ‘The Committee has asked that I write to you and give you a chance to respond to the reported comments you made to a meeting of Sun employees in March and recorded in a tape apparently leaked to Exaro news, and to the comments made by AC Dick and Commander (Neil) Basu regarding yourself and News UK (formerly News International).’

He said it would be ‘very helpful’ if the media mogul could respond to the request by noon on July 17.

Mr Murdoch is also expected to be recalled to appear before MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport select committee in the autumn to answer questions over the tape.
