James Hird has kept his job as Essendon's senior coach, the club has announced.

There had been speculation this morning that Hird was likely to be sacked.

In a statement released this afternoon, Chairman Paul Little said it would be 'potentially reckless' to make any significant decisions until there is 'further clarity' on some ongoing issues. 

Decision time: James Hird will remain as a senior coach. 

Keeping moving: Hird ran laps of the club's new training facility in Tullamarine, Melbourne, today. 

Laps: The current and future coach of the Essendon Football Club. 

All smiles: James Hird was given good news today.

Those issues were Hird's Federal Court appeal and anti-doping agency ASADA's expected re-issuing of show-cause notices. 

'The Board recognises the rights of James to pursue his appeal of the recent Federal Court decision,' Mr Little said. 

'James remains senior coach of the Essendon Football Club and will work closely with other members of the Football Department during this particularly important trade and planning period in preparation for the 2015 season.'

'The Board has set no timeframe on further considering these matters, however, will monitor developments as they occur.'

Mr Little said the board recognised there are 'many different opinions on these matters'.  

The Board of the Essendon Football Club met today and resolved to retain its existing football structure in the immediate term.

Chairman Paul Little said there were several complex matters of significance currently in progress, being the Federal Court Appeal by James Hird and the expected re-issuing of show-cause notices by ASADA.

'As such, the Board believes it would be potentially reckless to make any decisions of significance until there is further clarity on these crucial matters.

'The Board recognises the rights of James to pursue his appeal of the recent Federal Court decision.

'The Board has set no timeframe on further considering these matters, however, will monitor developments as they occur.

'After discussions with key relevant parties, we remain hopeful the ASADA process can be expedited and completed prior to the end of 2014. In the meantime, we will continue to provide all available support to the players and their families.

'The Board understands the uncertainty ongoing media speculation creates for our members and supporters. We recognise there are many different opinions on these matters and reaffirm the Board is committed to acting in the best interests of the Club and its members.
