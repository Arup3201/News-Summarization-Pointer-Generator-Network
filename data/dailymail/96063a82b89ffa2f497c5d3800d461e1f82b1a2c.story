A fourth doctor has died of Ebola in Sierra Leone after a failed bid to transfer her abroad for treatment.

Dr Olivet Buck died last night hours after the World Health Organisation said it could not help medically evacuate her to Germany.

Sierra Leone had requested funds from the organisation to transfer her for treatment saying it could not afford to lose another doctor.

But Chief Medical Officer Dr Brima Kargbo today confirmed that the Sierra Leone national had died on Saturday night. 

WHO had said it could not meet the request but instead would work to give Dr Buck 'the best care possible' in Sierra Leone, including access to experimental drugs.

It is a huge setback for the impoverished country that is battling the virulent disease amid a shortage of health care workers.  

A total of 301 health workers had become infected with the disease as of September 7 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to WHO. 

Of that tally, which included suspected and probable cases in addition to confirmed ones, 144 had died.

Because Ebola is only transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of people showing symptoms or from dead bodies of Ebola victims, health workers have been especially vulnerable as they respond to the worst outbreak in history.

The infections have exacerbated shortages of doctors and nurses in West African countries that were already low on skilled health personnel.

So far, only foreign health and aid workers have been evacuated abroad from Sierra Leone and Liberia for treatment.

Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor, was being considered for evacuation to a European country when he died of the disease in late July. 

Ebola victims suffer vomiting, diarrhea, internal and external bleeding in the final stages of the disease, leaving their bodies coated in the virus. 

To treat the sick, doctors require training and protective clothing - both of them scarce in Africa.

The outbreak - the first in West Africa - was detected five months ago deep in the forests of southeastern Guinea. But it was not until August 8 that the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency and promised more resources.

The doctor's death comes just days after a study found that the Ebola outbreak could hit 15 countries across Africa - putting the lives of 22 million people at risk

In a world first, Oxford scientists created a map of places most at risk of an Ebola outbreak warning regions likely to be home to animals harbouring the virus are more widespread than previously feared, particularly in West Africa.

Around 2,400 people have died from Ebola in the current West Africa outbreak, which has infected at least 4,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal.

The World Health Organisation says it will take months to bring the epidemic under control and is warning there may be up to 20,000 cases before it is stopped.
