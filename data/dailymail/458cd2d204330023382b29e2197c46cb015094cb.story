The last photography craze to sweep the internet, known as 'planking', saw people balancing poker-straight on inanimate, often dangerous, objects.

But a new craze has gone viral whereby internet users picture themselves doing something even more risky - taking their heads off.

Photographs are beginning to flood the web showing seemingly beheaded people standing beside a detached head.

Where's your head at: The craze, known as horsemanning, has started to sweep the internet. The name is derived from the Headless Horseman

Craze: Horsemanning is not a new craze and is thought to have been performed in front of cameras since the 1920s

Ouch: People adopt humourous positions to make it appear they have been beheaded

With the swift death of 'planking' and 'owling', it was only a matter of time before 'horsemaning' had its moment once more.

Spurred by historical pictures of people cleverly posing as if they had been beheaded, internet users have flooded sites with their own takes on the concept.

The craze is a homage to the folklore character, the Headless Horseman.

The optical trick sees people positioning their bodies so that their head cannot be seen. Another person then positions themselves nearby, making it appear that the head has been detached.

Heads will roll: Whether it is going to work, or posing by the Great Wall of China, tricksters can easily seize the moment for a spot of horsemanning

The set-up allows people room for improvisation, often with hilarious results.

But if the savvy photgraphers taking the snaps think they are being wholly original by partaking in the craze, they may want to think again.

Horsemanning dates as far back as the 1920s, when it was a popular way to pose for photographs.

Inventive users often use props such as sofas to perform the trick, but some are slightly darker, placing their headless bodies in machines and under cars.

It is the latest in a series of trends to take over message boards and forums.

Before 'planking', the internet was awash with people 'owling', whereby they would sit like the nocturnal bird in unusual positions.
