Australians are drinking and smoking less but are getting more anxious and fatter with three in five people still considered overweight, a new report has found.

In the new state of the nation health study, the report by Roy Morgan Research suggests anxiety might be a result of rising unemployment rates.

Roy Morgan chief executive Michele Levine, who will present the report findings in Melbourne today, said about 20 per cent of young people have expressed feeling anxious in the past 12 months.

Three in five Australian adults are still overweight with a body mass index of over 25 despite becoming a nation of 'weight watchers'

'It was increasing gently but it really starts to pick up around 2012. And that's the time also that unemployment and underemployment really started to kick up. When you put the two trend lines on a chart, they correlate quite strongly,' Ms Levine told ABC radio.

Anti-smoking and anti-drink-driving campaigns across the country have had a positive effect and the report suggested the decrease in smoking numbers also had something to do with increased taxes and a focus on plain packaging introduced by the federal government.

'The reduction in alcohol consumption… I think we've actually seen, again, a fairly strong anti-drink-driving campaign. And there's been enough information to get people to curb their drinking. The only one form of alcohol that's actually increasing is cider,' Ms Levine said.

But three in five Australian adults are still overweight with a body mass index of over 25 despite becoming a nation of 'weight watchers'.  This is a combined overweight total of more than 180,000 tonnes of extra weight, up from 150,000 in 2008.

Ms Levine said certain facts in the report like being overweight had to be investigated, but suggested obesity was largely an older person's issue.

'We worry about our weight. We think about our weight. We say that we're monitoring the calories we eat and yet our weight continues to increase,' Ms Levine said.

The report found Australians were also drinking less thanks to anti-drink-driving campaigns

The report found Australians had consistent levels of good eating and exercise, even though people don't tend to participate in as much organised sport.

'We've stopped doing so much organised sport but our level of engagement in physical activity like doing exercises and going for walks and going to the gym, that's actually taken off,' she said.

The report examines how Australians are faring across seven key health areas: smoking, alcohol consumption, nutrition, activity levels, illnesses, Body Mass Index (BMI) and psychological well being.

Results show that Australians have improved in every category particularly smoking with Australians now smoking almost eight million fewer cigarettes daily than in 2008.
