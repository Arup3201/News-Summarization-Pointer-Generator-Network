The early bird may catch the worm, but it seems the late arrival has to settle for, well, a broken bit of twig.

Still, this raven appeared to be making the best of the situation – lying on its back and playing with its new toy.

The strange bird-brained behaviour was spotted by Jens Buddrich, 62, at a park in Schleswig, Germany.

This raven appears to have got the wrong end of the stick as it uses the twig to play with rather than build a nest or simply perch upon

The nurse and amateur photographer, said: 'It was really unusual to watch this raven playing with the stick.

'It looked as if the bird was enjoying itself.' Yesterday bird behaviour expert Dave Paynter said this type of bird is known for playing around.

The Reserve Manager at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire said: 'People often don't realise how amazing our common birds are.

'All the corvid family - including crows, magpies and ravens - are very intelligent and like many intelligent creatures they learn and challenge themselves through play.'

He continued: 'At Slimbridge Wetland Centre we sometimes see whole gangs of crows using a stick for a game of tag.

'I've seen ravens flying upside down for no apparent reason, and I've even seen examples of raven leapfrog with a bird lying on its back whilst its mate repeatedly hops over it.'

Experts say ravens are intelligent birds who challenge themselves with playing
