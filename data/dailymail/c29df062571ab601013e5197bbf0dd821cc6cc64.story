Workers carrying out renovations have uncovered the grisly remains of eight human bodies believed to have been killed by Indian security forces as recently as 20 years ago.

The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital of India's northeastern Manipur state.

They appear to have been buried somewhere between 20 and 40 years ago when the area was used by the police force and later by a commando unit of the Indian army.

The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital India's northeastern Manipur state

It was around this time that there were a large number of 'enforced disappearances' of people in the region, believed to have been victims of 'extra-judicial executions' by security forces.

The executions of, mainly young, Indians that occurred in Manipur were part of 'shoot to kill' policy aimed at clamping down on the activities of insurgents.

Under the Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) 1958, security forces have unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared disturbed.

Even a non-commissioned officer is granted the right to shoot to kill based on mere suspicion that it is necessary to do so in order to 'maintain the public order'.

Rights groups have claimed that security forces used the act as a shield while they carried out human rights violations including arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and enforced disappearances.

The Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act  allows soldiers unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared 'disturbed'.

This gives the army sweeping powers, including the power to shoot to kill in certain situations and to arrest people without warrants. 

The Act also provides virtual immunity from prosecution by requiring prior permission to prosecute from the Central Government. 

It has been put into force in parts of northeast India - including Manipur - since 1958. 

Amnesty says the law has 'facilitated grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, rape and torture and other ill treatment'.

The Extra Judicial Execution Victim Families Association (EEVFAM) Manipur and the The Families of the Involuntarily Disappeared Association, Manipur (FIDAM) noted that the compound had been used by the 49 Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for more than 20 years and later by a commando unit.

According to the EEVFAM, some 1,528 people were killed in Manipur in extra-judicial executions between May 1979 and May 2012. 

However, those demanding an investigation into the uncovered remains have said it is unlikely that even if the killers are identified that there will be any action.

But there is now huge pressure in the region  to identify the dead bodies with DNA tests on each skull and the remains.

It is hoped that this could bring closure to at least some of the families of the hundreds of  people who have gone missing in the state.

Manipur has had a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence with various separatist groups including the communists, the People's Liberation Party, the People's Revolutionary Army and the United National Liberation Front.

Individual groups have been responsible for armed robberies and attacks on police stations and army bases as part of their campaign to be free of Indian control.

In 1980, the central government brought the entire state of Manipur under the AFSPA because the state government claimed that   local police needed the help of the Armed Forces to maintain law and order.
