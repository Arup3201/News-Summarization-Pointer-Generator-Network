Andre Schurrle insists he is going nowhere in the January transfer window.

The Chelsea forward has struggled for a place in Jose Mourinho’s first-team, behind Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar for a place in their attacking midfield three.

But Mourinho handed the chance to some of his fringe players in Wednesday night’s win over Sporting Lisbon and Schurrle responded with a goal.

Andre Schurrle scored his first goal since September in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon

Afterwards he vowed: ‘I am not going to change the club in the transfer window.

‘I am happy here, happy in London and the fans. We have a great team and want to win something this season, this is where I belong.

‘To score after a long time when it wasn’t so good for me, I’m very happy. I’m not where I want to be with my body, but it’s getting better and I’m happy to have scored and we won.’

Schurrle has struggled for fitness after going all the way in the World Cup with Germany during the summer.

But there has also been a mystery illness which has sapped his energy. He was not comfortable naming what problem he has suffered, but did explain: ‘The illness has lasted weeks and weeks.

‘I did not feel really well, and on the pitch I tried to work harder, but I needed more time. But for the last couple of weeks, I was training very, very hard and trying to get back my fitness.

‘I’m not where I want to be but I feel better and you could see that I was very motivated out there last night.

‘I don’t want to say what the medical name for the illness was but while the symptoms may have gone away, it still takes a lot of time to get back to match fitness.’
