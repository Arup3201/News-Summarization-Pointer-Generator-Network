Neglect: Carly Harper, 24, died after staff failed to act quickly over a serious infection, her parents claim

A mother and her unborn son both died because inexperienced hospital staff failed to provide urgent treatment after a scan showed the baby was dying, her parents have claimed.

Carly Harper, 24, was five months pregnant with her first child when her waters broke on May 17 last year.

She went to hospital and two days later developed a serious infection and was sweaty with a fluctuating temperature, key symptoms of septic shock.

She told staff at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, she was in pain on the morning of May 19, apparently indicating her contractions had started early.

At 3.15pm on May 19, when an utlrasound scan showed Miss Harper’s baby boy was dying, doctors chose to induce the birth.

But her family claim staff delayed inducing the labour and did not act quickly enough over signs that Miss Harper had a severe infection.

It was not until 9.28pm that evening – more than six hours after the scan – that she gave birth to the stillborn boy.

She was taken straight to intensive care and placed on a ventilator, but died of multiple organ failure at 9.10am the next day with her family at her bedside.

Her distraught parents Robert, 59, and Christine, 53, have now hired solicitors to investigate the hospital, claiming that neither clinicians or nurses knew what to do and disagreed about treatment.

They allege that staff were negligent and that this led to the death of their daughter and her child, which she was expecting with boyfriend Alex Dearden.

Miss Harper had already been into hospital a month before her death to have a procedure which would prevent her going into premature labour, but it was unsuccessful.

Speaking after an inquest was opened into her death, her father, 59, said: ‘How can it be that a healthy, young pregnant woman can go into hospital and for neither she nor her baby to see the light of day again?'

He described how Miss Harper called 
him on the day she went into hospital and told him that things did not 
look good but he should stay at home.

At 1.30am, she called again and said “you better get here fast”’

‘When I saw Carly in the ICU my first words were "my god, what have they done to her." I just couldn’t understand what had happened.

'We were all talking to Carly; trying to encourage her to stay with us but she just wasn’t responding. Seeing your daughter like that is absolutely devastating.

‘The look on the faces of the staff told me how grave the situation had become. All we could do was watched as she drifted away from us and then, that morning, she was gone.’

Mr Harper, a banker from Heswall, 
Merseyside, has not worked since July last year after he was diagnosed with depression over his daughter's death, his solicitor said.

He said he believes staff could have done far more to save
Miss Harper and his grandchild.

‘It
was as if the junior staff were left alone to deal with it,’ he said. 
‘We witnessed a complete lack of leadership and staff appeared unwilling
to step in to take responsibility for Carly’s treatment.

‘It felt like someone had pulled the rug from under us. Carly went into hospital a healthy girl and look what they did to her.

‘Two
lives were lost that day. My family and I are still suffering and I 
will never let it go until our daughter and her baby receive justice.'

Simpson
Millar LLP Solicitors, representing the family, said an 
internal report by the hospital had already identified failings.

Solicitor
Stephanie Forman said: 'The Trust has produced a Serious Incident 
Review Report which recognises a number of failings in the care provided
to Carly - including the failure of the obstetric team to respond with 
sufficient urgency to the seriousness of Carly’s condition.

‘Although it was apparent that the doctors and nurses were faced with a busy maternity ward that day, they did not know how to prioritise the patients and there was little involvement from the consultant until it was too late.

Claim: Miss Harper died in May last year at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral. Her family claim staff were negligent

'The window of time when Carly’s life might have been saved was lost and her family are now living with the consequences.

'The very least they deserve is absolute clarity about what happened on that fatal day in May, and to be reassured steps are taken to prevent the senseless loss of such young lives again in the future.'

An inquest was opened and adjourned on Tuesday and a full hearing will be held later.

A spokesman for Arrow Park Hospital said it was not appropriate to comment until the conclusion of the inquest.
