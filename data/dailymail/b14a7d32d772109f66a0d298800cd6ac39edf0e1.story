The biological mother of Maria, the blonde girl found in a Roma camp in Greece, has had five of her nine other children taken into care.

The Telegraph reported state authorities have taken the children from the home of Bulgarian couple Sasha and Atanas Ruseva.

Sasha Ruseva, 35, was proved to be the biological mother of the four-year-old via a DNA test after an international appeal was launched to reveal the girl's true identity.

Maria: The four-year-old girl was found after a police raid in Farsala, Greece

Maria was found living in Farsala after a police raid two weeks ago, and Bulgarian authorities have said they will ask Greece to hand her over.

Mrs Ruseva, and her two youngest children - Nasko, three, and Penka, two - were moved to housing in Stara Zagora, the regional capital 25 miles from the Roma ghetto on the outskirts of Nikolaevo where the family lived.

Kosyo Kosev, the mayor of Nikolaevo, said: 'Social services have decided to settle Mrs Ruseva and her two youngest children in social housing while the other five under age will be re-homed for the time being either in a state institution or with foster families.'

The couple also have a two older daughters, aged 20 and 18, who are married and have children of their own.

Maria is currently being cared for by
 the Smile Of The Child Charity in Athens. She will stay there until 
state authorities decide what will happen to her next.

Bulgaria's State Agency For Child Protection (SACP) wants Maria returned.

Eva Zhecheva, head of the SACP, said: 'Bulgarian
 authorities are ready to take full responsibility for Maria now that it
 is known she is the child of Bulgarian nationals.'

Maria will most likely be taken to a crisis centre or placed in foster care 
until she is either returned to her biological family, or found a 
permanent home.

'Maria will remain there until a solution is found for her upbringing â€“ a return to her biological family, a placement with relatives, or in a foster home or state institution,' Mrs Zhecheva said.

'We are awaiting a decision from Greek authorities as whether she will be transferred to Bulgaria.'

Mrs Ruseva said she wants Maria to live with her.

She is under investigation for allegedly selling her child in Greece where she and her husband were working as olive pickers, before returning to Bulgaria.

She denies receiving money for the child and insists she meant to return for her but 'was too poor and then another two babies came along'.

Christos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, the Greek Roma couple with whom Maria was found in Farsala, have been charged with child abduction and falsifying documents.

Their lawyers are expected to appeal the charges and the couple have said they will apply for custody for the child they have brought up 'like their own'.

DNA tests on both Dimopoulou and Salis found that they were not biologically related to Maria
