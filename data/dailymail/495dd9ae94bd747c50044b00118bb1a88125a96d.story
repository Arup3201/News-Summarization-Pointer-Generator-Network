A retired scientist has stripped off for a naked photo shoot to celebrate her new face.

Beverley-Jane Last, 51, from Walmer, Kent, decided to boost her confidence that little bit more with a flattering boudoir set of pictures to complement her operation.

'I've always worked hard at looking good. I exercise regularly, I'm careful with my diet and, as a result, I've weighed eight stone for the last 30 years,' says Beverley-Jane.

Beverley-Jane, 51, booked a boudoir photoshoot to give her an extra confidence boost following a facelift

She has been with husband Paul, 60, a retired pharmaceutical executive, for 22 years, and will gift him an album of the sexy snaps as an anniversary present.

She says: 'I was 50 last year, and while I felt happy with how I looked from the neck down, I didn't recognise the woman looking back at me in the mirror with her saggy jowls and puffy eyes.

'I used expensive creams and make-up, but nothing can hide the signs of ageing, so in April 2012 I paid for a private face lift which cost me £8,500.

'It was worth every penny. I looked younger, but still felt I could do with a confidence boost.'

So, inspired by a friend who'd done a boudoir shoot, Beverley-Jane booked one for herself at the Red Bow Boudoir studio in Canterbury in September.

'I told people what I was planning: one woman said she didn't think it was appropriate for someone of my age, but I just ignored her.

'I was determined to feel good again - and my husband supported me, which is all that mattered to me.

'The shoot lasted four hours. I loved every second - they made me feel so wonderful that I did five sets of photographs in a variety of outfits, before posed naked. I felt like a movie star.'

'I'm having an album made which I'll give to Paul later this month on the anniversary of the day we met 22 years ago.

'We'll also have one of the photographs framed and hung in our bedroom - a permanent reminder of the day I rediscovered my confident self again.'

'Beverley was a dream client. She had got to an age where she started to feel invisible and so decided to have a facelift to give her that boost of confidence again,' says Alison of Red Bow Boudoir Photography.

'I have to say what a great job they did, she just smiled the whole time.

'The shoot was an extra boost for her and she could then see the results. One of the photos was put on my Facebook page and the feedback was amazing. She felt great again.

'I love helping other women feel great about themselves even if it’s in a small way.'
