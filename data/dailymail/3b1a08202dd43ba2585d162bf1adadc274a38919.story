Thomas Muller may be joint leading scorer at the 2014 World Cup, but he was severely off target during a Germany training session - as one man eating lunch found to his cost.

The Bayern Munich forward is on course to reclaim the Golden Boot that he won at the 2010 World Cup after scoring a hat-trick in Germany's opening 4-0 demolition of Portugal - making it eight goals in seven games for him at the tournament.

However, during a practice session with Bastian Schweinsteiger, Muller managed to chip the ball over some improbably small goals and into the team's dining area where it hit an unassuming member of staff squarely in the face.

Muller apologised and, fortunately, the victim didn't fall to the floor clutching his face like Muller had done after being fouled by Pepe in Germany's opening game, subsequently leading to a red card for the combustible Portuguese defender.

Despite his play-acting getting criticised by the likes of Diego Maradona, Muller only hoped that he wasn't made to look like a fool on global television.

'I’d
 like to see it on TV,’ Muller told German television station ARD. ‘I 
only hope that I looked okay. I felt a blow from his fist.

‘But
 what happened after that I can’t really remember, whether we were 
head-to-head or not. I just hope it didn’t look stupid on TV.

‘I didn’t want to cheat,’ Muller added. ‘I felt Pepe’s hit. I can’t influence a red card, and I was not playing for a red card.'

Germany face Ghana in their second game on Saturday, where Muller will be hoping to add to his tally for the tournament.
