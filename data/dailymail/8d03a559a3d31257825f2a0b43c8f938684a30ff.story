The escalating violence in Syria’s civil war spilled over its borders yesterday into Turkey and Lebanon.

Just 24 hours before a UN peace plan was due to come into force, soldiers loyal to president Bashar al-Assad fired into a refugee camp inside Turkey, killing three people.

The camp, in the town of Kilis, had been due to be visited by former UN chief Kofi Annan today.

Witnesses said a number of people were
injured, including Turks, in the ‘sustained’ assault, which began when 
eight wounded opposition fighters escaped across the border and Syrian 
forces kept firing at them.

The attack was the first since Turkey 
began allowing 24,000 refugees, including hundreds of army defectors, to
find shelter in the country.

Last night a cameraman with Lebanon’s 
Al-Jadeed TV station was killed after Syrian troops opened fire on the 
car he was travelling in close to the Lebanese-Syrian border.

The U.S. said it was ‘outraged’ by the shootings while Turkey and Lebanon also condemned the killings.

Inside Syria, another 30 people were killed in the town of Hama yesterday following heavy shelling.

April 12 - 6 a.m: deadline for total cease-fire under Annan agreement.

Kofi Annan has put forward a peace plan to end the fighting and has laid down a deadline for Syria to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns tomorrow.

However, yesterday Syria demanded written guarantees that insurgents will stop fighting before it pulls back troops.

China has acknowledged differences with Turkey over their approach to the continuing violence in Syria ahead of talks with Turkey's leader who is making a rare official visit to Beijing.

China has joined Russia in blocking attempts by the U.S. and others at the United Nations to compel President Bashar Assad's regime to end violence against political opponents waging a 13-month uprising.

That has drawn accusations that Beijing is providing political cover for Assad, with whom it has long enjoyed friendly relations.

Turkey, on the other hand, has been one of Assad's most active critics and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that they are considering taking unspecified steps if Assad's forces do not pull out of towns and cities by tomorrow as agreed.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin
said China wants an immediate end to violence and hopes the 
international community will give Annan more time to put a cease-fire 
agreement in place.

'We think the final resolution needs all sides to sit down and talk,' he said.

The truce plan effectively collapsed on Sunday after Assad's government issued their new last-minute demands.

Eyewitnesses said troops have stepped up their attacks ahead of Tuesday's deadline.

The
Free Syrian Army does not recognise the regime 'and for that reason we 
will not give guarantees,' he said, adding the government should 
withdraw its forces to bases and remove checkpoints from streets.

Mr
Annan's deal calls for government forces to withdraw from population 
centres tomorrow before a full ceasefire by both sides starts at 6am on Thursday.

Even before the setback, expectations were low that the Assad regime would honour the agreement.

There were claims that heavy fighting during the past week has led to 1,000 deaths. The UN estimates that 9,000 people have been killed in total during the year-long conflict.

Russia, an Assad ally that supports 
the cease-fire plan, may now be the only one able to salvage it. The 
rest of the international community, unwilling to contemplate military 
intervention, has little leverage over Syria.

However, in recent days, Syrian 
forces have stepped up shelling attacks on restive towns, and activists 
say scores of civilians have been killed daily - at least 100 on 
Saturday alone.

Activists said at least 21 people were killed in violence yesterday.

Yesterday disturbing footage emerged 
allegedly showing Syrian troops beating an anti-government rebel in the 
suburbs of the country's capital, Damascus.

Brutal: Frames from the mobile video footage uploaded to YouTube, which allegedly shows members of the Syrian government forces beating a rebel in the suburbs of Damascus

The mobile video, which came to light on Sunday, has not yet been verified.

It
shows a man lying face down on a dusty floor, his hands behind his back
as three others - two of them wearing fatigues -  stand on his neck and
back, kicking him and hitting him with a small club.

The clip was uncovered by news agency AFP as a UN-brokered peace deal for Syria appeared to collapse.

Separately, a leading international 
human rights group said Syrian forces have summarily executed more than 
100 people, most of them civilians.

This includes several mass executions in the restive provinces of Homs and Idlib, the study by Human Rights Watch said.

The New-York-based group says it only
included cases corroborated by witnesses but has received more reports 
of similar incidents. The executions took place over the past four 
months, with most in March.
