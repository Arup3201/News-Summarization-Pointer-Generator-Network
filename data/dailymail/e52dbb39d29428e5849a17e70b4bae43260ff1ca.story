A soldier storms towards a forest, the night sky illuminated by explosions; a Lynx helicopter test-fires its flares in beautiful symmetry; and a young airman embraces his sweetheart after proposing.

These are just some of the amazing photos which offer a rare and fascinating glimpse into the lives of sailors and marines both at sea and on land.

They are all winners in the annual Royal Navy photo competition and show the many sides of the Forces which usually go unseen by the public.

The Royal Navy photographers deploy 
with warships and commando units all over the world, from Antarctica to 
Afghanistan and from the UK to the Far East.

Among the winning images are commandos seen training in the Mojave desert, in California, and helicopter units on exercise in Norway.

This year's overall winner was Leading Airman David Jenkins, whose photos included an image of the annual Dunkirk little ships Thames cruise for WWII veterans.

Other pictures show night exercises and ships on deployment.

'It has been a fantastic competition 
and one that has demonstrated the exceptional talent and professionalism
of the men and women of the Navy's photographic branch - and also of 
those amateurs who have captured some outstanding imagery,' said Captain
Ian Stidston, head of the Royal Navy photographic branch.

'The
standard of the images submitted are testament to the diversity and 
adaptability of our people and clearly demonstrate dedication to both 
their art and their service.

'I
could not be more proud of the way the photographers have managed to 
capture still and moving images that clearly tell the story of the Royal
Navy and Royal Marines and the range of operations on which we deploy.'
