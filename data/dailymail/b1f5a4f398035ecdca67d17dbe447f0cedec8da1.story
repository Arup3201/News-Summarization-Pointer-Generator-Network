Accused: Shane Hawkins murdered his 11-month-old baby son by violently shaking him before giving six different versions of how he died, a court heard

A father murdered his 11-month-baby by violently shaking and throwing him before giving six different versions of how he died, a court heard.

Shane Hawkins, 25, allegedly shook eleven-month-old Kaydon before 'throwing him down' causing bleeding and swelling to his brain and eyes.

The court was told a neighbour above the flat shared by 
Hawkins and his girlfriend Anna Libby heard arguing on the 
day Kaydon was rushed to the Royal Cornwall Hospital.

Miss Libby left for work leaving their 
son with Hawkins - but just 17 minutes later he was forced to dial 999 
to summon paramedics to the property.

Kaydon was rushed to hospital on December 11, 2010 but died three days later.

Hawkins, of Bodmin, Cornwall, denies murder at Truro Crown Court.

Martin Meeke, prosecuting, said: 
'Kaydon was only 11 months old when he died and we say this defendant 
killed him by shaking him so violently that it caused brain injuries 
that he could not recover from.

'Having shaken him, he either threw him down in his cot or struck his head, causing bruising to his head.'

The trial heard Hawkins gave six different reasons of how his son died.

He first told paramedics that Kaydon had fallen - then told a hospital doctor he had slipped from his arms and hit his head on the floor.

He then told a friend the baby had gone 'floppy' and later Hawkins explained to a medic that he dropped Kaydon on the carpeted floor.

His fifth version of events came after 
he told another doctor Kaydon had started vomiting before telling police
his son had banged his head on a heater.

Mr Meeke told the court: 'On the day Kaydon was 
taken to hospital, a neighbour in the flat above reported hearing 
arguments and things being thrown around.

'He then heard a huge thud which got his
attention and he wondered what it could be, 20 minutes later he noticed
the blue lights outside.'

Fiona Libby, Anna Libby's sister, told the court Kaydon had previously showed signs of injury.

She said: 'When he was two to three weeks old he had two black eyes, just under his eyes and slight bruising on his nose.

'When he was a month old he had a cut mouth, his lip was cut and all his gums were black.

'The only time I remember him not having marks on him was when Shane was working full time.'

She continued: 'Once, Shane picked him up and Kaydon began crying like he was scared, I've never seen him cry like that before.'

The trial continues.
