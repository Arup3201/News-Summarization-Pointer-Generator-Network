Parents are too obsessed by their children doing brilliantly in exams and are over-looking the importance of them getting a job, according to the Government-backed Women’s Business Council.

When they are young, it is also extremely useful for a child to get a part-time job, such as working in a local shop on a Saturday, it said.

Sue O’Brien, from the Women’s Business Council, who is also chief executive of the recruitment company Norman Broadbent, said there has been a ‘huge change’ over the last decade.

Obsession: The Women's Business Council said a generation of children were leaving school with little or no real experience of the workplace

It used to be commonplace for children to do part-time jobs while they were at school, but this trend has now been overtaken by many parents’ obsession with academic excellence.

As a result, a generation of children are leaving school or university with little or no real experience of the workplace, which leaves them totally unprepared for working life.

Mrs O’Brien said parents should think twice before pressurising their children to achieve top grades to the exclusion of anything else.

She said: ‘I think it is the pressure that we are putting children under to excel and exceed in academic life.

‘It means that they then don’t get the practical work experience of: "This is what it is going to be like to find a job when I leave school".'

Saturday job: A spokeswoman for the council said part-time work helped to teach children how to multi-task and boosted their employability

She added: ‘There are an awful lot of
graduates leaving university at the moment who literally have got no 
work experience at all. It is a huge deficit.’

She
raised fears some schools are discouraging pupils from getting a 
part-time job because they worry it will disrupt their academic studies 
and consequently hit the school’s performance in league tables.

Mrs
O’Brien said: ‘I think they [schools] can often advise children: "Don’t
get a Saturday job. Focus on your education", particularly because they
want to improve their performance on tables.

‘You need to have employable young people leaving our education system. That is not just about their academic ability.’

Her own career was shaped by getting a job at the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s when she was a 16-year-old school girl.

Warnings: Maria Miller recently emphasised the importance of flexible working opportunities for women with young children

She worked every Thursday night from 5pm-8pm and for seven hours every Saturday, and went onto to work for Sainsbury’s for 12 years rising rapidly up the career ladder.

But too many modern parents want their children ‘to focus purely on the academic route’, she said, which does not help their long-term job prospects.

By getting a job while they are a school, it helps children to learn the crucial skill of ‘multi-tasking’, such as finishing their homework, revising for exams and holding down a job.

The warning comes as Maria Miller, the Women’s Minister, said women’s career opportunities are being hurt by ‘a workplace designed by men for men.’

She said working flexibly is absolutely crucial for a woman to be able to succeed, particularly when her children are young.

Mrs Miller, who has three children, said: ‘The evidence is clear. Speaking as an employer myself I know that if you can offer employees that flexibility, you can keep the best for longer.’

She said it is wrong that so many women’s careers ‘stall at the nursery gate’, and that they ‘simply disappear off the radar when it comes to more senior executive positions.’

Mrs Miller pointed out that this year is the 100th anniversary of the death of Emily Davison, the suffragette who died after stepping in front of the King’s horse at the Epsom derby.

She said it was ‘remarkable’ that women in the workplace ‘remains an issue’, adding: ‘You would have thought we would have dealt with that by now, but we haven’t.’

One of Britain’s top female bosses, Ruby McGregor-Smith, chairman of the Women’s Business Council, urged working mothers to share their experiences with one another.

The mother-of-two who is chief executive of the outsourcing giant Mitie said: ‘Actually saying: do you know it is really tough. It is OK for it to be tough.

‘We are not expecting everyone to find sleepless nights and board meetings the next day an easy option.’

Laura Perrins, from the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter and a full-time mother of two young children, said: ‘I couldn’t agree more that the macho culture at the heart of many companies needs to be changed.

‘Women who are in work shouldn’t face discrimination on account of their sex.’
