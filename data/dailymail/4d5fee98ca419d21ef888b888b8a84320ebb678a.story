A woman was shot while she was inside a hospital receiving treatment when a stray bullet came through her window.

The 62-year-old was hit in the abdomen as she sat on her bed at a hospital just outside Philadelphia.

The patient was taken to surgery and is in stable condition, a hospital spokesman said.

Shot: The stray bullet hit the 62-year-old woman as she was sitting in her room on the first floor of Crozer Chester Medical Center in Upland, Pennsylvania

The incident took place at Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at 11.45pm Monday.

‘Extremely unusual,’ Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said in a press conference.

‘Kind of shocking. I understand where people would be concerned.

'She heard a popping sound, then reached down to her side, her abdominal area, where she noticed she was in pain and had blood coming out of that area.'

District Attorney Whelan stressed that the hospital was completely safe and that this was an isolated incident.

The bullet was fired within one mile of Crozer Chester Medical Center, where the female patient is now in stable condition after surgery

It is believed the weapon was a 22.caliber or above as it pierced the double-glaze window of the hospital wing.

Investigators believe the bulled came from within a mile of the hospital.

Shots were reported fired at a nearby apartment block in Chester around the same time as the woman was struck in the hospital.

Residents claimed a dozen shorts were fired between people in two vehicles in the area.

Lisa Johnson, who lives in Crosby Square Apartments, said she was at home when she heard the shooting.

‘I told my children to get down to brace themselves,’ she told Fox News. 'This is a bad neighborhood. Gunshots are normal.’

No further injuries have been reported and no further damage caused, Crozer-Chester Medical Center said.

Police continue to investigate the incident.
