A two-year-old boy was in intensive care today after being found so malnourished that he weighed less than half as much as a normal child his age.

The toddler, whose heart had stopped, weighed between 8 and 10 pounds and had no hair or muscle tone when emergency responders arrived at his home in Moses Lake, Washington.

His mother, who said she chose to consult a Chinese herbalist when it came to health matters for her son, was seen attempting to perform CPR when emergency workers arrived.Â 

Malnourished: The toddler weighed less than 10lb and had no hair or muscle tone when emergency responders arrived at his home in Moses Lake, Washington

He was airlifted to a Spokane hospital, where his parents, Richard and Michelle Staats, remained with him.

In the police report, emergency workers noted that it was not likely that the boy would survive even once he arrived at the hospital.

'The child was treated for severe malnutrition and dehydration,' the search warrant for the family home stated.

'The child's condition was so severe that he was flown by MedStar to Spokane, Washington and was not expected to survive.'

Cause for concern: The boy was on life support at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane

The boy had no hair or muscle tone, had a weak pulse, was bleeding from the rectum and had a core body temperature of 89F compared to normal body temperature of 98.6F.

'It was also obvious that the child could not even have sat up on his own for some time,' the warrant stated.

The symptoms were consistent with long-term malnutrition.

Mrs Staats, 32, told detectives she had spoken about the boy to a Chinese herbalist in San Francisco on the telephone, and also had consulted with a local naturopath.

There are no known medical records for the boy, and police described him as 'skin and bones'.

Kyle Foreman, a spokesman for the Grant County Sheriff's Office, said: 'There are a lot of questions investigators need to find answers for.'

Emergency: The two-year-old, who lived in Moses Lake (pictured), weighed only a couple of pounds more than the average weight for a newborn baby in the U.S.

Four other children who lived at the family home were in good condition, Mr Foreman said.

They were taken into custody by child protective services.

John Wiley, a spokesman for the state Department of Social and Health Services in Spokane, said child protection workers had no previous contact with the family.

Mr Foreman could not speculate on why the other children were not ill.

He added: 'There have been no arrests, and no one has yet been charged.'

The scene: Emergency responders arrived at the home to find the boy's mother giving him CPR

Protection: Four other children who lived at the family home were taken into protective custody

'The parents did have the opportunity to check on their child but that child and all the other children are in the custody of child protective services so they are safe,' a police officer told local NBC affiliate KHQ.

According to a search warrant, someone at the home dialled 911 on May 9 to report that a child had stopped breathing.

Mrs Staats, 32, was giving the child CPR when emergency responders arrived.

The boy was taken first to a Moses Lake hospital, then airlifted 90 miles to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane.

According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a two-year-old boy in the U.S. usually weighs between 22lb and 34lb.

The malnourished toddler weighed only a couple of pounds more than the average weight for a newborn baby in the U.S.- 7lb 5oz.
