If Jeremy Paxman is still weighing up the merits of his new facial hair, this may be enough to have him reaching for the razor.

Men with beards look as much as eight years older than their clean shaven counterparts, a survey has revealed.

When members of the public were shown photographs of celebrities with and without beards, they believed that facial hair made them look an average of five years older. And Paxman, who is 63, was reckoned to look his real age with the beard, but only 55 before he grew it.

Paxman said he had grown a beard on his last few summer holidays but this year decided not to shave it off before returning to host Newsnight on Monday.

His decision sparked a flood of comments on Twitter - and Paxman even accused BBC bosses of suffering from pogonophobia, an irrational fear of beards.

A panel was shown pictures of celebrities like Paxman, Prince William, David Beckham Jude Law, George Clooney and Brad Pitt with and without a beard.

On average, the panel said the stars looked five years older â€“ and sometimes as much as eight years older - when they had a beard.

The research also showed that the longer the beard, the more years it puts on a man.

The only stars whose beards were said to have made them look younger were Hollywood actors Ben Affleck and Hugh Jackman.

Prince William's real age is 31 - but when the panel was shown a picture of the royal with a beard, they believed he looked 36.

David Beckham is 38 but he was aged at 34 by the panel when he was clean-shaven and 39 with a beard.

The panel also said that Jude Law looked his real age - 40 - when clean shaven but three years old when he sported a beard.

And as for George Clooney, he may be 52 but the panel said he looked his age with a beard yet 47 when shaved.

Only Hugh Jackman and Ben Affleck 
were said to look younger with beards - possibly because they almost 
always wear their beards short or as heavy stubble, or because there is no grey in their beards.

Affleck was aged at 39 with a beard and 41 without one. His real age is 41.

And Jackman was aged at 42 with heavy stubble and 44 - his real age - when clean shaven.

Crown Clinic surgeon Asim Shahmalak, 
who carried out the survey, said: 'The message from our research is very
clear - if you want to look younger, get rid of the beard.

'Jeremy Paxman is a brilliant presenter but he may need to get his razor out to shave a few years of his age!'

Dr
Shahmalak - hair loss expert on the Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing
Bodies - said that while beards have never been more fashionable with 
male celebrities, the hirsute look aged men by at least five years.

He said: 'Hairier men look more masculine but they also look older, especially if they wear their beard long like Brad Pitt.'
