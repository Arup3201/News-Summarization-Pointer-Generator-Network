A bride who spent her wedding night in police cells after hurling racist abuse at staff in a luxury hotel has today walked free from court.

Mother of four Kirsty Bigland, 30, who was still wearing her white wedding dress, shouted racist language when a card payment was refused as she and her husband Nick tried to check into their hotel room.

Staff ushered the newlyweds out of the four star Hilton Hotel in Manchester city centre's Deansgate due to their foul mouthed tirade before Bigland began running at security staff swearing and spitting.

Police were called to the Hilton Hotel in Manchester City Centre following the incident, which led to Bigland, pictured still in her wedding dress, spending her wedding night in the cells 

Both she and her new husband had to be restrained until police arrived at the £300 a night hotel before the pair were both taken to a nearby police station where they spent the night in neighbouring cells.

At Manchester Magistrates Court today, Bigland, from Salford admitted racially aggravated assault upon hotel doorman Mustapha Muhssen and was given a 20 week jail sentence suspended for 12 months.

She was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay the victim £150 compensation plus £250 prosecution costs.

Her husband, 25, who had pleaded guilty to disorderly behaviour at an earlier hearing failed to turn up for sentencing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

At an earlier hearing the court heard how the incident occurred in May this year after the couple married and had their reception in Manchester city centre.

After the function they were due to book into the Hilton at 11pm for their wedding night as customers were queuing outside a lift to go to the trendy Cloud 23 bar on the 23rd floor of hotel building.

Bigland, and her new husband Nick, had been due to stay at the Hilton after holding their reception at a venue in Manchester city centre 

But trouble began when the couple tried to use a friend’s credit card and it was denied.

It was then that Bigland hurled racist abuse and the couple had to be restrained by security staff.

Today the court was told that the security guard had wanted to drop the assault complaint as it was the Biglands’ wedding night.

He said his injuries had been 'very minor' and dismissed the incident as 'name calling, picking out differences in my appearance like calling someone fat'.

John Wolfson, defending said: 'She accepts the facts but she can’t recall everything. She had something to drink and she’d had a very happy day, described as "bridal bliss".

'They turned up at the hotel, but her husband had been drinking heavily.

'When she arrived she was wearing her wedding dress. She was very happy, had a case with her with a view of spending the night in the hotel but it was the honeymoon, that never happened.

'Instead she ended up in her wedding dress in a police cell, in separate cells to her husband.'

Mr Wolfson spoke of the mix up with bookings and added: 'Mr Bigland at that point got very upset and irate and made it known his views to staff, he became noisy and offensive and abusive.

'Kirsty became upset, she felt utterly humiliated standing in the middle of the hotel with people coming and going, she wanted to disappear.'

It was claimed Bigland told her husband she wanted to go and he gave her taxi money and and sat on a wall outside before Mr Bigland was escorted out by security.

Mr Wolfson added: 'She didn’t know what had happened inside to cause that.

'She saw him sat on the barrier. He was removed forcefully from that and taken down.

'She was very upset. The police came and she was taken to the police station.'

The court heard that Bigland had been 'very upset' by a comment that said she had looked 'cheap'. She was detained in a cell until 7pm the following day.

Mr Wolfson explained: 'She has lost an awful lot, vilified in the media, very nasty unpleasant comments made. She has been sorely punished.

'Her marriage is in a precarious situation. He started it. She sought to walk away but became embroiled in it.'

But during sentencing district judge Mark Hadfield told Bigland: 'You proceeded to spit into the guard’s face and proceeded to punch him to the chest.

'When he was seen to restrain you, you kicked him. I simply don’t accept you don’t remember using racial language or spitting in his face.

'It seems clear to me that the incident did commence as a result of Mr Bigland’s behaviour and they were forced to deal with him.

'You became involved using particularly racist language and then assaulted him. Those who indulge in racially aggravated behaviour must expect to be punished.

'It’s a very serious offence and a repeated assault on a gentleman - not only a punch but kicking and spitting in his face.

'It occurred in the hotel reception then spilled outside. It was very late at night, you are not willing to concede that you were intoxicated, I expect drink played a part.'
