Clubbers have been warned to avoid a batch of ecstasy tablets called 'pink love' after two young people were left in hospital after taking the drug.

The news comes following a warning earlier this month about the dangers of taking tablets known as 'green apples' following the death of a 19-year-old man.

North Wales Police and the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board have since warned two young people from the Anglesey area had to be taken to hospital when they fell ill after taking the 'pink love' tablets.

Officers had previously warned of the potentially deadly batch of 'green apples' ecstasy tablets after Thomas Jones, 19, of Llangefni, died after apparently taking the drug.

Police said his death could be linked to another incident which left a Bangor man 'extremely ill'.

Acting Chief Inspector Simon Barrasford said: 'Both the pink heart shaped Pink Love and Green Apple tablets are being used by party goers and I want to make it very clear that the consequences of taking these tablets can be fatal.

'If you have been given or have bought these drugs please do not take them, I ask that you hand them into the Police so that they can be destroyed properly and safely.

'I am also asking parents with teenage children to be extra vigilant and to sit down with their sons and daughters and talk through the dangers of taking these drugs.

'You can also call in confidence with any information regarding drug dealing and I assure you this information provided will be dealt with confidentially.'

Warning: Police have said partygoers have been using both 'pink love' and 'green apple' tablets, but warned of their dangers

Dr Linda Dykes, a consultant in emergency medicine at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, said: 'Over recent weeks we have seen a number of people brought into hospital as emergency cases after taking recreational drugs, some of whom have suffered very severe reactions requiring admission to intensive care and one patient has sadly died.

'There are significant risks with any drug misuse, especially when it involves drugs bought off the streets or from unregulated sources. 

'Users will never actually know what they are taking, its strength or whether or not it is contaminated: every time you take a street drug, you are trusting your health, or indeed your life, to chance.'

Anyone with information about those who use or supply Pink Love or Green Apple tablets, or any other controlled drug, have been asked to contact North Wales Police.

Ecstasy is a class A drug, which is an artificial stimulant, popular among clubbers.

The chemical name is methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but the drug is also often known as pills or E.

It usually comes in the form of a tablet, although it can also come as a powdered form of MDMA.

Those who take the drug can have a rush of energy which makes them alert, excited and happy.

The high lasts for a few hours, before it is replaced with a comedown which can leave people feeling depressed, tired and paranoid.

Short-term risks of taking the drug can include feeling anxious or getting panic attacks, and developing confused episodes, paranoia or even psychosis.

There is no way of knowing what is in a tablet until it has been taken. There may be negative side effects from other ingredients added to the tablet.

There have been more than 200 ecstasy-related deaths in the UK since 2006. Users who take the drug before dancing for long periods can dehydrate, but drinking too much can also be dangerous.
