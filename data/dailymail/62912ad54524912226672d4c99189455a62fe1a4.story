These incredible series of images show planet Earth and the world humans have built as it is seen from space.

Artist Benjamin Grant, 25, from New York uses Google Earth to find the most compelling satellite images of human civilisation, showing sprawling metropolises, man-made islands and vast reservoirs from around the globe.

The images show everything from an interchange in Florida and the streets of Barcelona to deforestation of the Amazon and the rice terraces of China. 

In order to find an extraordinary picture in the practically endless supply of satellite data, Mr Grant focuses on the themes of current events or environmental issues and can spend up to an hour scouring landscapes for the perfect shot.

He does as little editing as possible, aside from minor colour correction,  to emphasize contrast within the images.
