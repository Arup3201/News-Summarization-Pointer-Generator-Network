Injured: Striker Johnny Adair, 16, shattered his tibia in a horror tackle during a Sunday League match in Southam, Warwickshire, two weeks ago

A town mayor is facing charges of improper conduct after sending a mocking Facebook message to a teenager who had broken his leg during a football match - telling him to 'think about taking up netball instead'.

Striker Johnny Adair, 16, shattered his tibia in a horror tackle during a Sunday League match two weeks ago.

He was taken to hospital for an X-Ray, before being sent home to recover in a plaster cast.

However, the teen was shocked to wake up the next day to find Councillor Jason Ward - who had refereed the match - had sent him a Facebook message making fun of the horrific injury.

It read: 'Sorry to hear of your “broken” leg, probably happened during the 15th roll, not the challenge! 

'It’s only a crack, not a real break. Football is a physical game played by men.

'Maybe think about netball or rounders in future. Get well soon.'

Cllr Ward, who sits as mayor for the town of Southam, Warwickshire, is now facing charges of improper conduct by Birmingham County FA.

Today, Johnny said he was 'disgusted' to have received the sarcastic messages.

'I knew straight away it was a horrendous tackle but the ref was saying if I’d really broken my leg I’d be crying,' said Johnny, who lives with his mother Amanda Kemp, 38, in Southam.

'He even said he was going to book me for diving. After I dragged myself off the pitch, the ref never came to check if I was ok or show any concern really. 

'Then he sent me these sarcastic messages on Facebook making fun of me and saying I should play netball or rounders instead.

'It’s shocking. A ref shouldn’t behave like that. When I found out he was mayor, I couldn’t believe it.'

He added: 'My main worry is that he’s going to ref other games. His job is to protect the players but he showed me no sympathy - he should take these things seriously.'

Johnny, who is on the books of Championship club Birmingham City 
FC, now fears his football dreams may be over due to his injury.

'Disgusting': The Facebook message from Councillor Ward poked fun at Johnny's horrific injury

He
must wear a plaster cast for six weeks and doctors have told him he 
cannot play football again for six months until his leg fully heals.

He said: 'I’m gutted, I was meant to play with Birmingham City on Monday, but obviously I couldn’t.

'I’ve played football for ages, it’s so frustrating, I’m desperate to get back on the pitch.

Ms Kemp said she was 'furious' with the Facebook message.

'It is very unlike Johnny to go down. He doesn’t dive, he only goes down if he has been hurt - that's how I 
knew something was wrong,' she said.

'The
ref went over to him and said "get off the floor, you would be crying 
if you had broken your leg", before carrying on with the game.

'When Johnny got home from hospital, he went straight to sleep, then woke up to find the Facebook messages.

'It
was shocking - how can someone act like that? He is supposed to be 
protecting the people of the town, not acting like this.

'I want a full apology from the referee and I hope he doesn't referee ever again.'

Birmingham County FA said they were investigating allegations into Ward's behaviour on and off the pitch.

A spokesman said: 'We can confirm this 
individual has been charged with improper conduct and the matter is 
currently being investigated further. 

'We are in receipt of a complaint 
from Miss Kemp concerning an injury to her son and have since liaised 
with her to ascertain fuller information. 

'In the meantime we trust that her son is recovering as best as possible under the circumstances.'

Ward - who has been the mayor of Southam for four months -  has refused to comment on the allegations.
