First it was planking and then owling but now an even stranger craze inspired by an iconic Australian animal is sweeping the internet - koalaing.

Thousands of people across the globe have taken up the bizarre trend which sees participants clinging onto various objects - and even other people - like a koala bear.

The stunt, which has gone viral, is a development of the planking craze which saw people taking pictures of themselves lying face down in strange locations.

Craze: Thousands of people across the globe have taken up koalaing, a bizarre trend which sees participants clinging onto various objects such as trees and poles like a koala bear

This was swiftly followed by owling in 
which participants perched on top of a variety of platforms like an owl.

American star Ellen DeGeneres recently sent the world crazy for 
koalaing after mentioning the trend on her hit TV show and encouraging 
viewers to spontaneously hug someone.

In a recent video of fans, the comedian told viewers to do it when their intended victim was least expecting it, News.com.au reports.

Fun: If you can grab hold of it - it can be used for a koala. Even a branch of a small tree

The trend has become a big hit on 
Twitter, where those taking part have posted bizarre pictures of 
themselves attached to various telegraph polls and other items alongside
the hashtag #koalaing.

The craze has involved people from across the world from the UK and the Czech Republic to Australia.

Some of those who took part in the planking craze injured themselves while trying to pose in a variety of dangerous places.
