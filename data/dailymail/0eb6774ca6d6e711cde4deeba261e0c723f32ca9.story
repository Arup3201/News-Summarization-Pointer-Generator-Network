On chilly winter days, firing up a hot tub and going for a long soak can seem like the perfect way to unwind and warm up. 

For capybaras at the Saitama Children's Zoo near Tokyo, this is exactly what they were treated to. 

The native South American rodents enjoyed a hot spring soak, complete with  water infused with yuzus, an East Asian citrus fruit known for its aromatic properties.

There is not much room for manoeuvring in the warm tank, but that does not seem to bother the giant rodents, who are each the size of a large dog.

Although the capybaras appear to have an enviable set up, there are notable suspicious brown droppings floating in the hot tub, hinting the capybaras could be getting a bit too comfortable in their spa session.
