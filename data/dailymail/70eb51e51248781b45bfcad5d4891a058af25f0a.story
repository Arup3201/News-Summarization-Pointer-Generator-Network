Mistletoe... it is hard to quantify how much joy and misery one sprig of a plant could bring every year. 

It is the stuff of horrors - a drunken colleague lurching towards you at the  office Christmas party with the plant held above their head. 

Or, the cause of happiness, when a person finally gets to plant a smacker on the lips of a man or woman that they have been admiring from afar. 

So spare a thought for Emma, 22, and Tom, 26, who bravely took to the streets of London earlier this week in a competition to see who could get the most smooches from members of the public.

Emma, 22, and Tom, 26, competed to win most kisses from strangers. The Londoners filmed the reactions of the people they approached. Emma won the competition with double Tom's kiss count.

The pair gamely took on the challenge from the social network Twoo.com, who handed them Go Pro cameras attached to a mistletoe-covered helmet each.

The social experiment took place in Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square on a grey Monday afternoon, but they still managed to attract several kisses each. 

Unsurprisingly, Emma came out as the clear winner at the end of the competition, with 18 men happy to provide her with a peck on the cheek or lips. 

Tom struggled considerably at the beginning of the experiment, with most women turning him down without a second glance, but he was saved by a group of female tourists who each gave a kiss after dancing around him in a circle and ended with a respectable nine smooches. 

Sarah Zelbst, Marketing & Community Coordinator from Twoo said: 'Interestingly, the experiment found that Londoners are more adventurous when in groups, which applies to both sexes. 

'The guys were more up for a kiss when their friends were there and encouraging them to plant a kiss on Emma's cheek. 

'Girls were also more up for a quick smooch under the mistletoe when they were with their friends. 

'In fact, Tom's score shot up after a group of girls encircled him and then went for a kiss.'
