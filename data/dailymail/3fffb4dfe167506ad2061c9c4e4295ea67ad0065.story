Tyler Blackett is keen on becoming Manchester United's first choice free-kick taker, but appreciates he may have to prove he's better than 'amazing' Angel Di Maria.

The 20-year-old defender, drafted in by new manager Louis van Gaal this season, does pack a punch from set-pieces and has scored them for United's youth teams including a rocket against Swansea.

And he's been picking up tips from the Argentina star on the training field and hopes to get a chance to take one soon.

Tyler Blackett is hoping to have the opportunity to take free-kicks for Manchester United 

Blackett described £60m signing Angel Di Maria as 'amazing' - he has three goals and three assists so far

In an interview with BBC Match of the Day Magazine, Blackett said: 'Hopefully further on into the season, you'll get to see me take one.

'I'd certainly be happy to if the opportunity came up. For now though, Angel's the expert so I'm just looking up to him.' 

The young defender has certainly been impressed by the impact the £60m signing has had at Old Trafford, scoring three goals - including a direct free-kick against QPR - and contributing three assists in five appearances. 

United manager Louis van Gaal has put his faith in young players like Blackett this season

'He's been amazing. He's one of the world's best players and the things that he does in training really make us stop and stare.

'The dribbling, the close control, these are things that a lot of players would like to have, but that not everybody's got!

'He really is special!'

Blackett has made six appearances for United this season and is likely to enjoy more as fellow centre backs Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling struggle for fitness.

The lifelong United fan, who used to try to emulate Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Rio Ferdinand on the playground, admits it's all been a little surreal this season.

He said: 'It's still something that feels a bit unreal. I love being inside Old Trafford, putting my boots on and taking in the atmosphere.

'This is the only club I've ever wanted to be at and I'm just so happy I've reached this level.'
