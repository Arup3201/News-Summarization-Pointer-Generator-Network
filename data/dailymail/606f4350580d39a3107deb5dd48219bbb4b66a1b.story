It may look like a toy, but this miniature motor is nothing of the sort.

Although it measures just 45.2cm (17.79ins) tall, it has as much right to be on the road as any other car, bus or lorry.

For Mirai, which means 'future' in Japanese, has just entered the Guinness World Records Book 2013 for being the lowest roadworthy car.

High-fives all round: The car was created by students and teachers of The Automobile Engineering Course of Okayama Sanyo High School in Asakuchi, Japan

It was created by students and teachers of The Automobile Engineering Course of Okayama Sanyo High School in Asakuchi, Japan.

It runs on six main batteries. The motors and controlling components are from 'Q-car', produced by CQ motors in Japan, while the switching console is from a motorbike.

The chassis, body, suspension, steering system, lights, seat and all other parts were made at the High School.

The record for the lowest car has been held in the past by British motor fanatic Andy Saunders, from Poole, Dorset, when he built a 21in version using a rusty 1989 Fiat 126.

The 43-year-old garage manager built the tiny red convertible - named Flat Out - in just three days in front of amazed spectators at a Beaulieu Motor Museum car show in the New Forest, Hants.

Officially measuring 21 and 3/8 inches, it jumped into the record books, beating the 24 inches held by Perry Watkins in 1990.
