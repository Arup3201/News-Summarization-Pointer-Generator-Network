Italian model Claudia Romani is venturing into a new career path in the world of football - after passing an exam in order to become a professional referee.

The 32-year-old has hung up her heels to become a referee, something which has been high on her agenda for a number of months.

Romani is now qualified to referee fixtures in both Serie A and Serie B - something which she is understandably delighted about.

She said: ‘Running around on the pitch with all those players and calling the shots is just an irresistible opportunity.'

No female referee has taken charge of a Serie A game as yet due to the amount of experience it commands.

That could soon change in the future, however, as Romani looks to take the Italian league by storm.
