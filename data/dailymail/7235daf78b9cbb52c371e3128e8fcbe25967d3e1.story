Popular: Dr Darryl Peel, 51, is battling for his life after the freak accident at his home in Huntingfield, near Halesworth, Suffolk

A popular doctor is battling for his life after becoming engulfed in flames when a petrol can exploded as he lit a bonfire in his garden.

Dr Darryl Peel, 51, suffered horrific burns and is in an induced coma after the freak accident at his home in Huntingfield, near Halesworth, Suffolk, on Wednesday.

The father-of-three managed to stagger back indoors and drench himself in cold water before a friend dialled 999.

His distraught wife Susie Peel, 47, said last night it was 'touch and go' whether her husband would survive.

Dr Peel, who works as a GP at Framlingham Medical Practice, is set to undergo six hours of emergency surgery before being put in an induced coma for at least six weeks to help him recover.

He was flown to a specialist 
burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, by East Anglian 
Air Ambulance helicopter after the dramatic incident.

Mrs Peel said the well-known GP had decided to have a bonfire at home.

But after Dr Peel had primed it she thinks a random spark hit a nearby petrol can which then exploded.

Mrs Peel said: 'He is to have six hours of surgery and is in an induced coma for six weeks to help him recover.

'Obviously we are hoping he will be able to recover and return to his patients.'

Dr Peel worked at Cutlers Hill Surgery, Halesworth, for 10 years until 2003, when the family emigrated to Australia.

They returned to the UK just 12 months later and Dr Peel took up a position at Framlingham Medical Practice.

He still works there after recovering from a long illness last year.

Mrs Peel said: 'He is a very much loved GP in this area.

'He left Halesworth in 2003 but still every Saturday when we go into town he is stopped by six or seven people to talk to him.

'People are so nice to him.'

She added: 'He was unwell for a year but returned to work in November at Framlingham, and the patients have been fantastically pleased.

'He has been made to feel so welcome after a difficult year.

'It's just so sad that this awful accident happened after he fought very hard to get back to fitness and work at the job he loves.'

A spokesman for the St Andrew's specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford said tonight that Dr Peel was in a 'critical, but stable' condition
