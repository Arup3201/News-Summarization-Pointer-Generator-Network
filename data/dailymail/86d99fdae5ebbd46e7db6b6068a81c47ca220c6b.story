Gareth Southgate is confident Saido Berahino is ready to recapture the form that made him one of England’s rising stars.

Berahino was catapulted into the limelight just a year ago by scoring a hat-trick on his full debut for West Bromwich Albion in a League Cup tie with Newport. He then fired the opening goal of Southgate’s reign as England Under 21 head coach.

Berahino was soon being talked about as a potential wildcard for the World Cup finals, as his hot streak continued with six goals in his first four Under 21 appearances and, notably, the winner against Manchester United at Old Trafford last September.

Guess who's back! Saido Berahino has recovered from the dip in form he suffered last season

Hot streak: Berahino scored six goals in his first four Under 21 appearances for Gareth Southgate

The campaign ended with problems, however. He was filmed inhaling the legal high ‘hippy crack’ after a dressing-room row with Albion colleague James Morrison but Southgate is confident Berahino is ready to resume his progress.

‘I think he was slightly affected when the manager (Steve Clarke), who he had a good relationship with, left,’ said Southgate, whose side face Lithuania in a Euro 2015 qualifier tomorrow.

‘All the reports we have had have been good — he came back early and in really good shape for pre-season — and he’s started the season really well.

‘The great thing with Saido is that he recognises he has had a dip and then done something about it. We don’t batter them for making mistakes.’

Remember the name: Berahino came to the fore after scoring the winner against United last season

England top Group One and will discover their opponents for next month’s qualifying play-offs when the draw is made next Friday.

Southgate, who has called up Middlesbrough’s Ben Gibson for the injured Spurs defender Eric Dier, will try to give most of his squad game time against Lithuania and Moldova.
