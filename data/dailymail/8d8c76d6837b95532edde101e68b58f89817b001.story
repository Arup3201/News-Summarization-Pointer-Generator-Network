Formula One driver Jean-Eric Vergne has revealed he was admitted to hospital after the Australian Grand Prix due to an extreme weight-loss regime for the 2014 season.

The 23-year-old driver has been on a strict diet regime to meet new weight regulations this season.

Frenchman Vergne, who drives for Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso, says he needed hospital treatment after the season opener in Melbourne as a direct result of his dieting.

'The weight difference between myself and my teammate was making me lose four tenths (per lap),' Vergne told French media.

'I did a diet this winter but you get to certain limits that the body can no longer take,' said Vergne.

'I was in hospital between the Grand Prix in Australia and Malaysia because of a lack of water and a little bit of lack of everything. I was very weak.

Adrian Sutil, who is one of the 
tallest, and subsequently heavier drivers on the grid, revealed he would race without a water bottle in yesterday's Bahrain Grand 
Prix in a drastic bid to keep his weight to a minimum.

Jensen Button: 12st

Nico ­Hulkenberg: 12st 8lbs

Adrian Sutil: 12st 8lbs

Lewis Hamilton: 11st 3lbs

Jean-Eric Vergne: 10st 8lbs

Kevin Magnussen: 10st 7lbs

Felipe Massa:  9st 2lbs

Vergne, who was came in 21st position on Sunday, admitted the issue has been discussed among his fellow 
drivers, but a resolution is yet to be found.

'Frankly, the situation is stupid', added Vernge.

'Some lighter drivers want to keep their edge, and we have not reached a solution.

'Formula One cars are very difficult to drive and we need all of our skills. Being forced to lose weight is not good.'

Vergne said that while the minimum car-plus-weight limit was raised by the FIA this season for the new turbo V6 rules, the 692-kg figure is still far too low.

Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, said he is dieting and 'has eaten no sugar since early December'

According to the rules cars are weighed with the driver in the cockpit and fellow F1 DRIVER Lewis Hamilton has previously spoken of the need 
for drivers to slim down due to turbos and hybrid systems being heavier 
than ­engineers expected.

'It’s hardcore what people are doing,' admitted Hamilton.

'I’m
 OK but for the really heavy drivers, I can’t imagine how it is for 
them. There’s a minimum they can physically get to without cutting their
 arm off.

'You can go into qualifying a little bit dehydrated. I heard someone was doing that, exhausting themselves.

'And then the next day they can drink some more because the race is different. It’s like jockeys do.'

Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, said he is also dieting to reduce his weight.

'I had to make the sacrifice if I want to balance the car perfectly,' he said.

'The diet alone is easy, but training with little food is hell,' Rosberg told Germany's Bild am Sonntag.

'I have eaten no sugar since early December -- for my dream I'm living like a monk'.

Clayton Green, Manager of the Human Performance Programme at McLaren previously told The Telegraph: 'The minimum weight limit of the car this year is 691kg. With the changes in technology, teams are struggling to get the cars down to the minimum limit - but they want to be as close to it as possible.

'Any extra weight equates to time per lap and they don’t want to give anything away to competitors. So we want everything as light as possible - including the driver.'
