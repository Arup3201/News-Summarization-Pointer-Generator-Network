Killed: Atkinson was jailed for six months for stabbing to death ex-girlfriend's parrot with a fork

A man has been jailed for six months for stabbing to death ex-girlfriend's parrot with a fork.

Police alleged that Richard J. Atkinson, 63 was alone at the former couple's Everett home in Washington State when he killed the bird with a serving fork and then trashed the house.

He pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and domestic-violence malicious mischief in the August 19 attack.

In a letter to the The Daily Herald  newspaper in September, the woman said she had the parrot, Bailey, for 18 years.

Defense lawyer William Steffener said at Tuesday's sentencing that his client doesn't remember what happened.

But claimed he may have mixed anti-anxiety medication with whiskey and slipped into a blacked-out rage.

Snohomish County Superior Court Judge George Appel ordered Atkinson to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

He also has to pay the woman for her parrot and destroyed belongings, and he can't own any animals for five years.

Mr Appel called the crime 'depraved' and 'hideous and barbaric.'

The judge said he hoped the time in jail and treatment orders would prevent Atkinson from ever hurting an animal again.
