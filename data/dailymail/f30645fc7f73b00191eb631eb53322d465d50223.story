Cooking a gourmet lunch for family and friends at Easter has never been so easy - or cheap.

One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each.

The home cook icon put her skills to the test by trawling the supermarket aisles to find healthy, fresh produce to turn into an Easter feast.

One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each

'I am such of a massive fan of the hospitality of a table. I think sitting down around a table is the loveliest thing,' Milan told Daily Mail Australia. 

'The worst homemade disaster is better than the shop bought stuff. You'll be wealthier, healthier and friendlier for cooking for the people you love.'

The results of her Aldi experiment include Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf and herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots. 

For dessert, Lyndey says her hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding with almond praline, which came in at $2 per person, is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser.

'The hot cross bun pudding is so much fun. What I like about it is you can use leftovers – you'll always have stale hot cross buns and Easter eggs,' Lyndey told Daily Mail Australia.

'The salmon is smart enough for a dinner party. I would serve that for people coming for dinner.

'What I love about it is the ease of preparation. All you do it make the crusting, spread the salmon with Dijon mustard – it's not that hard, it's perfect.'

Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf is also on Lyndey's menu for Easter

Lyndey was inspired by the lamb dish after filming a cooking series in Greece a few years back.

'At Easter, some people like to eat fish but then lamb is so traditional. Sometimes families aren't sure of how to cook it – the whole point of Greek lamb is it's well cooked, so you don't have that issue of cooking it rare for some and well done for others,' she said.

1. Use up all of what you buy

2. Buy fresh produce that’s in season

3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge 

4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them

5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal 

6. Only buy what you need

7. Use your freezer 

'You can buy it from Aldi already butterflied so you can reduce cooking time. I just did that really simple zucchini pilaf, but you can use any sort of veggie.

'With a recipe, it's only a description of what you've done once… I love it when people change them and make it their own.' 

Lyndey had never stepped foot inside an Aldi before she partnered with them to create the Easter recipes.

'I did my personal research on Aldi, I went and visited two stores. I was waiting to get arrested by the store detective,' Lyndey said.

'I went around taking photos and making notes of the prices, which I couldn't believe by the way. I then went and bought all my ingredients... I did a spreadsheet of costs and then created.

'All of their meat is grass-fed, they have Australian cheese in there that's won Sydney Royal Medals – I just saw how much of their stuff is Australian.

'I'm now a convert.'

Lyndey says her herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots is quick and easy to prepare

Lyndey, who prides herself on never throwing food out, says there's a few simple tips to keep the grocery spend down and minimise waste.

1. Use up all of what you buy. Cooking a whole chicken? Boil up the bones with a carrot, onion, parsley stalks and peppercorns and make your own stock or soup base. Do the same with meat bones.

2. Buy fresh produce that’s in season. Not only does it taste better, it costs less.

3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge. Soak celery in icy cold water, drain, then wrap well in plastic in the fridge. Store herbs and shallots in damp kitchen paper inside a plastic bag to keep them fresh. Store potatoes and onions in a cool, dark place.

4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them. ALDI has 7 Day Deals each Wednesday, which include amazing specials on meat, produce and some different and exciting products in the fridge.

5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal. Cold roast meat and vegetables can liven up a bland salad. Leftover vegies can go into a pasta, soup, frittata or risotto. Banana muffins or ice-cream can be made using over-ripe bananas and almost anything can be turned into a curry.

6. Only buy what you need. Always check the fridge and pantry before you shop and make a list before you go in store.

7. Use your freezer. Liquids like wine, coconut milk and stock can be frozen to use when needed. Bread stores well in the freezer and once defrosted, makes an excellent savoury breadcrumb topping with grated cheese.

Herb Crusted Salmon with Pea Puree:

6 salmon fillets (140g each)   3 tbsp. (1/4 cup) Dijon mustard

25g (1/2 packet) fresh parsley   25g (1/2 packet) fresh dill

½ cup dried bread crumbs   Olive oil

30g butter   3 green onions (shallots), finely chopped

2 sprigs mint   500g frozen peas   1 tbsp. lemon juice (optional)

METHOD:

Pre-heat oven to 180⁰C [160⁰C fan-forced] and line a baking tray with baking paper.

Place salmon on the prepared baking tray. Spread with mustard and season with salt and pepper. Chop parsley and dill in a small processor, then add breadcrumbs and enough olive oil to moisten. Press down on salmon. Roast for 8 minutes for pink or 12 minutes for well done.

Serve salmon on pea puree (recipe below), with smashed potatoes and ginger carrots.

Melt butter in a medium saucepan, add green onions and stir over medium heat until softened. Add frozen peas, cover with 2cm of water and bring to the boil. Boil for five minutes or until the peas are very tender. Strain the peas, but reserve the cooking liquid. Puree until smooth, adding a splash of the cooking water if needed. Season with salt and pepper and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. 

Greek Lamb 

1.2 kg butterflied leg of lamb   1/3 cup (80ml) extra virgin olive oil

1 1/2 tbsp. (30ml) wine vinegar   2 tbsp. dried oregano

2 cloves garlic, crushed   1 tsp. salt or to taste

Freshly ground pepper   1 lemon, cut in wedges, to serve

METHOD:

Preheat oven to 200'C (180'C fan-forced). Remove lamb from fridge 30 minutes before roasting to bring to room temperature.

Place 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Season the lamb with salt and pepper on both sides, then brown in the pan for 2- 3 minutes each side. Place lamb in roasting dish. Combine oil, garlic, vinegar and oregano. Rub mixture over lamb, place in oven and roast uncovered for 55 minutes, turning once. Remove from the oven and rest, covered loosely with foil for 10 minutes. Pour juices off and allow to settle in a jug. Scoop off the fat which rises to the top with either a spoon or kitchen paper. (Or a fat/lean separator jug can do this for you.)

Carve lamb into thin slices, drizzle with pan juices and serve with lemon, Zucchini Pilaf and Greek Salad.

Easter Bread & Butter Pudding with Almond Praline

5 - 6 cherry chocolate hot cross buns, sliced thickly

1 ½ tbsp. (30g) soft butter   275ml milk

2 cups (500ml) cream   1/3 cup (75g) caster sugar

1 tsp. vanilla extract (optional)   4 eggs

100g (1 large) Easter egg, crumbled (optional)

Ice-cream to serve (optional)   ½ cup (40g) flaked almonds

1 cup (220g) caster sugar   1/3 cup (80ml) cold water

METHOD:

Preheat the oven to 180'C (160'C fan forced). Grease a shallow 2-litre (8-cup) ovenproof dish. Spread cut surfaces of buns with butter. Place cut side up in prepared dish. Sprinkle with Easter egg (optional).

Combine the milk, cream and sugar in a small saucepan. Stir over heat until warm but not boiling. Whisk eggs in large bowl. Gradually add warm milk mixture as you whisk. Pour hot milk mixture over the hot cross buns. Leave to soak for at least 10 minutes, pressing down with your fingers occasionally to help the buns soak up the liquid.

Place overproof dish in a large baking tray and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ovenproof dish. Bake uncovered in oven for about 45 - 50 minutes or until pudding almost sets. It will still be wobbly in the middle if you shake the dish Remove the pudding from the oven and stand 5 minutes before serving.

Serve Bread & Butter Pudding with almond praline (see recipe below) sprinkled over the top.

Line a baking tray with baking paper. Scatter over the almonds and place in the oven until golden about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile combine sugar and water in a saucepan and place over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until sugar has dissolved. Increase heat to high and bring to the boil. Boil without stirring for 5-7 minutes or until mixture turns golden. Remove from heat and set aside for 2 minutes to allow bubbles to subside. Pour over almonds on the baking tray and allow to cool. Break praline into shards and sprinkle over the pudding.
