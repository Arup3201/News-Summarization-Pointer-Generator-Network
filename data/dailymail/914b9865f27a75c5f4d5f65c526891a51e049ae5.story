Ever fancied a pint a little bit too early in the day? Those who like an early tipple can now indulge - with an ale you can spread on your toast. Yum.

Omid dark ale spreadable beer has just launched in Selfridges and also promises to provide a unique accompaniment for hors 
d'oeuvres and cheeses - and, say its makers, can even be used as a garnish for tarts and cakes.

The beer spread contains a whopping 40 per cent actual beer and is suitable for spreading on toast

Beer lovers can now enjoy their favourite tipple in new and exciting ways thanks to the ingenious collaboration between an Italian chocolate maker and an Italian beer brewer.

The result is a sweet and beer-perfumed jelly with an intense scent and a full-bodied taste. 

Nicola Waller, Selfridges Director of Food comments 'Spreadable beer was chosen due to its quirky properties, but also because it tastes delicious! 

'It has the perfect composition using high quality ingredients, it might be an acquired taste, but for beer lovers out there it is perfect.

'There are two varieties,  one is more delicate like an IPA and the other is similar to an ale with  an intense scent and a full-bodied taste.'

Omid dark ale spreadable beer is made of 40 per cent and comes in a 280g jar for £7.99.

The omens weren’t good. As I twisted open the jar, I caught
a whiff of post-midnight pub: stale, yeasty and a bit dirty. It looked pretty
innocuous though – gravy-hued jelly with one or two tiny bubbles marring the
smooth surface.

But if it looked OK, it certainly didn’t taste it. I was
expecting Marmite. Instead, I got a pint of real ale with half a bag of sugar
stirred in – a sort of beery jam, if you will.

Those who love beer and those
who love sugary spreads but find Nutella a bit much will enjoy it. It
definitely has a future as a Secret Santa stand-by at the very least. But if
you’re working out what to buy for me, please step away from the ale spread.

Sweet it might be.
Nice it certainly isn’t.
