The new treatment could significantly boost older people’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses

A treatment which significantly boosts older people’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses has been developed by British scientists.

Once injected with the new chemical, the elderly and vulnerable will have a much for effective immune system, Oxford University researchers claim.

They say the drug could give a 90-year-old patient the immune system of someone in their 20s.

If the treatment performs well in clinical trials, it could severely reduce a niggling public health problem which costs the NHS millions each year.

Flu kills 5,000 people in England annually - the vast majority of them elderly or with existing respiratory conditions.

Part of the problem is that the elderly do not react as well as the young to vaccines.

The newly-discovered drug promises to boost the power of the flu jab, holding the potential to significantly reduce the danger of common viruses to older people.

The compound, called spermidine, has been shown to have a significant impact in tests on mice - and scientists have already patented it as a potential treatment for humans.

Each year three-quarters of those aged 65 and over take up the offer to get a flu jab free on the NHS.

The policy is the health service’s main tool against the infection – but the benefits of vaccinating pensioners have been seriously questioned in recent years with critics saying there are no figures to back up claims that lives are being saved.

This new chemical could solve that problem, the researchers say.

It could be mixed in with an existing vaccines or be delivered as a separate jab or a tablet.

The research, published yesterday in the journal eLife, showed that the compound restores the immune system’s inbuilt ‘memory’ enabling it to mount a more powerful protective response following vaccination.

Tests have shown the chemical can boost the response of mice to the flu virus and cytomegalovirus – or CMV – a common infection which can cause sight problems and pneumonia.

The scientists think it might be used to tackle a wider variety of viruses in future.

Study leader Professor Katja Simon said: ‘Viral infections like flu are unpleasant for most people, but can be very serious for the over-65s and vaccines, like the free annual flu jab, are the best form of protection.

‘Our aim is to make that protection even better, by adding immune boosting compounds to routine vaccinations.’

Scientists think vaccines lose effectiveness in older people because as we age, our immune system loses its ‘memory’.

It becomes less effective at recognising infections, including those we have had in the past and those we have been vaccinated against.

A key factor is that the white blood cells that coordinate the response to an infection – called T cells – lose the ability to form a ‘memory’ of the infection.

Therefore when elderly people encounter a virus they are unable to mount a strong immune response and can develop a serious, even fatal, infection.

The new breakthrough rests on the researchers’ discovery of the key cellular process essential for the formation of immune memory.

They showed that this process becomes defective in immune cells with age, helping to explain why immunity diminishes over time.

By targeting this process with spermidine, the scientists managed to restore immune memory, boosting the effectiveness of a vaccine.

Daniel Puleston, who co-authored the research, said of the drug: ‘It’s the equivalent of a 90 year old responding to a vaccine better than a 20 year old, which makes this a very exciting pathway to target as a potential way of boosting vaccine protection in the elderly.’

Spermidine works by enhancing a normal cellular process called autophagy, where parts of the cell that have become defective or damaged are broken down and destroyed within cells.

The researchers found that mice lacking a gene important for autophagy couldn’t make memory T cells when given the flu vaccine. They also saw that levels of autophagy were lowered in T cells from aged mice, suggesting that autophagy is a vital part of forming the immune memory into old age.

When aged mice were given spermidine prior to flu vaccination, their T cell response was enhanced dramatically.

The researchers have patented spermidine and will now see if they can use the compound, or other autophagy-enhancing drugs, to improve responses to already licensed vaccines in mice before hopefully moving on to early safety trials in humans.

Professor Simon added: ‘We think that spermidine could be particularly useful alongside many of the vaccines currently in development that protect against other viruses.

‘However, we expect it to be at least five to ten years before a drug reaches the clinic.’
