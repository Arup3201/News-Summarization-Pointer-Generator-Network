A bearded marijuana activist who calls himself Rev. Bud Green has claimed responsibility for running up white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge earlier this month.

The bleached American flags above one of New York's most recognizable landmarks drew national attention - an concern from city authorities who say the vandals should never have been able to make up the towers of the bridge unnoticed.

Green, who gained a small amount of fame on the 1980s talk show circuit by claiming that he worshiped God by smoking pot, posted an online rant on Wednesday saying that the white flags were meant as a political statement made by members of his POT (People Opposing Tyranny) Party.

Showman: Rev. Bud Green gained notoriety on the 1980s talk show circuit for lighting up on TV and claiming smoking marijuana was akin to worshiping God

'The Flags symbolize the need for the new Pledge of No Allegiance that the Rev. Bud Green and the Pot Party revealed to the Public on the Fourth of July,' he claimed.

'On the night of July 22, brave members of the Pot Party and supporters of my candidacy for Prez in 2016 courageously climbed up and put up the new bleached flags.'

In his short online screed, 49-year-old Green said that his supporters had hoped to replace the bleached American flags with a POT Party flag and a new flag that Green designed to represent his image of the United States.

'This flag was to be a logo of corporate media conglomerate GE and a Nazi Swastika with a background of bombs and guns,' he ranted.

'This unfortunately is what Amerikkka has become and is exactly why we need civil disobedience and non violent Revolution to truly change this country.'

Cops said they are treating the vandalism as a serious security breach and are investigating the flag swap

The Southern California-based activist told the New York Daily News that he didn't physically participate in the caper, but it was carried out by 'professional's in New York.

'It was interesting that people took it as a terror risk. We believe in nonviolent civil disobedience. The government has everybody scared s***less,' he told the newspaper.

Green compared the action at the Brooklyn Bridge to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent civil rights protests.

The New York Police Department said it is reviewing Greens' claim of responsibility - but did not comment on the validity of his statement.

Hello my fellow herb worshippers and revolutionaries. I can finally reveal that it was members of the New Pot Party that put up the bleached White Flags in NY that the whole country is talking about.

The Flags symbolize the need for the new Pledge of No Allegiance that the Rev. Bud Green and the Pot Party revealed to the Public on the Fourth of July.  On the night of July 22, brave members of the Pot Party and supporters of my candidacy for Prez in 2016 courageously climbed up and put up the new bleached flags. 

The original plan was then to replace the bleached flags with 2 new flags but the fascist police prevented us from doing it with their constant surveillance. The 2 new flags were gonna be the Pot Party flag which is a marijuana leaf with the revolutionary slogan Don’t Tread on Me to symbolize the beginning of a new American Revolution to be led by Pot Party Supporters. 

The other flag was to represent what the good old USA has become now that we are fully under the control of the Republicratic party and the united corporations of America.This flag was to be a logo of corporate media conglomerate GE and a Nazi Swastika with a background of bombs and guns. This unfortunately is what Amerikkka has become and is exactly why we need civil disobedience and non violent Revolution to truly change this country. 

Please smoke the Peace Pipe with the holy herb and rebel against the military industrial complex and the evil one percent.  That is the meaning of why we put up the bleached American Flags. Remember to recite the new Pledge of No Allegiance. Please repeat after me, I Pledge no Allegiance to the United Corporations of America, and to the right wing dictatorship for which it stands, one nation, under the devil, with liberty and justice for only the rich pigs who can afford it.

Put that it in your pipe and smoke it Fox News.
