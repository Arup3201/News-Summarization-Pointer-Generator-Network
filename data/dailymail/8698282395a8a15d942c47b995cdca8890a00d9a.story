With glowing skin, passion for healthy eating and an unassuming - if A-list - husband, Gwyneth Paltrow is the ultimate good girl.

All of which makes her admission that she loves to dance around her kitchen to the sound of hip-hop beats all the more unexpected.

According to the macrobiotic food-loving yummy mummy, husband Chris Martin, 36, can't stand rap music so she can only indulge in a spot of Public Enemy or Professor Green when he isn't at home.

'If he isn't at home, I turn on the hip-hop,' the 40-year-old actress revealed in an interview with the Evening Standard's ES magazine.

'I'm like a bad mutha rapping along to every word as I cook.'

Paltrow is currently busy promoting her latest cookery book, It's All Good: Delicious Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good And Feel Great, which contains 185 healthy dishes concocted by Paltrow.

In keeping with her macrobiotic approach to eating, the recipes avoid dozens of common 'unhealthy' ingredients, including alcohol, shellfish, caffiene, dairy, eggs, sugar, deep water fish (examples include plaice and ling), wheat, soy and anything processed.

It might not sound especially 
appetising but according to Paltrow, healthy eating means you can enjoy 
life without having to spare too much time for the gym.

Patrow,
who says she now focuses on a 'balanced lifestyle' said: 'I've been 
doing the Tracey Anderson [diet and fitness] method for such a long time
and she's changed my body so much.

'I do have alcohol, French fries and ice cream but I balance it out with exercise,' Paltrow explained.
