An eco-friendly ‘hobbit house’ made entirely from natural materials faces being bulldozed after planning chiefs ruled it was a blot on the landscape.

Nature-lovers Charlie Hague and Megan Williams spent £15,000 building their unique roundhouse at a secluded location near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire using all natural materials.

However, the couple, who built their dream without obtaining planning permission, now face having to tear it down after council officers recommended their retrospective planning application was refused.

The pair, both 26, spent four years living in a damp caravan before starting work on their home last summer.

Made from straw bales rendered in lime and situated on land owned by Mr Hague’s parents, it took less than 12 months to build and is now said to be worth between £15,000 and £20,000.

The couple said it was the only way they could afford a home of their own after prices of conventional houses in the area increased because of it being popular with tourists.

Using local wood and all natural materials, they completed the house just weeks before their son Eli was born and now claim to live a self-sufficient lifestyle at the property - growing their own fruit and vegetables and rearing their own animals.

However, they now face having to bulldoze their unique home – which looks like something Bilbo Baggins would be proud of – following an ongoing planning dispute with Pembrokeshire County Council.

The authority told the couple that without planning permission they would have to tear it down, so the pair applied retrospectively a year ago hoping the Welsh Government’s ‘One Planet Development Policy’ - which encourages sustainable development - would persuade planners to let them keep their home.

But planning officers have now recommended the couple’s application is refused and that their eco-friendly house is razed to the ground.

Planning officials said: ‘The proposal represents an unjustified residential development in countryside.

‘Despite its relatively low visual impact it erodes the rural character of its surroundings and represents an unsustainable form of development.’

The couple, who launched an online campaign to keep their home which has been backed by 90,000 people from all over the world, have vowed to carry on fighting.

Miss Williams said: ‘We are confident Pembrokeshire County Council will view our retrospective application fairly in line with One Planet Development guidelines.

‘We admit the house was built without planning consent but said there was no other way for them to afford their own home.

‘We have made the best of the space available to us and there’s no way we intended to flout planning laws.

‘I know it’s not a possibility for everyone, and our situation here is unique - but if young people are to live and work in the area they need somewhere to live.’

Mr Hague added: ‘We built this house to provide our son with a healthy environment to grow up in.

‘We were born in the area, went to school here, and have lived here all our lives. We wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.’

A friend of the couple described the pair as ‘heartbroken’ and said: ‘The roundhouse is a thing of great beauty which they put their hearts and souls into.

‘They are a young couple who should be applauded for solving their own housing issues by creating a sustainable home out of local materials.

‘Instead they are now facing the prospect of watching it being razed to the ground.’

Pembrokeshire County Council is due to decide the fate of the property next week.
