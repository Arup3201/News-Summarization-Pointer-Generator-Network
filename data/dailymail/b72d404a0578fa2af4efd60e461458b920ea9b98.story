'Ridiculous': Gordon Wilkinson, a patient for 35 years, said it is near-impossible to get an appointment

A doctor's surgery is turning away patients whose illness is not deemed an emergency, saying the practice is overcrowded and ‘no longer safe’.

In an astonishing letter sent out to its 10,000 patients, the GP practice claimed it was at ‘breaking point’, with doctors dealing with an ‘unsustainable’ workload.

The letter outlined a new scheme, whereby patients will only be able to book an appointment on the same day if their condition is ‘medically urgent’.

If it is not, they will have to wait up to seven days – in some cases even longer – just to be seen.

Even then, they may only be given a telephone consultation.

Halifax MP Linda Riordan said the changes at the town’s Keighley Road surgery were ‘terrifying’ and ‘seriously worrying’ to her constituents.

Some feared they would have to attempt to self-diagnose themselves, elderly people said they could die before they managed to get an appointment and parents were worried about their children.

The Royal College of General Practitioners said that GPs across the country have been trying various ways of coping with increased pressures.

The Halifax letter painted an alarming picture. It said: ‘GP practices in England are at breaking point.

‘GPs currently deal with 90 per cent of all patient contacts in the NHS, however they only receive around 8 per cent of NHS funding.

‘The GPs at Keighley Road already work more than full-time hours and are dealing with an unsustainable number of patients each day. It is simply no longer safe for them or for you.’

There are four doctors based at the practice, including Dr Nicholas Davies, chairman to the Yorkshire Faculty of the Royal College of General Practitioners. 

It is understood the area has had no recent surge in population. Yesterday the surgery was shut in the afternoon for ‘staff training’.

Gordon Wilkinson, a patient for 35 years, said: ‘My previous doctor here said it was getting ridiculous because they had so many patients and it was difficult to see everyone who needed to be treated.’

Mrs Riordan, a Labour MP, said: 'The NHS is under extreme pressure and doctors are at breaking point. I’ve had all ages coming to me about their concerns, including mothers worried for their children. 

Changes: This is the letter sent to patients of Keighley Road Surgery in Halifax, Yorkshire

'If their child has a temperature, who do they go to? The already gridlocked A&E services? This is a real crisis, not only in Halifax, but nationwide.'

Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said it was a nationwide issue. 

'Funding has fallen, in real terms, but at the same time practices are trying to deal with more patients with more complicated needs,' he added.

David Geddes of NHS England said: 'Changes to the GP contract have been introduced to improve access to services and give patients more choice in how they contact their practice. 

'We are working with Health Education England to ensure there is an increased number of GPs and clinical staff working in the community.'
