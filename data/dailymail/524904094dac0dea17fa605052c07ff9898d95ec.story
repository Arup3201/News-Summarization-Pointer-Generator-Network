Fashion bible Vogue has been accused of employing a model under the age of 16 in their magazine, breaking a pledge it made just four months ago to no longer do so.

Young American model Ondria Hardin has been featured in August's Vogue China in a group editorial photo.

But the rising star may have only been 15 at the time of the shoot, according to various sources.

Model Ondira Hardin is at the centre of a new row over whether or not Vogue photographed her before she was 16.

Vogue pledged in May to stop using models aged under 16 for print work in all international editions, as part of a new Health Initiative.

But fashion news websites Fashionista andÂ Jezebel have done some cunning calendar arithmetic and calculated that Hardin was possibly only 15 at the time of a group photo shoot featured in China's August edition.

Hardin, a South Carolina native, has been modeling since she was just 13, when Steven Meisel shot her for the fall 2011 Prada campaign.

Jezebel writes: 'That September, after turning 14, she walked at New York fashion week for designers including Marc Jacobs.

'In February, Hardin was reported to be 14. At the New York shows this September, when Hardin could have been no older than 15, she walked for seven designers, including Jacobs, Thakoon, Marchesa, and Oscar de la Renta. Just a couple hours ago in Milan she walked for Gucci.'

According to Hardin's agency, Ford, she is currently 16, but the company has not provided birth the models date.

At time of press both Ford and Vogue 's publisher Conde Nast had been contacted twice, but neither has yet provided a comment.
