A funeral director murdered his wife after embarking on an affair with a widow from a nearby village, a court heard yesterday.

John Taylor, 61, is alleged to have killed wife Alethea six months into his romance with 53-year-old Alison Dearden.

A jury was told that no trace has been found of Mrs Taylor, 63, since she was last seen in January last year.

Taylor had told friends his wife had developed ‘some form of dementia’ and vanished.

But the court heard their relationship had become strained after she discovered the affair. Mrs Taylor had written that her husband had become ‘besotted with a certain little widow’.

The prosecution claims Taylor killed the former teacher and somehow  disposed of her body.

Michael Burrows, prosecuting, said Taylor had used the couple’s joint bank account to buy a ‘love nest’, which he was renovating so he could eventually move in with his mistress.

Worcester Crown Court heard Mrs Taylor’s blood was discovered on bedding at the couple’s home and on the rear seats of Taylor’s car.

The funeral director claimed the blood was from a nose bleed, but a forensic scientist said it had not dripped and probably resulted from direct contact with the sheets.

Taylor was also seen vacuuming the boot of his vehicle outside his  home – despite telling police he was somewhere else at the time.

Mr Burrows said Taylor claimed his wife was still alive when he left their home in Orleton, Herefordshire, on the morning of January 19.

‘Mr Taylor says she simply disappeared – and that if she is dead, he didn’t kill her,’ he said.

Mrs Taylor’s nightdress was missing from the house but her glasses, passport, bank cards and a bracelet were all left behind.

Mr Burrows said Taylor was ‘keen to spread around’ the idea she was ‘in some way, losing her mind’ to cover up for her disappearance.

He told police he had once found his wife ‘crying and disorientated’ in a lane, but the prosecutor said he had never taken her to see a doctor despite his professed concerns.

And Mrs Taylor had not confided in friends about any problems with memory loss, the jury was told.

Rita Tetsill said she had known her for 40 years and was ‘gobsmacked’ when Taylor told her his wife was ‘suffering with dementia’.

Mrs Tetsill said she had ‘never’ seen anything to make her fear for her friend’s mental health.

She added: ‘(Alethea) always sent everyone cards, birthday, anniversary, Easter and New Year she never forgot, but since she went missing I haven’t received one letter.’

Both Mrs Tetsill and a second friend, Eve Martin, told the jury they were surprised when Taylor told them separately his wife had ‘wandered off’ on occasion.

The court heard Mrs Taylor’s first marriage ended in the 1980s when her then husband had an affair.

After the break-up Mrs Taylor met her future husband.

Taylor left his then wife and later moved to a bungalow in Orleton with Mrs Taylor, whom he married in 1996.

Taylor denies murder. The trial continues.
