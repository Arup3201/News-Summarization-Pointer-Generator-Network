Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, who was already accused of murder in a man's shooting death last year, 'ambushed and executed' two other men a year earlier after an encounter at a nightclub, prosecutors said Thursday in announcing new murder charges against Hernandez in their deaths.

The arrest of Hernandez on a murder charge last year stunned the American sports world.

Hernandez earned big money as a star for the Boston area's New England Patriots, one of the most successful teams in recent years in the National Football League, by far the most popular pro sports league in the US.

Charged: Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been charged with murder in connection with the shooting of two men - he was already in jail awaiting charges for another murder last June

In the new charges, Hernandez is accused of shooting Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, two Cape Verdean nationals, to death as they sat in a car in Boston's trendy South End on July 16, 2012.

Police have said they were shot by someone who drove up alongside in an SUV with Rhode Island license plates and opened fire.

Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said in announcing that Hernandez has been indicted that the victims were 'ambushed and executed as they drove home' and that Hernandez was the gunman.

Weeks later, Hernandez signed a five-year deal worth about $40 million with the Patriots and went on to play 12 games as a tight end for the team that season.

Lawyers for Hernandez, who is awaiting trial in the separate 2013 shooting death near his home of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in Massachusetts, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment about the new indictment. Hernandez is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in Lloyd's death.

On the night of the 2012 attack, Hernandez and the victims encountered each other at a nightclub, Conley said, though he did not detail what happened. Hernandez was seen on surveillance footage in the nightclub that night, authorities have said.

Boston police wrote in an affidavit last year there is probable cause to believe that Hernandez was driving a vehicle used in the double shooting. The affidavit was filed as police sought to search an SUV involved in the shooting and found at Hernandez's uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut.

The SUV was covered in dust and cobwebs and had a dead battery, leading police to believe it had remained untouched in the garage for close to a year, according to the court document.

Survivor Aquilino Freire told police an SUV pulled up next to them while they were stopped, and he saw someone in the SUV's back seat laughing, according to the affidavit. Then, several gunshots were fired from the rear passenger seat into the car, Freire told police. Two other people in the car ran away, Freire said.

Hernandez had long been famous as an American football star in the New England region, dating back to his school years in Connecticut.
