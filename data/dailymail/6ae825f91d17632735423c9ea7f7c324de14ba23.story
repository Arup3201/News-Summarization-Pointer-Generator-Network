The hacker that has targeted political heavyweights like former President George W. Bush and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell has a new victim but this time from the other side of the aisle.

A close confidante of both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been added as the latest victim of a hacker who goes by the name 'Guccifer'.

Sidney Blumenthal's email was allegedly hacked sometime this week and Guccifer was able to obtain email correspondence between Blumenthal and Mrs Clinton.

Close connections: Sidney Blumenthal (right) was an aide to Bill Clinton when he was President, and now Blumenthal was the latest victim in a series of politically-targeted hacks

The other Clinton: The hacker may have been targeting emails Blumenthal exchanged with Hillary Clinton when she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year

It is unclear what exactly the hacker was looking for or how many emails he was able to obtain, but the data in Mr Blumenthal's breached AOL account dates back to 2005.

The timeline means that it is unlikely that any memos that Blumenthal sent to Clinton when he worked as a close advisor in the late 1990s and early 2000s were part of the hacked data.

Though Mr Clinton was out of the White House by 2000, he stayed in touch with the powerful couple up to present day.

Mr Blumenthal told The Smoking Gun that he only realized something was awry with his account when he could not log in Thursday morning.

Other targets: Former Secretary of State Colin Powell (left) had his Facebook account hacked and emails sent by former President George Bush's relatives (right) were also breached

To outside observers, Mr Blumenthal seems like an odd target because his theorettical political heyday occurred when Mr Clinton was in the White House. In that wake it appears the hacker was looking for information exchanged with Mrs Clinton while she was in the post of Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year.

That theory also fits the trend that the hacker's interest stem from a possible conspiracy theory or issue stemming to foreign relations.

Other targets have included Senator Lisa Murkowski, former United Nations ambassador John Negroponte and unidentified members of the famed Rockefeller family.

Republican General Powell had his Facebook page broken into and created several posts.

Offensive: One of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

Bizarre: The hacker posted a series of rants on General Powell's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former President George W Bush's hacked email account

Apology: General Powell described the hacker's posts as 'stupid' and 'obscene' on his page yesterday

One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

In another bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrowâ€™s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!'

As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy.

Stayed close with the Clintons and may have been targeted because he communicated with Hillary when she was Secretary of State

Comes just days after the same hacker posted a series of bizarre rants on General Powell's Facebook page
