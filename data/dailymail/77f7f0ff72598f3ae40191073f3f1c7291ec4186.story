A young horse that was rescued after being found frozen to the ground in a patch of mud, two weeks ago, has died.

The one-year-old horse, Elsa, was just hours from death when she was pried from the frigid floor in an Enoch City yard, but managed to hang on for ten days before losing her life over the weekend.

Veterinarians have described it as one of Utah's worst cases of animal neglect.

The yearling was suffering from hypothermia with sores on the side of her face and an eye infection from prolonged contact with the frozen ground.

Horrific: Elsa, a one-year-old horse, was found emaciated and frozen to the ground in a Enoch City, Utah on January 9th. She did this weekend despite round-the-clock care for her

Harness: A sling was used to try and held Elsa stand on her legs

All hands on deck: While Elsa had been eating and standing with the help of a sling just hours earlier, there were a number of problems that could have led to her death

Her mother who was also rescued at the same time, was found starving alongside her.

'It was something where she hadn’t been properly cared for, probably since birth,' Grimes said, explaining that while Elsa had been eating and standing with the help of a sling just hours earlier, there were a number of problems that could have led to her death. 

In addition to severe malnutrition, the horse suffered from an assortment of ailments related to the poor conditions in which she was left, including sores on the side of her body.

'This is absolutely one of the worst cases in my career,' Enoch City animal control officer Chris Johnson told KUTV.com.

'When I got there she was laying in the mud. She had been starved. She had no strength from lack of nutrition.'

'(The ground) was completely frozen. When we rolled her over you could see the indent was still there and the ice and ground wasn't moving.'

The filly and her mother, Anna, were rescued from their corral after a concerned passerby saw the dangerously thin horses and called emergency services.

Rescuers pried the young horse from the ground and took both animals to the sanctuary. There, Grimes said, veterinarians gave Elsa about an hour to live.

Helpers: Volunteers have worked around the clock to nurse little Elsa back to health and even help her to her feet, but in the end it was all too much for her

Recovering: Elsa was so weak she needed to be propped upright and swaddled in blankets at the sanctuary

The abused creatures were treated with antibiotics and warm fluids before being rushed to the Dust Devil Ranch Sanctuary for Horses, south of Cedar City.

Sanctuary founder Ginger Grimes said a 'body imprint where you can see every hair strand' remains where Elsa lay for 'quite some time'. 

Grimes and other volunteers at the 
charity worked around the clock to nurse the horses back to health but in the end for Elsa, it was too much. The horses had been starved for so long, they had no strength.A dozen or more volunteers helped to care for the horse each day along with a ranch dog named Dingo, who caretakers said never left the filly’s side.

The dog was still present when Elsa died, at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. The mother horse was brought in to spend one last moment with Elsa.

Starving: Anna, Elsa's mother, was found malnourished on January 9th

Underweight: Elsa weighs just 400 pounds, half the normal weight of other horses her age

Grimes named both horses after the characters in the Disney movie 'Frozen'.

The mother, Anna, still appears to be recovering well and will be put out for adoption once she is ready, like other horses that move through the sanctuary.

Meanwhile, the horses' owner, an Enoch City man, has been issued with a citation for two counts of animal cruelty, a class 'B' misdemeanor.

'It's a very unfortunate situation,' Enoch Police Chief Jackson Ames said.

Gorgeous: Elsa almost looks peaceful as she lays beneath a heat lamp, on a bed of straw, swaddled in blankets for warmth

So sad: The story generated emotional responses and outpourings of support via social media

The story generated often emotional responses and outpourings of support via social media, and Grimes said the hope for many was that Elsa’s story would lead to more awareness and policy changes that would prevent similar cases.

The sanctuary is working with animal advocacy groups and the Iron County Sheriff’s Office to spread word to horse owners that if they are struggling to afford caring for their horses, help is available.

'If you’re having problems, call someone,' Grimes said. 'Call animal control, call me, call (Best Friends Animal Society). There are lots of people out there who could help you. What happened here didn’t have to happen.'
