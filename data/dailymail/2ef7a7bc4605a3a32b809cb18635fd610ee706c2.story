India's top police official has apologised for making remarks in which he said: 'If you can't prevent rape, you enjoy it'.

Ranjit Sinha, chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation which is India's equivalent of the FBI, provoked outrage less than a year after the fatal gang-rape of a woman aboard a New Delhi bus.

The police chief spoke yesterday during a panel discussion about illegal sports betting.

He told delegates that if the state was unable to stop gambling, it may as well make money by legalising and taxing it.

'Do we have the enforcement?' he was reported to have said yesterday. 'It is very easy to say that if you can't enforce it, it's like saying if you can't prevent rape, you enjoy it.'

His remark was translated in a number of slightly different ways, including as: 'If you can't prevent rape, you might as well enjoy it.'

The analogy provoked outrage among opposition politicans and women's groups who accused him of 'trivialising rape'.

Brinda Kara, leader of the Communist Party of India, said: 'It
is sickening that a man who is in charge of several rape investigations
should use such an analogy. He should be 
prosecuted for degrading and insulting women.'

Mr Sinha apologised today in a statement and said his comments had been taken out of context.

'I regret any hurt caused,' he said. 'I gave my opinion that betting should be legalised and that if the laws
cannot be enforced, that does not mean that laws should not be made.

'This
is as erroneous as saying that if rape is inevitable one should lie 
back and enjoy it. I reiterate my deep sense of regard and respect for 
women and my commitment for gender issues.'

But Kavita Krishnan, an activist with the All India Progressive Women's Association, called for Sinha to step down.

'How can he remain the head of India's premier investigation agency?' she said.

Nirmala Sitharaman, spokeswoman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, called the remarks 'shocking', adding on Twitter: 'Wonder if his colleagues in the Bureau, his family and well-wishers approve of his view.'

There were protests across India after a 23-year-old woman was brutally and fatally gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi last December.

Four men were sentenced to death by hanging over the attack, with another one dying in custody before the trial. A sixth male, a juvenile, was sentenced to three years in a reform facility.Â

The lawyer for Ram Singh, who was one of the six accused of the New Delhi gang rape, speaks to reporters in March after it emerged Singh died in custody. The fatal attack provoked national fury over rape laws

The New Delhi attack forced the government 
to change rape laws and create fast-track courts for rape cases.

New 
laws introduced after the attack make stalking, voyeurism and sexual 
harassment a crime. They also provide for the death penalty for repeat 
offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death.

There were more than 24,000 reported rapes in India in 2011, but activists say the real number is many times higher.

The affair comes at a bad time for India's 
CBI, which has been accused of acting as a tool for the government to pressure 
political rivals. Its own legality is being challenged in court.
