Demonstrators marching from Ferguson to Missouri's capital to protest the police shooting death of Michael Brown were met with opposition as they passed through a rural town.

Some people in Rosebud, population 400, shouted racial epithets and held signs telling them to 'go home.'

According to the Missourian, the marchers even encountered a 'display of fried chicken, a melon and a 40-ounce beer bottle' that was placed in the street.

Racist reception: Activists marching Wednesday in response to the Michael Brown verdict got a racist reception as they passed through the town of Rosebud, Missouri on a 120-mile trek to the state capital

Shocking: One stared down the group of 50 marchers on the Journey for Justice through what was quite clearly a nod to the Ku Klux Klan hoods the once struck terror in black communities across America

Several of the 200 or so protesters held signs, like this boy's which read 'Hands down! Go to work!'--a joke about what has become the call to arms for recent protests, 'Hands up, don't shoot'

In video taken as the group passed through the tiny town, marchers appeared to keep their heads high as the hostile protesters--one of them wearing something akin to a KKK hood--yelled obscenities and told them to get back to work.

I've been brought up to know how to deal with people like that,' marcher Cheyenne Willis told the Missourian. 'I ignore them and keep moving forward...The comments that we saw are pure ignorance.' 

The Missourian reports that at least one person displayed a Confederate flag, and the back window of a bus traveling with the marchers was broken by a bullet.

The protest march began after a grand jury decided last week not to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who was white, for the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, who was black and unarmed.

Activists gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday to begin a 120-mile march to the state capital Jefferson City to protest the killing of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer, a case that has rekindled a national debate over U.S. race relations.

Unwelcome: The group stood along the marchers' route and angrily yelled as they passed by

Many of the counter-protesters said they were out to support the police, specifically Officer Wilson

About 100 people were expected to take part in the seven-day march organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), with more joining segments of the long walk, NAACP staff member Jamiah Adams told Reuters.

The march, which is reminiscent of the civil rights marches of the 1960's, was set to begin at midday on Saturday at the Canfield Green Apartments, the residential complex near where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed on Aug. 9 by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.

A grand jury's decision not to charge Wilson ignited protests in Ferguson and a riot that left buildings torched and stores looted.

The NAACP expects about 1,000 people to be part of the final leg of the "Journey for Justice" march.

The civil rights group is asking participants to protect themselves against icy conditions expected along the route by wearing hand warmers and wool socks.

The NAACP is also calling for a new police chief in Ferguson and a national law to prevent racial profiling by police.
