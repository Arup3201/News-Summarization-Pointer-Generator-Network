Mischa Barton's enviable wardrobe on The O.C. was a prime reason to tune in throughout the Fox drama's four seasons, and now the actress says her connections were responsible for the designer items seen on the show.

In a new interview with Elle, the 28-year-old, who played affluent teen Marissa Cooper, credits her New York upbringing with her fashion savvy from a young age.

'Coming from New York, I was friends with a lot of the fashion designers. I grew up in a world around models and supermodels and designers and fashion. In LA, they were very much like, "What is that? I don't really know what that is,"' she says.

She added: 'I was like, if there was one benefit to having a character like Marissa Cooper [it] is that she has access to things. It's that kind of access that made her fascinating to watch. Watching people in the bubble is what people get so fascinated by. I mean that is fully what The O.C. was about: There's the people in the bubble, and then there's the regular, old people around them. Marissa was definitely in the bubble.'

Miss Barton reveals that she had trouble getting into character, but found a connection to Marissa when she wore her impeccable ensembles - many of which she chose.

'The costume designer went out and got all that stuff and we built it, but it was definitely something I pushed. I would pick the outfits and then go to great lengths for it,' she says.

In fact, she says the says the show's young cast would have looked quite different if she hadn't gotten involved.

'I started getting Chanel to send stuff. I started having these designers send stuff over because I saw the merit in getting that kind of stuff on television,' she said.

'If I had those connections in the fashion world, why not? [The wardrobe department] would totally have been happy just dressing us as regular teenagers, to be honest. Not in a bad way, we would have looked adorable, but we would have been just your average Orange County teenagers. But with my wiling and conniving I was like, "You know what would be super great is if we could get this Chanel dress for this [prom] episode," and it kind of all came together.'

In 2008, Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld presented Miss Barton with the InStyle Germany VIPer award, proclaiming, 'So many girls want to look like Mischa Barton. She is a fashion role model for an entire generation.'

Miss Barton has maintained ties with the fashion industry since The O.C. ended in 2007. In 2008, she launched a line of handbags, and in 2012, she opened her own boutique in London, called Mischa's Place.

Last year, she opened up about her personal style in an interview with PopSugar, saying, 'I stick to the designers that I love. So, Chloe and Helmut Lang. I've been wearing a lot of the new Lagerfeld stuff.'
