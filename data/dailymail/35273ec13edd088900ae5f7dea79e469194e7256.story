Police officers in Melbourne are reportedly confiscating the meager earnings of street beggars and labelling the loose change as the 'proceeds of crime'.

There have been at least eight cases in the past year where homeless people in the Victorian city's centre have had their cash seized, according to charity Youth Projects.

'Our outreach teams have reported seeing people quietly begging and having their little cup of change taken away because it is an offence to beg,' the welfare group's chair, Melanie Raymond, told Daily Mail Australia.

She said it is a 'common problem' and hundreds of her clients have been fined around $100 for begging.

'There's a lot of myth around how much people make begging. It is opportunistic and short lived. They normally make around 12-20 dollars. And they might only beg for a couple of hours just to make enough cash for what they need, a meal or toiletries, because they hate begging,' Ms Raymond said.

One client had his begging change seized on Christmas Eve. 'He was begging because he knew there was a public holiday and he knew that non of the charities would be open for support,' Ms Raymond reasoned.

'He was devastated to lose that money because he had two children that he was hoping to see and would arrive empty handed.'

Police on the streets of Melbourne's CBD reportedly told The Age newspaper on Tuesday that they enforce begging laws.

However, Victoria Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sharon Darcy said she did not know of any cash seizures.

A 1966 Victorian law called 'begging or gathering alms' states a person must not beg or gather alms and a person must not cause, procure or encourage a child to beg or gather alms.

Alms are defined as gifts of money, clothes, or food to poor people.

The maximum penalty if found guilty is 12 months imprisonment.

Ms Raymond has called for the law to be scrapped and said it is an old law 'from different times that is ineffective and doesn't reflect reality'. Some of her clients have been fined three times in one day.

Once police have seized cash from begging they do not return it, Ms Raymond explained. Instead, she said some officers have taken her clients to charities and tipped the cash into communal donations boxes. She called this process an 'inefficient redistribution'.

She explained there has been a 40 per cent increase in homelessness in Melbourne's CBD in the past year which has led to beggars on the street seeming more common.

She said their need is 'very genuine' and that while they are sleeping on the streets many concur that they may as well place a sign in front of them to ask for help at the same time.

'It is a sign of crisis in plain sight in our streets,' she said.

She also explained she believes giving money, while a 'deeply personal choice', is more helpful than giving food to the homeless.

'Try to imagine what it would be like if you never ever had the chance to choose what to eat,' she said.

'People are living off a constant diet of bad food and fast food and people would rather choose what they can eat.'

The Youth Projects is the only free medical clinic for the homeless in the Melbourne CBD and The Youth Projects Living Room cares for 6,000 people each year.

There are currently 105,237 people in Australia who are homeless.

The state of Victoria has 22,789 homeless people, the second largest amount behind New South Wales which has 28,190, according to the 2011 ABS Census of Housing and Population.
