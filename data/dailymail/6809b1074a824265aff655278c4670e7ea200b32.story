Marianne Power tests two different 'seasonal' Spanx

The wedding was straight out of the pages of a magazine. The bride wore Fendi, the vows were exchanged in a garden overlooking Lake Como and the lunch was five courses of pure heaven.

But the thing I remember most about my friend's perfect wedding last summer is just how hot I was. 

It's not that the temperatures were particularly scorching - in the pleasant mid-20s at most - but I still spent the celebration sweating like a pig on a spit, and looking about as attractive as one. By the end of the day I was so hot and bothered I was ready to pass out. 

The cause of this discomfort? My industrial-strength Spanx pants. 

I had bought the thickest and longest pair possible - the ones that go from your knees to your bust and suck you in so tight you can hardly breathe - in a bid to get away with the long, clingy dress I'd bought for the wedding.

It never occurred to me in the cold London changing room that being trapped in some sort of giant compression bandage would not be the most comfortable attire for a Mediterranean summer's day.

By the start of the evening, my shorts had been peeled off - after a five-minute battle in the loos - and all my lumps and bumps were wobbling in gay abandon on the dance floor.

I learned my lesson that day - that summer and support wear don't mix. It's one of those cruel facts of life that the very time you need slimming the most - thanks to both a glut of weddings and lack of opaque tights - is the time that you have to go au naturel.

Or is it?

Spanx - which are worn by everyone from Princess Beatrice to Adele, Kim Kardashian to Gwyneth Paltrow - also offer a summer-friendly range it insists will help you keep your cool.

The Skinny Britches range, first introduced last year but re-launched this summer with extra support panels, is made of lightweight breathable fabric, designed to tone lumps and bumps without causing hot flushes.

The range of shorts, slips and body shapers, which claim to firm the tummy, hips, thighs and bottom, have been created with ultra-light, sheer fabric, a cotton gusset and a 'non-binding' unseamed waistband that won't dig in or create lumps and bumps. 

Spanx even includes a mysterious item called the 'skort', which, for the uninitiated, is a pair of shorts with a skirt over the top. The benefit being that if your dress or skirt rides up, you look like you're wearing a slip rather than a pair of control pants.

It all sounds great on paper, but can they pass the comfort test during our hottest summer in years? I decide to try them out.

I start with a pair of Skinny Britches shorts (£44). The first impressions are good - they're delicate, semi-sheer and nicely silk to the touch. More sexy stocking than Elastoplast. In fact, the nude blends so well with my skin I can hardly see them and they're extremely comfortable.

I tried them out under an unforgiving jersey maxi-dress, which normally shows up every lump and bump. They definitely smoothed out my silhouette, lifted my bum and controlled my tum -but, I have to admit, they didn't suck everything in quite as much as my old industrial-strength wedding shorts.

That's because Spanx's 200 products (who knew women needed trussing up in so many different ways?) fall under three categories: Medium support, which 'smoothes your figure and offers a close, yet comfortably forgiving fit'; Super support, which 'shapes your body and flattens your stomach'; and Super Duper support, which 'powerfully transforms your physique targeting specific problem areas with zoned compression'.

Summer Spanx come in shorts or skirt format - known as the 'skort' - for breeze-related emergencies

The summer Spanx, it turns out, offer only the Medium support - so they're lightweight in more ways than one.

The real litmus test, however, came when wearing them out on a scorching London day.

The temperature was in the early 30s and I was getting on and off the Tube and sitting in the park. But far from causing me to overheat, they were so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing them until I undressed again that night. So far so good. 

The next day I tried them out under a pair of light Capri pants, which always show my knicker line. These trousers fitted comfortably when I bought them last summer but now cling like leggings, thanks to a year of over-indulgence on the ice cream front. The shorts made them fit much better - no VPL and my bum looked less saggy, my tummy much flatter.

'The good news is that no matter what 
crazy shapes I was making, my skort stayed in place without being too 
constricting or making me overheat'

In fact, they sucked in my tummy so much I realised that for both days I'd worn them, I'd been eating less. There's just not enough room to tuck into that extra helping. Could Spanx actually force me to diet? I wondered.

Next up, I tried the Skinny Britches Skort (£52) under a shortish summer dress that I'm usually too self-conscious to wear. I don't like my bare legs and am always worried that a gust of wind is going to reveal too much cellulite to the world.

The skort may be a ridiculous word but it's a good solution to this rather universal problem.

A flimsy-looking bubblegum pink undergarment, this acts as both a slip and shorts in one, promising to keep both your dignity and wobbly bits under control. I liked it. When my skirt did fly up with a gust of wind, my pink slip stayed in place and looked much more respectable than a beige pair of Spanx would have done.

Marianne gives the skort a thumbs-up... in spite of the silly word

Again, I wore it all day and felt perfectly cool and comfortable.

For the ultimate test, I took my skort to a wedding in Surrey. The sun was blazing and the marquee felt like a furnace. I'd like to say that I stayed cool as a cucumber throughout but that wouldn't be strictly true. Only this time, it wasn't my undergarments that were making me sweat like I was at an aerobics class - I blame Beyonce. Or whatever else the DJ was playing that kept me on the dance floor all night.

The good news is that no matter what crazy shapes I was making, my skort stayed in place without being too constricting or making me overheat. By the end of the night my head spun, my heels hurt but my wobbles stayed firmly under control. What more could a girl ask for?
