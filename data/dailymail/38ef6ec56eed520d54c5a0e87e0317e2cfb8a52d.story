Two Mexican nationals were arrested in south Texas yesterday in connection to the December Target credit card breach which compromised the personal bank information of an estimated 100million customers.

McAllen, Texas police arrested 27-year-old Mary Carmen Garcia and 28-year-old Daniel Guardiola Dominguez as they were trying to cross into the U.S. from Reynosa, Mexico. Both are from Monterrey, Mexico.

Police say the couple crossed into the U.S. last weekend with 100 fraudulent cards and spent tens of thousands of dollars and brought an addition 96 cards with them on Sunday.

The credit cards they were carrying are believed to contain information obtained in the Target secuirty breach last month, which resulted in the release of credit and debit card information belonging to 40 million customers and the account and personal information of an additional 70 million customers. 

The credit cards Garcia and Dominguez were carrying were from Mexican banks but contained the account information of south Texas residents.

Chief Victor Rodriguez of the McAllen Police Department told The Monitor they already had warrants on the couple so when they tried to cross the Anzalduas International Bridge, they were arrested on the spot.

But police believe Garcia and Dominquez are just two of a larger group out to exploit the stolen credit cards.

'Every day that goes by we think that the Target breach data may be devaluating so there will be more pressure to capitalize on them sooner rather than later,' Chief Rodriguez told KGBT.

More information on the couple will be released after formal charges are filed.
