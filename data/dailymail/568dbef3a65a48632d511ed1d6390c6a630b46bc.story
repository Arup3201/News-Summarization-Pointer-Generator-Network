Only seven per cent of Britons would pay more than a tenner for wine - and women are more frugal than men

Most Britons refuse to pay more than £6 for a bottle of wine while only one in three can name a single grape variety, it is claimed.

The shift to cheap plonk has brought claims that Britain, which imports more wine than any other nation, is effectively dumbing down as a wine nation.

Some 80 per cent of all wine sold in the UK sells for less than £6, which leaves very little profit for the producers once tax – at 60 per cent - and shipping is taken out of the equation.

Today, just 7 per cent of us are prepared to part with more than £10 for a bottle of wine, according to research by drinks specialist Harpers.

The research found that a third cannot name a single grape type and only four per cent can name more than 10. Overall, women were far less knowledgeable than men.

It might be assumed that the reason most people opt for cheap wine is a result of a five year cost of living squeeze, coupled with confusion and ignorance about what tastes good.

However, there is some research to suggest that a nation raised on big brands like Jacobs Creek, Blue Nun and Piat D’Or genuinely prefer the taste of cheaper wines rather than exclusive expensive vintages.

A study found that eight in ten people in blind taste tests preferred a bottle of wine costing £4.99 over a £19.99 option which was made from the same grapes.

Six in ten thought the £4.99 version was just so delicious that it must be the more expensive of the two, according to research by the London Wine Academy.

Data was gathered from 20,000 enthusiasts attending courses with the Academy over the last 20 years.

On average, 80per cent preferred the taste of cheaper, commercial Aspen Chardonnay from South East Australia, which costs some £4.99 from Majestic Wine.

They put it ahead of the more expensive, small-volume Gerard Thomas St. Aubin 1er Cru from Burgundy, France, which is £19.99 at Waitrose and Majestic.

Two thirds of us cannot name a single grape variety and 80 per cent of wine sold goes for under £6

The academy said the amateur’s perception of a good wine is based on the notion of ‘smoothness’.

As a result, it says it is hardly surprising that most prefer cheaper wine from warm climates which are soft, due to lower acidity, round, due to higher alcohol, and display simple, pure-fruit characteristics.

Getting young consumers to understand the nuances of wine flavours is the industry’s biggest challenge, according to the Harpers researchers.

More than half of the 18- to 24-year-olds interviewed in its survey said they normally only buy wine if it is on promotion.

Jeremy Rockett, marketing director at Spanish-owned distributor Gonzalez Byass, believes many are simply confused by wine and the way it is sold.

‘You go into a supermarket and there’s a wall of products that all look broadly the same,’ he said.

Sainsbury's, Asda and Tesco are the most popular among wine-buyers, thanks to the special offers

‘There are 900 glass bottles of similar size and shape, but different countries, different grape types – many you’ve never heard of – all with different prices . Where do you start as a young person? It’s really, really hard.’

James Burston, business development director at PLB – Britain’s largest independently owned wine distributor, said the industry needs to make wine less intimidating.

He said: ‘The UK wine market is going through a period of seismic change. There will be casualties, and there may well be consolidation and collaboration.’

Mr Burston said cider had managed to change its image and generate a surge in sales by adopting more modern packaging and marketing, such as suggesting it is served over ice.

‘Cider became more accessible and suddenly the whole category exploded back into life, from entry level through to premium and niche,’ he said.
