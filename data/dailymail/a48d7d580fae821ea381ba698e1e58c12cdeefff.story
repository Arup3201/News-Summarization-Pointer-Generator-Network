Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said that a 'new economy is emerging' outside London

The boom of new private sector jobs and businesses in northern regions is
 beginning to outpace London and the south east, a Cabinet minister 
claims today.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said that under the 
last government prosperity had become dangerously concentrated in 
financial services in and around the capital, but the latest statistics 
suggested a ‘new economy is emerging’.

But he said that in Merseyside
 and Lancashire, for instance, there were 48,685 new enterprises created
 last year, an 11 per cent increase on the previous year and three times
 the rate in London.

Rather than relying on the public sector, Mr 
Pickles said there was clear evidence of a ‘diverse and balanced economy
 based on the innovation and entrepreneurship that lies at the heart of 
what makes Britain great’.

His remarks came as official figures 
boosted hopes of a secure, sustained recovery, showing the economy is 
becoming less reliant on consumer spending after a long-awaited surge in
 business investment.

The Office for National Statistics said 
business investment rose by 2.4 per cent quarter on quarter in the final
 three months of 2013, against expectations of 1.3 per cent.

Upward 
revisions to previous estimates mean it has also increased for four 
quarters in a row for the first time since 2007 and has increased 8.5 
per cent compared with the previous year.

Gross domestic product rose
 by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, the Office for National 
Statistics confirmed, unrevised from an earlier estimate and in line 
with forecasts - meaning the fastest rate of full year growth since the 
financial crisis.

Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the figures, 
saying in they provided ‘more encouraging news our long-term economic 
plan is working’.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, 
said: ‘The second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP provides further 
reassurance that the economic recovery is becoming better balanced and 
is therefore sustainable.’

Deutsche Bank economist George Buckley 
said: ‘This provides some hope that the recovery is gaining breadth even
 if, as we expect, overall growth slows during the course of this year.’

Mr Pickles said that the Government’s economic plan had ‘profound goals’.

‘One
 of the many tragedies of the Labour years is that the self-proclaimed 
party of the many acted in the interests of just a few. Prosperity, 
financial security, opportunities - these were things restricted to too 
few parts of country,’ the minister said.

‘If you were from the south
 east and worked in financial services, then you were OK. But if you 
weren’t, then you were left behind. Changing this will take time but we 
are making progress.’

New figures show that in Nottingham, Derby, 
Leicester and the surrounding towns, more than 49,010 new 
apprenticeships were started last year, more than in the whole of 
London.

‘Young people in our former industrial heartlands getting the
 chance to develop practical skills, kick start a career and of course 
the chance to take home a decent pay-packet,’ Mr Pickles said.

In 
Birmingham, Yorkshire and Humberside the rise of private sector 
employment has been higher in every year since 2010 than in the boom 
years between 2000 and 2007.

In Coventry, the number of young people 
starting an apprenticeship has doubled, while in Liverpool, there has 
been a five per cent jump in the number of private sector jobs.

In 
places including Stoke-on-Trent, Tyneside and Plymouth, there is now 
seeing economic growth which is far outstripping the national average.

Mr
 Pickles claimed a new generation of enterprise zones, with significant 
business tax breaks, simplified planning permission and superfast 
broadband, was helping to encourage growth of the private sector in the 
regions.

‘Those conditions are attracting massive investment like
 the £800 million being put into Manchester’s Airport City by a 
British-Chinese joint venture, creating 16,000 jobs, or the £500 million
 being invested in the Black Country by Jaguar Land Rover: one of the 
great British brands spearheading the recovery,’ he said.

‘But 
there is still a long way to go. The job isn’t even half done, and 
nothing would be more dangerous than a return to the same old recipe of 
more spending, more borrowing and more taxes that Labour offers.’

The minister added that Britain could ‘look forward to the future with confidence’.

‘In
 April we’ll have the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and 
thousands of employers will no longer have to pay employers’ National 
Insurance contributions, meaning they take more people on and provide 
more families with financial security.

‘The tax threshold will 
rise to £10,000 so no one will pay tax for the £10,000 they earn. In 
short, they take home more with every pay cheque.

‘I know from 
experience how much these changes will help. From behind the till at my 
father’s corner shop in Keighley I witnessed neighbours on a council 
estate working very hard for a wage and being able to keep their family 
secure because of that. It wasn’t easy at times but it had a big impact 
on me.

‘I’ve always believed that Government must create the 
right conditions to help anyone who wants to work hard and get on in 
life, to do so. It not only encourages economic growth but gives people 
the opportunity to support their own families.’

A Treasury spokesman added a note of caution: ‘As the Chancellor said last week the recovery is not yet secure.

‘The
 Budget next month will do more to support investment and exports, and 
the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s 
providing economic security for hardworking people.’
