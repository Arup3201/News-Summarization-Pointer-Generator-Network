A man panicked and ran for cover after shooting a gun for the first time hitting both the target and a tree that came crashing down in his direction.

Dave of Terre Haute, Indiana took a .500 Smith & Wesson in hand hoping to hit a bull’s eye target. He hit his mark but also nearly knocked himself out after a tree came violently crashing down in his direction.

Video of the hilarious moment titled, '500 Smith & Wesson Tree Fail,' was posted on YouTube on October 11 and since then has gotten over one million views.

First shot: Dave gears up to shoot a practice target against a tree with a Smith & Wesson for the first time ever 

Dash: Dave runs away in panic after he hits the target and the tree sending it crashing down in his direction 

'Watch out. Move, move!' a friend can be heard yelling at the rookie shooter darts off in utter terror.

'My brother, who is featured in the video, was shooting a .500 for the first time at a target placed against a tree,' Robert S. of told Jukin Media.

'None of us thought that the result of hitting his target would cause that tree to come down.'

Dave wasn't using his gun against another but his target shot back at him nevertheless, teaching him a lesson in gun safety. 

Tree down: The tree falls to the ground and luckily didn't hit anybody on it's sudden descent after being struck

Bulls eye: Dave hit his target but his great shot also caused a tree to break and fall in his direction 

Stumped: Dave and his friends struggle to find out how the  gunshot could lead to the tree's destruction
