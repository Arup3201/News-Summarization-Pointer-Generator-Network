Secret documents revealing why Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith escaped prosecution for child abuse will now be published after a lengthy legal battle.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been ordered to release papers relating to its decision not to bring charges against the obese paedophile politician while he was still alive. 

Police submitted files about Smith’s abuse of boys in his hometown of Rochdale in 1970, 1998 and 1999, but each time prosecutors recommended that no action should be taken against him.

But the 
Information Rights Tribunal has ruled the CPS must make public documents
 explaining why its lawyers decided he should not be brought to court.

Judge
 Chris Hughes described the papers as ‘significant historical documents’
 that shed light on the paedophile MP’s ‘character and actions’. 

The
 current MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk, the author of a recent book 
exposing Smith’s abuse, said: ‘I think it’s good news that these 
documents are finally seeing the light of day.

‘I suspect there are many other documents relating to Smith and other paedophiles that also need to see the light of day.’

Mr Danczuk’s book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith was serialised in the Daily Mail earlier this year.

Sir Cyril Smith died in September 2010, aged 82.
