Amir Khan celebrated his 28th birthday on Monday by declaring himself so much a better fighter than he was a year ago that he is now the future of boxing.

If he can demonstrate that to the world with a statement performance against America’s Devon Alexander here on the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday night, he hopes the public will give him the present he wants above all others.

Namely, that long awaited fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Birthday boy Amir Khan says he's the future of boxing ahead of his clash with Devon Alexander

Khan was speaking to reporters at The Delano in Las Vegas ahead of the big fight on Saturday night

‘I’m focussed on Alexander,’ says Khan. ‘But after I beat him I hope the people will say that I deserve to fight Floyd and will demand that he meets me.’

That picture is clouded by the public’s desire to see Mayweather meet Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time. But if that doesn’t happen Khan expects to be ready and waiting for the fight of his life.

He says: ‘I have the fastest hands in the ring. I have some of the best skills in boxing. I deserve to be regarded as among the elite fighters in the world, to be talked about in the same breath as Mayweather and Pacquiao. I believe I am the future of boxing.’

The boy from Bolton has never been short of confidence, even after twice losing world title defences, but his detractors are wrong in confusing that self-belief with arrogance.

This is the first time Khan has pronounced himself the equal of the two men widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighters on the planet.

He does so in the certainty that he has eliminated the mistakes which saw him walk on to devastating punches and now knows how to protect a chin which many regard as made of glass.

He explains: ‘Even though I’m just turning 28 I still feel young, I’m still hungry and still a nice person. But the difference is that I’m wiser, smarter and I've learned from those mistakes.’

Khan should have fought Alexander a year ago, when the 27-year-old from St Louis held a world title. He pulled out in anticipation of a Mayweather fight and Alexander lost that crown to Shawn Porter, who subsequently had it taken from him by Khan’s British rival Kell Brook.

But Khan does not regret starting that chain of events. He says: ‘Everything happens for a reason and I know now that I’m a stronger, smarter fighter than I was 12 months ago.

‘That would have been my first fight coming up to welterweight and there’s no doubt that I’m much more ready for Devon now than I would have been then.

‘I've grown into the division. And in the time I had out of the ring Virgil Hunter (his trainer) corrected my errors. He worked on my balance and my defence. He made me realise that although I’m an attacking boxer I need to recognise when to go on the offensive.

‘It’s in my blood to love a fight and that will always be a big part of me. But I have a better grasp of when to concentrate on boxing with abilities and not walk onto big shots. Anyone who does that gets knocked down by the kind of punches I got caught with.

‘Now I know that this is my time.’

Khan made an impressive debut at welterweight with a comfortable points win over Luis Collazo last May

This is his first fight since the birth of his first child and he has spent most of the time since that day away from his daughter, his wife and most of his family at Virgil’s gym near San Francisco.

He says: ‘I’ve sparred more than 160 rounds. I’ve learned to eat clean because if you put high quality fuel in a racing car it goes even faster. I’ve missed my family. But I’m making the sacrifices because I want the big fights against the best in the world, the chance to prove I belong in the ring with them and see how well I can do.’

Khan’s father and mentor, Shah, does spend time with him at the training camp. His separation from his mother ended, for a few hours on his birthday, as she welcomed him and his father to Las Vegas as they flew in from San Francisco.

His eyes light up when he says: ‘I’ll be flying to New York the day after this fight to see my wife and daughter and spend quality time with them over the holidays.’

He expects to make that trip as a hot contender in what is being described here as ‘the Mayweather sweepstakes'.

That will depend on him defeating Alexander, another quick and clever boxer, in eye-catching style on his first bill-topping appearance at the fabled MGM Grand Garden.

Khan vs Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late Saturday night.
