Tragedy: Daniel Kapis died walking to a wedding ceremony he had been invited to because he was lonely

A 'lonely man' who a couple invited to their wedding was knocked down and killed clutching the gift he bought them as he walked to their ceremony.

Daniel Kapis, 64, from Canonsburg, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was found on Route 19 in North Strabane on Friday, with the wedding card and a $25 gift certificate.

Thomas and Denise Yakopin had invited Mr Kapis because he was extremely lonely and didn't have much in his life.

They even requested that he shouldn't buy them a present because him just being there would have made them happy.

According to the couple Mr Kapis had told them how excited he was to be attending their special day.

But tragedy struck when Mr Kapis was walking to the church and he was knocked down by a passing vehicle.

He died just before 5pm at Allegheny General Hospital.

Speaking to the Pittsburgh News, Reverend John Batykefer said: 'When I found out it was him, it took me back and there was a gasp from the church when I made the announcement yesterday.' 

According to the priest, Mr Kapis was an usher at 10 o'clock mass every Sunday.

'From what I understand, he had the gift in his hand that they found at the scene of the accident.'

The couple are said to be devastated by the news and on Saturday Mr Yakopin posted a tribute to Mr Kapis on his Facebook page.

Thomas and Denise Yakopin were preparing to get married at St Patrick's Church when Mr Kapis lost his life

He wrote: 'Our friend Dan K. was hit and killed by a car crossing the highway on his way to our wedding.

'Words cannot express the grief my new wife and I have experienced trying to make sense of this loss. 

'Denise loved Dan and purposed to show him the kindness of our LORD Jesus. Dan was a very special man.

Thomas Yakopin posted a tribute to Mr Kapis on his Facebook page after his wedding day

'Everyday accidents happen, but rarely this close to home. If you would be so kind, pray for Dan's family, pray for the young man who hit and killed Dan, and pray for my lovely wife, Denise M. Yakopin.'

The gift certificate was for the Olive Garden restaurant which the devastated couple visited on Sunday night in tribute to Mr Kapis.
