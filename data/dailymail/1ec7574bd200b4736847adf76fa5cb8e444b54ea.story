Daniel Sturridge and his England team-mates have been exploring Miami by taking a stroll along the beach and looking at the some of the amazing views the city has to offer.

With some free time to enjoy, the striker posed for a photo with Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling and Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere on the beach.

Posting the snap to his Instagram account, the 24-year-old - who will play in his first World Cup this summer - said: 'Beach selfie with the boys!! Nice afternoon off. Good vibes strolling on the beach. Back to training tmoz!!'

The foursome - all wearing their England tracksuits - had earlier cast their eye over the city from a rooftop but it seems Sturridge was glad to get back on the ground.

The former Chelsea and Man City frontman joked: 'Great vibes in Miami with the boys. Rooftop made my belly drop and that's no lie. Felt like I was on a roller coaster!'

England's opening training session had to be cancelled on Monday morning as hurricane season swept through the city.

Roy Hodgsonâ€™s squad, who arrived at the Barry University campus at around 10am local time in two buses, were blown away on their first full day in Florida.

Instead England, who play Ecuador in the SunLife Stadium in Miami on Wednesday, were forced to train in the university gym instead of the specially prepared outdoor pitch.

Meanwhile, Oxlade-Chamberlain has revealed he will be ready for the hot and humid conditions of Manaus when England meet Italy in the World Cup this month.

The Arsenal wideman told Lucozade Sport that he and his England team-mates will be sure to prepare right in order to deal with the hot and humid conditions in Brazil.

The 20-year-old recalled a visit to Vietnam when he was 'dripping with sweat' having only stepped out of his room and says players must prepare and be ready for the South American climate.
