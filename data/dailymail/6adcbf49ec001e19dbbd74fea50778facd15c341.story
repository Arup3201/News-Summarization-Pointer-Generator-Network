Russian police have launched a criminal investigation after two British anglers were killed by a helicopter’s rotor blades during a luxury salmon fishing tour north of the Arctic Circle.

Retired City lawyer Rupert Beaumont and fine-art dealer Mark Robertson, both 69, died alongside their Russian guide and interpreter, Alexander Tushnikov, 53.

Last night the helicopter pilot was being questioned by detectives amid claims he initially misled police about the events surrounding the crash.

The probe is understood to be looking into whether human error was to blame for the tragedy, rather than initial suggestions of adverse weather conditions.

Wreckage: Debris litters the site where this helicopter crashed, killing two British tourists and their guide

Investigation: The rotor blades are clearly missing from the Eurocopter EC-120 which crashed while taking two Britons and a guide on a luxury fishing trip to a remote part of Russia

Pictures show the Eurocopter E120B 
lurched to one side – lending support to the theory that wet ground made
 the helicopter slip, striking the men below.

The British pair were on what has 
been described as the ‘ultimate’ salmon fishing trip in the Kola 
peninsula, 90 miles from the Russian Arctic port city of Murmansk. The 
tours cost up to £4,000 a week.

They had just been dropped off at an 
angling lodge on Sunday morning, near the Rynda river, when their 
chartered helicopter banked suddenly while trying to take off. The 
blades hit the three men, killing them instantly.

Impact: The helicopter flipped moments after dropping off Mark Robertson and Rupert Beaumont and their guide for a fishing trip, initial reports suggest

Emergency: The pilot of the stricken helicopter managed to escape the wreckage with only minor injuries

The Russian authorities opened a 
criminal case by questioning Shabalin over an alleged violation of air 
safety rules leading to the death of two or more people, which carries a
 penalty of between four and ten years in jail.

Pilot Alexander Shabalin alerted the emergency services with a distress call, but is now said to be ‘traumatised’.

Tribute: Rupert Beaumont, pictured, was described as a devoted family man who was deeply admired within the legal profession

Both Britons were enthusiastic fishermen and lived close to each other in Hook, Hampshire.

Mr Beaumont was a senior partner at 
London law firm Slaughter and May, and a director of the exclusive New 
Zealand Golf Club near West Byfleet, Surrey.

A keen golfer and bridge player, who 
retired at 57, the father of two was described as ‘instrumental’ in the 
deal to sell the collapsed Barings Bank in 1995 following the Nick 
Leeson rogue trader scandal.

His wife Susie was yesterday 
travelling back from a holiday, where she was understood to be visiting 
their daughter Juliet in Australia.

Slaughter and May senior partner Chris Saul described Mr Beaumont as a ‘great teacher’ who loved life.

He said: ‘This is the most tragic news. Rupert was with the firm for over 30 years and built a hugely successful practice.

‘Rupert was a lover of life. He loved
 fishing, he loved golf, he loved his garden and he loved his family.  
He nurtured young talent. He was a very thoughtful, supportive lawyer, 
good to work with and a great teacher.

‘He was a very generous and energetic
 individual, there was something very lively about Rupert’s approach to 
the law and his life in general.

‘He was one of those people who when you think about them you smile. It is an awful loss.

Probe: An investigation is now underway to establish how the Eurocopter EC-120, which has a good safety record, crashed, killing three

Crash scene: A major investigation is underway to establish how the helicopter blades hit the three men

‘He was admired by colleagues and 
clients alike for his wonderful legal skills, his creativity, his grace 
under pressure and his warmth and charm. He will be enormously missed 
and our hearts go out to his family.’

Mr Robertson’s son Timothy said 
yesterday that he, along with his mother and sister, were ‘devastated’ 
at their loss, but he was too upset to comment further.

A Foreign and Commonwealth spokesman released a statement from both families.

It said: ‘Both families are 
devastated by yesterday’s tragic news. Both men will be deeply missed by
 their families and many friends.’

Ultimate destination: Salmon anglers on the 'untouched' Kola peninsula

Tragedy: The helicopter which is thought to have killed the three men was a Eurocopter 120B (stock image, this helicopter was not involved in the crash)

The Kola peninsula became the ‘ultimate destination’ for luxury fishing tours after the Cold War.But those who spend £4,000 a head to fish in some of the most well-stocked waters in the world, are taking a calculated risk.

The area is accessible for only five months of the year, the rivers are frozen for up to four months and in December the temperature plunges to an average minimum temperature of -39C.

All travel in Russia can be hazardous, with the country’s road death rate of 19.5 per 100,000 only just below many African countries. 

But having to charter a helicopter into the best fishing areas only adds to the danger. Although the three men who died on Sunday were travelling in a modern Eurocopters, it is not uncommon for extreme tourists in Russia to be carried in ancient Army helicopters that are veterans from the Afghanistan wars. 

Angling enthusiast David Profumo, son of disgraced politician John Profumo, was lucky to survive a crash in an MI-2 helicopter in the Kola peninsula in 2001.

He was on a fishing expedition for The Field magazine and was pulled from the wreckage by the pilot, leaving him with two broken ribs. It took ten hours for the group to be rescued.

In such a vast country, many parts of which offer limited medical care, people caught up in trouble have to travel hundreds of miles for often substandard help.

When television presenter and keen angler Chris Tarrant visited the Kola peninsula in 2000, he said he was threatened by a drunk fishing inspector with a loaded revolver.

And although the fish are plentiful, it is not advisable to eat them. 

As the former home of the Soviet submarine fleet, the Kola peninsula is littered with facilities housing more than 100 tons of nuclear waste – the largest concentration in the world.
