President Barack Obama has paid tribute to comedian and director Harold Ramis who died on Monday, with the President calling the late actor one of America's 'greatest satirists'.

'Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of Harold Ramis, one of America’s greatest satirists, and like so many other comedic geniuses, a proud product of Chicago’s Second City. 

'When we watched his movies – from Animal House and 'Caddyshack to Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day – we didn’t just laugh until it hurt. We questioned authority. 

Loss of a legend: Harold Ramis wrote and directed 'Caddyshack' and 'Stripes,' and had writing credits in 'Meatballs' and 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' to name a few

'We identified with the outsider. We rooted for the underdog.  And through it all, we never lost our faith in happy endings.'

Paying tribute: President Obama put out a statement after news of Ramis' death, hailing the his fellow Chicagoan as one of America's best satirists

The President even ended the statement with a Ramis reference that only the most ardent of fans would catch.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Harold’s wife, Erica, his children and grandchildren, and all those who loved him, who quote his work with abandon, and who hope that he received total consciousness,' the statement concluded.

'Total consciousness is not a phrase used often, and Gawker caught that it was a reference to a famous speech that actor Bill Murray made in Ramis' hit film Caddyshack where Murray's character tells a tale of how he was the caddy for the Dalai Lama one time in Tibet. 

'So we finish the eighteenth and he's 
gonna stiff me. And I say, "Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little 
something, you know, for the effort, you know." And he says, "Oh, uh, 
there won't be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will 
receive total consciousness. So I got that goin' for me, which is nice,'
 Murray says in the film.

Ramis, a native of President Obama's hometown of Chicago,  died Monday at the age of 69.

He suffered for several years from an 
autoimmune disease that caused inflammation and damage to his blood 
vessels, and died at his home in the Chicago suburbs, surrounded by 
family and friends, his talent agency said.

His death rattled a modern comedy world Ramis helped build. His legacy as a father figure to generations of comedians was appropriately captured in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up, in which Ramis was cast as Seth Rogen's father, Apatow said, 'because we all saw him as the dream dad.'

'Harold Ramis made almost every movie which made me want to become a comedy director,' Apatow said.

'These films are the touchstones of our lives.'

One of Ramis' closest friends in Hollywood and his longtime collaborator was Bill Murray, who put out a statement to Time Magazine.

‘He earned his keep on this planet. God bless him,’ Murray said.
