It has been five long years since 13-year-old Marcellous Bennett and his older brothers pistol whipped and robbed a pizza delivery driver in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Since then, Bennett has been to juvenile detention and remains on probation for the crime. His older brothers, both members of local gangs, are still serving time in prison.

But Bennett has made an unlikely ally, one who is now mentoring him and helping him stay away from trouble: the victim of his crime.

'I see a lot of myself in Marcell,' Brady Middleton, 24, told The Grand Rapids Press in a interview about their redemption story, from assailant and victim to close friends.

'I don’t see Marcell as a sum of mistakes and where he’s from. I see him as a human. That’s bigger and more important than any mistake, any background.'

After the attack, Middleton needed 70 stitches and three years of physical therapy

Middleton, then 19, was on his last pizza delivery in 2009 when he buzzed the apartment where Bennett and his two older brothers were. He heard a gun cock to his side.

'Everything slowed down,' he told the Press. 'My heart dropped.'

The man with the gun told him to get down on his knees.

'I thought it was over at that point in time,' he told the paper. 'I asked him, ‘Are you going to kill me?’ He said, ‘Yes.''

When Middleton thought all was lost, the man ran away and all three suspects fled in his delivery car.

Middleton was left with a cut above his left eye that required 70 stitches, post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be in physical therapy for three years for post-concussion syndrome.

The three suspects were eventually arrested and sentenced for the crime.

When Middleton confronted one of his adult assailants in court, he told him, 'You not only stole my car and money that night, you stole something more valuable: my genuine trust in people and my surroundings.'

But once Middleton saw Bennett in court — a 13-year-old boy following the only example he'd seen growing up — his heart began to soften.

'My gosh, this is a child,' he thought. 'How the heck does somebody get there?'

He started attending all of Bennett's court hearings and offered the troubled teen words of encouragement.

Once Bennett was released from juvenile detention, Middleton dropped by his foster home. The two played video games for a while, and Middleton finally asked him the question that burned in his mind: 'Why?'

'It was just what I seen, I breathed, I looked, I did,' Bennett told the Press. 'It was a family thing. Some people can’t help the fact that all they brothers is gang members. So when I was growing up, that’s all I seen.'

The two men have forged an unlikely friendship since Bennett and his older brothers attacked Middleton in 2009

But slowly, Bennett started to realize he didn't need to enter a life of crime just because of the example he'd had.

'That changed my life at that point in 
time more than the assault,' Middleton told the Press. 'It was indicative of a 
bigger problem — this just wasn’t about me'

'I knew that he cared about my future, so it was nothing but respect,' the 18-year-old added about his mentor.

Bennett is studying to become a barber and works as a cook in Portage, Michigan. His probation will be over in a year. Once that's taken care of, he wants to go live on his own and is considering studying business administration in college.

Middleton has already offered him a spot at his apartment near Grand Valley State University, where he studies political science.

Together, the two attend meetings with a local group that helps men re-enter society after spending time behind bars.

Growing up, Bennett never thought he had a future to look forward to.

'When I was younger, when I was gang banging, the older kids was telling me, ‘We need people in the hood to go to college to be lawyers, to be doctors,’' he said. 'But we see them, they’re not doing that. They telling us that but they still selling drugs, they still toting guns.'

But now, next to his new friend and mentor, he knows he has much ahead of him.

'With so much trust and how much he believe in me,' Bennett told the paper, 'I don’t want to disappoint him.'
