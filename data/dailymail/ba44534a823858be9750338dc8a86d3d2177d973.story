There are ways of quitting a job you hate... and then there are ways of quitting a job you hate.

And this is most certainly the latter.

When video editor Marina Schifrin decided she wanted to leave Taiwanese animator Next Media Animation she didn't pop into her boss's office to have a quiet word.

Instead, she posted a film on YouTube of herself dancing around the open-plan workspace to Kanye West's hit single Gone with subtitles explaining her grievances in detail.

Scroll down for video.

Dead of night: The video begins with Miss Schifrin setting up a camera in her company's office at 4.30am

Dancing time: It then cuts to a shot of her dancing to the music of Kanye West's hit Gone

Backhanded compliment: Miss Schifrin says her boss is a 'brilliant writer' and her 'respect for him is boundless'

And as if that were not enough, she also penned a 1,500-word blog outlining her reasons, which she called Journalism is Dead (To Me).

She writes: 'I work for an awesome company that produces news videos.

'For almost two years I've sacrificed my time, energy and relationships for this job, and my boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets. 

Gripe: Tactfully she never names the company for which she worked but pulls few punches in her reasons for wanting out

Blogged down: And as if the video were not enough, she also penned a 1,500-word blog outlining her reasons, which she called Journalism is Dead (To Me)

'So I thought I'd make one of my own to focus on the content instead of worry about the views.

'Oh, and to let my boss know I quit.'

On her blog, Miss Schifrin, who is from New York, explains further: 'I got a job [...] for an animation company where I was free to make jokes and put my personality into my writing. I loved it! I found the perfect combination between comedy and journalism. I was having my cake, eating it AND going in for seconds.

'I dropped everything for work. I spent hours in the office perfecting my headlines, my voice overs, my stories.

Ironic? Since posting it online two days ago, her video has had more than 300,000 views

'I'm gone': The video ends with her switching off the light and leaving the office

'But as the workload increased, I found I could no longer keep up. I tried. I came in earlier, I stayed later, I worked on weekends. Scared I wasn’t pulling my weight, I went to my boss and told him how I felt.

'"Make deadlines, not art," was his response.

'After I admitted that I could not hit the deadlines needed to put out our long-form, satirical news pieces, I was moved to our serious stories.'

But she says she didn't find that fulfilling and decided to leave for a different career.

She adds: 'Running away from something is never the solution. Unless your problem is a mugger. Then yes, run. GO! NOW!

'But for this particular problem, the solution is rolling up your sleeves, sticking your hands in the motherboard and jostling the wires until things fall into place.'
