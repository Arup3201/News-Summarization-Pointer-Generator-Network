Fashionistas outside Lincoln Center on Sunday got a sartorial surprise when a group of Anna Wintour clones paraded around the New York Fashion Week venue.

The lookalikes, sporting the Vogue editor-in-chief's signature dark sunglasses and polished bobs, were debuting British singer and designer Madame Allsorts' line of sweatshirts, branded with the words 'Spring, Summer, Autumn' and a cartoon drawing of Ms Wintour.

The 'fash mob' - including Madame Allsorts herself, who wore a purple gown adorned with a pattern of Anna Wintour faces - caused such a stir that they were eventually escorted off the premises.
