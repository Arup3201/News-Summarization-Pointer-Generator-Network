A father has given his young daughters a big surprise, showing up at their school dressed as Santa Claus after his return from a year-long deployment in South Korea.

Captain Josh Risher visited Windsor Elementary School in Columbia, South Carolina, on December 10, where his two girls, eight-year-old Christy and six-year-old Kaylee were attending an assembly, completely unaware that their dad was back home for the holidays.

Video footage of the emotional reunion sees Mr Risher arriving at the event in costume and, staying in character as St. Nick, asking his chidren: 'Have you girls been good this year?'

It takes a moment before their eyes light up with recognition and they both scream 'Daddy!' before leaping up to embrace their father, as the teachers and students behind them cheerfully applaud.

Mr Risher had returned to Columbia one day prior and stayed with his parents to keep his visit a secret from his children.

'It was definitely worth one more night... at my parents' house,' Mr Risher told NBC affiliate WIS-TV. 'To be able to see the look on these girls' faces today, just the utter look of shock and disbelief. It was great.'

Mr Risher's wife, Amanda, was in on the surprise, and managed to keep the secret from Christy, Kaylee and their three-year-old brother Jack.

'We’re going to have a great Christmas,' Mrs Risher told South Carolina newspaper The State. 'I don’t have to get them one present because their daddy is going to be home, and that’s all they care about.'

'I feel so good. It was an early Christmas miracle,' Christy added.

Happy reunion: Kaylee, whose sixth birthday was the following day, threw her hands in the air and cheered

Well-kept secret: Mr Risher returned to South Carolina the day before the surprise but spent the night at his parents' house to keep his return from his children

The three children were told that their dad wouldn't be home until Christmas Eve, but his early arrival meant that he was also home to celebrate Kaylee's sixth birthday on December 11.

Mr Risher, who was deployed in December 2013, communicated with his family through Skype over the past year and was able to visit them for two weeks over the summer.

Later this month, the family will move to Fort Campbell in Kentucky, where Mr Risher has been transferred.
