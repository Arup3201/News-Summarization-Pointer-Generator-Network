Kiera Wilmot has been expelled and charged with adult felonies for her aluminum foil and toilet cleaner experiment

A 16-year-old girl has been expelled from school and charged with two adult felonies for causing an explosion in a water bottle.

Kiera Wilmot, described as a 'good kid' by her high school principal, was mixing aluminum foil and toilet cleaner in the bottle when it exploded before school on Monday morning.

The screw-top on the 8oz bottle blew off as pressure built within the container.

She told the assistant principal, who found her after hearing a bang, that she 'thought it would just cause some smoke', 10 News reports.

She said she was not trying to hurt anyone or disrupt the school and was conducting a science fair experiment.

But her science teacher said no such experiment had been set for students and the assistant principal called police.

When police arrived they handcuffed Wilmot and charged her with possession or discharge of a weapon on school grounds and discharging a destructive device.

'She is a good kid,' school principal Ron Pritchard told 10 News. 'She has never been in trouble before. Ever.

'She made a bad choice. Honestly, I don't think she meant to ever hurt anyone. She wanted to see what would happen [when the chemicals mixed] and was shocked by what it did.'

School principal Ron Pritchard said Kiera Wilmot had 'made a bad choice' but was 'a good kid'

Wilmot's twin sister reportedly ran out of a class crying when a fellow student asked her about the arrest.

She will now finish her high school 
diploma through an expulsion program after being expelled from Bartow 
High School in Polk County, Florida.

Expulsion is mandatory for any student found with explosives or a bomb unless it forms part of a school activity, reports the Miami New Times.
