She's has her own clothing line, access to stylists and numerous designer contacts. But that doesn't mean Kim Kardashian always gets it right when it comes to her fashion choices.

The reality star, 34, caused a stir when she recently stripped off for Paper magazine and it seems she can also fire debate when she has her clothes on.

In a poll of women aged between 18-30, respondents were asked to identify the mother-of-one's top ten fashion fails.

Her worst outfit: Kim Kardashian was compared to Mrs Doubtfire when she wore this dress by designer Riccardo Tisci to the Met Ball in 2013 when she was pregnant with her daughter, North

Not pretty in pink: A holey Chanel outfit worn during Paris Fashion Week, left, and a latex dress worn this month came second and third in the poll

Topping the list was the floral print dress created by Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci which she wore to the Met Ball in 2013 when she was pregnant with her daughter, North.

The unflattering gown was criticised for being too gaudy and looking like a set of curtains. Some even went as far as to compare Kim to the character Mrs Doubtfire thanks to the frumpy, floral number. 

One respondent said: 'I have to say that considering Kim Kardashian probably has so many personal stylists, she never seems to get it right. That floral dress she wore to the Met Gala was absolutely awful.

'She actually looked like the sofa I have in my living room, it's exactly the same print.'

Revealing: Kim's choice of outfit for this year's VMAs. She admitted her style 'has become sexier since becoming a mum'

In second place was the unusual hole detail two-piece she wore at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.

Despite being designed by Chanel, respondents weren't convinced by the bizarre baby pink ensemble that was also seen on the catwalk modelled by Cara Delevingne.

One person said: 'When Kim wore that weird two piece with holes in it, I genuinely thought she'd lost the plot. Who cares if Chanel designed it – it was hideous.

'It just goes to show that it's all about the brand and not the clothing itself, she is definitely just a fashion follower.'

Another recent fashion faux pas was Kim's salmon pink latex bodycon dress, worn to promote her latest perfume in Australia this month.

The outfit tightly clung to her famous curves creating unflattering lines and creases and pushed her cleavage up. 

Double denim has long been a fashion no-no so Kim was slated by voters for wearing denim jeans with a matching shirt earlier this year - with this outfit coming in fourth place in the poll.

Next was another outfit Kim chose whilst surrounded by fashionistas at Paris Fashion Week.

Her choice of a white lacy maxi dress with a gold choker necklace did not make a good impression when she stepped out with her husband Kanye West.

Four of the outfits which made the top ten were worn when Kim was pregnant showing she had difficulty nailing a chic maternity style.

As well the floral gown, snakeskin peplum trousers and nude and monochrome dresses, all worn when she had a baby bump made the top ten.

A mother who took part in the poll observed: 'Kim Kardashian does look glamorous a lot of the time, but when she was pregnant she really had no idea. When I was having a baby, I just stuck to comfy clothes that were loosely fit.

'She still tried to wear skintight clothes and shoes that made her look massive and must have been so uncomfortable.'

In  seventh place was a clashing colour block purple and orange dress Kim wore back in 2011 for another perfume launch while also making the top ten was a garish print mini dress with a plunging neckline she wore to the VMAs this year.

Although the 650 voters were asked to pick Kim's worst outfits of all time, nearly half of the most unpopular choices were worn since the reality star has become a mother.

In October, she told Grazia magazine she has deliberately chosen raunchier outfits since North was born.

She said: 'My style has become sexier since becoming a mum. I'm more bold. You would think that I would tone it down and wear sweats and flats all day but I don't feel good wearing that.' 

A spokesperson for mobileslots.com, who carried out the poll said: 'Kim Kardashian is one of the powerful celebrity names in the world. With great power comes great fashion responsibility and she is guilty of letting her fans down one too many times.

'Many of her outfit choices have been questionable to say the least, sometimes simple is more effective.'
