A dog had to be rushed to vets for emergency surgery - after he almost killed himself by eating too many pairs of his owner’s silk thongs.

Kaye Banks, 47, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was horrified when her pet Brian was unable to digest his food – so she took him to a vets, who found her underwear in his stomach.

Staff at Abbey Vets in Barnsley carried out an emergency two-hour operation to save the four-year-old Samoyed’s life - and after four days, he was deemed well enough to return home.

But within hours of being back at Mrs Banks’s £250,000 four-bedroom detached home, the dog raided the washing basket and ate another pair of knickers.

Mrs Banks rushed him back to Abbey Vets, where employee Tony Duffy was able to give him medication to make him vomit, narrowly avoiding further surgery.

The mother said: ‘I’d spotted him nibbling on some of the washing and I got really worried when he wasn’t eating properly and he regurgitated his food undigested.

‘We took him to the vet and they could see a big bulge on the X-ray but they weren’t sure what it was. When they pulled out a black lacy thong everyone had a bit of a shock.

‘After a two-hour operation we finally managed to bring him home. He’s a bit cheeky and he often roots through handbags or bags of shopping and he’s occasionally chewed on the odd sock, but nothing like this. I could believe it when we’d just got him home and it happened again.

'We’d seen him go near the washing and my daughter Charlotte came in and said: “I put a pink lace thong in the washing basket earlier and now it’s gone.” So straight away we took him back to the vets to see if they could help and they managed to get it out without more surgery.

'We just couldn’t believe that after an operation and four days at the vets he comes home and does it again. It’s a warning to other pet owners to be really careful, because Brian needed major surgery and he’s lucky to come out okay. As for us, it’s underwear straight into the washing machine where he can’t get at them.’

Vet Mr Duffy said: ‘It never fails to amaze me what dogs will swallow, but swallowing three thongs in such a short space of time must beat them all.’
