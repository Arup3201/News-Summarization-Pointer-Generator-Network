Money worries, fights with friends and families that don't understand us are familiar problems, but for bubbly blonde Danielle and scouse-browed Kim these are issues that weigh heavily on their mind.

These two 20-somethings are part of a wave of young British women turning to stripping as a way to support themselves, and losing friends and family as a result.

The number of strip clubs in the UK has doubled in the last 10 years, but life on a podium isn't as glamorous as the men visiting might imagine.

Now, a new TV series aims to highlight the impact life as a lapdancer has on the relationships and self-esteem of the girls involved.

Hands off! Shelley says that men visiting the club will have her to deal with if they touch one of the girls

Glaswegian venue Diamond Dolls, the star of the first episode, is described as a 'high-end' club by the narrator, but while the girls are better looking than at some of the seedier establishments they still admit to thinking about anything else but the job their admiring male fans are paying them to do.

Kim, sporting fake Uggs, huge lashes and a WonderBra says: 'I'll be oblivious to the guy sitting there. I'll be thinking about a hundred other things, like what I'm having for dinner.

'To me it's a job. Go in there, do a dance, get the money, move on to the next customer.

Kim is one of the more experienced dancers but has decided that she wants to try and get a normal job before she gets too old

The
 Scottish ex-gymnast began exotic dancing as a last resort: 'I used to 
think I would never do something like that, but I couldn't get a job, at
 all, anywhere.

'I'm not selling my body, am I? It's just like working in Frasers selling perfume, in here you're selling a dance, that's it.'

Later,
 Kim contradicts herself as she admits she would like a normal job, and wipes away tears as she talks about a rift with her family.

Her tardiness at the club reinforces the idea that her heart isn't in it and one person who isn't happy at all about Kim's lax attitude to the job is 
Shelley, the draconian house mother who now runs the club and is 
responsible for staffing three floors of fun.

Straight-talking
 Shelley, an ex-stripper herself and the undisputed star of the Channel
 4 show, says: 'It's always the same dramas: am I making enough money? 
My boyfriend doesn't want me to do it. How do I tell my family?

'They
 are not doing anything wrong apart from being confident, independent 
young women, which is what any mother should want for their daughter.

The Diamond Dolls website is loud but discreet

Shelley
 maintains that her girls are not being exploited: 'Open your eyes. The 
only people being exploited here are the ones with the money.

'Women use their bodies everywhere to get what they want.

'They can't touch my ladies, they can only look. If they do, I'll break every finger that they touch them with.'

Kim and Shelley appear in Strippers, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4
