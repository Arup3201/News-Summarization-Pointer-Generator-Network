A court has been told that a Melbourne teenager accused of fatally stabbing a homeless man had only intended to threaten him.

Easton Woodhead may have also acted in self-defence when he stabbed homeless man Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry in a Melbourne park in the early hours of January 5, his defence lawyer said.

The incident is said to have taken place in Enterprize Park, near Flinders St station, and Mr Perry later died from his wounds in hospital.

It was Woodhead's motorbike and he understood Mr Perry knew of its whereabouts.

He said Mr Perry had received a series of threatening phone calls from someone other than Woodhead relating to the motorbike and so had taken steps to arm himself.

The fatal stabbing could have occurred in the context of confrontation that led to a 'struggle for a knife', Mr Zayler said on Tuesday.

'Mr Woodhead had no intention to harm Mr Perry, and it may have been to threaten Mr Perry,' Mr Zayler continued.

'Some witnesses see Mr Woodhead on top of Mr Perry, and it does not follow that the events that followed were not in self-defence.'

Woodhead appeared in Melbourne Magistrate's Court on Tuesday via a video link

Prosecutor Gemma Watson said phone records from Mr Perry's mobile did not show any sign of him receiving threatening calls.

Woodhead appeared in the court via a video link, and only responded with a short 'yep' when asked if he could hear proceedings.

Magistrate Peter Reardon set a committal hearing date of October 13.
