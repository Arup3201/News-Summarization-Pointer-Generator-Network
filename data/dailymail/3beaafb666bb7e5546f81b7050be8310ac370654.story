Tribute: Newcastle United fan John Hardisty, 64, created this 8ft stained glass window in his shed

While the average stained glass window might picture the Virgin Mary or Jesus, it’s important to note that ‘football is religion’ to many Geordies.

And one Newcastle United Football Club fan has taken that saying to extreme lengths by creating an astonishing 8ft stained glass window which illustrates the emotions of a die-hard supporter.

John Hardisty, 64, of Benton, Newcastle upon Tyne, got the idea to create the window in his garden shed after fans protested when the club’s stadium St James’ Park was renamed the ‘Sports Direct Arena’ last November.

Magpies fans described the 
decision to 
use owner Mike Ashley’s sports firm in the new name for the ground, 
where football has been played since 1880, as a ‘nightmare’ and 
‘abysmal’.

Mr Hardisty said: ‘I saw the reaction of fans outside St James’ Park when it was announced that it was going to be renamed. Then I saw this guy holding a protest poster, which he’d made out of felt-tip pen.

‘It said: “Football is my religion. St James’ Park is my church”. My idea came from that really. Football, especially Newcastle United, is a form of religion up here.

‘I saw some images on the internet and started to draw my own from there. It took about two months for me to draw and then create the window.’

Mr Hardisty said he put striker Papiss Demba Cissé - a £9million signing from German side Freiburg in January - ‘at the top as Jesus Christ on the cross and then the rest as the disciples’.

‘It’s all symbolic, but fun as well,’ he added.

Cissé, who has made a huge impact since joining Newcastle, is revered on Tyneside after scoring 13 goals in 14 games last season, and helping the club qualify for the Europa League.

Mr Hardisty became interested in stained glass windows when he was a child but only began making them about 15 years ago while he owned the Hardisty Cycles shop in Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne.

The football fan - who has also created a stained glass project based on the industrial revolution - sold the shop 10 years ago and went travelling to Russia where he met his future wife, Tatiana.

He added: ‘It was about eight years ago that I started making stained glass windows seriously and devoted some time to it. It is still a hobby but I do sell a few.

‘I’ve lived in the same Edwardian house for about 30 years and it’s got quite a big garden, so I built a summer house there to make the windows. I work in a big hut at the bottom of the garden.’

'I saw this guy holding a protest poster, which he’d made out of felt-tip pen. It said: “Football is my religion. St James’ Park is my church”. My idea came from that really'

John Hardisty

John owned his cycle store for more than 20 years and expanded onto the site of a 16th century property next door. There was a 1,500 sq ft room above, which he turned into an art gallery.

He added: ‘The bike shop made money, the gallery didn’t. It was always more of a hobby. So, you could say I have an artistic background.  

‘I don’t know what theme I’m going to base my windows on next. Something beginning with 'r', so maybe romance?’
