The countdown to Apple's new iPhone continued today as the boss of Sharp Corp. said it will begin shipping screens for the new gadget within weeks.

The new phone, expected to be called simply the iPhone, is widely rumoured to be unveiled on September 12th at an event in San Francisco.

The handset is then expected to go on sale in October, in time for the lucrative Christmas shopping season.

Sharp Corp's President Takashi Okuda (R) is surrounded by media as he leaves a news conference in Tokyo. He said the firm will start shipping screens for a new iPhone next month.

'Shipments will start in August,' Sharp's new president, Takashi Okuda, said at a press briefing in Tokyo on Thursday after the company released its latest quarterly earnings.

He declined to give a more specific date for shipments beyond this month.

Sharp, identified as a supplier by Apple last year, is one of three companies expected to build the screens for the latest Apple offering.

The other two suppliers of the panels are LG Display Co Ltd and Japan Display Inc.

Online rumours have claimed the iPhone screens will be thinner than their previous incarnations
with the use of so-called in-cell panels.

The new technology embeds 
touch sensors into the liquid crystal display, eliminating the 
touch-screen layer found in current iPhones.

Sources earlier told Reuters that the panels will be 4 inches corner to corner -- 30 percent bigger than current iPhones.

The news comes as Samsung and Apple on Tuesday faced off at the start of a high-stakes patent trial, where Apple has accused Samsung of stealing iPhone features like scrolling and multi-touch.
