Tasteless: Gary Lineker posted a picture of a leaf on his car and made a joke about the storm

Given the widely reported deaths and chaos, it was clearly not the right time for attempts at humour.

That, however, did not stop some of the lucky ones who escaped the storm from trying. Inevitably, their chosen method of sharing their tasteless thoughts was Twitter.

Football pundit Gary Lineker, 52, posted a picture of a leaf sitting on his car and wrote: ‘Part of a tree has hit the car roof. Not too much damage, I think.’

Sports journalist Jake Humphrey posted
a picture of himself pointing in mock-horror at a branch on the 
pavement, and wrote: ‘Stormaggedon on streets of London. Stay safe out 
there peeps.’

Musician Lily 
Allen said on Twitter she was pleased with the effect of the high winds.
She wrote: ‘Thank you Storm St Jude for finally getting rid of the 
neighbours [sic] tree that has been blocking out the light.’

Joey
Barton, footballer for Queens Park Rangers, was criticised by fans for 
saying the storm was an anti-climax.

The 31-year-old midfielder tweeted:
‘Tad disappointing, this mega death to all before it storm.’

His comments prompted anger from fans who asked whether he wished the death toll were higher.

Some
police staff also thought the moment right for ‘humorous’ tweeting.

The
safer neighbourhood team in Malvern, Worcestershire, wrote: ‘PCSO Steve
Freeman has patrolled the Pickersleigh patch and reports all bins and 
trampolines in correct gardens. What storm?’

Ann
Barnes, Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent, wrote on her personal 
Twitter account: ‘Lyminge is quiet and sunny – what storm? I seem to 
have slept through it.’

Minutes later, however, a tweet was issued from her official account urging people to ‘stay safe’.

A spokesman from her office explained the discrepancy by saying the official account is sometimes updated by other people.

On
hearing later that 17-year-old Bethany Freeman had died in the storm, 
Mrs Barnes tweeted: ‘Really sad to hear of young woman’s death in West 
Kent. Seems like Lyminge had the best of the weather today.’
