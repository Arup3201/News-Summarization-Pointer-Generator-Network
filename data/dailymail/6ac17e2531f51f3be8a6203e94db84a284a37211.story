Seat belts on aeroplanes are pointless and will not save passengers in a crash, the chief executive of Ryanair has claimed.

Michael O'Leary claims legislation forcing passengers to wear seat belts is unnecessary and wants to introduce 'standing room only' sections on flights.

'Seat belts don't matter,' O'Leary said.

Outspoken: Michael O'Leary says seatbelts on planes are 'useless' and aviation authorities are using outdated thinking

'You don't need a seatbelt on the London Underground. You don't need a seatbelt on trains which are travelling at 120mph and if they crash you're all dead,' he added.

He told the Telegraph that the argument that seatbelts can stop injuries during turbulence doesn't apply as Europe doesn't have areas of excessive turbulence.

According to the newspaper, O'Leary's remarks came as he attempts to make low-cost 'standing room only' cabins a reality. He says he is being obstructed by aviation authorities, who he branded 'plonkers'.

He has suggested removing the back ten rows of seats in aircraft, allowing groups of less discerning travellers to commute to their destination on their feet for as little as Â£1.

He added: 'The problem with aviation is that for 50 years it's been populated by people who think it's a wondrous sexual experience... when it's really just a bus with wings.'
