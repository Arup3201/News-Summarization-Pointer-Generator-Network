Right, that’s my autumn holiday to America sorted out. First, I’ll drop in on my cousin, Barack Obama, and bed down at the White House for a few days.

Then I’ll move on to Cousin Kim’s in LA — that would be Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star — and catch up with Kanye West, her rapper husband, and my other cousin, their baby daughter North West (yes, really).

And, if they insist on me playing a guest role in Kim’s show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, along with my cousins Kourtney and Khloé, it would be churlish to refuse.

Family ties: Harry Mount discovered that he, David Cameron and Kim Kardashian all have a shared ancestor in the shape of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet and MP for Glamorgan from 1670-1679 and 1681-1689

If it helps, I’m delighted to change my name to Kharry to maintain the family naming tradition.

I’m prepared to forgive them, too, for not inviting me to Kim and Kanye’s mammoth wedding spectacular last May in Florence.

After all, we’re really quite distant relatives — Kim is my 13th cousin; North my 13th cousin, once removed; and Barack, again, is my 13th cousin.

I only found out yesterday that I shared a bloodline with these famous faces, thanks to a genealogy website, Geni.com.

In return for $119.40 (£72) for a year’s membership, the website connected me up to a family tree of 5,000 blood relatives, including one David Cameron.

I did know about that one, incidentally — he’s a second cousin, slightly closer than Cousin Kim and Cousin Barack.

Famous faces: The genealogy website Geni.com, which works on crowd-sourcing, revealed that President Barack Obama is Harry's 13th cousin

Cameron, too, is a 13th cousin of Kim Kardashian, through the same link as me. We all have a shared ancestor in the shape of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet and MP for Glamorgan from 1670-1679 and 1681-1689.

Sir Edward lived in Margam Castle, a thwacking great country house overlooking Port Talbot in South Wales.

The castle and its 850-acre estate are now owned by the council — how lovely it would be if Cousins Kim and Kanye bought it back for the family.

I’d love to think I’m somehow special with all these gilded relations.

But the truth of it is that we’re all related to famous people, if you stretch the net far enough — or, in this case, the internet.

Geni.com — part of a new wave of genealogy websites, including WeRelate and WikiTree — works through a sort of crowd-sourcing, along the lines of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia written by its users.

As more and more members of the public add their own mini-family trees online, they connect them up with pre-existing family trees, until they grow together into one enormous forest.

Using these vast, spreading maps of connections, you can build up impossibly huge family trees.

One keen genealogist, a New York writer called Al Jacobs, has managed to connect himself to 78,783,197 people, including his distant cousins Daniel Radcliffe, Sir Paul McCartney, Albert Einstein, Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, and the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, aka the Milwaukee Cannibal.

Oh, and they’re all related to George Clooney, who is George  H.W. Bush’s 12th cousin, twice removed. You can also add into that family tree Neil Armstrong, Frank Sinatra and Patrick Swayze.

‘In a few years, we may have a single tree containing nearly all seven billion humans on earth,’ says Mr Jacobs (a relative of the artist Jackson Pollock and the writer Saul Bellow, too).

‘The Family Of Man will no longer be an abstract cliche. We’re all related — we just have to figure  out how.’

Next summer, Mr Jacobs — also a distant cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the musician Quincy Jones — is planning the biggest family gathering in history, the Global Family Reunion, in the New York Hall of Science, on the site of the 1939 and 1964 World’s Fairs.

In a bid to beat the current record for the biggest family gathering ever — held by the 4,512 members of the Porteau-Boileve family in France — millions of Mr Jacobs’s living relations will be invited.

Astonishing: The Queen is an 11th cousin, four times removed of socialite Paris Hilton (right), through a mutual relation, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge in the mid-19th century

Mr Dahmer, however, will not be attending, given he was beaten to death in 1994 by a fellow prisoner at Columbia Correctional Institution in Wisconsin. Ah well, there are bad apples in every family tree.

Log on to trace yours online, and astonishing links are magically, instantly made. The Queen, I learn, is an 11th cousin, four times removed, of the socialite Paris Hilton, through a mutual relation, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge in the mid-19th century.

The Queen is also a fifth cousin, twice removed, of David Cameron — and so I can stick her on my list, albeit too, through the slightly weak link of ‘cousins by marriage’.

The singer Prince, once known as The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, is a 20th cousin, three times removed, of Nick Clegg, once known as The Politician Formerly Known As An Impressive Prospect. Prince and Clegg are connected through shared blood with John of Gaunt, Edward III’s son and a great powerbroker in 14th-century England.

The higher you go in society, the greater the connections between the great and the good.

Cousin Al: Comedian Al Murray is just one of Harry Mount's 5,000 blood relatives as listed by the genealogy website that he subscribed to

And not just in Britain — all the American presidents, except for the 19th-century president Martin Van Buren, are distantly related to each other. 

Spend enough time on your computer, and genealogy becomes curiously addictive.

And it’s not just me: ancestry websites are the second most popular sites on the internet after pornography. (I suppose they’re related pursuits — after all, they’re both dependent on sex.)

As I followed the higgledy-piggledy lines on my family tree, more and more curious names popped out from behind the thicket of interconnected branches. I — and Cousins Kim, Barack and Dave — are all relatives of William Makepeace Thackeray, the great Victorian novelist, author of Vanity Fair.

My four-times great-grandfather, John Talbot Shakespear, a senior civil servant with the East India Company, was Thackeray’s uncle.

Oh, and while we’re hovering in that particular corner of the family tree, it turns out that Thackeray was the three-times great-grandfather of the comedian Al Murray, aka the Pub Landlord, and now aka Cousin Al — to me and my 5,000 other blood relatives listed on the website.

Of course, as with all crowd-sourcing websites, there’s tremendous room for error. Geni.com has 120 volunteer curators and eight million users, all constantly merging their family trees and making them bigger and bigger.

That said, I couldn’t see a single mistake in my own. All you have to do is add details of your own immediate family — and you can be pretty sure of the accuracy of that — until you find a relative who appears to belong to someone else’s family tree, too.

The website — which holds details of millions of people’s names, lifespans and relationships — will flag up likely ‘matches’, which the user can verify simply by checking if the relative’s details appear to tally. As more matches are made, a reliable guide to your wider ancestry begins to take shape.

And these online family trees stretch right back to time immemorial. Using mine, I could trace my ancestors — and relations of Cousins Dave, Kim and Barack — all the way back to 1175,  when my who-knows-how-many-times great-grandfather, Richard Talbot, died.

Still, the 12th century is nothing in the internet’s genealogy fraternity. Al Jacobs tracked down his 97th great-grandfather, King David, who ruled Israel and Judah in 1,000 BC.

Admittedly, that sounds pretty dodgy but, then again, if you go that far back, the chances are that millions of us around on earth today are related to King David.

If all of those generations, down to the present day, had just two children, that would leave King David with 1,267,650,600,228,229, 401,496,703,205,376 descendants.

Of course, if you do go that far back, you can hardly claim to share much blood with your famous ancestor. But, still — as I’ll tell Cousin Kim, when I rock up on her doorstep this autumn — family’s family, isn’t it?
