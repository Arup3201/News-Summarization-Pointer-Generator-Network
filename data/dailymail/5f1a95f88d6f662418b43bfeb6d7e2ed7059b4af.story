A greedy bee who flew headfirst into a flower looks like he could be a robot in disguise - after pulling off a near-perfect impression of his namesake from the multi-billion dollar Transformers franchise.

The podgy bee was caught on camera looking just like the robot Bumblebee from the Hollywood series - as he raises his front legs in a bid to stand up, covered in bright yellow pollen.

Amateur photographer Kutub Uddin, 27, captured the moment on camera in Hotham Park, Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

Mr Uddin, who works as a chef, had been trying to capture a perfect close-up shot of a bumblebee and, after being stung by wasps several times, finally managed to capture this moment.

He said: 'This was a particularly big bee, and he'd been drinking a lot of pollen.

'He was covered in it so much that he was struggling to fly away, so I moved in to take a picture.

'He obviously wasn't happy about me getting too close though, so raised up on his back legs to try to protect his pollen.

'I knew that was the moment I needed to capture.

The bee was particularly large and reared up to protect its pollen when Mr Uddin edged too close

'I love taking close shots of bees and wasps by going very close to them slowly. This takes a lot of patience as a decent shot can take up to several hours.

'I enjoy insects and animals so I wasn't scared to go up close to them, however a couple of time I did get bitten by wasps which wasn't very pleasant.

'It was worth it to get a shot like this though.'
