Just this morning, the Queen attended the Opening of Parliament dressed in her full State finery.

The Imperial State Crown was perched on her perfect candyfloss curls and her diminutive figure was shrouded in the impressive 18ft fur-trimmed Robe Of State.

Hours later though, the monarch cut a very different figure as she hunkered down under a headscarf (Hermes, naturally) and navy raincoat against the grim British weather.

At times, as the rain drizzled down and the corners of her headscarf blew about in the breeze, the monarch's mouth was set in a grim line.

But appearances can be deceiving and the Queen, attending the first day of the Windsor Horse Show, would likely have been in her element.

What a difference! Left, the Queen this afternoon at the Windsor Horse Show, and right, wearing the George IV State Diadem, her Angela Kelly crystal-studded dress and and an ermine stole at Parliament today

Quick change: Left, the Queen in wool skirt and warm outerwear in the grounds of Windsor castle and right, hours earlier in her silk Angela Kelly dress, carrying a bespoke Launer handbag wearing Queen Victoria's diamonds and pearls

In her element: Despite the odd grimace, the Queen looked overjoyed to be at the horse show, where she would have been able to watch jump competitions and inspect thoroughbreds

The Horse Show, held in the grounds of Windsor Castle, is known to be one of the monarch's favourite events of the spring/summer calender.

An occasion for serious equestrians, the Queen would have today taken in a jumping competition and a display of part bred and Arab horses among other events.

Quite the departure from the pomp and ceremony from earlier in the day where with a 15 minute speech the Queen unveiled 20 new Bills the coalition will pass into law over the coming year.

With that out of the way - and the 2.3lb weight of the crown jewels and 15lb state robe changed for her 'civvies' - the Queen must have felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders - literally.

Her crystal-encrusted white silk gown - the same one she wore for her Jubilee portrait last summer - had been hung safely away. Instead, the Queen wore a sensible blue wool skirt along with her navy coat.

One is not (very) amused: The queen stifles a laugh as her companion makes a joke

Looks like rain... The afternoon proved to be mixed, with grey clouds and drizzle taking place of the bright sunshine of earlier in the week

It was announced this week that the Queen would be scaling back her public duties - primarily cutting back on longhaul flights - a forthcoming Royal engagement in Sri Lanka will be carried out by Prince Charles instead of the Queen.

Indeed, Charles attended the State Opening for the first time in 17 years, and was accompanied for the first time by Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall in a clear sign that the heir to the throne is stepping up his royal duties.

But today, at the ripe old age of 87, the Queen proved she still has more than enough energy to put on an impeccable show - both with the pomp and ceremony of the State occasion, and getting stuck in among the crowds in the field.

No prizes for guessing which event she enjoyed the most.

EARLIER THAT DAY...

The Queen attended the State Opening of Parliament wearing the Robe of the State, the Imperial Crown, a white dress and gloves, and Queen Victoria's pearl earrings and Jubilee necklace

It has been announce that Prince Charles - attending the ceremony for the first time in 17 years, and for the first time with his wife Camilla Duchess of Cornwall - will take on a bigger role as 'co-head' of the Royal family

Queen Elizabeth wore pearl drop earrings that were given to Queen Victoria by her husband Prince Albert

The necklace worn by the Queen was gifted to Queen Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee
