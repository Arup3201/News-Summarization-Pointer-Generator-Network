Having threatened to bomb the United States and warned foreigners to leave South Korea due to an impending thermonuclear war, North Korea returned to domestic matters today by holding its annual marathon in Pyongyang.

The North’s state news agency said a big contingent of foreign runners were expected from countries including Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ethiopia as well as 600 North Koreans at today's race.

The marathon celebrates tomorrow's 101st anniversary of the birthday of the country’s founder Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong Un.

'I think enthusiasm for the upcoming tournament is running high among local marathoners and their coaches as never before,' Ham Chang-hyok of the Sports Ministry told the KCNA state agency this week.

This is the 26th time the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, named after a hill revered for its association with the country’s founding hero, Kim Il Sung, has been held.

It is not known if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whose portly frame would appear to suggest he is not a keen runner, would attend the event.

Kim is noted for his love of basketball and recently hosted former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman in the capital, Pyongyang.

The anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, is also usually marked which a big military parade.

The United States and Japan have offered new talks with North Korea to resolve the increasingly dangerous stand-off over its nuclear and missile programmes, but said the reclusive communist government first must lower tensions and honour previous agreements.

North Korea has a clear course of action available to it, and will find 'ready partners' in the United States if it follows through, Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters.

Japan's foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who appeared with Mr Kerry at a news conference, was more explicit, saying that North Korea must honour its commitment to earlier deals regarding its nuclear and missile programmes and on returning kidnapped foreigners.

The officials agreed on the need to work toward a nuclear-free North Korea and opened the door to direct talks if certain conditions are met.

Their comments highlight the difficulty in resolving the North Korean nuclear situation in a peaceful manner, as pledged by Mr Kerry and Chinese leaders in Beijing yesterday.

Gaining China's commitment, Mr Kerry insisted, was no small matter given Beijing's historically strong military and economic ties to North Korea.

The race went ahead despite international tensions between North Korea and the South

The issue has taken on fresh urgency in recent months, given North Korea's tests of a nuclear device and intercontinental ballistic missile technology, and its increasingly brazen threats of nuclear strikes against the United States.

US and South Korean officials believe the North may deliver another provocation in the coming days with a mid-range missile test.

Mr Kerry said the US would defend both its allies at all cost. His visit to Japan followed two days of meetings in South Korea and China.
