Three experimental treatments will be used on Ebola patients in West Africa from next month as health workers attempt to bring the viral outbreak under control.

At one site in Guinea victims will be given blood transfusions from recovered patients, while at two different locations medics will begin using new antiviral drugs.

All three treatments have been fast-tracked into use without the usual lengthy trials on animals and healthy people, but doctors believe it is the only way of stopping the infection spreading further.

Blood plasma therapy, in which the blood of an Ebola survivor is pumped into a sufferer to boost their immune system, has been used before but the precise effects have not been studied.

Doctor Craig Spencer, who caught the virus in Guinea  before carrying it back to New York, was given blood from nurse Nancy Writebol while in isolation at a hospital in the city.

Spanish nurse Teresa Romero was also given a blood transfusion after she caught the virus treating two missionaries.

Both patients have recovered and been released from hospital after testing negative for Ebola.

Doctors from the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine will begin the first widespread trial of blood plasma therapy at an Ebola centre in Conakry, Guinea, next month.

The first antiviral drug, known as brincidofovir, is being tested by Oxford University at a separate site in Liberia, though researchers have not revealed exactly where.

The drug comes in tablet form and needs to be taken twice a week for two weeks. The drug works by interfering with the way the virus multiplies within healthy human cells.

It will be given to 140 patients, with their consent, and doctors will compare their survival rates against those who were not treated.

Peter Horby, who is overseeing the trial of the drug, said: 'If we're going to find a treatment, we have to do it now - which is why we have to accelerate these trials.'

A second antiviral, favipiravir, will be administered at a third site in Guinea. Mrs Romero was also thought to have been given this drug before recovering from Ebola, but authorities would not confirm its use.

Transfusions involve pumping blood from a recovered Ebola patient into a sick person. The treatment has been used before, such as on New York doctor Craig Spencer (pictured) but has not been widely tested

While there is evidence that blood transfusions are effective, their use is highly controversial among native West Africans, many of whom hold to spiritual beliefs

While it is hoped that the new treatments will help to stop the largest and deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history, their success is far from certain.

The antiviral drugs are largely untested on humans, so it is not known exactly what effect they will have on the virus.

While there is some anecdotal evidence that blood transfusions can help patients recover, their use is highly controversial among the native West African people.

Identifying people who have recovered from the disease, taking their blood, transporting it to the patient and then administering it in countries whose healthcare systems have been wiped out also poses huge challenges.

The worst outbreak of the virus on record has claimed at least 5,160 lives in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea so far.

Cases of the disease have also been reported in Nigeria, where eight people have died, and Mali, where four have been killed.

Officials in Mali believed they had eradicated the disease after quarantining everyone who had come into contact with a two-year-old girl who arrived from Guinea carrying the disease.

However a second infected man arrived and passed the disease to a nurse, who died on Tuesday, prompting 90 more people to be placed in isolation.

The country's president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, says he has no plans to close the border with Guinea for the moment, but has called on the World Health Organisation to step up their response to the crisis.
