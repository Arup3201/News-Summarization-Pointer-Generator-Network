Bank customers will soon be able to pay a cheque into an account by taking a picture of it on their mobile phone

Bank customers will soon be allowed to pay a cheque into their account without having to visit a branch – by taking a picture of it with their mobile.

A change in the law means customers will be able to email a picture of the cheque to their bank along with their account number and have the funds transferred without having to queue in their local branch.

The system means cheques can be paid in 
to accounts at any time of the day or night and, most importantly, the 
funds are instantly available.

Banks claim the service will make life easier for customers. More than 23million people receive cheques for their birthday every year, while 60 per cent of charity donations are made by cheque, as is one in four payments to small businesses.

The Government is expected to support the change, and an announcement from Chancellor George Osborne could come as soon as Monday.

The banks are keen on the system as it will cut costs.

Barclays has been running a trial using its banking app on iPhones, while the system has been running in the US for five years.

A Barclays spokesman said: ‘The current cheque legislation dates from 1882, which is the year Charles Darwin died, and is clearly not fit for the digital age.’

Overseas financial institutions have been
 using smartphone cheque deposit systems since 2009, including Bank of 
America, Chase, Citigroup, ING, Paypal in the USA, Banco Sabadell in 
Spain and ING Direct in Canada.

The firm behind the technology, 
Intelligent Environments, says its research found three in four Britons 
would like the option of using the ‘photocheque’ system.

The company claims the regime is a natural extension of the fact that an increasing number of people are using laptops, tablets and smartphones for their banking.

Banks claim the service will make life easier for customers and will 
also help cut costs. They say the current system for banking cheques is 
outdated

Managing director at Intelligent Environments, David Webber, said: ‘It is nonsense that British consumers aren’t allowed to snap a photo of their cheques and instantly deposit them using a smartphone.

‘In this connected age with almost two-thirds of the population using smartphones, mobile cheque deposits could save the UK millions of wasted hours and thousands of pounds on stamps.

‘The major banks are on a drive to introduce technology to make their customers lives as easy as possible and I’m sure they would introduce this tomorrow, if the Treasury let them.

‘It’s madness that Britain is still lagging behind due to out of touch regulation.’

In the US, a new Federal law known as Check 21, was passed to allow digital images of cheques to be accepted by the banks. A similar law would be required in this country.

Earlier this year, the nation’s biggest banks signed up to the new ‘Paym’ system, which allows payments to be made to individuals and businesses based on their mobile phone number rather than account details.

Users simply tap in the number of the person to receive the money to authorise an electronic transfer from one account to another.

The idea is that millions of people will have their mobile phone number tied to their bank account – as a substitute for the normal account number and sort code.

Access to the Paym system will be covered by password or code protection in an attempt to avoid the risk of the phone being stolen and used to raid customers’ accounts.
