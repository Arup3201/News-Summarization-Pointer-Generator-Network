A filthy kebab, pizza and burger takeaway was yesterday closed by a judge for serving food that was ‘unfit for human consumption’ after inspectors found mouldy onion bhajis and foul-smelling meat.

The Nile, in Bolton, Greater Manchester, failed to comply with hygiene standards for years and faced complaints of an unclean floor, damaged shelves in a fridge and a freezer that did not shut properly.

Partners in the business Abid Patel, 28, Sajid Patel, 20, and Tahir Patel, 30, who had earlier admitted a series of hygiene failures, were fined at Bolton Crown Court and ordered to do unpaid work.

Disgusting: The Nile, in Bolton, Greater Manchester, failed to comply with hygiene standards for years and faced complaints of an unclean floor, damaged shelves in a fridge and a freezer that did not shut properly

Filthy: Judge Timothy Clayson made a prohibition order preventing The Nile, located on Bradshawgate in the city, from being used for any food businesses after a 'long history of non-compliance'

Dirty: A hygiene noticed was issued in December 2010, because an oven needed to be cleaned thoroughly and repairs were needed. But the work had not been carried out a month later

Judge Timothy Clayson made a prohibition order preventing The Nile, located on Bradshawgate in the city centre, from being used for any food businesses after a ‘long history of non-compliance’.

Environmental health staff repeatedly visited the takeaway, giving advice and issuing improvement notices. Hygiene notices were first issued by Bolton Council in December 2010, prosecutors said.

After further visits, conditions had improved but the men were still not complying with food safety management systems and hazard analysis had not been carried out.

Defence: Phillip Parry, defending Abid Patel, the licence holder, said the offence was down to his inexperience

Nile notice: Partners in the business Abid Patel, 28, Sajid Patel, 20, and Tahir Patel, 30, who had earlier admitted a series of hygiene failures, were fined at Bolton Crown Court and ordered to do unpaid work

Abid Patel was sentenced to 150 hours 
of unpaid work after admitting six counts of failing to comply with 
hygiene improvement notices and three counts of having food that was 
unfit for human consumption. He was ordered to pay £1,250 court costs.

Sajid Patel will complete 150 hours of
unpaid work after he pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to comply 
with hygiene improvement notices and three counts of having food that 
was unfit for human consumption. He was ordered to pay £1,250 court 
costs.

Tahir Patel admitted three counts of 
having food that was unfit for human consumption. He will carry out 120 
hours of unpaid work and pay £1,000 costs.

A mouldy onion bhaji was bagged up by council staff on a later visit - but removed when they turned their backs.

Other mouldy bhajis and the cooked meat, which is believed to have been sold to a customer, were found in October last year.

Phillip Parry, defending Abid Patel, the business' licence holder, said the offence was down to his inexperience. He was now working at another family-run takeaway in Chorley, Lancashire.

William Donnelly, defending Sajid Patel, said his role in the business was more ‘ministerial than managerial’.

Peter Cunliffe, for Tahir Patel, said he worked there to support his wife and two children.

Judge Clayson said: ‘Really no efforts had been made to bring it up to standard.’

A Bolton Council spokesman said: ‘The order remains in place until the council issues a certificate to the effect that they are satisfied that the food business operator has taken sufficient measures to remove the health risk conditions.’
