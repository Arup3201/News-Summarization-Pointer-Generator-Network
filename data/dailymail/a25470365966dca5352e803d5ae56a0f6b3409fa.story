Apple took a gamble with the launch of its larger iPhones last week - and it appears to have paid off.

The tech firm has reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the weekend - a three-day record for a new model. 

This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C.

Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) has reported that the tech giant sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the weekend - a three-day record for a new model. The two models went on sale in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK on Friday

The two new models went on sale in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK on Friday. 

They will launch in 20 more countries this coming Friday, and worldwide by the end of the year. 

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display.

Both models also include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency. 

They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay. 

Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments.

In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB. 

A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK.

The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB. 

Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK.  

'Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch weekend, and we couldn't be happier,' said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive in an official statement. 

'We would like to thank all of our customers for making this our best launch ever, shattering all previous sell-through records by a large margin. 

'While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible.'

The iPhone 6 Plus, in particular, was so popular, it sold out in many regions before lunchtime on Friday.  

The devices were unveiled on 9 September at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino last night.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display. 

They are both larger than the 4-inch iPhone 5S, and put the handsets in the same league as the HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy S5.

Both models also include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency. 

They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay.

Last week, Apple also released its latest iOS 8 software, which is pre-installed on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and is also available for older handsets.

Figures from Virgin Media claim that during rush hour on the London Underground today, 33 per cent of Apple devices connected to the firm's Wi-Fi network were using iOS8.

This was up from 13 per cent of all Apple devices on the network, running on iOS 8 on Thursday morning - the day after the software launched.
