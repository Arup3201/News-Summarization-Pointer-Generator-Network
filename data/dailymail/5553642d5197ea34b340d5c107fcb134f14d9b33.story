Paul Lambert has urged Fabian Delph to provide a huge boost to beleaguered Aston Villa by signing a new deal and becoming the club’s Steven Gerrard.

Delph is out of contract in the summer and could leave Villa Park on a free, with Liverpool said to be interested in replacing outgoing Gerrard with the 25-year-old.

The possibility of seeing Delph stay had seemed remote, as he looks to explore his options, but Lambert struck a more confident tone than in previous weeks. When asked if Villa could realistically keep Delph, the Villa manager said: ‘Yes. With Fabian it will not be about money. He’s not a money-orientated guy. He just wants to play football.

'It would be a major boost if we can get him to stay. It would send out a great message. Him turning around and staying would be a massive statement.

'We’re still talking to Fabian. Hopefully we can get something done. The contract would happen if your club is flying and doing well. When you’re out of contract you have the obligation to see it through and then move.’ 

Delph is back after a three-match suspension to face Liverpool and Gerrard, the player he has taken over from in England’s midfield. 

‘Fabian is ready, he’s energetic. He’ll be a major boost,’ said Lambert. 'If he keeps progressing and doing what he’s doing he’s in for a big career.

'Steven Gerrard leaving Liverpool is going to be a really hard player to replace. How do you replace that? He’ll be a massive loss on the pitch. Maybe off it will be even harder.’
