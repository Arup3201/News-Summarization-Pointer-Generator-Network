The shocking variation in cancer incidence and mortality rates across the country has been revealed by a leading charity.

Cancer Research UK has unveiled a new search engine that enables a person look look up cancer statistics according to postcode, healthcare area or local authority.

The findings highlight the discrepancy between those living in the North and the South - with London coming out on top in the country and Liverpool performing the worst.

Salubrious London boroughs including Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster are the least likely to contract or die from cancer in the country, whereas cities in the North such as Liverpool and Manchester show the highest prevalence – and death rate – of the disease, according to a report by The Independent.

Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis and patient engagement at Cancer Research told the newspaper: ‘There has been plenty in the news over the years about north-south divide and a lot of factors will play into that.

Incidence of cancer is very often a reflection of lifestyle in an area - levels of deprivation and high smoking rates, for example

'Incidences are very often a reflection of lives that have been led: deprivation, high smoking rates, high alcohol rates, low exercise – all the things that we know contribute to increased cancer risk.

‘If you get well-established communities that are either incredibly well-off or deprived, the chances are you are going to get higher cancer incidences in the more deprived areas, and [the] converse.’

According to the latest data, 295.9 people out of 100,000 develop cancer in Kensington and Chelsea.

That figure is well down on the national average of 398.1 per 100,000, but even further below the highest incidence rate of 498.4 out of 100,000 at the Liverpool Primary Care Trust.

Cancer mortality rates show a similar trend.

The lowest rate of 123.9 deaths per 100,000 was recorded by the Kensington and Chelsea PCT, with Liverpool PCT registering the highest number of deaths in the country at 239.9.

Ms Hiom added that the data would raise awareness about regional cancer rates and the need for more initiatives at a time when services like smoking cessation could be under threat from the huge reorganisation of the NHS.

Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central and Shadow Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, added: 'Cancer Research UK’s Local Cancer Statistics website is a great source of information for MPs, their staff and everybody else who is interested in information about cancer like waiting times and smoking rates locally.'
