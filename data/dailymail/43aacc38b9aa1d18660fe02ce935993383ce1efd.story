Supporters of the Islamic extremist group ransacking Iraq were seen mocking the White House's hashtag diplomacy with #bringbackourhumvee tweets early this morning.

Middle East and North America photo manager for the Agence France-Presse Patrick Baz said in a tweet that he had seen the #bringbackourhumvee meme on websites and twitter accounts supporting terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The hashtag is a play on the #bringbackourgirls campaign to rescue the 276 Nigerian girls being held captive in Nigeria by Islamic militant group Boko Haram.

Supporters of the radical Islamic group overtaking Iraq are trolling the White House with #bringbackourhumvee tweets

First Lady Michelle Obama did not start the #bringbackourgirls campaign but she became the face of the initiative after she tweeted this photo last month

First lady Michelle Obama did not start the Bring back Our Girls initiative, but she became the face of the crusade after she tweeted a photo of herself holding up a sign that said #bringbackourgirls and used her husband's weekly address to make case for military intervention by the Nigerian army.

The Nigerian girls never were rescued despite high profile displays of support for military intervention from the first lady and celebrities like Amy Poehler.

Tweets trolling the White House with #bringbackourhumvee refer to a truck of American-made humvees ISIS reportedly confiscated last week in Iraq.

ISIS happened upon the humvees as well as bulldozers, tanks, helicopters and weapons that were left behind by the Iraqi troops when they retreated from their posts as insurgents took the city of Mosul.

The International Business Times reported last Thursday that the terrorist group had transported the humvees and other materials it had captured to Syria, where it is also at war with that country's government.

Photos of the humvees being captured that were posted to twitter could not be verified but the pictures are consistent with reports coming out of the region.

The first lady has become increasingly involved in policy making decisions at the White House. Today she advocated for comprehensive immigration reform at a special naturalization ceremony at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

At the time of the seizure, the U.S. had made no moves to prevent the terrorist group from taking any more ground, and the president had made it clear that he would not send U.S. forces in to defend the Iraqis.

Since then the president has sent the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier with its usual battleship escort, USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters, as well as 275 armed military personal into Bagdhad to protect State Department personnel and American assets as they are moved to safer locations.

The U.S. has not engaged the opposition militarily, and the president is still mulling whether he wants to order air strikes on their strongholds. This afternoon the president sent in armed F-18 fighter jets to do surveillance.

Meanwhile, the battle between the Iraqi army and ISIS blazed on as the terrorist group attacked the country's largest oil refinery on Tuesday night, setting it aflame.

As of Wednesday afternoon they had reached the town of Baquba, less than 40 miles north of Iraq's capitol city, Baghdad.
