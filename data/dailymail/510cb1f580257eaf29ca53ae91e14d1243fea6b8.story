It could nearly pass as a plotline from one of her spine-chilling books.

Bestselling crime writer Val McDermid found herself the subject of an 18-year grudge which resulted in her being attacked at a book signing.

Her woman assailant disguised herself before covering the author’s face with ink, shouting obscenities at her and bizarrely likening her to Jimmy Savile.

Sandra Botham told a court she attacked The Wire In The Blood author because of a book she wrote in 1995.

A Suitable Job For A Woman explores the lives of real-life female private eyes in the US and the UK, which Botham, 64, said was critical of herself and her family.

Sunderland magistrates’ court heard how Botham thought one of the case histories, which mentioned a woman called Sandra who was shaped ‘like a Michelin Man’, was referring to her.

The claim has been denied by the author’s agent, who says the two women never even met before the incident.

However, it is not known whether the case history does in fact refer to Botham, because it was related second-hand by a private eye. Bent on revenge,  Botham travelled to Sunderland University on December 6 last year, where she knew Miss McDermid would be signing books.

She disguised herself in a blonde wig, trilby hat and glasses and sat at the end of the front row as the author gave a talk about her latest novel, Vanishing Point.

Miss McDermid, 58, told the court: ‘I had noticed a woman sitting on the end of one row. She caught my eye a few times during the lecture because she appeared to be in disguise.

‘After the lecture, I was giving a book signing and noticed she was at the end of the queue.

‘When she got to the front, she produced a dog-eared copy of A Suitable Job For A Woman.’

Botham then asked her to dedicate it to ‘Michelin Man San’ – which she did, even though she had no idea what it was in reference to.

She also asked her to sign a page of an old Top of the Pops annual with a picture of Jimmy Savile on it.

She said: ‘She was quite insistent. I wasn’t keen, but I get asked to sign all sorts of things so thought it would be easier just to do it.’

It was then that Botham pulled a container of ink from her pocket, throwing it across the author and ruining her clothes.

Miss McDermid added: ‘She then said to me something like “you are my female equivalent of Jimmy Savile” before walking out the building.’

Cross-examining the author, Botham, who was representing herself, stood up and said: ‘Hello Val, we meet again.’

Botham told the magistrates’ bench to ‘get stuffed’ when they refused to allow her to read paragraphs from the book.

She then told magistrates she was ‘closing the case’ and instead would take it ‘to the highest court in the land’.

The pensioner, of Hendon, Sunderland, stormed out of the courtroom and was convicted in her absence of common assault.

Miss McDermid said never in her 25 years as an author had she experienced ‘anything like this before’.

Her 1997 bestseller The Wire In The Blood was turned into an ITV series in 2002 starring Robson Green.

Last year, she told how she met Jimmy Savile in 1977 when she was a young journalist and he later inspired another character in the book, Jacko Vance, a TV celebrity with a secret lust for torture, murder and under-age girls.
