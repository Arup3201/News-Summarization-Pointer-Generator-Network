The two women in Nelson Mandela’s life sat three seats apart at his memorial yesterday.

Widow Graca Machel exchanged only a few words with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the woman she replaced.

Winnie, 77, bent down to kiss 68-year-old Graca on the lips before taking her seat at the service, held in a football stadium.

The two women, both wearing black 
jackets, dresses and turbans, held on to each other for a few moments, 
but while Winnie was smiling, Graca simply stared ahead, her face drawn.

Both
 women are hugely respected by many in South Africa and were loudly 
cheered by the crowd in the stadium. Winnie is admired for her role in 
the struggle against apartheid; Graca for the selfless grace with which 
she looked after Mr Mandela in his old age having married him in 1998.

 Winnie has also attracted a great deal of criticism, not least in 1986 
for endorsing the violent practice of ‘necklacing’ – burning opponents 
alive using tyres and petrol.

In
 1988 she was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault 
in connection with the death of a 14-year-old boy who was accused of 
being an informer, but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine 
on appeal.

Winnie has also 
maintained a tenacious grip on the Mandela legend. Although married to 
him for 38 years, 27 of those were while he was imprisoned on Robben 
Island.

Graca Machel married Mandela (pictured together in 2002) on his 80th birthday and is commended for nursing him through years of ill health

Their divorce was 
finalised six years after he walked free, but Winnie fought the divorce 
in court and still uses the Mandela name, having added it to her maiden 
name. Winnie, who was Mr Mandela’s second wife, visited him occasionally
 during the 181 days he was ill before his death.

Graca,
 the widow of former Mozambican president Samora Machel, spent every day
 by his bedside. But it emerged yesterday that Winnie made sure she was 
by her former husband’s bedside in his final hours.

A
 close family friend has told how, when he heard that Mr Mandela was 
dying, he arrived to see both women standing over his bed.

Holomisa said he could feel the ‘tension’, but it was not clear if he 
meant tension between the two women or just their shared concern for Mr 
Mandela.

‘They said on the 
phone that Madiba doesn’t look good,’ Mr Holomisa said. ‘I immediately 
drove straight to his home and went to his bedroom.

‘Winnie and Graca were at the bedside of Madiba. You could see the tension.’

Ever
 since Mr Mandela’s death last Thursday, Winnie has been by far the more
 visible of the two women. She grabbed the limelight last Sunday at a 
church service held on South Africa’s national day of mourning, sitting 
in prime position next to South Africa’s president Jacob Zuma.

She
 expressed little emotion during the service, but showed a flash of 
anger when the pastor Mosa Sono mistakenly called her Graca.

For her part, Graca has decided to mourn her husband’s death in private at the nearby family home.

Previously, Winnie insisted they have a close bond.

She said: 'I call her little sister and she 
calls me big sister, we share everything.

'When she talks 
to me, she talks about "our husband".

'We are an extended family, we are both in the same situation emotionally.'
