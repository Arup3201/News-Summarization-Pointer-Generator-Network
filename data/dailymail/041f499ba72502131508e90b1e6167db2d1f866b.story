The father of hostage survivor Harriette Denny has told of the moment he saw his daughter running out of the Sydney cafe where she had been held for 17 hours by self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis.

Robert Denny was watching the siege unfold on television on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and was relieved to see Ms Denny escape before police stormed the Lindt Cafe at Sydney's Martin Place early on Tuesday morning.

Mr Denny told 9News at first he was not sure if he had seen her in the group of hostages bolting from the scene.

'I wanted to see the image again to make sure it was her,' a relieved Mr Denny said of watching his daughter running to safety form the Lindt building

'When I saw her running I wanted to see the image again to make sure it was her, but that image wasn't shown again because the next thing that happened was the shooting,' he said.

'There was so much going on that I wanted to confirm it was her escaping. It was her. So that’s good.'

Mr Denny said he had spoken to his daughter who he hoped was sleeping now, but had not discussed any details with her about what went on inside the cafe.

He said she was glad to be out but was still trying to come to terms with the death of friend and colleague Tori Johnson.

'She'll be fine:' Robert Denny has described his daughter Harriette as an 'outward going girl, a people person'

Mr Johnson, who was the manager at Lindt Cafe, was killed during the raid while he tried to disarm the hostage-taker, and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson died after she was taken to hospital.

'Very sad to learn that one of my daughter’s workmates was killed... very sad,' Mr Denny said.

'[Harriette is] an outward going girl, a people person, a good organiser, she's great dealing with people. They love her in the coffee shops and restaurants where she's worked.

'She'd be handling it okay. She'd be very distressed about the death of her friend. 

'She'll be fine, she's a strong girl.'

His comments come after Ms Denny's friends also posted on her Facebook expressing their joy that she was safe.

'So overwhelmed with happiness to see you safe and well Harri our thoughts and prayers were with you we wish you well for the coming days love always.' one friend wrote.

Another person wrote: 'So glad you are safe beautiful. Hope you are holding up okay. Be kind to yourself. Thinking of you.'

Ms Denny's friends also posted on her Facebook page expressing their joy that she was safe

Mr Denny said his daughter was resting in hospital and was 'very distressed' over Tori Johnson's death

Panicked friends posted prayers and words of encouragement to Harriet via Facebook during the 17 hours she was trapped in the Lindt shop with the gunman and other hostages

During the siege, one friend wrote: 'Tried to call you hoping that you weren't at work. Looks like you are.

'I'm thinking of you constantly. I know you're a strong lady and you'll be ok, can't wait to see you and give you a squeeze. Love you. x.'

While another friend wrote: 'Hope you are okay darling! Thinking of you and praying for you xx.'
